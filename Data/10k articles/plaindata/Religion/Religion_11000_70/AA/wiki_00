{"id": "351214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351214", "title": "Aga Khan", "text": "Aga Khan\n\nAga Khan (, ; also transliterated as \"Aqa Khan\" and \"Agha Khan\")\nis a title held by the Imām of the Nizari Ismāʿīli Shias. , the holder of the title has been the 49th Imām, Prince Shah Karim al-Husseini, Aga Khan IV (b. 1936).\n\nThe title is made up of the titles \"agha\" and \"khan\". The Turkish \"agha\" is \"aqa\" (Āqā) in Persian. The word \"agha\" comes from the Old Turkic and Mongolian \"aqa\", meaning \"elder brother\", and \"khan\" means king, ruler in Turkic and Mongolian languages.\n\nAccording to Farhad Daftary, a scholar of the Ismaili movement, \"Aga Khan\" is an honorific title bestowed on Hasan Ali Shah (1800–1881), the 46th Imām of Nizari Ismailis (1817–1881), by Persian king Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. However, Daftary apparently contradicts what the Aga Khan III noted in a famous legal proceeding in India: that \"Aga Khan\" is not a title but instead an alias that was given to the Aga Khan I when he was a young man.\n\nDuring the latter stages of the First Anglo-Afghan War (1841–1842), Hasan Ali Shah and his cavalry officers provided assistance to General Nott in Kandahar Province and to General England in his advance from Sindh to join Nott. For these and for other diligent efforts made by him in the service of the Empire, the British Raj recognised him as a \"prince\". This title was less extraordinary in that time and place than it seems today, because the British, while consolidating their hold on India, had been doling out similar titles liberally to any large landowner or tribal chieftain with local influence who made himself useful to them. \n\nYet, the Agha Khan was exceptional in that, while it was local tribal influence which had enabled him to serve the British and gain their favor, his claim to nobility was based upon his claim to leadership of an entire sect of Islam. This claim was dubious at best, but imperial Britain saw great possibilities in having under their control and patronage the head of a major Shia sect; it could even be used at some later stage to counterbalance the influence of the Ottoman Caliph, head of Islam as recognized by the Sunni sects. In pursuance of this grander narrative, and recognizing that his pretensions and Anglophilia were alike repugnant to the tribes then under his influence, he was awarded the status of \"Prince\" by the British government's representatives in India and became the only religious or community leader in British India granted a personal gun salute.\n\nWhen Hasan Ali Shah, the first Aga Khan, came to Sindh (which is now in Pakistan) from Afghanistan, he and his army were welcomed by Mir Nasir Khan of Baluchistan. In 1866, the Aga Khan won a court victory in the High Court of Bombay in what popularly became known as the Aga Khan Case, securing his recognition by the British government as the head of the Khoja community. The Aga Khan is also the Pir within the Nizari Ismaili community.\n\nIn 1887, the Secretary of State for India, acting through the Viceroy of India, formally recognized the title \"Aga Khan\".\n\nFour Ismāʿīli imāms have held this title:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5620515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5620515", "title": "Anti-Indian sentiment", "text": "Anti-Indian sentiment\n\nAnti-Indian sentiment or Indophobia refers to negative feelings and hatred towards India, Indians, and Indian culture. Indophobia is formally defined in the context of anti-Indian prejudice in East Africa as \"a tendency to react negatively towards people of Indian extraction against aspects of Indian culture and normative habits\". Its opposite is Indomania.\n\nBy the late 19th century, sinophobia had already emerged in North America over Chinese immigration and the cheap labour it supplied, mostly for railroad construction in California and elsewhere on the West Coast. In xenophobic jargon common in the day, ordinary workers, newspapers and politicians opposed this \"Yellow Peril\". The common cause of eradicating Asians from the workforce gave rise to the Asiatic Exclusion League. As the Indian community of mostly Punjabi Sikhs settled in California, the xenophobia expanded to encompass immigrants from British India.\n\nThe relation of \"Indomania\" and \"Indophobia\" in colonial era British Indology was discussed by American Indologist Thomas Trautmann (1997) who found that Indomania had become a norm in early 19th century Britain as the result of a conscious agenda of Evangelicalism and utilitarianism, especially by Charles Grant and James Mill. Historians noted that during the British Empire, \"evangelical influence drove British policy down a path that tended to minimize and denigrate the accomplishments of Indian civilization and to position itself as the negation of the earlier British Indomania that was nourished by belief in Indian wisdom.\"\n\nIn Grant's highly influential \"Observations on the ...Asiatic subjects of Great Britain\" (1796), he criticized the Orientalists for being too respectful to Indian culture and religion. His work tried to determine the Hindus' \"true place in the moral scale\" and he alleged that the Hindus are \"a people exceedingly depraved\". Grant believed that Great Britain's duty was to civilise and Christianize the natives.\n\nLord Macaulay, serving on the Supreme Council of India between 1834 and 1838, was instrumental in creating the foundations of bilingual colonial India. He convinced the Governor-General to adopt English as the medium of instruction in higher education from the sixth year of schooling onwards, rather than Sanskrit or Arabic. He claimed: \"I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.\" He wrote that Arabic and Sanskrit works on medicine contain \"medical doctrines which would disgrace an English Farrier – Astronomy, which would move laughter in girls at an English boarding school – History, abounding with kings thirty feet high reigns thirty thousand years long – and Geography made up of seas of treacle and seas of butter\".\n\nOne of the most influential historians of India during the British Empire, James Mill was criticised for prejudice against Hindus. Horace Hayman Wilson wrote that the tendency of Mill's work was \"evil\". Mill claimed that both Indians and Chinese people are cowardly, unfeeling and mendacious. Both Mill and Grant attacked Orientalist scholarship that was too respectful of Indian culture: \"It was unfortunate that a mind so pure, so warm in the pursuit of truth so devoted to oriental learning, as that of Sir William Jones, should have adopted the hypothesis of a high state of civilization in the principal countries of Asia.\"\n\nDadabhai Naoroji spoke against such anti-India sentiment.\n\nStereotypes of Indians intensified during and after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, known as India's First War of Independence to the Indians and as the Sepoy Mutiny to the British, when Indian sepoys rebelled against the British East India Company's rule in India. Allegations of war rape were used as propaganda by British colonialists in order to justify the colonization of India. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against British women and girls were generally uncommon, this was exaggerated by the British media to justify continued British intervention in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAt the time, British newspapers had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of British women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, but cited little physical evidence. It was later found that some were fictions created to paint the native people as savages who needed to be civilized, a mission sometimes known as \"The White Man's Burden\". One such account published by \"The Times\", regarding an incident where 48 British girls as young as 10–14 had been raped by Indian rebels in Delhi, was criticized as propaganda by Karl Marx, who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events. A wave of anti-Indian vandalism accompanied the rebellion. When Delhi fell to the British, the city was ransacked, the palaces looted and the mosques desecrated in what has been called \"a deliberate act of unnecessary vandalism\".\n\nDespite the questionable authenticity of colonial accounts regarding the rebellion, the stereotype of the Indian \"dark-skinned rapist\" occurred frequently in English literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The idea of protecting British \"female chastity\" from the \"lustful Indian male\" had a significant influence on the British Raj's policies outlawing miscegenation between the British and the Indians. While some restrictive policies were imposed on British females to \"protect\" them from miscegenation, most were directed against Indians. For example, the 1883 Ilbert Bill, which would have granted Indian judges the right to judge British offenders, was opposed by many British colonialists on the grounds that Indian judges could not be trusted in cases alleging the rape of British females.\n\nContemporary Indophobia has risen in the western world, particularly the United States, on account of the rise of the Indian American community and the increase in offshoring of white-collar jobs to India by American multinational corporations. Indophobia in the west manifests itself through intimidation and harassment, such as the case of the anti-Hindu Dotbusters street gang. Cultural theorists have shown that more genteel forms of Indophobia thrive in forums like the editorial pages of \"The New York Times\", and especially in the cliche-ridden and often factually dubious writings of its long-time South Asia reporter, Barbara Crossette.\n\nAccording to Christophe Jaffrelot and Jean-Luc Racine, Pakistan's nationalism is primarily anti-Indian, even though Pakistan was part of Indian civilization over many thousands of years. \"This is the essence of the country's identity.\" Anti-Indian and anti-Hindu sentiments have waxed and waned in the country since its independence. According to Tufts University professor Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, anti-India sentiment in Pakistan increased with the ascendancy of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami under Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi. It is also used to derive the legitimacy of the Pakistani state.\n\nBritish diplomacy and supremacy in arms displaced Muslim power which religious and cultural responses from the Muslim populace were unable to stop. Some Indian Muslims feared the Hindu majority that would gain political ascendance after independence. This view was bolstered by religious riots in British India such as the 1927 Nagpur riots. The Two-Nation Theory was enunciated by Allama Iqbal, which was supported by the All India Muslim League and eventually culminated in the Independence of India and of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nIndependence was accompanied by acts of genocide and hundreds of thousands of deaths on both sides of the border leading to lasting memories among the surviving refugee populations. In Pakistan, this contributed to Indophobia. In an interview with Indian news channel CNN-IBN Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan said \"I grew up hating India because I grew up in Lahore and there were massacres of 1947, so much bloodshed and anger. But as I started touring India, I got such love and friendship there that all this disappeared.\"\n\nThe Two-Nation Theory predicates that the Indian Subcontinent at the time of Partition was not a nation and in its extreme interpretation postulates that the Indian Hindus and Indian Muslims constituted nations which cannot co-exist \"in a harmonious relationship\".\n\nAccording to Husain Haqqani after partition Pakistan faced multiple challenges to its survival. At the time Pakistan's secular leaders decided to use Islam as a rallying cry against perceived threats from predominantly Hindu India. Unsure of Pakistan's future they deliberately promoted anti-India sentiment with \"Islamic Pakistan\" resisting a \"Hindu India\".\n\nAccording to Nasr, Anti-Indian sentiments, coupled with anti-Hindu prejudices have existed in Pakistan since its formation. Indophobia in Pakistan increased with the ascendancy of the Jamaat-e-Islami under Maududi.\n\nCommenting on Indophobia in Pakistan in 2009 former United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice termed the Pakistan-India relationship as shadowed by Indophobia.\n\nIn his article \"The future of Pakistan\" published by Brookings Institution American South Asia expert Stephen P. Cohen describes the Pakistan-India relationship as a neverending spiral of sentiments against each other.\n\nAccording to Sustainable Development Policy Institute since the 1970s Pakistani school textbooks have systematically inculcated hatred towards India and Hindus. According to this report, \"Associated with the insistence on the Ideology of Pakistan has been an essential component of hate against India and the Hindus. For the upholders of the Ideology of Pakistan, the existence of Pakistan is defined only in relation to Hindus hence the Hindus have to be painted as negatively as possible\".\nA 2005 report by the National Commission for Justice and Peace, a nonprofit organization in Pakistan, found that Pakistan studies textbooks in Pakistan have been used to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy-makers have attempted to inculcate towards the Hindus. \"Vituperative animosities legitimize military and autocratic rule, nurturing a siege mentality. Pakistan Studies textbooks are an active site to represent India as a hostile neighbor\", the report stated. \"The story of Pakistan's past is intentionally written to be distinct from often in direct contrast with, interpretations of history found in India. From the government-issued textbooks, students are taught that Hindus are backward and superstitious.' Further the report stated 'Textbooks reflect intentional obfuscation. Today's students, citizens of Pakistan and its future leaders are the victims of these blatant lies.\"\n\nIn 1971 rising political discontent in East Pakistan, on the other side of India from West Pakistan, led to calls to secede from Pakistan, which were brutally suppressed by Pakistan Army leading to the Bangladesh Liberation War. India intervened, triggering the brief Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that culminated in Pakistan's defeat and the secession of East Pakistan which then became Bangladesh. According to Ardeshir Cowasjee in West Pakistan the political and military leadership whipped up anti-India sentiment with the slogan \"crush India\", trying to convince the people that the only issue in East Pakistan was India supporting a secessionist movement.\n\nWriting for Middle East Research and Information Project Pakistani nuclear scientist Pervez Hoodbhoy stated that anti-Indian sentiment is instilled in Pakistani soldiers early in their training at Cadet College Hasan Abdal and Cadet College Petaro. He also claimed that to prosper, Pakistan needed to overcome its hatred for India.\n\nOn 21 November 2012, Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving Pakistani terrorist involved in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks that killed 156 Indians, was hanged by the Indian government after a four-year trial. Following this incident a member of Imran Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) demanded the hanging of Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh in retaliation. Sarabjit Singh later died in the Lahore hospital on 1 May 2013 after being in coma for nearly a week following a brutal assault by fellow Pakistani inmates in a high-security Pakistani jail.\n\nIn 2008 then trade minister of Pakistan Ahmad Mukhtar called upon Pakistanis to renounce \"Indophobia\" and cultivate trade.\n\nThe symbols of the troubled relationship between the two nations are the \"Beating the Retreat\" spectacles at sundown at the Wagah and Fazilka borders. In 2010 both governments agreed to tone down the rituals as part of \"Confidence Building Measures\".\n\nEven though India played a key role in the independence of Bangladesh, providing arms and training to the nationalists, the relationship began to sour within a few years. After the 1975 military coup, `Bangladeshi nationalism' was formulated as a new identity, which portrayed India as an adversary. Over the next 30 years, the situation worsened with the addition of further issues of difference between the two nations. There is a general perception of an Indian regional hegemony among the Bangladeshis. Such perceptions were used by the military regimes and the BNP to cultivate an atmosphere of Indophibia and exploit it for electoral gains.\n\nAlthough a sizeable Hindu minority remained in Bangladesh following the 1947 Partition of India, growing anti-Hinduism caused steady migration into India. The phobia that had grown from anti-Hinduism into Indophobia forms part of ethnic Bengali Nationalism, which continues to mark Bangladeshi perceptions of Indians.\nPolitical disputes such as the Farakka Barrage, Indo-Bangladesh enclaves and Indo-Bangladeshi barrier created rifts between the two countries. Persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh by the rising tide of militant Islamists and cross-border infiltration into India by illegal Bangladeshi immigrants created anti-Bangladeshi sentiment in India. Indophobia coupled with anti-Hinduism, led to accusations of dual loyalty among Bangladeshi Hindus by right-wing Bangladeshis often affiliated with the Al-Badr-esque Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and the BNP. However most of Bangladesh India problems are not based on religion.\n\nAnti-Indian prejudice may be caused by the island nation's bad experience with Indian empires (such as the Chola Empire), their ethnic tensions with Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, who are accused of loyalty to India, India's support and training of the LTTE as well as past attacks against Sri Lankan civilians allegedly committed by Indian forces, such as the Jaffna Hospital incident.\n\nDespite India's alliance with the Sri Lankan government during the Sri Lankan Civil War, anti-Indian hatreds and prejudices are fairly common among the ethnic Sinhalese, escalated by Buddhist Nationalism and militancy. Attitudes towards Tamils are associated with Indophobia and Tamils are labeled \"Indian spies\". Indian traders and businessmen, patronized by the Tamil minority, have been shunned and attacked by the Sinhalese.\n\nDuring the 1950s, discriminatory measures taken by the Sinhala regime targeted Indian traders (typically from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), forcing the traders out of Sri Lanka. Following this, trade with India was deliberately scuttled, as was the sale of Indian magazines.\n\nThe Indophobia of that era led the Sinhala government to go after the so-called Tamils of 'recent' Indian origin. These immigrant plantation workers were imported by the British more than a hundred years earlier and had already been stripped of citizenship by earlier legislation—the first Legislative Act of the newly independent country in 1948. Since then, these Tamils lived as 'stateless' persons and many returned to India.\n\nIn 1981, riots were carried out by Sinhalese mobs against predominantly Indian Tamils in Ratnapura, Kahawatte and Balangoda areas. Shops were looted and set on fire and many women and girls were raped by marauding mobs. During the Black July riots, 4,000 Indian and Sri Lankan Tamils were killed by Sinhalese rioters.\n\nAnti-Indian sentiments began to rise in Burma after the First World War ended due to a number of reasons. The population of ethnic Indians was growing rapidly in Myanmar (almost half of Yangon's population was Indian by the Second World War). The Indians played a prominent role in the British administration and became the target of Burmese nationalists. Racial animosity toward Indians because of their skin-color and appearance also played a role. Meanwhile, the price of rice plummeted during the economic depression of the 1930s and the Chettiar from South India, who were prominent moneylenders in the rice belt, began to foreclose on land held by native Burmese.\n\nIn May 1930, a British firm of stevedores at the port of Rangoon employed Burmese workers in an attempt to break a strike organized by its Indian workers. When, on 26 May, the strike ended and the Indians returned to work, clashes soon developed between the returning Indian workers and the Burmese workers who had replaced them. The clashes soon escalated into large-scale anti-Indian riots in the city. Over two hundred Indians were killed and their dead bodies flung into the river. Authorities ordered the police to fire upon any assembly of five or more who refused to lay down their arms, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Within two days the riot spread throughout the country to locations such as Maymyo.\n\nAfter Burma achieved Independence, Burmese law treated a large percentage of the Indian community as \"resident aliens\". Though many had long ties to Burma or were born there, they were not considered citizens under the 1982 Burma citizenship law which restricted citizenship for groups immigrating before 1823.\n\nAfter seizing power through a military coup in 1962, General Ne Win ordered a large-scale expulsion of Indians. Although many Indians had been living in Burma for generations and had integrated into Burmese society, they became a target for discrimination and oppression by the junta. This, along with a wholesale nationalization of private ventures in 1964, led to the emigration of over 300,000 ethnic Indians from Burma. Indian-owned businesses were nationalized and their owners were given 175 kyat for their trip to India. This caused a significant deterioration in Indian-Burmese relations and the Indian government arranged ferries and aircraft to lift Burmese of Indian ethnicity out of Burma.\n\nDiscrimination of Indians exists in Malaysia. On 28 June 1969, rioting broke out in Sentul where Malays attacked Indians, and 15 Indians were killed.\n\nIn March 2001, a 9-day communial violence known as the 2001 Kampung Medan riots occurred between Indians and Malays cost the deaths of 6 people and injuring many more people. The severity of injuries range from head injuries to severed limbs. The riots no doubt caused anti-Indian feelings among Malays residing in Selangor and Klang Valley.\n\nThe novel Interlok caused ernomous controversial backclash for allegedly being anti-Indian as the book includes racist derogatory terms used to refer to Indians such as \"Pariah\" and \"black people\". The novel also includes the usage of the term \"kasta pariah\" (\"pariah caste\"), which often refers to persons from the lowest caste in the Indian caste system.\n\nThe first anti-Indian commotion that took place in South Africa was the Durban riots in 1949 that took place in the South Africa's largest city Durban, where angry Black Zulus attacked and killed 142 ethnic Indians, destroyed and looted Indian property, and also accounts of Indian women being raped. Many local Whites who were present openly supported the Zulus in their anti-Indian killings and even participated in the lootings.\n\nAnother anti-Indian riot took place again in Durban in 1985.\n\nThe famous peace activist Mahatma Gandhi experienced anti-Indian racism when he was in South Africa, he was beaten up by a driver for travelling in first class coach.\nIndians were also not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa and Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.\n\nThe most prominent case is the ethnic cleansing of Indians and other South Asians (sometimes simply called \"Asian\") in Uganda by Idi Amin. (See Expulsion of Asians from Uganda.)\n\nAccording to H.H. Patel, many Indians in East Africa and Uganda were tailors and bankers, leading to stereotyping.\n\nIndophobia in Uganda existed under Milton Obote, before Amin's rise. The 1968 Committee on \"Africanisation in Commerce and Industry\" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals.\n\nA system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to Indians' economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life. After Amin came to power, he exploited these divisions to spread propaganda against Indians.\n\nIndians were stereotyped as \"only traders\" and thereby \"inbred\" to their profession. Indians were attacked as \"dukawallas\" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time). They were stereotyped as \"greedy, conniving\", without racial identity or loyalty but \"always cheating, conspiring and plotting\" to subvert Uganda.\n\nAmin used this to justify a campaign of \"de-Indianisation\", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority. Some 80,000 were expelled, leading about 25,000 to settle in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 triggered mass anti-Indian hysteria amongst the British public as news of atrocities committed by Indian rebels against British civilians became increasingly widely known throughout Britain, resulting in the mass slaughter of Indian civilians by British forces during the revolt. In Oudh alone, 150,000 Indians were massacred by British troops, with 100,000 of them being civilians. Places such as Delhi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow were all met with general massacre after they were recaptured by British forces. One young officer was apparently recorded as saying \"the orders were to shoot every soul... it was literally murder.\"\n\nThe UK's prime minister Sir Winston Churchill also expressed his hatred and disgust of Indians frequently throughout his career. During the Bengal famine of 1943 when Churchill was confronted by some British officials to direct food supplies to save starving Indians, in a calm reply Churchill suggested that it was the result and fault of the Indians for \"breeding like rabbits\" and joked that the famine was merrily culling the Indian population.\n\nIn countries such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as some Caribbean islands, anti-Indian sentiments sometimes becomes violent.\n\nImmigration from India to the United States became more frequent between 1907-1920 because of Canada's Immigration Act in 1910 which restricted the number of Indians coming into the country. California is where most Indians migrated to and Indian Immigrants had a negative stigma around them. In the late 1980s in New Jersey, an anti-Indian hategroup gang calling themselves the \"Dotbusters\" targeted, threatened and viciously beat Indians until the Indians were in a coma and died or suffered brain damage.\n\nVamsee Juluri, author and Professor of Media Studies at the University of San Francisco, identifies Indophobia in certain sections of the US media as part of a racist postcolonial/neocolonial discourse used to attack and defame India and encourage racial prejudice against Indian Americans, particularly in light of India's recent economic progress, which some \"old-school\" colonialists find to be incompatible with their Clash of Civilizations world view. Juluri identified numerous instances of bias and prejudice against Indians in US media, such as \"The New York Times\" and Foreign Policy and attempts to erase and disparage the history of India in American school textbooks misrepresent the history of India during the California textbook controversy over Hindu history with the final verdict to retain the term \"India\" in Californian textbooks and to remove the disparaging, disrespectful contents in the textbooks.\n\nIn May and June 2009, racially motivated attacks against Indian international students and a perceived poor police response sparked protests. Rallies were held in both Melbourne and Sydney. Impromptu street protests were held in Harris Park, a suburb of western Sydney with a large Indian population. Representatives of the Indian government met with the Australian government to express concern and request that Indians be protected. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd expressed regret and called for the attackers to be brought to justice. The United Nations termed these attacks \"disturbing\" and the human rights commissioner Navi Pillay, herself a member of the Indian diaspora, asked Australia to investigate the matters further.\n\nSome Facebook groups were set up with Indophobic leanings. The Rudd Government set up a task force to address a proposal to make sending a text message encouraging commission of a racial attack a federal offence. The group was headed by national security adviser Duncan Lewis. The proposed amendment would strengthen police powers to respond to attacks against Indian students. Internet-based racist commentary was able to continue because of protection afforded by privacy laws. The current system allows the commission to investigate complaints of racial vilification and then attempt to resolve complaints through conciliation with ISPs and site operators.\n\nIn 2008, the BBC was criticised for referring to those who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as \"gunmen\". This followed complaints that the BBC expresses racism against Indians stemming from the British Raj. \"Rediff\" reporter Arindam Banerji chronicled cases of alleged Indophobic bias from the BBC regarding reportage, selection bias, misrepresentation and fabrications. Hindu groups in the United Kingdom accused the BBC of anti-Hindu bigotry and whitewashing Islamist hate groups that demonise the British Indian Hindu minority.\n\nJournalist M. J. Akbar chose to boycott the BBC when he spoke of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. British parliamentarian Stephen Pound referred to the BBCs alleged whitewashing of the attacks as \"the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Hindu\", Business Line reporter Premen Addy criticised BBC reporting on South Asia as consistently Indophobic and pro-Islamist and that they under-report India's economic and social achievements, while exaggerating its problems. In addition, Addy alludes to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are hostile to India.\n\nWriting for the 2008 edition of the peer-reviewed \"Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television\", Alasdair Pinkerton analysed BBC Indian coverage from independence through 2008. Pinkerton suggested a tumultuous history involving allegations of Indophobic bias, particularly during the cold war, and concludes that BBC coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics shows pervasive Indophobic bias.\n\nIn the journal of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, media analyst Ajai K. Rai strongly criticised the BBC for Indophobic bias. He found a lack of depth and fairness in BBC reporting on conflict zones in South Asia and that the BBC had, on at least one occasion, fabricated photographs while reporting on the Kashmir conflict to make India look bad. He claimed that the network made false allegations that the Indian Army stormed a sacred Muslim shrine, the tomb of Hazrat Sheikh Noor-u-din Noorani in Charari Sharief, and only retracted the claim after strong criticism.\nEnglish journalist Christopher Booker has also criticized the BBC for its coverage of India-related matters. He concludes that the BBC's efforts to reinforce Stereotypes of South Asians has been directly responsible for damaging the image of India, and encouraging racist incidents against Indians, such as the Leipzig University internship controversy.\n\nThe newspaper's India coverage has been heavily criticized by prominent academics such as Sumit Ganguly, a professor of political science at Indiana University and member of the Council of Foreign Relations as well the London-based Institute of Strategic Studies. In a 2009 \"Forbes\" article, Prof. Ganguly faults the New York Times editorial board for its \"hectoring\" and \"patronizing\" tone towards India. He finds anti-India bias in coverage of the Kashmir Conflict, the Hyde Act and other India-related matters.\n\nIn 2010, the \"Huffington Post\" charged that \"The New York Times\" is Indophobic and promotes neocolonialism with its slanted and negative coverage. United States lawmaker Kumar P. Barve described a recent editorial on India as full of \"blatant and unprofessional factual errors or omissions\" having a \"haughty, condescending, arrogant and patronizing\" tone.\n\nIn 2014, Vamsee Juluri, novelist and professor at the University of San Francisco referred to a \"New York Times\" article on public sanitation issues in India as \"absurd, far-fetched, and ugly pieces of Hinduphobic racism\".\n\nIn September 2014, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around the planet Mars, thereby completing the Mars Orbiter Mission. CNN reported this as a \"groundbreaking Mars mission\", making India the first nation to arrive on its first attempt and the first Asian country to reach Mars. A few days later, \"The New York Times\" published a cartoon on this event, showing a turban-wearing man with a cow knocking at the door of an \"elite space club\". As reported in the \"Daily Mail\", the cartoon \"drew immediate criticism for being racist in content\" and a common view on social media was that the paper had \"resorted to uncharitable tactics to take down India's impressive foray into space\". The \"Huffington Post\" said that the cartoon was in \"poor taste\" and \"the racial, national and classist stereotyping is apparent\". \"The New York Times\" subsequently published an apology saying that a \"large number of readers have complained\" about the cartoon and that they \"apologize to readers who were offended\".\n\nIn June 2016, the New York Times published an editorial opposing India's entry into the Nuclear Supplier's Group (NSG). During this time the US administration led by President Barack Obama was actively supporting India's membership. The paper said the membership was \"not merited\" and that India had \"fallen far short\" in assuming responsibilities of a nuclear nation. This view was criticized by several western and Indian experts on nuclear issues. Prof. Ramesh Thakur, Director of the Centre for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament at the Australian National University, said \"The New York Times\" is \"frequently chauvinistic\" and that the editorial \"reflects a deliberate bias\". Dr. Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, rebutted the editorial, saying \"the small community of India-watchers in Washington read these words in disbelief\" and the paper \"should ground its arguments in an appraisal of the complete facts\".\n\nIn November 2017, the New York Times published an article by Asgar Qadri attacking the Indian Sari as a \"conspiracy by Hindu Nationalists\". The article was widely lambasted on social media for associating a common Indian dress with religious prejudice and communalism. In addition, the article was heavily criticized by several Indian journalists, such as Barkha Dutt\n, who called it \"daft commentary\" and a \"gross misrepresentation of what the sari means to us\", and the notion that the sari is exclusively a Hindu dress as \"utter nonsense\". Others criticized the New York Times for promoting colonial racist stereotypes, and pointed out that the sari is also popular in Muslim-majority countries like Bangladesh\n\nPakistani media commentators such as Zaid Hamid were accused by other Pakistanis of promoting Indophobia, particularly Hinduphobia. In an editorial published in \"Daily Times\" Tayyab Shah accused him of acting at the behest of the Pakistani security establishment and condemned his views. Along with Lashkar-e-Taiba he is one of the main proponents in present-day Pakistan of Ghazwatul Hind, a battle where Muslims will conquer India and establish Sharia rule according to a Hadith.\n\nTalking to reporters after inaugurating an exhibition in Lahore, Majid Nizami, the chief editor of Nawa-i-Waqt, stated \"freedom is the greatest blessing of the Almighty, Who may save us from dominance of Hindus, as our sworn enemy India is bent upon destroying Pakistan. However, if it did not refrain from committing aggression against us, then Pakistan is destined to defeat India because our horses in the form of atomic bombs and missiles are far better than Indian ‘donkeys’.\"\n\nSome of the anti-India propaganda is claimed to be driven the Pakistani military. In December 2010 many Pakistani newspapers published reports based on United States diplomatic cables leaks which portrayed India in a negative light. The Guardian reported that none of the information reported by Pakistani media could be verified in its database of leaked cables. Thereafter several newspapers apologized. The fake cables were believed to have been planted by Inter-Services Intelligence.\n\nThe Indo-British film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" was the subject of many controversies in terms of its title, its depiction of Indian slums and its language use. The film's title was consistently challenged for having the word \"dog\" in it. The protest took place in Patna where it was written on a signboard \"I Am Not a Dog\".\nActivists stated that slum dwellers would continue to protest until the film's director deleted the word \"dog\" from the title. \nThe Hindu organisations Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS) and Shiv Sena protested against the film for its portrayal of the Hindu God Rama. The film depicted Hindu society as rapacious monsters.\nCo-director Loveleen Tandan was too criticized by producer Christian Colson. Colson defined her partnership with Boyle a mismatch. Colson noted that the title of \"co-director (India)\" given to Tandan was \"strange but deserved\" and was developed over \"a Coca Cola and a cup of tea\" in order to identify her as \"one of our key cultural bridges.\" During the 2009 Oscar awards ceremony, Tandan was ignored and all credit for the film was taken by Boyle.\nSome filmmakers and actors from Bollywood were also critical of Slumdog Millionaire including Aamir Khan, Priyadarshan and Music Director Aadesh Shrivastava.\n\nVarious Islamist terror groups, such as Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, carry out attacks on Indian soil, the most prominent being the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The crown signifies his power to benefit all sentient beings. A corresponding crown, the Red Crown, is worn by the Shamarpa. The Tai Situpa wears a red crown as well, whereas Goshir Gyaltsab wears an orange crown. \n\nLegend tells that in a previous eon, in a former life as an accomplished yogi, the Karmapa attained the eighth level or \"bhumi\" of the bodhisattvas. At this time, 100,000 dakinis (female buddhas) manifested their hair as a crown, and offered it to the Karmapa as a symbol of his accomplishment. \n\nDusum Khyenpa, the 1st Karmapa, was regarded as an emanation of that yogi and his appearance was predicted by the historical Buddha Shakyamuni in the Samadhiraja Sutra:\n\nA bodhisattva with the lion's roar will appear. He will use the power he achieved in deep meditation to benefit countless beings. By seeing, hearing, touching or thinking of him, they will be led to happiness\n\nThe Karmapas were traditionally the teachers of the successive Ming dynasty Emperors of China. When the 5th Karmapa, Dezhin Shegpa, met the Yongle Emperor, the Emperor, through his devotion and spiritual realization, was able to perceive Karmapa in the Sambhogakaya form of Vajradhara (Tib. \"Dorje Chang\"), wearing a black crown on his head. The Karmapa explained to the Emperor that he could see the 'Vajra Crown', the power-field of wisdom-energy that always stays above the Karmapa's head. The emperor offered to have a physical replica made so that others could receive its blessing.\n\nA crown encrusted with precious stones and topped by a huge ruby was commissioned, and using this, the 5th Karmapa started the tradition of the Black Crown Ceremony which was performed by successive Karmapa incarnations up to the time of the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje.\n\nIn preparation for the ceremony the Karmapa meditates to become inseparable with Chenrezig, the Buddha of Compassion. A mandala offering is made, followed by the seven branch prayer. This is to accumulate good impressions for the ceremony that ensues. The Karmapa then places the crown on his head while reciting the mantra 'Om Mani Peme Hung', transmitting blessings to each participant in the ceremony to the extent that they are capable of receiving them. It is said that by merely seeing of the Black Crown during the ceremony, one will become the first bhumi bodhisattva within three lifespans. This is one of the key reasons why the Black Crown is so important to the Karma Kagyu lineage.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the 16th Karmapa brought the Black Crown and other valuable relics of the Kagyu lineage to Rumtek monastery in Sikkim. They remained there in safekeeping until 1993 following the 16th Karmapa’s death. The ensuing split in his lineage caused a conflict at the monastery between supporters of the two rival claimants for the title of Karmapa. Since that time, it is said that many valuable items have disappeared from the cloister. On July 5, 2004, the Indian Supreme Court delivered a final judgement to grant Rumtek monastery to the Karmapa Charitable Trust, principal supporters of Thaye Dorje, one of the rival candidates for the title of 17th Karmapa. Since then an inventory of valuables is being prepared. The location and integrity of the Black Crown is currently unknown.\n\n"}

As of the 1997 estimate, 29,497 Belgian people identified their religion as Buddhist (about 0.29% of the total population)\n\nBelgium has been comparatively slow in the absorption of Buddhism compared with other countries in Europe because there were no Buddhist countries amongst the territories colonized by Belgium. Alexandra David-Néel introduced the Maha Bodhi Society to the Congress of Free Thinkers in Brussels as early as 1910. There was reportedly a group of those interested in Buddhism who met in Brussels in the period between the Wars. Buddhism had already come to the attention of Belgians academically through the works and translations of the two famous Indologists Louis de La Vallée Poussin at the Ghent University and his disciple Étienne Lamotte at the Catholic University of Louvain, founders of what is internationally known as the Belgian School of Buddhist studies, still now active in Ghent (with the Ghent Centre for Buddhist Studies of the UGent) and Louvain-la-Neuve (at the Institut orientaliste de l'Université catholique de Louvain). There was also for a while in Brussels an Institut Belge des Hautes Etudes Bouddhiques where several Belgian scholars (Jean Dantinne, José Van den Broeck, Charles Willemen) published translations of Buddhist texts between 1969 and 1980.\n\nBelgium has remained wary of new religions (even though in many cases they are historically much older than Christianity) and the general attitude has been illustrated by the Government publication of a blacklist of 189 organizations (including two Buddhist ones) in its ‘witchhunt’ for sects of 1997 and in the ongoing attitudes especially in the French-speaking community of Belgium. Nonetheless, in 1999 there were about thirty active Buddhist organizations and centres in Belgium, representing all traditions of Buddhism. A Buddhist Union of Belgium was set up in 1997 bringing together the various centres of Buddhism in Belgium that had been established through charitable and private organizations. The 2001 census estimated that there were 10,000 Buddhists of Belgian nationality - however, the numbers of Buddhists in the immigrant population alone exceeded 20,000.\n\nThe government was first approached on 10 June 2005 to grant official recognition for Buddhism - a process which is expected to be completed in 2008. Independent sources now estimate the numbers of Buddhists in Belgium at 29,467.\n\n\n\n"}

G. C. Waldrep classifies them as \"para-Amish\". Among Anabaptists the community is often simply called \"Caneyville\".\n\nIn 1990 the \"Christian Communities\" were founded in Cookeville, Tennessee by Elmo Stoll, a former bishop of the Old Order Amish in Aylmer, Ontario. Stoll's aim was to create a church mostly modeled on the Amish, but with community of goods and without the German language and other obstacles in order to help Christian seekers from a non-plain background to integrate into a very plain, low technology Christian life without materialism. He was successful in establishing a community, but without community of goods, and soon many people from Amish, Old Order Mennonite and German Baptist Brethren backgrounds, but also - as intended - seekers joined his community. In addition, the \"Christian Communities\" soon spread to other locations in the United States and Canada. Elmo Stoll was the charismatic leader of the communities who held them together. \n\nAfter Elmo Stoll's early death in 1998 disunion started among the \"Christian Communities\". Bryce Geiser, who has a German Baptist background, replaced Elmo Stoll as the leader of the \"Christian Communities\", but he could not hold together all the different people from different backgrounds. In 2001 the five congregations of the \"Christian Communities\" announced that they would disband the Cookeville community and the movement as a whole. That lead in the end to the disbanding of two of the five \"Christian Communities\", while two others joined the Noah Hoover Mennonites and one affiliated with an Amish group from Michigan.\n\nIn 2004 Bryce Geiser, Andrew Hess and Aaron Stoll, a son of Elmo Stoll started anew and founded the Christian at Caneyville, Kentucky in order not to give up Elmo Stoll's vision.\n\nCaneyville is an Old Order community, that means, they use horses and buggies instead of cars, dress Plain and do not use electricity, computers, cell phones and other modern conveniences. Internal combustion engines are also not used, but steam engines instead. They use wood stoves, the community makes, and many things are propane powered, like it is custom among many Amish. The community makes a living mainly from market gardens and the manufacture of wood stoves. They still adhere to Elmo Stoll's vision.\n\nDonnermeyer and Anderson describe the Community as follows:\n\nThere are about 15 families at the Caneyville Christian Community, living on a property. The members do not all have an Old Order background, but come from Amish, German Baptist Brethren, and \"seeker\" backgrounds. Caneyville established a daughter community near Brownsville, Kentucky, some away.\n\nA bi-monthly pamphlet, called \"Plain Things\", is published by the Caneyville Christian Community.\n\n\n"}

The character's adventures have been published by Dark Horse Comics and later IDW Publishing.\n\nCal himself is akin to John Constantine, a DC Comics paranormal detective. He takes illicit drugs, and befriends a network of ghouls to assist him in his cases. Policemen do not really care to be involved with Cal.\n\nCal McDonald's first story, entitled \"Big-Head\", was released in 1990 as part of the anthology comic \"Fly in My Eye: Daughters of Fly In My Eye\" from Arcane Comix, with art by Jim Whiting. That story led directly to the four-part \"Hairball\", serialized in \"Dark Horse Presents\" #102-105 in 1996. Hairball was later printed as a one-shot comic.\n\nCal's subsequent appearances were in two 2002 novels, \"Savage Membrane\", and \"Guns, Drugs and Monsters\". In the latter, Cal relocated to Los Angeles, after following a living, severed head searching for its body.\n\nFollowing the novels, Cal made his return to comic book form in the Dark Horse Comics mini-series, \"Criminal Macabre\" (2003) with Ben Templesmith as artist. The two would pair up again for a one-shot comic titled \"Love Me Tenderloin\" in 2004. Cal's adventures have continued in other mini-series such as \"Last Train to Deadsville\" and \"Supernatural Freak Machine\", both with artist Kelley Jones, where he re-encountered the severed head. Next, he starred in the mini-series \"Two Red Eyes\" with artist Kyle Hotz, where he does battle with the vampire Nosferatu. He also made a brief appearance in short story format in the Dark Horse Comics released title \"Drawing on your Nightmares\", again with Ben Templesmith as artist. From there, he went on to do \"My Demon Baby\" and \"Cell Block 666\" with artist Nick Stakal. The series \"Two Red Eyes\" started a trend continuing in \"My Demon Baby\", where action film actor Thomas Jane would portray Cal on the issue's covers, stylized by artist Tim Bradstreet.\n\nDuring the release of some of the comic book series there was another novel released in 2003 titled \"Dial M for Monster: A Cal McDonald Collection\". This novel included several short stories featuring Cal.\n\n\"Criminal Macabre: The Complete Cal McDonald Stories\" collects the entire catalogue of Cal McDonald short stories (not the comic stories) until this point. It was released on December 26 of 2007.\n\n\nThe series has been collected into a number of trade paperbacks:\n\nA Cal McDonald film is said to be on the way, however due to the nature of the character, Steve Niles does not want to compromise or \"water down\" Cal McDonald, making it tough to find a studio that will finance the film as is.\n\nUniversal Pictures signed a deal to produce a Criminal Macabre movie with Kyle Ward scripting.

{"id": "593135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593135", "title": "Cult (religious practice)", "text": "Cult (religious practice)\n\nCult is literally the \"care\" (Latin \"cultus\") owed to deities and to temples, shrines, or churches. Cult is embodied in ritual and ceremony. Its present or former presence is made concrete in temples, shrines and churches, and cult images, including cult images and votive offerings at votive sites.\n\nIn the specific context of the Greek hero cult, Carla Antonaccio wrote,\nCicero defined \"religio\" as \"cultus deorum\", \"the cultivation of the gods.\" The \"cultivation\" necessary to maintain a specific deity was that god's \"cultus,\" \"cult,\" and required \"the knowledge of giving the gods their due\" \"(scientia colendorum deorum)\". \nThe noun \"cultus\" originates from the past participle of the verb \"colo, colere, colui, cultus\", \"to tend, take care of, cultivate,\" originally meaning \"to dwell in, inhabit\" and thus \"to tend, cultivate land \"(ager)\"; to practice agriculture,\" an activity fundamental to Roman identity even when Rome as a political center had become fully urbanized. \"Cultus\" is often translated as \"cult\" without the negative connotations the word may have in English, or with the Old English word \"worship\", but it implies the necessity of active maintenance beyond passive adoration. \"Cultus\" was expected to matter to the gods as a demonstration of respect, honor, and reverence; it was an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion (see \"do ut des\"). Augustine of Hippo echoes Cicero's formulation when he declares, \"\"religio\" is nothing other than the \"cultus\" of God.\"\n\nThe term \"cult\" first appeared in English in 1617, derived from the French \"culte\", meaning \"worship\" which in turn originated from the Latin word \"cultus\" meaning \"care, cultivation, worship\". The meaning \"devotion to a person or thing\" is from 1829. Starting about 1920, \"cult\" acquired an additional six or more positive and negative definitions. In French, for example, sections in newspapers giving the schedule of worship for Catholic services are headed \"Culte Catholique\", while the section giving the schedule of Protestant services is headed \"culte réformé\". Within the Catholic church the most promenant Cults are those of the saints.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, outward religious practice in \"cultus\" is the technical term for Roman Catholic devotions or veneration extended to a particular saint, not to the worship of God. Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church make a major distinction between \"latria\", the worship that is offered to God alone, and \"dulia\", which is veneration offered to the saints, including the veneration of Mary, whose veneration is often referred to as \"hyperdulia\".\n\nOutward religious practice in worship are rituals, ceremonies, liturgy or audits, which may involve spoken or sung words, and often involve personal sacrifice. Other outward manifestations of the cult of a deity are the preservation of relics or the creation of images, such as icons (usually connoting a flat painted image) or three-dimensional cultic images, denigrated as \"idols\", and the specification of sacred places, hilltops and mountains, fissures and caves, springs, pools and groves, or even individual trees or stones, which may be the seat of an oracle or the venerated site of a vision, apparition, miracle or other occurrence commemorated or recreated in outward religious practice. Sacred places may be identified and elaborated by construction of shrines, temples, and churches, on which are centered public attention at religious festivals and which may become the center for pilgrimages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49763858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49763858", "title": "Democratic Peasants' Party (Bukovina)", "text": "Democratic Peasants' Party (Bukovina)\n\nThe Democratic Peasants' Party (, PȚD; ), also known as Democratic Party, Peasants' Party, National Democratic Party or Unirea Society, was a provincial party in Bukovina, Austria-Hungary, one of several groups claiming to represent the ethnic Romanians. It had a national liberal and left-wing populist agenda, and was mainly supported by \"the peasants, the village teachers, and some of the intellectuals.\" Its leader was Aurel Onciul, seconded by Florea Lupu, both of whom were adversaries of the conservative and elitist Romanian National People's Party (PNPR). Rejecting sectarianism, the PȚD combined Austrian and Romanian nationalism, as Onciul argued that Romanian aspirations could only be fulfilled inside the multi-ethnic empire. For this reason, and for its role in dividing the Romanian vote, the party was often accused of double-dealing.\n\nIn 1902–1905, the PȚD pursued an alliance policy with politicians from the other ethnic groups—including, most controversially, Ukrainian nationalists. This resulted in the creation of a Progressive Peasants' Fellowship, which dominated the Diet of Bukovina and, in 1904, passed an electoral reform project drafted by Benno Straucher. Ethnic rivalries pushed the group back into sectarian politics before the legislative elections of 1907. The PȚD embraced economic antisemitism and, together with the PNPR, merged into Christian Social Romanian Party in 1908. It continued to have an autonomous existence, with its elite controlling Bukovina's state bank and Raiffeisen credit union. Its business practices nearly drove Bukovina's economy into insolvency, turning other Romanians against Onciul.\n\nThe PȚD reemerged informally during the election of July 1911, and again formally in April 1914. At that stage, it embraced agrarianism and anticlericalism, while also reaffirming its loyalty to Austria and its opposition to the Kingdom of Romania. It became dormant a few months later, with the outbreak of World War I and the Russian offensive, during which party activists put up an inefficient paramilitary resistance. Onciul continued to represent the PȚD in the Austrian House of Deputies to 1918, singular among his Romanian colleagues for endorsing a Romanian–Ukrainian partition of Bukovina. His cooperation with the Ukrainian Galician Army resulted in his and his party's disgrace, but the backlash contributed to Bukovina's incorporation with Greater Romania.\n\nThe PȚD existed during the final stages of Austrian Bukovina, when the \"extreme ethnic fragmentation\" created various rivalries or alliances between its main ethnic groups: the large and rural communities of Romanians and Ukrainians (or \"Ruthenians\"), and the mostly urban German and Jewish minorities. From his early years, Onciul was separated from the mainline currents of Romanian nationalism in Bukovina, represented at first by the local Concordia Society (or \"National Romanian Party\"). Although he did preserve contacts with its conservative wing, he was more interested in the rival PNPR (or \"Radical Nationalist Party\"). However, as historian Vlad Gafița notes, his attempt to participate in the latter was hampered by his professional work: for a while, he worked as a bank clerk in Moravia. Onciul had antagonized other Romanians by taking sides with the Austrian officials, in turn accused of playing community leaders against each other, or of \"Machiavellianism\".\n\nAccording to scholar Irina Livezeanu, the \"relative liberalism\" of the Austrian administration promoted an \"accommodationist\" climate, in which the elites were less tempted to group on competitive national bases—Onciul illustrated such a spirit. Historian Teodor Bălan believes that Onciul's ascendancy was directly owed to the new Governor of Bukovina, Konrad zu Hohenlohe, who wished to calm the situation after a season of Romanian–Ukrainian political battles. For this, he needed \"a political program with economic demands, which would exclude the national question\" and \"replace political romanticism with realism.\" Onciul validated these priorities by turning to a moderate nationalism which favored an \"entente with the Ruthenians, national autonomy, cultivation of the vernacular, and a more intimate relationship with Romanians abroad.\"\n\nOnciul first took a seat in the Austrian House of Deputies during the January 1901 election, which he contested at Czernowitz. By October, he was publicizing his critique of the PNPR, accusing it of passivity. According to Onciul, the \"old men\" of Bukovina's politics endorsed a radical program on paper, knowing full well that they would never apply it. Identifying with the \"youth\", the PȚD was formally established in early 1902, but took almost a year to emerge as an organized group: in January 1903, it published its \"Democratic Program\", and on February 2, held its first congress, as \"the Political Society Unirea or Democratic Peasants' Party\". Onciul was its president, seconded by Grigore Halip and George Hostiuc; Unirea's first motto was \"Înainte, nimănui spre daună, tuturor spre bine\" (\"Forward, with bad outcomes for none and good outcomes for all\").\n\nOnciul, who was the party president, made his entry into politics at an inauspicious time, when the Concordia Conservatives and the PNPR had agreed to merge back into a single party, headed by Iancu Flondor. This challenge guided the PȚD unorthodox strategy, including its alliances and its attacks on other Romanian leaders. The latter were carried in the two party newspapers, \"Privitorul\" (\"The Onlooker\") and \"Voința Poporului\" (\"The People's Will\"), both of which had been founded in 1902. Onciul's brother in law, the Conservative Florea Lupu, came out in support of these attacks. Together with his refusal to accept the PNPR merger, this stance caused him to be expelled from Concordia—although he held on to his seat in the House.\n\nIn its propaganda, the PȚD accused the \"boyar\" elite of having exploited the peasant class and the rural intelligentsia, claiming to expose elitist nationalism as a scheme; it advocated its populist nationalism of a distinctly left-wing hue. \"Privitorul\" deplored \"boyar\" elitism, and exposed the non-Romanian origins of various families forming the conservative ruling class. According to Gafița, Onciul and his followers saw themselves as emancipated progressives: \"profoundly loyal\" to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, capable of seeing beyond national divisions, and even open to the idea of a trans-ethnic, Austrian nationalism. Gafița also sees Onciul as employing \"doublespeak\" on this issue, and of willingly fashioning himself to be the diametrical opposite of Flondor.\n\nHistorian Ioan Cocuz, one of Onciul's staunchest critics, describes him as \"wholly unscrupulous\", as well as \"anti-national\", \"a loyal Austrian\". However, researcher Mihai Iacobescu writes that the PȚD agenda may have been \"hesitant, contradictory, dissolving\", but not truly \"anti-national\". Onciul firmly believed that Austria had united the small peoples of East-Central Europe, and that this had protected them from being absorbed into the Russian Empire. While preserving imperial rule, he favored a multicultural approach, with each people granted \"independent organization and management\", especially over language education. The process leading to additional federalism was a form of \"suum cuique\", with the Moravian Diet as a working model of ethnic cohabitation. His ideas on the topic were overall similar with the \"United States of Greater Austria\" designs of Aurel Popovici, as acknowledged by Popovici himself. Onciul also extended this federal model to solve the national issue of Romanians being divided over several states: a scheme proposed by \"Privitorul\" around 1902 was to somehow incorporate the Kingdom of Romania into Austria.\n\nAs Livezeanu observes: \"Aurel Onciul's National Democratic Party [...] brought together liberal Romanians who favored ethnic compromise and opposed the social conservatism of the National Party.\" According to Nicolae Iorga, the historian and nationalist polemicist, Onciul became especially adept at manipulating the schoolteachers and peasants against the aristocrats. Cocuz similarly suggests that Onciul and Lupu relied on an \"incitement\" tactic: \"setting the class of Romanian schoolteachers against the national Romanian parties\". A major point of contention was class representation within the Diet of Bukovina, with Onciul noting that 150 \"boyars\" elected 10 parliamentarians, while 18,000 peasants and 70,000 proletarians elected one deputy each. The party's original manifesto argued:\nFor ten years now, we have repeatedly tried to reason with our boyars into giving the people its fair share of public life, but all our attempts have been in vain. The boyars never ceased confiscating the people's electoral right, and to abuse it in order to grow rich and occupy for themselves offices on the people's money and for the people's perdition. Given this, we have no other road left but the fight against boyars in order to gain our electoral liberty and with it the people's legitimate influence over its own destiny. [Unirea Society is] a point of convergence for honest, national and democratic, Romanian politics.\nThe effect of this discourse is assessed by Gafița as follows: \"The democrats' orientation toward predominantly social demands, as opposed to those of a national-political substance reaped momentary electoral gains, but also numerous losses for the Romanian emancipation movement as a whole. The latter was submerged and weakened by a climate of internal conflict, but also by the spread of left-wing concepts, such as the class conflict of peasants and boyars, inside the Romanian camp.\" Scholar Andrei Corbea-Hoișie also notes that Onciul's platform \"was not based on the strict national doctrine of the established [National Party], but on [the] goals of left-liberal social and political progress\". Rather than representing the peasantry, the group was vying \"for the favor of the Romanian middle class\".\n\nOnciul and Lupu were elected to the regional Diet in the by-elections of June 1903, allegedly with a mixture of Romanian and Ukrainian votes. Also in 1903, the PȚD leader established in Vienna a trans-ethnic League for Electoral Reform, which became in June 1904 the Liberal Alliance or \"Freisinnige Verband\" (\"Freethinkers' Alliance\"). Its other leaders were: Staucher, the German Arthur Skedl, the Romanian Ukrainophile Nikolai von Wassilko, and the \"Young Ukrainian\" Stepan Smal-Stotskyi. This act remains one of enduring controversy among Romanians: Cocuz argues that Smal-Stotskyi intended to use the \"Verband\" as an advancement tool for the Ukrainians. According to Smal-Stotskyi, his group was a \"subjugated nation\", which could succeed \"only within the titular nations.\" Cocuz speculates that this policy was suggested to Onciul by Hohenlohe, in a bid do undermine the PNPR.\n\nDuring June 1903, Onciul publicly announced that electoral reform was his chief political goal, and that upon its adoption he would retire to Moravia. Beginning in autumn, he approached Flondor and the Conservatives to discuss Bukovina's democratization, following blueprints drafted by Benno Straucher, the Jewish politician. Both also negotiated with Hohenlohe and with the Austrian Minister-President, Ernest von Koerber. The agreement between the groups also included their future merger into a \"Unitary Romanian Party\", its ideological stance to be decided by grassroots democracy. However, the electoral reform project had lost Flondor's support, which also caused the merger project to unravel. It remains poorly understood why Flondor opted to back out: he may have reactivated his Concordia nationalism, as the electoral reform unwittingly gave electoral leverage to the urbanized German and Jews. Moreover, Cocuz claims that the merger deal was suspicious, and that the PNPR never truly accepted it as such. He also believes that Onciul was being hypocritical, offering the merger but still caucusing with the Ukrainians, \"the Romanians' most bitter ethnic enemies\", and refusing to tone down his attacks on Flondor.\n\nThe perceived anti-reform attitude of Flondor and the PNPR pushed the PȚD into a near-complete isolation. On November 10, Onciul, Straucher, Smal-Stotskyi, Wassilko, Hierotheus Pihuliak and Theodor Lewicki signed a manifesto condemning the Romanian parties in exceptionally harsh terms, accusing them of having stalled democratic progress. Such moves upset the moderate Hostiuc, who resigned from the PȚD for fear of becoming a \"tool to our enemies\". The PȚD intensified its outreach efforts toward the Ukrainian, German and Jewish politicians, coordinating attacks on Flondor—during what became known as the \"Flondor Affair\", anti-PNPR forces in the Diet accused Flondor of spreading antisemitism, and forced his resignation. In the Diet, Onciul also accused Flondor of secretly sabotaging his electoral campaign; he was in turn accused by his adversary of being an \"international agent\". Trying to forge a lasting alliance with Smal-Stotskyi, he also challenged in \"Privitorul\" the core theses of Concordia nationalists. He suggested that German colonization in Bukovina could only benefit the local Romanians, and help them learn new trades. From the Diet rostrum, Lupu also praised the Germanic talent for administration, seemingly with his brother-in-law's acquiescence.\n\nOnciul became especially controversial in Romanian circles when he first claimed that all Bukovinans were East Slavs, some of whom had been Romanianized. Onciul's other essays denied the existence of Ukrainization in northern Bukovina, claiming that the Cheremosh Valley had always been a Ukrainian heartland; this stance was immediately challenged from within the party by Zaharia Voronca. In 1901, Lupu had been expelled by the leading nationalist club, \"Societatea Academică Junimea\", after ridiculing the Romanian tricolor; Onciul himself resigned from \"Junimea\" in December 1902. Condemned as \"anti-Romanian\", Onciul and Lupu also found themselves expelled from the cultural society \"România Jună\" in 1904. During the polemic that followed, PȚD men dismissed \"România Jună\" as an instrument of \"the boyars\" and a \"herd of bovines\". A pro-Onciul wing of the club broke off as Dacia Society, which counted Filaret Doboș and George Tofan among its leading members.\n\nDuring the political realignment that followed Flondor's resignation, Ociul was able to succeed with his policy of alliances outside his ethic group, creating a tight alliance around the 1903 League. This \"Progressive Peasants' Fellowship\", presided over by Onciul, together with Skedl, Smal-Stotskyi and Georg Graf Wassilko von Serecki, took the majority vote (17 out of 31 seats) in 1904 elections for the Diet; the PNPR had dissolved itself, and a Conservative (or \"Pactist\") Party, under Ioan Volcinschi, took 4 seats. Onciul, Graf Wassilko and Lupu all won seats in this arrangement, as did their PȚD colleagues Teofil Simionovici and Alexandru Buburuzan; a sixth was won when the front-runner Varteres von Prunkul, an Armenian, renounced in favor of the PȚD man Tit Onciul. An inner-Fellowship agreement prevented the PȚD from putting up candidates in the six majority-Ukrainian constituencies, and in turn guaranteed Ukrainian votes in the majority-Romanian ones.\n\nAs a result of this reshuffling, Graf Wassilko became \"Landeshauptmann\", with Smal-Stotskyi as his lieutenant. Their arrival to power brought with it the adoption of Straucher's democratic reform. There followed liberal and nationalist bills (including the establishment of a state bank, the lifting of propination laws, and the creation of a Romanian History Chair at Francis Joseph University), but the more radical measures proposed by the PȚD were vetoed by Koerber. Soon after, the Fellowship began rupturing around ethnic lines. This had been a backup option for Onciul, who had vetoed Graf Wassilko's proposal to fuse the distinct Fellowship clubs into unitary, non-ethnic, sections.\n\nFor a while in 1905, the PȚD press had no real challenge in Bukovina's cultural-political setting. As the PNPR reconstituted itself around Dorimedont Popovici and the paper \"Apărarea Națională\", Onciul himself began pressing for Flondor's return to politics, and for a reunification of Romanian nationalists. The party exposed anti-Romanian sentiments expressed by the other Fellowship partners (in particular by Smal-Stotskyi) and Ukrainian attempts to control the regional bank, and won instead support from various German deputies. Onciul became expressly committed to economic nationalism and nativism, and more critical of Austria's internal colonization policies. \"Privitorul\" claimed that: \"Mass auctioning of both peasant granges and large-scale properties has steadily brought down the number of our settled population. It is being replaced by legions of foreigners who share neither our custom nor our language, and the pitiful Romanian people, sucked to its marrow by the tolerated usurers, is driven to all corners of the Earth by the indifference of present-day potentates.\"\n\nThis interval in power also saw the creation of Romanian paramilitary and self-help units, called the \"Arcași\" (\"Bowmen\"). The groups were consciously modeled as a mixture of volunteer fire departments and \"Sokol\" clubs. They were identified by their white shirts, but also wore ribbons echoing the Romanian tricolor. The first such units, also active within the temperance movement, were set up in Alt Fratautz and Parhautz. Their creation signaled the Onciul and Lupu wanted to expand beyond their bourgeois constituency and actively involve the Romanian peasantry in regional politics. They were often involved in skirmishes with the Ukrainian \"Sich\" clubs, \"reaching out for their knives and revolvers.\"\n\nOn May 28, 1905, the Fellowship was denounced by the PȚD, and ceased to exist. During that interval, Onciul had a bitter polemic with Wassilko and Straucher's newspaper, \"Bukowinaer Post\". On July 17, the PȚD merged into Modest Grigorcea's reconstructed National Romanian Party (PNR), but continued to function informally as a Democratic wing, still putting out \"Voința Poporului\" to October 1908. In 1906, the PȚD proudly accepted the label of a Romanian \"irredentist\" group, allowing its \"Arcași\" delegates to attend the 25th anniversary of the Romanian Kingdom. Although an old rival of Onciul's, Nicolae Iorga joined Dacia Society as an honorary member. He was then persuaded by Tofan to mediate between Onciul and Flondor, trying to reunite them around a nativist slogan, \"Bukovina for the Romanians\". Running on PNR lists for the by-elections of Chernowitz—Sereth—Storozynetz, Onciul easily won a seat in the Austrian House of Deputies, and was reelected at Gura Humora in the full-term elections of 1907. Together with Dacia, the \"Arcași\" were important electoral agents for Onciul. \n\nAt the time, the faction drew its funds from corrupt practices, taking over control of the local Raiffeisen credit union, which Lupu, as president of the public bank, used for high-risk investments in the forestry business. Tensions were again running high between the Romanians and the Ukrainians, with the latter openly calling for Bukovina to be merged into Galicia-Lodomeria as a single \"Ruthenian province\". Reversing the Ukrainian political ascendancy, Onciul and other PȚD figures undermined Smal-Stotskyi's constituency by joining hands with the mainly Orthodox Ukrainian Russophiles against the Greek-Catholics. However, former associate N. Wassilko sponsored Lupu with money for the regional bank, receiving instead guarantees that opponents of Wassilko's would not find themselves in eligible positions. A new Governor, Rudolf Graf von Meran, observed the Onciul–Lupu partnership and began issuing calls and warnings toward Bukovina's \"healing\".\n\nIn parallel, Onciul began advocating electoral reform in Cisleithania, supporting the over-representation of Germans, Italians and Romanians as a counterweight to the Slavic vote. However, the PȚD slid into hostility toward the local Jews. \"Voința Poporului\" openly embraced economic antisemitism during the peasants' revolt in neighboring Romania, indirectly criticizing the Jewish middle class in Bukovina. Other newspapers, secretly ran by Onciul, published more direct attacks on rich Jews. Such venues include \"Die Wahrheit\", edited by Mihail Chisanovici, and \"Bukowinaer Lloyd\", whose publisher was a Jewish man, Emanuel Goldenberg.\n\nIn October 1908, the PNR, including its Democratic wing, merged with the \"Apărarea Națională\" group to form the Christian Social Romanian Party of Bukovina (PCSR). It offered its presidency to Flondor, who (despite having qualms about the inclusion of a PȚD group) accepted. Although claiming to represent, above all, the local interest of the Romanians, the new party also functioned as a Bukovinan simile of Austria's Christian Social Party (CS), fully adopting its antisemitic theses.\n\nAs noted by Corbea-Hoișie, Onciul initially denied the connection, stating that he and the CS had no common ideological ground; however, Onciul ended up with a \"decisive role\" in the \"brutal enforcement of antisemitic commonplaces and slogans in public discourse.\" In particular, Onciul expanded his polemic with Straucher and other local Jews to an imperial scale, arguing that \"vampire\" Jews had taken hold of the Austro-Hungarian press, and would eventually subjugate the economy. He also alleged that a conspiracy of German and Jewish interests had blocked out his project to tax the alcohol industry and redirect funding toward public education. Radicalized by his readings from Karl Lueger, by 1909 Onciul was writing that Christianity and Judaism were incompatible, and that Jews were anarchic \"bloodsuckers\" or \"well-poisoners\". He proposed racial segregation, euphemistically defined as \"Christian self-determination\". Onciul extended some of his nativist criticism to include the Bukovina Poles, engaging in public debates with another deputy, Krzysztof Abrahamowicz.\n\nOnciul also worked intensely to unify the various Romanian groups under the antisemitic banner, and also publicly denounced liberalism in all its forms, insisting that the PȚD had always stood for the \"thoroughly conservative peasantry\". On January 31, 1909, after co-opting various other factions, the PCSR became a \"Romanian National Party\", with Flondor reconfirmed as leader—essentially a reunion of Concordia. Also then, as a result of Onciul's networking, the party became formally allied with the Austrian CS, though still as an \"independent corporation\". Despite being one of the two vice presidents, Onciul continued to antagonize his colleagues, preserved the Democratic wing as an informal party division, and was suspected of conspiring against Flondor.\n\nDuring the congress of November 1911, Flondor announced his resignation; Onciul was reconfirmed as vice president, delivering a speech about the coming victory of the Romanian element over the Ruthenians. He noted that there was little reason to worry, since, despite official census data, Romanians had a sizable majority. The party was able to coalesce again in April 1911, when its candidates, including Onciul, Lupu and Simionovici, won seats against a rising left-wing threat, the Social Democratic Party of Bukovina—this was celebrated in the party press as a victory of \"nationality and law\" against \"international socialism\".\n\nAfter this victory, Onciul was able to reform the electoral law, tightening the concept of ethnic representation, splitting voters into ethnic caucuses, and eliminating indirect suffrage. Nevertheless, on June 20, 1911, the PCSR/PNR effectively split, following a publicized row between Onciul and Popovici. During the House election of July 1911, Lupu was defeated at Bojan by Constantin Isopescu-Grecul, who claimed that the Raiffeisen scheme had been intended to destroy the Bukovinan Romanian banks. The relaunched Democrats (also \"Democratic Peasantists\", or \"National Peasantists\"), putting out a newspaper \"Foaia Poporului\" (\"People's Sheet\"), resumed their attacks on the Concordia establishment, this time claiming to represent the true voice of Romanian nationalism in a populist and anticlerical variant. Other attacks focused on pan-Romanian nationalists based in the Kingdom of Romania—in particular the Cultural League. Although Chisanovici joined Isopescu-Grecul on a goodwill tour of the Kingdom, he and Onciul were denounced as Austrian agents, and measures were taken to cut down Romanian subsidies for \"Foaia Poporului\".\n\nDepicting the rump PNR as party \"of parsons and kikes\" acting \"on government orders\", \"Foaia Poporului\" was in turn attacked as a \"sellout to Jewish finance\". Although, by 1911, Onciul had toned down his and his party's antisemitism, he still believed that the Jews were obstacles to his federalist project, in that they often supported centralization. At this stage, Onciul was again open to collaboration with the Ukrainians, by proposing that the contested Orthodox Bishopric of Bukovina be informally split between the Romanian and Ukrainian churchgoers. The Romanian conservative establishment complained about the Ukrainization of churches, but Onciul disagreed. Like many in the Ukrainian press, he suggested that there was a \"denationalization of the Ruthenians by Romanians\". He also hoped that, through promises of debt restructuring for Ukrainian credit unions, who would obtain the establishment of a regional credit cooperative, to be presided upon by him.\n\nThe Raiffeisen fiasco prompted Onciul to consider restoring his old party. The PȚD reemerged formally at Czernowitz on April 26, 1914, under the name of \"Peasants' Party\", and with Onciul reconfirmed as president. Its other leading members included Lupu, Buburuzan, Doboș, and Chisanovici. Onciul and Simionovici held the party's two of the five Romanian seats in the House, which were collectively grouped as a \"Romanian Club\" caucus; the three other seats were held by Isopescu-Grecul and Gheorghe Sârbu of the PNR, and by Alexandru Hurmuzachi, an independent. The group's generic populism was replaced with agrarianism: it claimed to have divorced from the intelligentsia, and to be focused on \"ensuring that the peasants are happy\"—according to Cocuz, this reinvention was \"ridiculous\" and \"farcical\".\n\nThe party also restated its loyalism, declaring itself hostile to projects of union between Bukovina and Romania. Onciul had a publicized row with Ion Grămadă and other young Romanian nationalists, whom he denounced as \"irredentists\". By April, his renewed attacks on the Cultural League and its \"chauvinism\" created a stir in Romanian nationalist circles. These responded by calling Onciul a \"traitor\" and \"alcoholic\". During a Diet session on June 14, Onciul clashed with the nationalist deputy Aurel Țurcanu, hitting him with a clot of blotting paper. As Onciul put it at the time: \nthe squires' gazettes and the priests have this practice of wailing and grumbling against the Empire and of abasing [the Empire] in Romania's eyes. This wailing, grumbling and abasing had found a strong echo in Romania, ruining the friendship between that country and Our Empire, that which is harmful to both countries. Our hearts aching, we stood up to this cavalcade, and we asked those in the Kingdom to mind their own business and leave us to our own fate, and to stop meddling in our affairs.\nThe Sarajevo Assassination of June 28 took Austria-Hungary into World War I, and meant the effective end of the party, which had had no meaningful activity after establishing itself. Nominally, however, the Peasantist group continued to be represented in the House until late 1918, through Onciul and Simionovici. From the early stages of war, Onciul was more radical than the Concordia elites in supporting the Austrian cause, adopting the imperial slogan \"A.E.I.O.U.\". This issue took the forefront in July 1914, at the Schoolteachers' Congress in Suczawa. Onciul and Chisanovici tried to prevent it from taking place, claiming that it would be used for promoting irredentism. He later openly accused a guest speaker, Onisifor Ghibu, of \"high treason\" against Austria.\n\nAs reported by scholar Iuliu Maior, the teachers' congress showed Onciul's desperation that the PȚD was losing political relevancy. Around that time, some former leading members of the party were indeed growing reluctant of endorsing the Austrian project—Tit Onciul was arrested as a traitor by the Gendarmerie, and reputedly mistreated. During the Russian invasion of November, Aurel Onciul and Buburuzan formed defense units of \"legionaries\" among the Romanians, comprising up to 1,500 irregulars; N. Wassilko did the same among the Hutsuls. These largely peasant troops were notoriously untrained and under-equipped, wearing civilian clothes and black-yellow armbands, and were consequently decimated by the enemy.\n\nFor the following year, with Romania still neutral, Onciul supported schemes that would prevent her joining the war against Austria and the other Central Powers. Together with the Bessarabian Constantin Stere, he sought to obtain more collective rights for Romanians in Transleithania, and thus prevent Romania from having a \"casus belli\"; he believed that the best scenario was for Romania to fight alongside Austria, and receive Bessarabia as a reward, or even to be peacefully annexed by the empire. The latter proposal vexed Iorga, who replied that \"Romania as a state is no Belgium, to exist [only] as a customs office\", but the representation of a \"healthy people, with its future ahead.\" Also then, Onciul mediated between the Romanians of Transylvania and the Prime Minister of Hungary, István Tisza, asking Tisza to curb Magyarization policies, reform the electoral law, and give semiofficial status to the Romanian language.\n\nWhen Romania declared war on the Central Powers, what remained of the PȚD was further split. Doboș deserted to the Romanian side, then helped organized Romanian political clubs and a Volunteer Corps in the Ukrainian People's Republic. He himself noted that \"many\" of his colleagues in Dacia Society followed suit. In November 1917, Doboș joined Sever Bocu and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk at the Congress of Nationalities from Austria-Hungary, held in Kiev. As Romania experienced heavy losses and its capital fell, Onciul radicalized his opinions on the issue of irredentism. He argued for the annexation of Romania to fulfill Romanian unity under one crown; he also called for Austria to cede its Ukrainian regions to a Ukrainian state, and for West Galicia to fuse into a German-aligned Poland.\n\nThroughout most of 1918, still a representative of Bukovina in the House, Onciul supported plans for the region's partition on an ethnic basis. On October 4, present at Czernowitz, he and Lupu were elected to the 50-member National Romanian Council, which rejected partition and also proposed merging the whole of Bukovina with Transylvania, to form an independent Romanian state. Alone among the Romanian intellectuals, Onciul refused to abide by this agenda, and, according to his adversaries, did everything in his power to obstruct their work. During negotiations, he threatened the anti-Austrian Sextil Pușcariu, hinting that Pușcariu risked a death sentence for his disloyalty. Onciul refused to recognize the National Council as a constitutional body, and instigated other Romanian Club members to do the same. This effort collapsed: parliamentarians Sârbu and George Grigorovici refused to follow Onciul's lead, and returned to Czernowitz.\n\n\"Foaia Poporului\", published as a newspaper of the \"National Peasants' Party\", continued to press for the loyalist agenda during October, although the empire slowly disintegrated \"(see Republic of German-Austria)\". On November 6, as a self-appointed representative of the Romanians, Onciul agreed to divide Bukovina with the West Ukrainian People's Republic, which was represented locally by Omelian Popovych. The act, which validated the Ukrainian Galician Army (UHA) incursions into Bukovina, alarmed the other members of the National Council, who requested the intervention of the Romanian Army under Iacob Zadig and, eventually, Bukovina's merger into Greater Romania. Though he still favored Greater Austrian federalism, Onciul welcomed the UHA. He then appointed himself \"governor al Moldovei de Sus\" (\"Governor of Upper Moldavia\"), warning Zadig and his troops to stay out or risk being massacred by the Ukrainians. According to Cocuz, this period constitutes \"full-blown treason\" and a \"deplorable end\" to Onciul's career.\n\nArrested for a while by the Romanian authorities, then released, Onciul dedicated his last years to drafting plans for a large-scale land reform. In one of his essays, published in 1919, he acknowledged that Greater Romania had managed to fulfill the aspirations of his Bukovina constituents. As a final political act, he presented himself as a candidate in the election of May 1920. Onciul died in Bucharest, where he ran his own law firm, on September 30, 1921.\n\nThe white-shirted \"Arcași\" groups were revived as independent paramilitary associations, and, reorganized by folklorist Valerian Dugan-Opaiț, had some 500,000 members and over 55 sections in 1926. The effort was reportedly slowed down by Romaniațs laws on legal entities, which the mostly-peasant organizers had trouble interpreting. Also then, various sections were driven increasingly close to, and infiltrated by, the antisemitic far-right: as noted by Corbea-Hoișie, Onciul's own participation in diffusing antisemitic lore was partly responsible for this political evolution. From ca. 1923, various \"Arcași\" became sympathetic toward the National-Christian Defense League (LANC), and were in correspondence with its Bukovinan affiliate, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, ultimately splitting from Dugan-Opaiț's apolitical mainstream.\n\nIn 1927, the LANC press also boasted a connection between the \"Arcași\" and Nicolae Totu, who had murdered the Jewish youth David Falik and was acquitted by a sympathetic jury. The following year, it published a piece by Dugan-Opaiț, who claimed that Ion Nistor, the Minister for Bukovina, wanted the \"Arcași\" banned, and that the movement had been marginalized during a national festival at Chișinău. The still-independent groups, supervised by Doboș (who was a member of the Senate of Romania), reorganized themselves in July of that year, allowing \"each member to engage personally in whatever sort of politics\". In 1930, some breakaway \"Arcași\" lodges became subsections of Codreanu's own Iron Guard. Others, in large part recovered and again reorganized by Dumitru Străchinaru, remained primarily loyal to the Romanian King, Carol II, and in 1935 marched at his \"Feast of the Restoration\". These \"Arcași\" received official protection, and by 1937 had expanded to 150 sections.\n\nThe \"Arcași\" movement and the Iron Guard were effectively banned in March 1937 by the government of Gheorghe Tătărescu, which made it illegal to wear political uniforms. However, in August of that year they were again active, and Carol was ceremoniously confirmed as their \"Great \"Vornic\"\". By 1938, with Romania placed under Carol's National Renaissance Front dictatorship, the \"Arcași\" remained an auxiliary of the regime, and Doboș returned as their leader. The movement was largely annexed to the larger organization, \"Straja Țării\", itself led by a former \"Arcași\" youth, Teofil Sidorovici. In June 1938, they formed part of the Romanian delegation at the Strength Through Joy festival in Hamburg. \"Arcași\" groups disappeared under the Iron Guard's National Legionary State but were again revived by Doboș in 1943, this time as subgroups of the Society for Romanian Culture and Literature. The movement was ultimately disbanded in 1944.\n"}
{"id": "7205616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7205616", "title": "Ecclesiastical judge", "text": "Ecclesiastical judge\n\nAn ecclesiastical judge (, or ) is an ecclesiastical person who possesses ecclesiastical jurisdiction either in general or in the strict sense. Up until 1858 when Ecclesiastical courts were abolished, ecclesiastical judges tried church clergy men in church courts or Ecclesiastical courts. Charges dealt in these courts were often very lenient, especially when dealt to church clergymen.\n\nThe official body appointed by the qualified ecclesiastical authority for the administration of justice is called a court () Every such court consists at the least of two sworn officials: the judge who gives the decision, and the clerk of the court (), whose duty is to keep a record of the proceedings and the decision. As a rule, however, an ecclesiastical court forms a collegiate tribunal, the members of which either join with the presiding officer in giving the decision as judges () or merely advise with him as councillors () (cc. xvi, xxi, xxii, xxiii, X, De off. et pot. jud. deleg., I, xxix).\nConnected with the courts are advocates, procurators, syndics, defenders, promoters, conservators, apparitors, messengers etc. The procurators and advocates conduct the case as the representatives or defenders of the parties to the suit; the syndic is the counsel of a juridical person, a collegiate body or a chapter. The chief duty of the conservators is to represent the rights of the , i.e. members of orders, the poor, widows, orphans. The fiscal promoter () is appointed by the ecclesiastical authorities to watch over ecclesiastical discipline, consequently in penal cases he appears as public prosecutor. A , or defender of the matrimonial tie, assists in suits concerning the invalidity of a marriage.\n\nIn addition to his jurisdiction, which can be ordinary, quasi-ordinary or delegated, the ecclesiastical judge must also have certain physical and moral qualities First, he must be an ecclesiastic, so women and laymen are excluded from the office. Yet the pope could confer the office upon a layman. It is further necessary to have full use of his senses and understanding, and suitable legal knowledge; the person appointed must also be twenty years old; but eighteen years will suffice for a judge appointed by the pope or if the parties agree to it. The judge must also have a good reputation, must not be excommunicated, suspended from office, or under an interdict Above all he must be impartial; a suspicion of partiality attaches to the judge who is personally interested in a case, or is related by blood within the fourth degree to one of the parties, or connected with one by marriage, or who lives in the same house, or dines at a common table, or is otherwise friendly, or on the other hand inimical, towards one of the parties, and he may be rejected () by the accused or by both parties as prejudiced () If objection be raised against a judge on the ground of prejudice, which must be done in writing and if possible before the beginning of the action, arbitrators are to pass on the objection; if, however, objection be raised against the delegate of the bishop, the decision rests with the bishop. If the objection be declared well-founded, the judge transfers the case, with the concurrence of the party who brought the accusation, to another or to a higher judge. If the judge lacks the necessary qualifications, and this be known to the parties in the suit, the decision is invalid; if, however, his unfitness be unknown to the parties, and he follow statute canon law, the Church supplements the deficiency, even if the judge have acted in bad faith. \n\nEcclesiastical jurisdiction is exercised over all baptized persons; yet in order that an ecclesiastical judge may be permitted to exercise his judicial power he must also be competent, i.e. must be authorized to pass judgment on a given person in a given case Proceedings held before a judge without competence are null and void .Those subject to the jurisdiction of a certain judge are said to be within the competence () of his court, or have their in him. The forum is either the free, voluntary choice of the parties (), or it is defined by law (), but in criminal and matrimonial cases there is no . Ecclesiastics can choose another judge only with the permission of the bishop, and in this case he must be an ecclesiastic The legal forum () is either ordinary, if the proper course of the regular courts is followed, or extraordinary, if for legal reasons a regular court is passed over. Moreover, the is either general (), corresponding to the universally valid law, or special or privileged (), resting on privilege, as in the case of ecclesiastics on account of the which they cannot renounce.\nAs the jurisdiction of a judge is generally limited to a defined locality, the is fixed by the or of the accused. The axiom holds: , the plaintiff goes to the court of the accused. Domicile is that place where one actually resides with the intention of always remaining there Quasi-domicile is determined by actual residence at the place and the intention to remain there at least the greater part of the year; there is also a domicile by operation of law, legal or fictitious domicile ()—thus a wife may be subject to the jurisdiction of the domicile of the husband, children to that of the parents, religious to that of the place where the monastery is situated, persons having no fixed abode to that of the present place of residence A process can be instituted at Rome against an ecclesiastic who is only accidentally there. Besides the—usual—, there is also that of the object (, where the thing is situated), i.e. complaint can be brought before the judge in whose district the controverted object is; the forum where the contract is made (), i.e. the parties can bring action before the judge in whose district the disputed contract has been made; that of the offence (), within the jurisdiction where the offence was committed. There is also a forum arising from the connection of matters (), if the matters in dispute are so interrelated that one cannot be decided without the other; also the forum of a counterplea (), i.e. in a criminal suit the defendant can, on his side, accuse the plaintiff in the court of the judge before whom he himself is to be tried. If the judge himself wishes to bring an accusation, the superior appoints the judge who is to hear it. The decision of an incompetent judge is valid if by common error () he is held to be competent In civil disputes the parties can entrust the decision to any desired arbiter. \n\nIf the judge render a defective decision, appeal can be taken to the next higher judge; this relation of the courts to one another and the successive course of appeals (), called succession of instances, follows the order of superiority. From the beginning the bishop, or his representative, the archdeacon, or the \"official\" (), or the vicar-general, was the judge in first instance for all suits, contentious or criminal, which arose in the diocese or in the corresponding administrative district, so far as such suits were not withdrawn from his jurisdiction by the common law. The court of second instance was originally the provincial synod, later the metropolitan. The court of the third instance was that of the pope. The court of the first instance for bishops was the provincial synod, the metropolitan, the exarch or the patriarch; the court of second instance was that of the pope; only the pope could be the judge of first instance for exarchs and patriarchs. Since the Middle Ages the pope is the judge of first instance in all more important episcopal causes (), the number and extent of which are in no way exactly definable, but to which above all belong the —more serious criminal charges against bishops Conformably to this the diocesan bishop or his representative (the vicar-general, or , or some other diocesan authority) became the judge of the court of first instance, so far as common law has not withdrawn from him this jurisdiction. If the see is vacant the vicar-capitular is judge of the court of first instance. The judge of the second instance is the metropolitan. For archdioceses, as a rule, the judge of second instance is a neighbouring archbishop or bishop appointed by the Holy See. The same ordinance also applies to exempt bishoprics. The court of the third instance is the Apostolic See, but in the it is the court of first instance As, however, the pope is the , the ordinary ecclesiastical judge of all, ecclesiastical suits without exception can be brought or summoned before the as the court of first instance. \n\nIn the Middle Ages the lower courts were often evaded, or the popes summoned the suits at one before their forum; this custom had some advantages on account of the better legal education and greater impartiality of the members of the papal court, but the administration of justice was delayed and, above all, made more costly by the rule enforced in the papal courts that the parties must appear in person. What made the matter still worse was that such summonses to Rome, as to the court of first instance, diminish unduly the authority of the lower courts. To put an end, therefore, to constant complaint on this point, the Decretals ordained that in future, before the rendering of the sentence, no one could appeal to a higher court without giving a sufficient reason to the judge (from whom the appeal was made), and that the appeal could only be accepted by the judge (to whom appeal lies) after he had satisfied himself of the validity of the appeal Lawsuits, therefore, pending before the Apostolic See were to be tried by a judge belonging to the place whence the appeal came, and especially appointed by the pope. In the late Middle Ages rulers of countries were frequently granted for their domains the papal (exemption from summons); in some cases, they forbade the appeal to a foreign court. \n\nFollowing the precedents of the Synod of Constance and Synod of Basle, the Council of Trent decreed: The court of the bishop is the court of first instance Each suit must be brought to a close within at least two years. During this period no appeal is permitted, neither can the higher judge summon the case before his forum; an appeal before the lapse of two years is permissible only if a final sentence has been pronounced.\n\nIn case of appeal to the Apostolic See, or if the latter, for good reasons, summons a suit from the beginning before its forum, the suit is to be decided either at Rome or by delegated judges on the spot (). As on account of the remoteness of the place where the dispute arose and the consequent lack of knowledge of local persons, unsuitable judges have been at times appointed at the place where the dispute arose, the bishops are each to select, on occasion of the provincial—or diocesan synod, at least four men () having the qualities designated by Boniface VIII, and present their names to the Apostolic See, which in its selection of judges is to be so limited to the persons thus named that the delegation of any other person is invalid; as provincial and diocesan synods are no longer regularly held, bishops are permitted to make this selection with the advice of the diocesan chapter; consequently, judges so appointed are called . At present, this also is no longer customary: on the contrary, the Apostolic See appoints its representatives entirely independently, but it is so arranged that the delegation is bestowed on neighbor bishops and archbishops for a definite term of years. Such delegation is all the more necessary in case a State does not permit ecclesiastical suits to be tried outside of its boundaries, or will only permit the judgement of such a court to be executed within its territories by the secular power.\n\n\n"}

In practice, unregistered religious organizations have operated freely, and the government's practice of not recognizing any new religious groups has not restricted the activities of unregistered religious groups.

According to the government's National Statistics Office, approximately 94.8 percent of the population is Buddhist and 4.5 percent is Muslim; however, non-governmental organizations, academics, and religious groups estimated that approximately 85 to 90 percent of the population is Theravada Buddhist and up to 10 percent of the population is Muslim. Christians, mainly Catholics, represent 0.7% of the population. There are small animist, Confucian, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and Taoist populations. According to the Ministry of Culture's Religious Affairs Department (RAD), the numbers of atheists or persons who do not profess a religious faith make up less than one percent of the population.\n\nThe dominant religion is Theravada Buddhism. The Buddhist clergy, or Sangha, consists of two main schools, which are governed by the same ecclesiastical hierarchy. Monks belonging to the older Mahanikaya school far outnumber those of the Dhammayuttika school, an order that grew out of a 19th-century reform movement led by King Mongkut (Rama IV).\n\nIslam is the dominant religion in four of the five southernmost provinces, which border Malaysia. The majority of Muslims are ethnic Malay, but the Muslim population encompass groups of diverse ethnic and national origin, including descendants of immigrants from South Asia, China, Cambodia, and Indonesia. The RAD reported that there are 3,567 registered mosques in 64 provinces, of which 2,289 are located in the 5 southernmost provinces. According to the RAD, 99 percent of these mosques are associated with the Sunni branch of Islam. Shi'a mosques make up the remaining 1 percent.\n\nAccording to RAD statistics, there are an estimated 351,987 Christians in the country, constituting 0.5 percent of the population. There are several Protestant denominations, and most belong to one of four umbrella organizations. The oldest of these groupings, the Church of Christ in Thailand, was formed in the mid-1930s. The largest is the Evangelical Fellowship of Thailand. Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists are recognized by authorities as separate Protestant denominations and are organized under similar umbrella groups.\n\nAccording to the most recent government survey in 2002, there are 9 recognized tribal groups (chao khao), comprising approximately 920,000 persons. Syncretistic practices drawn from Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and spirit worship are common among the tribal groups. The Sikh Council of Thailand estimates the Sikh community to have a population of approximately 70,000 persons, most of whom reside in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Pattaya, Ko Samui, and Phuket. There are 18 Sikh temples in the country. According to RAD statistics and local Hindu organizations, there are an estimated 95,000 Hindus in the country.\n\nThe ethnic Chinese minority (Sino-Thai) has retained some popular religious traditions from China, including adherence to popular Taoist beliefs. Members of the Mien hill tribe follow a form of Taoism.\n\nMahayana Buddhism is practiced primarily by small groups of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants. There are more than 675 Chinese and Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist shrines and temples throughout the country.\n\nReligious groups proselytize freely. Monks working as Buddhist missionaries (Dhammaduta) have been active since the end of World War II, particularly in border areas among the country's tribal populations. According to the National Buddhism Bureau, as of December 2006 there are 6,458 Dhammaduta working in the country. In addition, the government sponsored the international travel of another 1,414 Buddhist monks sent by their temples to disseminate religious information. Muslim organizations reported having small numbers of citizens working as missionaries in the country and abroad. Christian organizations reported much larger numbers of missionaries, both foreign and Thai, operating in the country.\n\nThe law provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice; however, it restricted the activities of some groups. On September 19, 2006, in a bloodless coup d'état, the military overthrew the government and repealed the constitution. On October 1, 2006, the military coup leaders promulgated an interim constitution, established an interim government, and convened a Constitutional Drafting Assembly to draft a new constitution. Legal experts maintained that the interim constitution incorporates by reference many of the civil rights and protections contained in the 1997 constitution. The repealed 1997 constitution required that the monarch be a Buddhist. This provision was retained in the April 2007 first draft of the country's next constitution. The state religion in effect is Theravada Buddhism; however, it is not officially designated as such. During the reporting period, some Buddhist organizations called for the designation of Buddhism as the state religion in the new draft constitution, but as of June 2007 such a provision had not been included.\n\nThe repealed 1997 constitution stated that discrimination against a person on the grounds of \"a difference in religious belief\" shall not be permitted. The September 2006 interim constitution appears to retain by reference this prohibition against discrimination, and it has been included explicitly in the April 2007 draft constitution. There was no significant pattern of religious discrimination during the period covered by this report.\n\nThe repealed 1997 constitution and the interim constitution by reference provided for a large measure of freedom of speech; however, laws prohibiting speech likely to insult Buddhism remain in place. The 1962 Sangha Act specifically prohibits the defamation or insult of Buddhism and the Buddhist clergy. Violators of the law could face up to 1 year imprisonment or fines of up to $5,800 (188,000 baht). The Penal Code prohibits the insult or disturbance of religious places or services of all officially recognized religions.\n\nThe government plays an active role in religious affairs. The RAD, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Culture, registers religious organizations. Under the provisions of the Religious Organizations Act, the RAD recognizes a new religion if a national census shows that it has at least 5,000 adherents, has a uniquely recognizable theology, and is not politically active. A religious organization must be accepted into an officially recognized ecclesiastical group before the RAD will grant registration. During the reporting period, there were five recognized religious groups: Buddhists, Muslims, Brahmin-Hindus, Sikhs, and Catholics. Four Protestant groups are recognized as subgroups of the Catholics. Government registration confers some benefits, including access to state subsidies, tax-exempt status, and preferential allocation of resident visas for organization officials. However, since 1984 the government has not recognized any new religious groups. In practice, unregistered religious organizations operated freely, and the government's practice of not recognizing any new religious groups did not restrict the activities of unregistered religious groups.\n\nThe repealed 1997 constitution required the government \"to patronize and protect Buddhism and other religions.\" The September 2006 interim constitution appears to retain by reference this protection for religion, and it has been included explicitly in the April 2007 draft constitution. The state subsidizes activities of the three largest religious communities (Buddhist, Islamic, and Christian). The government allocated approximately $92.6 million (3 billion baht) during fiscal year 2007 to support the National Buddhism Bureau, which was established in 2002 as an independent state agency. The office oversees the Buddhist clergy and approved the curricula of Buddhist teachings for all Buddhist temples of educational institutions. In addition, the bureau promotes the Buddhist faith by sponsoring educational and public relations materials on the faith and practice in daily life.\n\nFor fiscal year 2006 the government, through the RAD, budgeted $950,000 (30.8 million baht) for Islamic organizations and $88,000 (2.85 million baht) for Christian, Brahman-Hindu, and Sikh organizations.\n\nThe budgets for Buddhist and Muslim organizations included funds to support Buddhist and Muslim institutes of higher education, fund religious education programs in public and private schools, provide daily allowances for monks and Muslim clerics who hold administrative and senior ecclesiastical posts, and subsidize travel and health care for monks and Muslim clerics. Also included is an annual budget for the renovation and repair of Buddhist temples and Muslim mosques, the maintenance of historic Buddhist sites, and the daily upkeep of the central mosque in Pattani, Thailand. Other registered religious groups can request government support for renovation and repair work but do not receive a regular budget to maintain religious buildings, nor do they receive government assistance to support their clergy. In 2007 the government budgeted approximately $580,000 (18.8 million baht) for the restoration of religious buildings of religious groups, of which $362,000 (11.7 million baht) was allotted for the Muslim community, $145,000 (4.7 million baht) for the Christian, Brahmin-Hindu, and Sikh communities, and $73,000 (2.4 million baht) for special projects of all communities. Private donations to registered religious organizations are tax deductible.\n\nReligious instruction is required in public schools at both the primary and secondary education levels. The Ministry of Education has formulated a course called \"Social, Religion, and Culture Studies,\" which students in each grade study for one to two hours each week. The course contains information about all of the recognized religions in the country. Students who wish to pursue in-depth studies of other religions or of their belief may study at the religious schools and can transfer credits to the public school. Schools, working in conjunction with their local school administrative board, are authorized to arrange additional religious studies courses. The Sangha Supreme Council and the Central Islamic Committee of Thailand have created special curricula for Buddhist and Islamic studies.\n\nThere are a variety of Islamic education opportunities for children. Tadika is an after-school religious course for children in grades one through six, which is under the supervision of the RAD, except for the three southern provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani, where the courses were supervised by the Ministry of Education. The education generally takes place in a mosque. According to government statistics, as of April 2007 there were 1,618 registered Islamic Religious and Moral Education centers teaching Tadika in the 3 southern provinces, with 170,989 students and 5,749 teachers. In the remainder of the country, the RAD registered 994 centers, with 110,783 students and 2,693 teachers. For secondary school children, the Ministry of Education allows two separate curricula for private Islamic studies schools. The first type teaches only Islamic religious courses. As of April 2007 there were 107 schools with 2,044 students and 277 teachers using this curriculum in the 3 southern provinces. The Government registers but does not certify these schools, and students from these schools cannot continue to any higher education within the country. The number of this type of school declined because students opted to attend schools that afford alternatives for higher education. The second curriculum teaches both Islamic religious courses and traditional state education coursework. As of April 2007, 144 schools with 72,618 students used this curriculum in the 3 southern provinces. The government recognizes these private schools, and graduating students can continue to higher education within the country. A third type of Islamic education available, mostly in the southern part of the country, is that provided by traditional, privately operated religious day schools, known as pondok schools. As of April 2007, there were 328 registered pondok schools primarily in Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat Provinces. Previously, these religious schools were not required to register with the Government and received no government oversight or funding. The registration effort began in April 2004 following an attack on a military post and arms depot in Narathiwat in January 2004. Government investigations into that incident led the authorities to pursue suspects associated with pondok schools. The total number of pondoks is still unknown. Sources believed that there could be as many as 1,000.\n\nThe government actively sponsors interfaith dialogue. The abrogated 1997 constitution required the state to \"promote good understanding and harmony among followers of all religions.\" This language was included in the April 2007 draft constitution. The government funds regular meetings and public education programs. These programs included the RAD annual interfaith meeting for representatives and members of all religious groups certified by RAD. The programs also included monthly meetings of the 17 member Subcommittee on Religious Relations, located within the Prime Minister's National Identity Promotion Office (the subcommittee is composed of one representative from the Buddhist, Muslim, Roman Catholic, Hindu, and Sikh communities in addition to civil servants from several government agencies). The RAD held an interfaith event focusing on religious youth from June 26–28 in Chonburi Province, just outside Bangkok. Approximately 250 youth from across the country attended. In July 2006 the RAD organized another interfaith convention in Surat Thani, which had approximately 1,000 participants. The RAD sponsored a public relations campaign promoting interreligious understanding and harmony, including prime-time television announcements. However, a continuing separatist insurgency by militant ethnic Malay Muslims in the southernmost provinces led to concerns that the violence may be contributing to increased tensions between the local Buddhist and Muslim communities.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Falun Gong abandoned a petition challenging the government's September 2005 denial of their application to register as an association with the Office of the National Cultural Commission. The petition was abandoned after no action had been announced on a second petition submitted to the police department to print and distribute a weekly Falun Gong magazine. The group was able to print and distribute religious materials both in Thai and Chinese on a small, informal basis for free distribution. Falun Gong maintained a website that advertises daily gatherings in Bangkok.\n\nThe government does not recognize religious groups other than the five existing groupings; however, unregistered religious organizations operated freely.\n\nAlthough unregistered missionaries were present in large numbers, the number of foreign missionaries registered with the government is limited to a quota that originally was established by the RAD in 1982. The quota is divided along both religious and denominational lines. There were close to 1,500 registered foreign missionaries in the country, most of them Christian. During the period covered by this report, the government increased by 10 slots its quota for Christian missionaries. In addition to these formal quotas, far more missionaries, while not registered, were able to live and work in the country without government interference. While registration conferred some benefits, such as longer terms for visa stays, being unregistered was not a significant barrier to foreign missionary activity. Many foreign missionaries entered the country using tourist visas and proselytized or disseminated religious literature without the acknowledgment of the RAD. There were no reports that foreign missionaries were deported or harassed for working without registration. Muslim professors and clerics, particularly in the far south, continue to face additional scrutiny because of continued government concern about the resurgence of Muslim separatist activities; however, this did not appear to interfere with their activities or their ability to practice their faith.\n\nMuslim female civil servants were not permitted to wear headscarves when dressed in civil servant uniforms; however, in practice most female civil servants were permitted by their superiors to wear headscarves if they wished, particularly in the country's southernmost provinces. Muslim female civil servants not required to wear uniforms were allowed to wear headscarves.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country. However, in many Thai schools Buddhism praying is a compulsory activity along with paying respect to Thai Flag, but the student of other religions can freely choose not to perform Buddhism praying (for example, Muslim student are not forced to pray the Buddhism ritual) .\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversions, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nThere were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice; however, religious groups closely associated with ethnic minorities, such as Muslims, experienced some societal economic discrimination. Such discrimination appeared to be linked more to ethnicity than to religion. Continued violence in the far southern regions of the country contributed to negative stereotypes of Muslims held by persons from other geographic areas of the country. Killings clearly targeted at Buddhists increased ethnic tensions between Muslim and Buddhist communities in the far south.\n\nViolent acts committed by suspected separatist militants in the Muslim-majority provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla, and Yala affected the ability of some Buddhists in this predominantly Muslim region to undertake the full range of their traditional religious practices. During the reporting period, 13 suspects were arrested and were in the process of being tried for the deaths of a Buddhist monk and two novices in an October 2005 attack on a Buddhist temple in Pattani Province.\n\nThere were almost daily attacks by suspected separatist militants in the country's southernmost provinces on both government officials and Buddhists and Muslim civilians. On March 14, 2007, assailants ambushed a van in Yala Province killing eight Buddhist passengers including two teenage girls. That evening, 2 bombs exploded outside a nearby mosque and teashop, killing 3 Muslims and injuring 20. On March 19, 2007, gunmen killed three Muslim students and injured seven others at an Islamic boarding school in Songkhla Province. The violence contributed to an atmosphere of fear and suspicion in the southern provinces. As a result of a series of increasingly provocative attacks, the level of tension between the local Muslim and Buddhist communities continued to grow. Government officials and observers expressed concern that the violence could result in open communal conflict.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, a monk was injured by a bomb in Narathiwat Province. Three others were injured in a separate incident on October 23. The monks were performing the morning ritual of receiving donations of food and were guarded by three armed soldiers, one of whom subsequently died from the explosion.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, no one had been arrested for the 2004 killing of three Buddhist monks and the beheading of one civilian Buddhist rubber tapper, or for the 2004 attacks on Buddhist temples and one Chinese shrine in the southern provinces of the country. The Government continued to investigate these incidents in the context of security operations involving the ongoing separatist violence in the South. Buddhist monks continued to report that they were fearful and thus no longer able to travel freely through southern communities to receive alms. They also claimed that laypersons sometimes declined to assist them in their daily activities out of fear of being targeted by militants. In response to the killings, the Government stationed troops to protect the religious practitioners and structures of all faiths in communities where the potential for violence existed and provided armed escort for Buddhist monks, where necessary, for their daily rounds to receive alms.\n\n\n"}

Now part of the collection of the National Museum of Korea, it was designated as the 78th national treasure of Korea.\n\nThe statue is 83.2 centimeters in height. It was cast from bronze and gilded, probably in the middle or late 6th century. The bronze is less than one centimeter in thickness (and as thin as 2 mm) which attests to the skills of bronze-workers during this time period.\n\nIn 1912 a Japanese person acquired it, and donated it to the General Governing Department of Japan over Joseon. Since 1916 it has been housed at the National Museum of Korea.\n\nThe maitreya is semi-seated on a stool with its right leg crossed over the left in deep meditation. The face of the statue, has a hint of a smile, and exhibits a sense of serene concentration. The right arm of the statue, at the elbow, rests on its lap while its delicate hand reaches towards its cheek giving the impression of deep thought. One shoulder of the maitreya is slightly higher than the other and the upper body is slightly bent forward which also creates the impresses on the viewer an aura of deep thought. The statue wears a crown which is rather elaborate with many prongs and parts of the crown rest on the shoulders of the maitreya. The statue is also dressed in a complicated scarf-like vestment that curves around the body with wing-like projections. The left foot rests on a base which is shaped like a lotus flower. The statue is probably of Silla provenance because of the style is more formalized than realistic.\n\nAt one point, the statue had a halo, but only traces of it remain. It was designated as the 78th national treasure of Korea on December 12, 1962. An X-ray analysis in 1963 showed that \"it has no trace of defect or repair either inside or out, and that it was made of a rare material using unique techniques.\".\n\n\n\n"}

Harae is one of four essential elements involved in a Shinto ceremony. The purpose is the purification of pollution or sins (tsumi) and uncleanness (kegare). These concepts include bad luck and disease as well as guilt in the English sense. \n\n\"Harae\" is often described as purification, but it is also known as an exorcism to be done before worship. \"Harae\" often involves symbolic washing with water, or having a Shinto priest shake a large paper shaker called ōnusa or \"haraegushi\" over the object of purification. People, places, and objects can all be the object of harae.\n\n\"Harae\" stems from the myth of Susano-o, the brother of the Sun goddess Amaterasu. According to the myth, while Amaterasu was supervising the weaving of the garments of the gods in the pure weaving hall, Susano-o broke through the roof and let fall a heavenly horse which had been flayed. This startled one of her attendants who, in her agitation, accidentally killed herself with the loom's shuttle. Amaterasu fled to the heavenly cave Amano-Iwato. Susano-o was subsequently expelled from heaven and Amaterasu’s sovereignty resumed. The traditional Shinto purification ritual \"harae\" is represented when Susano-o is removed from heaven.\n\nThere are various ways in which \"harae\" is practiced. In Ise, “the holiest of all Shinto shrines”, wooden charms named \"o-harai\", another name for \"harae\" or \"harai\", are hung all over the shrine.\n\nIn all Shinto religious ceremonies, \"harae\" is performed in the beginning of the ritual to cleanse any evil, pollution or sins away before anyone gives offerings to the \"kami\". Often, water and salt are used for the ceremonies to rinse hands and the face, as well as the shrine before it is prepared with offerings of goods and food. Then the priest, along with the rest of the participants of the ritual chant a solemn liturgy before the assistant priest purifies the offerings using a wand called haraigushi. \n\nAnother method used to perform harae is \"misogi\", in which a participant stands under a cold waterfall while chanting a liturgy. \"Misogi\" is said to be done on the 11th day of the month, including the winter months at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine. As both are related they are collectively referred to as .\n\n\"Oharae\" is another method performed as a cleansing ritual to cleanse a large group of people. This ritual is practiced mostly in June and December to purify the nation, as well as after a disaster occurs. The practice is also performed at the year-end festival and also before major national festivals. \n\n\"Shubatsu\", a cleansing ritual performed by sprinkling salt, is another practice of the Shinto religion. Salt is used as a purifier by placing small piles in front of restaurants, known as or , for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons. In addition, sprinkling salt over a person after attending a funeral is also practiced commonly in the Shinto religion. Another example of this cleansing ritual is to sprinkle water at the gate of one’s home, both in the morning and evening. A significant and visible form of this ritual is when sumo wrestlers sprinkle salt around the fighting ring before a match, to purify the area.\n\n\n"}

The Indus Valley civilization collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the Vedic Civilisation, which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan.\n\nThe time period in the history of India known as the Vedic period or Vedic age is the period of the composition of the sacred texts called Vedas and other such texts in Vedic Sanskrit. The associated culture sometimes referred to as Vedic civilization was centred on the Punjab (modern day Pakistan and India) and the Gangetic plain (modern India). Scholarship places the Vedic period into the 2nd and 1st millennia BCE, continuing up to the 6th century BCE when it began to be transformed into classical forms of Hinduism. Early medieval Hindu authors suggest dates as early as the 4th millennium BCE.\n\nIts early phase saw the formation of various kingdoms of ancient India. In its late phase (from c. 700 BCE), it saw the rise of the Mahajanapadas, and was succeeded by the golden age of Hinduism and classical Sanskrit literature, the Maurya Empire (from c. 320 BCE) and the Middle kingdoms of India.\n\nGandhāra (Sanskrit गन्धार, Persian Gandara, Waihind) (Urdu: گندھارا) is the name of an ancient Mahajanapada, in northern Pakistan (the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and parts of northern Punjab and Kashmir) and eastern Afghanistan. Gandhara was located mainly in the vale of Peshawar, the Potohar plateau (see Taxila) and on the northern side of the Kabul River. Its main cities were Peshawar and Taxila.\n\nThe Kingdom of Gandhara lasted from the 6th century BCE to the 11th century CE. It attained its height from the 1st century to the 5th century under the Buddhist Kushan Emperors. After it was conquered by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1021, the name Gandhara disappeared. During the Muslim period the area was administered from Lahore or from Kabul. During Mughal time the area was part of Kabul province.\n\nThe Punjabis were predominantly Buddhists like the rest of South Asia, when Umayyad Muslim Arab army led by Muhammad bin Qasim attacked Sindh and lower Punjab, in 713. This started the process of Islamic conversion among the population of Punjab, as well as India. This process continued for the next 10 centuries but there were significant non-Muslim populations including Hindus and later Sikhs:\n\nIs situated at a distance of 16 kilometres to the North of Rahim Yar Khan, on the lost river Hakra. The village is said to be named after the name of Raja Bhutta who captured this locality after Raja Dahir. This village is also claimed to be the birthplace of Sassi, the renowned heroine of Sassi-Pannun and of Ab-ul-Fazal and Fiazi, sons of Mullah Mubarik.\n\nIslamgarh, the old Bhinwar Fort, was built by Rawal Bhim Singh in Sambat in 1665, as the following inscription on its gate in Babri characters proves \"Samabat 1665 Asuj Wadi 2, Maharaj Rawal Sri Bhim Singh Ji Maharaj\". The fort is situated in the Cholistan area of Tehsil Khanpur. It is 46 kilometres south east of Baghla Fort. The fort is in a dilapidated state.\n\nAccording to Tarikh-e-Murad, a fort was built by Raj Hans Karar in Mau Mubarik as a residence for his mother, hence the name Mau refers to mother in local language. The fort was taken by Shah Arghun in 1525. It was one of the six fortresses of Raj Sahasi 11. It had 20 bastions and Towers. The ramparts were about 549 meters in circumference and the walls very strongly and thickly built. Here, the shrine of a Saint Sheikh Hakim is of great importance.\n\nThe ruins of Pattan Minara are located at a distance of about 8 kilometers in east south of Rahim Yar Khan city. It has variously been described as the remains of Mauryan period, who built it in 250 BCE or a Buddhist monastery. Nearby the minar, remains of a fort, a mosque and some tunnels are also visible. About 110 years ago, Colonel Minchin a political agent of Ex-Bahawalpur state, started the excavation of these tunnels but discontinued digging for some reasons or other. According to Colonel Toy, it was the capital of the Hindu state in 10 CE. In the mid of the 18th century, Fazal Elahi Khan Halani, a Daupauta chief, destroyed it and used its materials in the construction of Bhagla and Dingarh Fort.\n\nThe ruins of Kafirkot, ruins at Mari, remains of Rokhri, architectural objects and remain-ruins of Sirkapp Fort.\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2017, the Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar while hearing a case on Katas Raj Temple in Chakwal stressed, \"This temple is not just a place of cultural significance for the Hindu community, but also a part of our national heritage.

The village Jewish synagogue and cemetery are the last remnants of the now abandoned Affaltrach Jewish community.\n\nJews began to settle in Affaltrach in 1660, under the protection of the ruling Knights Hospitaller order. In 1683, three or four Jewish families were living in Affaltrach. By 1749, the Jewish community of Affaltrach reached to about 17 families, dealing mainly with trading cattle, money and goods. A Jewish cemetery was established in 1706 and can still be visited today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Jewish community of Affaltrach was bigger than at any other time: In 1807 - 110 Jews (about 11% of total population), 1843 - 164, 1858 - 219. Due to emigration to bigger cities and other reasons, during the second half of the 19th century the community started to minimize to 151 in 1869, 79 in 1886 and 28 in 1910 (3.75% of the total population).\n\nIn 1861, a district report \"Beschreibung des Oberamts Weinsberg\", was written in Stuttgart by F.L.I Dillenius, depicting the geographical, demographic and economical conditions of the weinsberg district („Oberamt Weinsberg“), an administrative area operated between 1755 and 1926, that Affaltrach was part of. The report stated that Affaltrach had 990 inhabitants in 1861, among them 219 Jews. It is also stated that in 1856, 41 children learned in the Jewish school. In addition, trade was mostly mediated by Jews.\n\nAfter the beginning of the industrialisation and with the 19th century liberal Jew legislation, Jews from rural areas settled to the bigger cities. That's why the\nJewish population of Affaltrach was decreasing, so there were only about 21 people left in 1921. During World War I, three Jews from Affaltrach who were drafted to the German military died in service, and were buried at the local Jewish cemetery. The names of the Jewish soldiers were erased from the town's war memorial during the Nazi Period. A memorial in their honor was also erected in the Jewish cemetery, which is still there today. In the wake of World War II, the town Jews were denied access to their shops, and they were eventually deported out of town between 1941 and 1943. The town economy was largely depended on Jewish businesses. Two of the three local grocery stores were owned by Jews, in addition to two butchers, a baker and a clothier.\n\nAs shown by the documentation of the Jewish victims of the Nazi regime, most Jews living in Affaltrach in the 20th century were older than 40 years old.\n\nThese are the names of the Jews who lived in Affaltrach prior to the holocaust and perished among all other European Jews -\n\nThe Jewish community of Affaltrach established a synagogue in 1701.\n\nDuring the second half of the 18th century, the synagogue was shared with the Jewish community of nearby Eschenau. Between 1820 and 1824 the synagogue was expanded and a women gallery was added to it, in the cost of about 700 florins. In 1851, a newer synagogue replaced the old one. In addition to the synagogue itself, the building hosted also a teaching room, a teacher's apartment and a Mikveh.\n\nDuring 1938 \"Kristallnacht\" the synagogue was devastated and used as a storeroom and refugee shelter. Nowadays, the syangogue is used as a museum for the Jewish community of Affaltrach and maintained by an association specifically dealing with the building. The museum collection shows a few ritual objects, posters and pictures depicting the history of Jews in the Heilbronn area.\n\nThe Affaltrach Jewish cemetery is located to the north of the village itself. The oldest gravestone seen today is dated to 1677. The cemetery served not only Affaltrach but also the nearby villages of Sontheim, Talheim and Horkheim. The cemetery hall and the memorial for the fallen Jewish soldiers who served in the German army during World War I still exist in the cemetery ground. Estimations suggest that the cemetery has around 700 graves, the last one dated to August 1942.\nNowadays, the key to the synagogue is kept at the Protestant Rectory in Affaltrach. Documentation, pictures and details of all gravestones can be reached through the burial book of the Affaltrach cemetery.\n\nTwo of the most notable residents of Affaltrach were August Thalheimer and his sister Bertha, both were born in Affaltrach and had family there. August and Bertha were Communist activists during the first half of the 20th century. Bertha and August were first members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and then were among the founders of the Spartacus League. Later on, while August became the main theorist of the Spartacus League and published several essays on Communism, he exiled to France and eventually to Cuba, where he died in 1948. Bertha stayed in Germany and served two years in prison since October 1917 due to her part in Anti-war demonstrations. During World War II she was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943 until she was released in 1945. She died in Stuttgart in 1959.\n\nDuring the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, some reports about the Jewish community of Affaltrach were published and still exist today.\n\nIn February 1899, an article describing an anti-Semitic incident in Affaltrach was published in \"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums\". Apparently, a few young men attacked a few Jewish shop owners in Affaltrach, causing them slight injuries and insulting Judaism. They were given trials and were sentenced to about 14 days of prison and a fine, though some irregularities were found in the process of the trial, according to the article itself.\n\nSome Jewish newspapers dating to the first decades of the 20th centuries depict ordinary life and occasions among the Affaltrach Jewish community. It can be found here.\n\n"}

The poll also showed that 10% of Ireland now consider themselves convinced atheists, which is a vast increase from 2005.

{"id": "234861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234861", "title": "James Joseph Sylvester", "text": "James Joseph Sylvester\n\nJames Joseph Sylvester FRS HFRSE LLD (3 September 1814 – 15 March 1897) was an English mathematician. He made fundamental contributions to matrix theory, invariant theory, number theory, partition theory, and combinatorics. He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University and as founder of the American Journal of Mathematics. At his death, he was professor at Oxford.\n\nJames Joseph was born in London on 3 September 1814, the son of Abraham Joseph, a merchant. James later adopted the surname Sylvester when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States—a country which at that time required all immigrants to have a given name, a middle name, and a surname. \n\nAt the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of Augustus De Morgan at the University of London. His family withdrew him from the University after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the Liverpool Royal Institution.\n\nSylvester began his study of mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge in 1831, where his tutor was John Hymers. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the tripos, for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, and Sylvester could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a Smith's prize. In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at University College London and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an MA by Trinity College, Dublin. In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia, but left after less than four months following a violent encounter with two students he had disciplined. He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of Charles Sanders Peirce) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry. However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England.\n\nOn his return to England, he was hired in 1844 by the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society for which he developed successful actuarial models and served as de facto CEO, a position that required a law degree. As a result, he studied for the Bar, meeting a fellow British mathematician studying law, Arthur Cayley, with whom he made significant contributions to invariant theory and also matrix theory during a long collaboration. He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of \"The Times\".\n\nOne of Sylvester's lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, Latin and Greek, and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement, published a book entitled \"The Laws of Verse\" in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for prosody in poetry.\n\nIn 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to his being a Jew.\n\nIn 1876 Sylvester again crossed the Atlantic Ocean to become the inaugural professor of mathematics at the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold. After negotiation, agreement was reached on a salary that was not paid in gold. In 1878 he founded the \"American Journal of Mathematics\". The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the \"Analyst\", which eventually became the \"Annals of Mathematics\".\n\nIn 1883, he returned to England to take up the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the University appointed a deputy professor to the same chair.\n\nSylvester died in London on 15 March 1897. He is buried in Balls Pond Road Jewish Cemetery on Kingsbury Road in London.\n\nSylvester invented a great number of mathematical terms such as \"matrix\" (in 1850), \"graph\" (combinatorics) and \"discriminant\". He coined the term \"totient\" for Euler's totient function φ(\"n\"). His collected scientific work fills four volumes. In 1880, the Royal Society of London awarded Sylvester the Copley Medal, its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the Sylvester Medal in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in Oxford. In Discrete geometry he is remembered for Sylvester's Problem and a result on the orchard problem.\n\nSylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at Johns Hopkins University, is named in his honor. Several professorships there are named in his honor also.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Osteen's televised sermons are seen by over 7 million viewers weekly and over 20 million monthly in over 100 countries.\n\nHe is the author of seven books which have been on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nOsteen was born in Houston, Texas, and is one of six children of John Osteen and Dolores (\"Dodie\") Pilgrim. His father, a former Southern Baptist pastor, founded Lakewood Church, of which Osteen is the current senior pastor, in the back of an old feed store. He was educated at Humble High School, a public high school in the city of Humble, Texas, from which he graduated in 1981, followed by Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he studied radio and television communications, but did not graduate and did not receive a degree from a divinity school. In 1982, he returned to Houston and founded Lakewood's television program, where he produced his father's televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died unexpectedly from a heart attack.\n\nOsteen's father encouraged him to preach for many years, but he declined, preferring to work behind the scenes until January 17, 1999, when he accepted his father's suggestion and he preached his first sermon. John Osteen died six days later of a heart attack. Two weeks after his father's death, Osteen began preaching regularly and later that year was installed as the new senior pastor of Lakewood Church on October 3, 1999. Since then, Lakewood's attendance has grown from 5,000 to 43,000.\n\nIn 2003, Lakewood Church acquired the Compaq Center, former home of the NBA Houston Rockets. Renovations cost $105 million. The renovations took over 15 months to complete, and included the addition of five stories to add more capacity. Lakewood's 2005 grand opening was attended by an estimated 56,000 people, including Texas Governor Rick Perry and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nLakewood Church services are seen in over 100 countries. Osteen was selected by Barbara Walters as one of her 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006. Former presidential candidate John McCain described Osteen as his favorite inspirational author. The Osteen family attended Easter breakfast hosted by President Barack Obama at the White House in 2010.\n\nOsteen's sermon preparation involves memorizing his remarks and listening to himself on tape.\n\nOsteen says that he chooses to focus more on the goodness of God and on living an obedient life rather than on sin. He says that he tries to teach Biblical principles in a simple way, emphasizing the power of love and a positive attitude. When asked why he does not focus more on sin, the devil and hell in detail, Osteen stated in an interview with CBN News:\n\nOsteen's first book, \"Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential\", was released in October 2004, and reached the number 1 position on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nHe released his second book, titled \"Become a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day\", in October 2007. It also topped \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list and had a first printing of four million copies. Osteen has said that the book focuses more on relationships and not getting stuck where we are in life.\n\nOsteen married Lakewood Church co-pastor Victoria Osteen (née Iloff) on April 4, 1987. They have a son and daughter. His older siblings, Paul, Lisa, and Tamara, and his younger sister, April, are also involved in full-time ministry. His half-brother Justin does missionary work and is based in New York.\n\nOsteen's 2017 net worth has been reported between $40–60 million. He lives with his family in a 17,000 square-foot mansion, worth an estimated $10.5 million in River Oaks. As senior pastor, Osteen says he draws no salary from the church, which has an annual budget of $70 million. Instead, he relies on income from book sales.\n\nOsteen has generally avoided discussing controversial issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and politics. However, when asked, Osteen said that he is opposed to same-sex marriage. Osteen refuses to preach about homosexuality due to his belief that God likes, accepts, and approves of all people. When asked if he thought God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality is a sin according to the Scripture, but gay people are welcome in his church. He has said sin is human nature, nobody's perfect, and he is not judging, but God is the judge. Osteen has also stated he believes a person can be freed from a lifestyle of homosexuality; it is a process and God can free anyone of any sin or addiction. Osteen has also stressed he does not approve of homophobia, but his faith is based on his reading of the Scriptures. He has said the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News in 2008 during the Republican Party Presidential primary race, when discussing whether he thought that Mormons were Christians, Osteen indicated that he believed that they were. He further revealed that he had not studied the religion. In an interview in 2011, Osteen stated his support for Israel.\n\nOsteen's sermons and writings are sometimes criticized for promoting prosperity theology, or the prosperity gospel, a belief that the reward of material gain is the will of God for all pious Christians. On October 14, 2007, \"60 Minutes\" ran a twelve-minute segment on Osteen, titled \"Joel Osteen Answers his Critics\", during which Reformed theologian Michael Horton told CBS News correspondent Byron Pitts that Osteen's message is heresy. Horton stated that the problem with Osteen's message is that it makes religion about us instead of about God.\n\nWhen asked if he is a prosperity teacher, Osteen responded that if prosperity means God wants people to be blessed and healthy and have good relationships, then he considers himself a prosperity teacher, but if it is about money, he does not. He has specifically stated that he never preaches about money because of the reputation of televangelists.\n\nIn an interview with The Christian Post on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as being part of the prosperity gospel. \"I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it's fair, but it's just what it is. I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of. But when I hear the term prosperity gospel, I think people are sometimes saying, 'Well, he's just asking for money'.\"\n\nDuring the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Osteen received significant criticism in response to not making Lakewood Church, a 606,000-square-foot, 16,000-seat former basketball arena, available as an emergency shelter for those displaced by the storm. On August 27, posts from the church and a Lakewood Church associate pastor's social media accounts stated that the church was \"inaccessible due to severe flooding,\" Osteen countered the claim that flood waters closed the church, saying \"the church has been open from the beginning,\" and, \"We've always been open ... How this notion got started, that we're not a shelter and we're not taking people in is a false narrative.\" This contradicted his earlier statement that the church would open when other refugee centers were full. In a subsequent interview, Lakewood spokesperson Don Iloff stated that the building itself had been flooded during the weekend, with water getting close to spilling over the facility's floodgate. Taking in a crowd of storm evacuees over would've been unsafe, although Iloff maintained that the church's doors were never closed. He also stated that pictures supposedly showing Lakewood free of flooding were taken on Monday, after the flood waters had lowered. On the evening of August 28, it was announced by Lakewood that it would open at noon the next day as an available shelter, opening to storm victims and emergency personnel on August 29.\n\nOn August 15, 2018, less than a year after Harvey struck, the City of Houston and Mayor Sylvester Turner proclaimed a day in honor of Lakewood and Osteen's assistance in rebuild efforts across the Houston area. It stated Lakewood and its pastors have provided \"assistance to more than 1,150 Houston-area families whose homes were damaged or destroyed by floodwaters\" and bought \"\"1.1 million dollars in building materials, furniture, appliances, and paid labor, as well as through the contribution of more than 2,500 volunteers\".\"\n\nIn 2011 Osteen and Lakewood Church were sued by the band The American Dollar for copyright infringement. A judge in 2012 ruled in favor of Osteen, but gave The American Dollar leave to amend the case.\n\nIn March 2017, a family filed a lawsuit against Lakewood Church and Osteen claiming their 18-month-old daughter suffered injuries following an altercation at the church in May 2014. Lakewood Church said it was unable to confirm the story, and the suit was settled by the church's insurance company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "524929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524929", "title": "Kalachakra", "text": "Kalachakra\n\nThe Kalachakra (, ; \"Tsogt Tsagiin Hurden\"; ) is a term used in Vajrayana Buddhism that means \"wheel(s) of time\".\n\n\"Kālacakra\" is one of many tantric teachings and esoteric practices in Tibetan Buddhism. It is an active Vajrayana tradition, and has been offered to large public audiences. The tradition combines myth and history, whereby actual historical events become an allegory for the spiritual drama within a person, drawing symbolic or allegorical lessons for inner transformation towards realizing buddha-nature. The most important texts of this tradition include \"Kalachakra Tantra\" and \"Vimalaprabhā\". The tradition's roots are in India, but its most active history and presence has been in the monasteries of Tibet. The tradition is a form of nondualism, and devotees of the tradition believe that the Kalachakra was taught by Gautama Buddha himself.\n\nKālacakra refers both to a patron Tantric deity or yidam () of Vajrayana Buddhism and to the philosophies and meditation practices contained within the \"Kālacakra Tantra\" and its many commentaries. The \"Kālacakra Tantra\" is more properly called the \"Kālacakra Laghutantra\", and is said to be an abridged form of an original text, the \"Kālacakra Mūlatantra\" which is no longer extant. Some Buddhist masters assert that Kālacakra is the most advanced form of Vajrayana practice; it certainly is one of the most complex systems within tantric Buddhism.\n\nThe Kālacakra tradition revolves around the concept of time (kāla) and cycles (chakra): from the cycles of the planets, to the cycles of human breathing, it teaches the practice of working with the most subtle energies within one's body on the path to enlightenment.\n\nThe Kālacakra deity represents a buddhahood and thus omniscience. Since Kālacakra \"is\" time and everything is the flow of time, Kālacakra knows all. Kālacakri, his spiritual consort and complement, is aware of everything that is timeless, not time-bound or out of the realm of time. In Yab-Yum, they are temporality and atemporality conjoined. Similarly, the wheel is without beginning or end. The term \"wheel\" evoked herewith is a principal polyvalent sign, teaching tool, organising metaphor and iconographic device within Indian religions. Some \"wheel\" cognates are the aṣṭamaṅgala symbol of the dharmacakra, Vishnu's Sudarshana Chakra and the theory of saṃsāra.\n\nKālacakra refers to many different traditions: for example, it is related to Hindu Shaiva, Samkhya, Vaishnava, Vedic, Upanishadic and Puranic traditions and also to Jainism. The Kālacakra mandala includes deities which are equally accepted by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists.\n\nThe Kālacakra deity resides in the center of the mandala in his palace consisting of four mandalas, one within the other: the mandalas of body, speech, and mind, and in the very center, wisdom and great bliss. The Kālacakra sand mandala is dedicated to both individual and world peace and physical balance. The Dalai Lama explains, \"It is a way of planting a seed, and the seed will have karmic effect. One doesn’t need to be present at the Kalachakra ceremony in order to receive its benefits.\"\n\nThe Kālacakra Tantra is a key text of the Kalacakra tradition. It is divided into five chapters.\n\nThe first two chapters are considered the \"ground Kālacakra.\" The first chapter deals with what is called the \"outer Kālacakra\"—the physical world– and in particular the calculation system for the Kālacakra calendar, the birth and death of universes, our solar system and the workings of the elements.\n\nThe second chapter deals with the \"inner Kālacakra,\" and concerns processes of human gestation and birth, the classification of the functions within the human body and experience, and the vajra-kaya; the expression of human physical existence in terms of channels, winds, drops and so forth. Human experience is by some described in terms of four mind states: waking, dream, deep sleep, and a fourth state which is available through the energies of sexual orgasm. The potentials (drops) which give rise to these states are described, together with the processes that flow from them.\n\nThe last three chapters describe the \"other\" or \"alternative Kālacakra,\" and deal with the path and fruition. The third chapter deals with the preparation for the meditation practices of the system: the initiations of Kālacakra. The fourth chapter explains the actual meditation practices themselves, both the meditation on the mandala and its deities in the generation stage practices, and the perfection or completion stage practices of the Six Yogas of Kalacakra. The fifth and final chapter describes the state of enlightenment (Relijin) that results from the practice.\n\nThe Kālacakra Tantra contains passages that refer to Islam, calling Muslims as \"mleccha\" (barbarians). It contains the prophecy of a holy war between Buddhists led by the twenty fifth warrior-king Chakravartin Kalki and the barbarians. According to John Newman, the Buddhists who composed the \"Kalacakra Tantra\" likely borrowed the Hindu concept of Kalki and adapted the concept. They combined their idea of Shambhala with Kalki to reflect the theo-political situation they faced after the arrival of Islam in Central Asia and western Tibet. The text prophecies a war fought by an army of Buddhists and the destruction of the Muslim persecutors of dhamma; then after the victory of good over evil and attainment of religious freedoms, Kalki ushers in a new era. \n\nOne of the most important Buddhist commentaries on Kalachakra Tantra, named \"Vimalaprabha\" and dated to the 11th-century, provides further details of this holy war. The \"Vimalaprabha\" mentions an event in the year \"403\" in Tibetan number symbols stating it to be the \"year of the lord of the barbarians\". This combined by the text's statement that \"Muhammad is the incarnation of al-Rahman\" and the teacher of the barbarian dharma, states Newman, suggests that the 403 year must be in the era of Hijra, or equal 1012-1013 CE. The many Tibetan translations of the \"Kalachakra tantra\" and the commentaries therein, according to Alexander Berzin, mention practices such as the barbarians slaughtering cattle while reciting the name of its god, the veiling of women, circumcision, and five daily prayers facing their holy land, all of which leaves little doubt that the prophecy part of the text is referring to Islam. Further, this supports the dating of this Kalachakra tradition text to the 11th-century by Tibetan and Western scholars, and linking it to the history of Buddhism of that period. The \"Kalachakra\" was introduced into Tibet in 1027 CE according to Tibetan records and per the \"rabjung\" calculations of the Tibetan astronomical calendrical calculations.\n\nAnother interpretation of Kālacakra's prophecy is that it refers to internal war against mental and emotional aggression. Fifteenth century Gelug commentor Khedrub Je interprets \"holy war\" symbolically, teaching that it mainly refers to the inner battle of the religious practitioner against barbarian tendencies.\n\nThe phrase \"as it is outside, so it is within the body\" is often found in the Kālacakra tantra to emphasize the similarities and correspondence between human beings and the cosmos.\n\nIn Tibet, the Kālacakra text is the basis of Tibetan astrological calendars. It is luni-solar system and employs complicated astronomical calculations to determine, for example, the exact location of the planets. The text also is the basis of some Tibetan astrology manuals.\n\nAccording to the Ka-tan system of time calculation in the Kalachakra tradition, Buddha is believed to have died about 833 BCE.\n\nAccording to the \"Kālacakra tantra\", the Buddha taught the first Kālacakra root tantra in Dharanikota (near modern Amaravathi) in 5th century B.C. of southeastern India, supposedly bilocating (appearing in two places at once) at the same time as he was also delivering the Prajñāpāramitā sutras at Griddhraj Parvat in Bihar. Along with King Suchandra, ninety-six minor kings and emissaries from Shambhala were also said to have received the teachings. The \"Kālacakra\" thus passed directly to Shambhala, where it was held exclusively for hundreds of years. Later Kings of Shambhala, Mañjushrīkīrti and Pundarika, are said to have condensed and simplified the teachings into the \"Śri Kālacakra\" or \"Laghutantra\" and its main commentary, the \"Vimalaprabha\", which remain extant today as the heart of the Kālacakra literature. Fragments of the original tantra have survived; the most significant fragment, the \"Sekkodesha\", was commented upon by Naropa.\n\nMañjuśrīkīrti () is said to have been born in 159 BCE and ruled over Shambhala and 100,000 cities. In his domain lived 300,510 Lalo Mutegpa (Mleccha, Yavana) with heretical beliefs in Nimai sinta (sun). He expelled all these heretics from his dominions but they accepted the \"piṭaka\"s (Buddhist texts) and pleaded that they be allowed to return. He accepted their petitions and taught them the \"Kālacakra\" teachings. In 59 BCE he abdicated his throne to his son, Puṇḍārika, and died soon afterwards, entering the saṃbhogakāya of Buddhahood.\n\nThere are currently two main traditions of \"Kālacakra\", the Ra lineage () and the Dro lineage (). Although there were many translations of the \"Kālacakra\" texts from Sanskrit into Tibetan, the Ra and Dro translations are considered to be the most reliable (more about the two lineages below). The two lineages offer slightly differing accounts of how the \"Kālacakra\" teachings returned to India from Shambhala.\n\nIn both traditions, the \"Kālacakra\" and its related commentaries (sometimes referred to as the \"Bodhisattvas Corpus\") were returned to India in 966 by an Indian pandit. In the Ra tradition this figure is known as Chilupa, and in the Dro tradition as Kālacakrapada the Greater. Scholars such as Helmut Hoffman have suggested they are the same person. The first masters of the tradition disguised themselves with pseudonyms, so the Indian oral traditions recorded by the Tibetans contain a mass of contradictions.\n\nChilupa/Kālacakrapada is said to have set out to receive the Kālacakra teachings in Shambhala, along the journey to which he encountered the Kulika (Shambhala) king Durjaya manifesting as Mañjuśrī, who conferred the Kālacakra initiation on him, based on his pure motivation.\n\nUpon returning to India, Chilupa/Kālacakrapada is said to have defeated in debate Nadapada (Tib. Naropa), abbot of Nalanda, a great center of Buddhist thought at that time. Chilupa/Kālacakrapada then initiated Nadapada (who became known as Kālacakrapada the Lesser) into the \"Kālacakra\", and the tradition thereafter in India and Tibet stems from these two. Nadapada established the teachings as legitimate in the eyes of the Nalanda community, and initiated into the \"Kālacakra\" such masters as Atiśa (who, in turn, initiated the Kālacakra master Pindo Acharya (Tib. \"Pitopa\")).\n\nA Tibetan history, the \"Dpag bsam ljon bzang\", as well as architectural evidence, indicates that the Ratnagiri, Odisha mahavihara was an important center for the dissemination of the \"Kālacakratantra\" in India.\n\nThe \"Kālacakra\" tradition, along with all Buddhism, vanished from India in the wake of the Muslim invasions, surviving only in Nepal.\n\nThe Dro lineage was established in Tibet by a Kashmiri disciple of Nalandapa named Pandita Somanatha, who traveled to Tibet in 1027 (or 1064, depending on the calendar used), and his translator Dro Lotsawa Shérap Drak , from which it takes its name. The Ra lineage was brought to Tibet by another Kashmiri disciple of Nadapada named Samantashri, and translated by Ra Lotsawa Chörap .\n\nThe Ra lineage became particularly important in the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, where it was held by such prominent masters as Sakya Pandita (1182–1251), Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280), Butön Rinchen Drup (1290–1364), and Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen (1292–1361). The latter two, both of whom also held the Dro lineage, are particularly well known expositors of the \"Kālacakra\" in Tibet, the practice of which is said to have greatly informed Dölpopa's exposition of shentong. A strong emphasis on \"Kālacakra\" practice and exposition of the zhentong view were the principal distinguishing characteristics of the Jonang school that traces its roots to Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen.\n\nThe teaching of the \"Kālacakra\" was further advanced by the great Jonang scholar Taranatha (1575–1634). In the 17th century, the government of the 5th Dalai Lama outlawed the Jonang school, closing down or forcibly converting most of its monasteries. The writings of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, Taranatha, and other prominent zhentong scholars were banned. Ironically, it was also at this time that the Gelug school absorbed much of the Jonang \"Kālacakra\" tradition.\n\nToday, Kālacakra is practiced by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, although it appears most prominently in the Gelug lineage. It is the main tantric practice for the Jonangpa, whose school persists to this day with a small number of monasteries in Kham, Qinghai and Sichuan. Efforts are under way to have the Jonang tradition be recognized officially as a fifth tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAs in all Vajryana practices, the Kālacakra initiations empower the disciple to practice the Kālacakra tantra in the service of attaining Buddhahood. There are two main sets of initiations in Kālacakra, eleven in all. The first of these two sets concerns preparation for the generation stage meditations of Kālacakra. The second concerns preparation for the completion stage meditations known as the Six Yogas of Kālacakra. Attendees who don't intend to carry out the practice are often only given the lower seven initiations.\n\nThe Kālacakra sand Mandala is dedicated to both individual and world peace and physical balance. The Dalai Lama explains: \"It is a way of planting a seed, and the seed will have karmic effect. One doesn't need to be present at the Kālacakra ceremony in order to receive its benefits.\"\n\nButön Rinchen Drup had considerable influence on the later development of the Gelug and Sakya traditions of Kālacakra and Dölpopa on the development of the Jonang tradition on which the Kagyu, Nyingma, and the Tsarpa branch of the Sakya draw. The Nyingma and Kagyu rely heavily on the extensive, Jonang-influenced Kālacakra commentaries of Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso and Jamgon Kongtrul, both of whom took a strong interest in the tradition. The Tsarpa branch of the Sakya maintain the practice lineage for the six branch yoga of Kālacakra in the Jonang tradition.\n\nThere were many other influences and much cross-fertilization between the different traditions, and indeed the Dalai Lama asserted that it is acceptable for those initiated in one Kālacakra tradition to practice in others.\n\nThe Dalai Lamas have had specific interest in the Kālacakra practice, particularly the First, Second, Seventh, Eighth, and the current (Fourteenth) Dalai Lamas. The present Dalai Lama has given over thirty Kālacakra initiations all over the world, and is the most prominent Kālacakra lineage holder alive today. Billed as the \"Kālacakra for World Peace,\" they draw tens of thousands of people. Generally, it is unusual for tantric initiations to be given to large public assemblages, but the Kālacakra has always been an exception.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, Kalu Rinpoche, and others have stated that the public exposition of this tantra is necessary in the current degenerate age. The initiation may be received simply as a blessing for the majority of those attending, however, many of the more qualified attendees do take the commitments and subsequently engage in the practice.\n\nKālacakra Initiations given by XIV Dalai Lama .\nThe 33rd Kalachakra ceremony was held in Leh town of Jammu and Kashmir, India from July 3 to July 12, 2014. About 150,000 devotees and 350,000 tourists were expected to participate in the festival.\n\nKirti Tsenshab Rinpoche (1926–2006), the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Jhado Rinpoche and the late Gen Lamrimpa (d. 2003) were also among prominent Gelugpa Kālacakra masters.\n\nThe Kālacakra tradition practiced in the Karma Kagyu and Shangpa Kagyu schools is derived from the Jonang tradition and was largely systematized by Jamgon Kongtrul, who wrote the text that is now used for empowerment. The 2nd and 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul (1954–1992) were also prominent Kālacakra lineage holders, with the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul giving the initiation publicly in North America on at least one occasion (Toronto 1990).\n\nThe chief Kālacakra lineage holder for the Kagyu lineage was Kalu Rinpoche (1905–1990), who gave the initiation several times in Tibet, India, Europe and North America (e.g., New York 1982). Upon his death, this mantle was assumed by his heart son, Bokar Tulku Rinpoche (1940–2004), who in turn passed it on to Khenpo Lodro Donyo Rinpoche. Bokar Monastery, of which Donyo Rinpoche is now the head, features a Kālacakra stupa and is a prominent retreat center for Kālacakra practice in the Kagyu lineage.\n\nTenga Rinpoche was also a prominent Kagyu holder of the Kālacakra; he gave the initiation in Grabnik, Poland in August, 2005.\n\nLopon Tsechu performed Kālacakra initiations and build Kālacakra stupa in Karma Guen buddhist center in southern Spain. Another prominent Kālacakra master is the Second Beru Khyentse.\n\nChögyam Trungpa, while not a noted Kālacakra master, became increasingly involved later in his life with what he termed Shambhala teachings, derived in part from the Kālacakra tradition, in particular, the mind terma which he received from the Kalki.\n\nAmong the prominent recent and contemporary Nyingma Kālacakra masters are Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö (1894–1959), Dilgo Khyentse (1910–1991), and Penor Rinpoche (1932–2009).\n\nSakya Trizin, the present head of the Sakya lineage, has given the Kālacakra initiation many times and is a recognized master of the practice.\n\nThe Sakya master H.E. Chogye Trichen Rinpoche is one of the main holders of the Kālacakra teachings. Chogye Rinpoche is the head of the Tsharpa School, one of the three main schools of the Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nOne of the previous Chogye Trichen Rinpoches, Khyenrab Choje (1436–97), beheld the sustained vision of the female tantric deity Vajrayogini at Drak Yewa in central Tibet, and received extensive teachings and initiations directly from her. Two forms of Vajrayogini appeared out of the face of the rocks at Drak Yewa, one red in color and the other white, and they bestowed the Kālacakra initiation on Khyenrab Choje. When he asked if there was any proof of this, his attendant showed the master the kusha grass that Khyenrab Choje brought back with him from the initiation. It was unlike any kusha grass found in this world, with rainbow lights sparkling up and down the length of the dried blades of grass. This direct lineage from Vajrayogini is the 'shortest', the most recent and direct, lineage of the Kālacakra empowerment and teachings that exists in this world. In addition to being known as the emanation of Manjushri, Khyenrab Choje had previously been born as many of the Kings of Shambhala as well as numerous Buddhist masters of India. These are some indications of his unique relationship to the Kālacakra tradition.\n\nChogye Trichen Rinpoche is the holder of six different Kālacakra initiations, four of which, the Bulug, Jonang, Maitri-gyatsha, and Domjung, are contained within the Gyude Kuntu, the Collection of Tantras compiled by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and his disciple Loter Wangpo. Rinpoche has offered all six of these empowerments to Sakya Trizin, the head of the Sakya School of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nRinpoche has given the Kālacakra initiation in Tibet, Mustang, Kathmandu, Malaysia, the United States, Taiwan, and Spain, and is widely regarded as a definitive authority on Kālacakra. In 1988 he traveled to the United States, giving the initiation and complete instructions in the practice of the six-branch Vajrayoga of Kālacakra according to the Jonangpa tradition in Boston.\n\nChogye Rinpoche has completed extensive retreat in the practice of Kālacakra, particularly of the six-branch yoga (sadangayoga) in the tradition of the Jonangpa school according to Jetsun Taranatha. In this way, Chogye Rinpoche has carried on the tradition of his predecessor Khyenrab Choje, the incarnation of the Shambhala kings who received the Kālacakra initiation from Vajrayogini herself. When Chogye Rinpoche was young, one of his teachers dreamed that Rinpoche was the son of the King of Shambhala, the pure land that upholds the tradition of Kālacakra. (See biography of Chogye Trichen Rinpoche in \"Parting from the Four Attachments\", Snow Lion Publications, 2003.)\n\nOnce deemed heretical by the 5th Dalai Lama and successors, and even thought to be extinct, the Jonang tradition has in fact survived and is now officially recognized by the Tibetan Government in exile as a fifth school of Tibetan Buddhism. Jonang is particularly important in that it has preserved the Kālacakra practice lineage, especially of the completion stage practices. In fact, the Kālacakra is the main tantric practice in the Jonang tradition. Khenpo Kunga Sherab Rinpoche is one contemporary Jonangpa master of Kālacakra.\n\nTantric iconography including sharp weapons, shields, and corpses similarly appears in conflict with those tenets of non-violence but instead represent the transmutation of aggression into a method for overcoming illusion and ego. Both Kālacakra and his dharmapala protector Vajravega hold a sword and shield in their paired second right and left hands. This is an expression of the Buddha's triumph over the attack of Mara and his protection of all sentient beings. Symbolism researcher Robert Beer writes the following about tantric iconography of weapons and mentions the charnel ground:\nMany of these weapons and implements have their origins in the wrathful arena of the battlefield and the funereal realm of the charnel grounds. As primal images of destruction, slaughter, sacrifice, and necromancy these weapons were wrested from the hands of the evil and turned - as symbols - against the ultimate root of evil, the self-cherishing conceptual identity that gives rise to the five poisons of ignorance, desire, hatred, pride, and jealousy. In the hands of siddhas, dakinis, wrathful and semi-wrathful yidam deities, protective deities or dharmapalas these implements became pure symbols, weapons of transformation, and an expression of the deities' wrathful compassion which mercilessly destroys the manifold illusions of the inflated human ego.\n\n\n"}

It was ruled by kings who bore the family name \"Malla\" (not to be confused with the later Malla dynasty of Kathmandu). The Khasa Malla kings ruled western parts of Nepal during 11th-14th century. The 954 AD Khajuraho Inscription of Dhaṇga states Khasa Kingdom equivalent to Gauda of Bengal and Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty.\n\nAn ancient tribe named Khasa is mentioned in several ancient legendary Indian texts, including the \"Mahabharata\". The historical Khasa kingdom is different from the territory of this legendary tribe, although there have been some speculations about a connection between the two. The historical Khasas are mentioned in several Indian inscriptions dated between 8th and 13th centuries CE. The Khasa Malla kingdom was feudatory and the principalities were independent in nature. Most of its territory was over the Karnali River basin. Prithvi Malla had firmly established the Kingdom around 1413 A.D. The kingdom had conquered over the half of the Greater Nepal over two hundred years. The reign of King Punya Malla and Prithvi Malla had strict traditional Hindu ritual and customs. This kingdom disintegrated after the death of Abhaya Malla and formed the Baise rajya confederacy. In the 12th century, King Nāgarāja conquered the principal Jumla Kingdom of the central Himalayas and overran lands up to Bheri River in the east, Satluj river in the west and Mayum pass of Tibet in the north. King Nāgarāja also referred as Jāveśvara () came from Khāripradeśa (present day Ngari Province) and set up his capital at Semjā. The widely regarded most renowned King of Khasa Malla Kingdom was Prithvi Malla.\n\nThe successors of King Nāgarāja adhered to some suffix as -illa and -challa like King Chapilla, King Krachalla. \"Challa\" and \"Malla\" were titles of kings and princes. \"Rāulā\" was the title of a high-ranking official. Personalities like Malayavarma, Medinivarma, Samsarivarma, Balirāja, etc. had title of \"Rāulā\". \"Mandalesvara\" or \"Mandalik\" was a title conferred on powerful persons of the Kingdom. Royal princes, senior officials and defeated Kings were appointed to the post of \"Mandalesvara\". \n\nThe list of rulers of Khasa (Tibetan:\"Ya rtse\") Kingdom established by the Tibetologists Luciano Petech and Roberto Vitali are:\n\nAfter the Siege of Chittorgarh in 1303, large immigration of Rajputs occurred into Nepal.

Historian and Jesuit Ludwig Stiller considers the Rajput interference to the politics of Khas Kingdom of Jumla was responsible for its fragmentation and he explains: Francis Tucker also further states that \"...the Rajputs was so often guilty of base ingratitude and treachery to gratify his ambition. They were fierce, ruthless people who would stop at nothing.\" After the late 13th century the Khas empire collapsed and divided into Baise Rajya (22 principalities) in Karnali-Bheri region and Chaubise rajya (24 principalities) in Gandaki region.

Notable events in his life include his journey with his uncle Abram (Abraham) and his flight from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, during which Lot's wife became a pillar of salt, and Lot had sexual relations with his daughters so that they could bear children.\n\nLot and his father Haran were born and raised in Ur of the Chaldees () in the region of Sumeria on the River Euphrates of lower Mesopotamia. Haran died in that land before his father Terah. ()\n\nEn route to Canaan, the family stopped in the \"Paddan Aram\" region, about halfway along the Fertile Crescent between Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. They settled at the site called Haran where Lot's grandfather, Terah, lived the rest of his days. He was 205 years old when he died. ()\n\nAfter they dwelt in the land of Canaan for a little while, a famine overtook the countryside, and they journeyed many miles farther south into Egypt. After having dwelt in Egypt for some time, they acquired vast amounts of wealth and numbers of livestock and returned to the Bethel area.\n\n helps and discusses Abram and Lot's return to Canaan after the famine had passed and the lands became fertile again. They traveled back through the Negev to the hills of Bethel. With their constant movement and the sizeable numbers of livestock each family owned requiring pasture, the herdsmen of the two groups began to bicker. These arguments became so troublesome that Abram suggested to Lot that they part ways, lest conflict continue among the \"brethren\".\n\nAlthough Abram gave Lot the choice of going either north (the left hand) or south (the right hand), Lot instead looked beyond Jordan toward a well-irrigated plain and chose that land, for it seemed \"like the garden of the \". Alas, ahead Lot could not foresee the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the transformation of the water into a saline sea. () Abram then headed south to Hebron, staying within the land of Canaan. ()\nLot camped among the cities of the green Jordan plain and initially pitched his tent facing Sodom. Eight or so years before, the five kingdoms had become vassal states of an alliance of four eastern kingdoms under the leadership of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam. They served this king for twelve years, but \"the thirteenth year they rebelled.\" () The following year Chedorlaomer's four armies returned and at the Battle of the Vale of Siddim, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell in defeat. Chedorlaomer despoiled the cities and took captives as he departed, including Lot, who by then \"dwelt\" in Sodom.\n\nWhen Abram heard what had happened to his \"brother\" Lot, he armed a rescue force of three hundred and eighteen of his trained servants and caught up to the armies of the four kings in the territory of the Tribe of Dan. Abram divided his forces, which attacked at night from multiple directions, and the four kings fled northeast. Abram's pursuit continued and the \"slaughter of Chedorlaomer\" and the other kings was completed at Hobah, north of Damascus. Abram brought back \"his brother Lot\" and all the people and their belongings.

His response infuriated the men of Sodom who accused him of being judgmental and they threatened to do worse to him than they would have done to the men.\n\nBefore they could harm Lot and break into the house, the men pulled Lot back in and struck the intruders with blindness, and revealed to Lot that they were angels sent to destroy the place. This allowed a window of opportunity for Lot to make preparations for him and his family to leave. When he went out to the men that were engaged to marry his daughters, warning them to flee, they assumed he was joking.\n\nAs the day began to dawn, the angels urged him to hurry up and leave; when he lingered, the angels took hold of Lot, his wife and two daughters, and transported them beyond the city and set them down. The angel told Lot, \"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\" Lot argued that if he went to the mountain some evil would cause his death, and he requested to be allowed to flee instead to the \"little\" city which was closer. (This city of Bela was later called Zoar because it was little.) His request was accepted, and they headed for Zoar instead.\n<poem style=\"display:table;\">\nGenesis 19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n\nAbraham could see the smoke billowing upward from the countryside.\n\nInstead of both fire and brimstone, Josephus has only lightning as the cause of the fire that destroyed Sodom: \"God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city, and set it on fire, with its inhabitants; and laid waste the country with the like burning, as I formerly said when I wrote \"The Jewish War\".\"\n\nThe account of Lot and his daughters is in \nThe older daughter conceived Moab (Hebrew מוֹאָב, lit., \"from the father\" [meh-Av]), father of the Moabites; the younger conceived Ben-Ammi (Hebrew בֶּן-עַמִּי, lit., \"Son of my people\"), father of the Ammonites.\n\nThe story, usually called Lot and his daughters, has been the subject of over the centuries, and became one of the subjects in the Power of Women group of subjects, warning men against the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of women, while also providing an opportunity for an erotic depiction. The scene generally shows Lot and his daughters eating and drinking in their mountain refuge. Often the background contains a small figure of Lot's wife, and in the distance, a burning city.\n\nIn the Bereshith of the Torah, Lot is first mentioned at the end of the weekly reading portion, Parashat Noach. The weekly reading portions that follow, concerning all of the accounts of Lot's life, are read in the Parashat Lekh Lekha and Parashat Vayera. In the Midrash, a number of additional stories concerning Lot are present, not found in the Tanakh, as follows:\n\nIn the Christian New Testament, Lot is considered sympathetically, as a man who regretted his choice to live in Sodom, where he \"vexed his righteous soul from day to day\" (). Jesus spoke of future judgment coming suddenly as in the days of Lot, and warned solemnly, \"Remember Lot's wife\". ()\n\nLut () in the Quran is considered to be the same as Lot in the Hebrew Bible. He is considered to be a messenger of God and a prophet of God.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, Lot lived in Ur and was a nephew of Ibrahim (Abraham). He migrated with Ibrahim to Canaan and was commissioned as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. His story is used as a reference by some Muslims to demonstrate Islam's disapproval of homosexuality. He was commanded by Allah to go to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah to preach monotheism and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts. Lut's messages were ignored by the inhabitants, prompting Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction. Though Lut left the city, his wife was asked to be left behind by angels hence died during the destruction.\nThe Quran defines Lot as a prophet, and holds that all prophets were examples of moral and spiritual rectitude. The Quran does not include stories of Lot's drunkenness and/or incest.\n\nThe presumptive incest between Lot and his daughters has raised many questions, debates, and theories as to what the real motives were, who really was at fault, and the level of bias the author of Genesis Chapter 19 had. However, such biblical scholars as Jacob Milgrom, Victor P. Hamilton, and Calum Carmichael postulate that the Levitical laws could not have been developed the way they were, without controversial issues surrounding the patriarchs of Israel, especially regarding incest. Carmichael even attributes the entire formulation of the Levitical laws to the lives of the founding fathers of the nation, including the righteous Lot (together with Abraham, Jacob, Judah, Moses, and David), who were outstanding figures in Israelite tradition.\n\nAccording to the scholars mentioned above, the patriarchs of Israel are the key to understanding how the priestly laws concerning incest developed. Kinship marriages amongst the patriarchs includes Abraham's marriage to his half-sister Sarai; the marriage of Abraham's brother, Nahor, to their niece Milcah; Isaac's marriage to Rebekah, his first cousin once removed; Jacob's marriages with two sisters who are his first cousins; and, in the instance of Moses's parents, a marriage between nephew and aunt (father's sister). Therefore, the patriarchal marriages surely mattered to lawgivers and they suggest a narrative basis for the laws of Leviticus, chapters 18 and 20.\n\nThe Levitical laws against incest were created, it has been argued, to separate the lifestyle of the Israelite from the lifestyle of the people of Canaan, despite any incestual involvements the patriarchs had had in the past. The Levitical laws were needed for a developing nation who needed to be seen as different from the world, cleansed and blameless: The first step starting with circumcision. So nothing could be held against the patriarchs for incestuous behavior because this was part of progressive development, from the ways of the world (coming out of Chaldea) to becoming blameless before their God.\n\nSome have argued that Lot's behavior in offering of his daughters to the men of Sodom in Genesis 19:8 constitutes sexual abuse of his daughters, which created a confusion of kinship roles that was ultimately played out through the incestuous acts in Genesis 19:30–38.\n\nA number of commentators describe the actions of Lot's daughters as rape. Esther Fuchs suggests that the text presents Lot's daughters as the \"initiators and perpetrators of the incestuous 'rape'.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4646662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4646662", "title": "Nagarakretagama", "text": "Nagarakretagama\n\nThe Nagarakretagama or Nagarakrtagama, also known as Desawarñana or Deshavarñana, is an Old Javanese eulogy to Hayam Wuruk, a Javanese king of the Majapahit Empire. It was written on lontar as a \"kakawin\" by Mpu Prapanca in 1365 (1287 Saka year). The \"Nagarakretagama\" contains detailed descriptions of the Majapahit Empire during its greatest extent. The poem affirms the importance of Hindu–Buddhism in the Majapahit empire by describing temples and palaces and several ceremonial observances.\n\nIn 1894, the Dutch East Indies launched a military expedition against the Cakranegara royal house of Lombok. That year, the Dutch took the manuscript as part of the valuable \"Lombok treasure\", war-booty from the destroyed palace of Mataram-Cakranagara in Lombok. The first western scholar to study the manuscript was , a Dutch philologist. He accompanied the KNIL expedition to Lombok in 1894, and is credited with saving the valuable manuscripts collection of the Lombok royal library from being burnt in the chaos of the battle. A generation of Dutch scholars participated in translating the poem.\n\nMuch of its historical value was due to its having been the product of priestly activities directed at enhancing the magical powers of the ruler at the time. The manuscript is written on lontar leaves. It was held in the library of Leiden University in the Netherlands, with inventory code number L Or 5.023.\n\nAfter its translation in the early 20th century, the \"Nagarakretagama\" became an inspiration and foundation of the Indonesian independence movement.\n\nIn 1973 during the state visit of Queen Juliana to Indonesia, she returned the manuscript to Indonesia. Today it is held by the National Library of Indonesia, with inventory code number NB 9. In May 2008 UNESCO recognised the significance of the \"Nagarakretagama\" by naming it \"The Memory of the World - Regional Register for Asia/Pacific\", and finally registered it in 2013.\n\nHistorians have examined the poem for what it reveals of political history. In the canto 13 to 14, the poet Prapanca named several states within today's Indonesian borders. This suggested that those areas were within Majapahit spheres of influence. Prapanca said the states were subsumed by Majapahit or were vassal states.\n\nIn Canto 13, several lands on Sumatra are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: Jambi, Palembang, Teba (Muaro Tebo), and Dharmasraya. Also mentioned are Kandis, Kahwas, Minangkabau, Siak, Rokan, Kampar and Pane, Kampe, Haru (Aru Kingdom in coastal North Sumatra, today around Medan) and Mandailing. Tamiyang (Aceh Tamiang Regency), negara Perlak (Peureulak) and Padang Lawas, are noted in the west, together with Samudra (Samudra Pasai) and Lamuri, Batan (Bintan), Lampung, and Barus. Also listed are the states of Tanjungnegara (believed to be on Borneo): Kapuas Katingan, Sampit, Kota Lingga, Kota Waringin, Sambas, and Lawas.\n\nIn Canto 14 more lands are noted: Kadandangan, Landa, Samadang, Tirem, Sedu (Sarawak), Barune (Brunei), Kalka, Saludung (Manila), Solot (Sulu), Pasir, Barito, Sawaku, Tabalung, and Tanjung Kutei. In Hujung Medini (Malay Peninsula), Pahang is mentioned first. Next Langkasuka, Saimwang, Kelantan and Trengganu, Johor, Paka, Muar, Dungun, Tumasik (where Singapore is today), Kelang (Klang Valley) and Kedah, Jerai (Gunung Jerai), Kanjapiniran, all are united.\n\nAlso in Canto 14 are territories east of Java: Badahulu and Lo Gajah (part of today's Bali). Gurun and Sukun, Taliwang, Sapi (Sape town, east end of Sumbawa island, by the Sape Strait) and Dompo, Sang Hyang Api, Bima. Hutan Kadali (Buru island). Gurun island, and Lombok Merah. Together with prosperous Sasak (central, north and east Lombok) are already ruled. Bantayan with Luwu. Further east are Udamakatraya (Sangir and Talaud). Also mentioned are Makassar, Buton, Banggai, Kunir, Galiao with Selayar, Sumba, Solot, Muar. Also Wanda(n) (Banda island), Ambon or Maluku islands, Kai-islands (Ewab Ohoi-Ewur Mas-Il Larvul-Ngabal-istiadat), Wanin (Onin peninsula, today Fakfak Regency, West Papua), Seran, Timor and other islands.\n\nThe manuscript describes the capital city of Majapahit. According to the account of Prapanca in the Nagarakretagama poem, the royal compound was surrounded by a thick, high wall of red brick. Nearby was the fortified guard post. The main gate into the palace was located in the north wall, and was entered through huge doors of decorated iron. Outside the north gate was a long building where courtiers met once a year, a market place, and a sacred crossroads. Just inside the north gate was a courtyard containing religious buildings. On the western side of this courtyard were pavilions surrounded by canals where people bathed. At the south end a gate led to rows of houses set on terraces in which palace servants lived. Another gate led to a third courtyard crowded with houses and a great hall for those waiting to be admitted into the ruler's presence. The king's own quarters, which lay to the east of this courtyard, had pavilions on decorated red brick bases, ornately carved wooden pillars, and a roof decorated with clay ornaments. Outside the palace were quarters for Shiva priests, Buddhists, and other members of the nobility. Further away, and separated from the palace by open fields, were more royal compounds, including that of the chief minister Gajah Mada.\n\nIn the poem, Prapanca recounted Hayam Wuruk's religious observances in the Candi Singhasari, in which he entered the sanctuary and performed the \"puspa\" ceremony for his great-grandfather Kertanegara. After the visit, he went to Kagenengan to perform worship to the founder of the Singhasari kingdom, Rajasa.\nPrapanca told details of the \"sraddha\" ceremony, performed to honour the soul of a deceased. He described specifically the ceremony for the Queen Grandmother's soul, Gayatri Rajapatni, who had died twelve years earlier. In the canto 63, stanza 4, Prapanca narrated the preparation of the ceremony by the court artisans. During the ceremony, lion thrones were erected, where priests placed a flower effigy (\"puspa\") symbolising the soul of the Queen Grandmother. The descent of the soul to earth and its final placement in the \"puspa\" were narrated in canto 64, stanza 5.\n\nThe ceremony lasted for seven days. Colorful pageants crowded the main courtyard. The whole ceremony was performed to please the Rajapatni's soul in hopes that her favour would shine on the reign of her descendants. The posthumous ceremony continued and the king ordered the repair of the Kamal Pundak sanctuary to enact a new holy shrine (\"candi\") for the Queen Grandmother, deified as the \"Prajnaparamita\".\n\n\"Nagarakretagama\" was written as a \"puja sastra\", a genre of Old Javanese literature of adoration and reverence, directed mainly to King Hayam Wuruk. Prapanca did not shy away to expressed his admiration, even bordering somewhat a cult, since he often invoked a divine quality of the king and his royal family. Nevertheless, the work seems to be independent of court's patronage since Prapanca wrote them incognito after he retired from the court.\n\nOne of the religious practices of the Majapahit royal family was the \"royal walkabout\". They visited cornerstones of the empire and paid homage to the ancestors of the king. The poem also describes the death of Hayam Wuruk's most trusted regent, Gajah Mada.\n\nThe Queen Grandmother Rajapatni had a special place in Prapanca's poem. In one stanza, the poem describes the Queen Grandmother as \"chattra ning rat wisesa\" (the eminent protector of the world). Rajapatni was the progenitor of the Majapahit kingdom, because she was the daughter of Kertanegara, the last king of the \"Singhasari\" kingdom, and she was also the wife of Raden Wijaya, the founder of Majapahit. Thus she was seen as the protector of the world. The Queen Grandmother is said in the poem to embody the \"Pramabhagavati\"; \"Bhagavati\" is another name of Prajnaparamita (the Goddess of Wisdom in Mahayana).\n\nThe poem portrays \"Kertanegara\" as a staunch Buddhist, described as \"submissive at the Feet of the Illustrious \"Shakya-Lion\"\". Upon his death, the poem describes the deification of Kertanegara in three forms: a splendid Jina, an Ardhanarishvara, and an imposing Shiva-Buddha. Particularly for the Shiva–Buddha deity, Prapanca praises him as \"the honoured Illustrious Protector of Mountains, Protector of the protectorless. He is surely, Ruler over the rulers of the world\". The Shiva–Buddha deity is neither Shiva nor Buddha, but the Lord of the Mountains, or the Supreme God of the Realm. This religious belief is indigenous to the Javanese people who combined the gods of two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, into the same God, the oneness of the \"dharma\", as is written in the \"Kakawin Sutasoma\" (see Bhinneka Tunggal Ika). When Kertanegara was deified as Shiva–Buddha, he symbolised the collective powers of the God of the Realm.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43552793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43552793", "title": "Our Lady of Pellevoisin", "text": "Our Lady of Pellevoisin\n\nOur Lady of Pellevoisin is a series of Marian apparitions in Pellevoisin, in the province of Berry, in the department of Indre, France. It is west of Châteauroux in the Catholic Archdiocese of Bourges.\n\nIn 1876, a domestic servant, Estelle Faguette, claimed to receive a series of fifteen apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary and recovered from a serious illness, tuberculosis. In 1983, Archbishop Paul Vignancour of Bourges formally declared the cure to be inexplicable in the light of medical science and that her cure could rightly be regarded as a miracle by Catholics.\n\nFollowing authorization by the Archbishop of Bourges in 1877, Estelle's bedroom was transformed into an oratory. Pellevoisin rapidly became a place of pilgrimage, the shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin. The Catholic Church has never made a formal pronouncement on pilgrimages of the alleged apparitions, but Pope Leo XIII encouraged the pilgrimages by approving indulgences to pilgrims, and also approved related devotions to Our Lady.\n\nA distinctive feature of the reported events of Pellevoisin is the request to use a Scapular of the Sacred Heart.\n\nEstelle Faguette was born 12 September 1843 at Saint-Memmie near Châlons-sur-Marne and joined the Children of Mary at the age of 14. She entered an order of Augustinian nursing sisters, but left while still a novice, she tripped and fell on a staircase; although the sprain seemed trivial at first, two weeks later, her leg was immobilised and doctors considered amputation. On 15 September 1863, Estelle reluctantly accepted that she could not pursue the life of a nursing sister and returned to her parents’ home.\n\nAt the time of the apparitions, Pellevoisin was the commercial centre for around a thousand citizens under the authority of the village mayor, Comte de la Rochefoucauld. His wife employed Estelle Faguette as a domestic servant and nursemaid at their residence near Pellevoisin, the Château de Poiriers-Montbel. A woman of fragile health, after numerous years in service, Estelle was dying of tuberculosis at the age of 33.\n\nWith childlike faith, Estelle composed a letter to the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she asked for a cure. The letter was laid at the feet of a statue of the Virgin in Montbel, the summer chateau of the Rochefoucaulds, about 3 km from Pellevoisin.\n\nIn February 1876, the Countess had to travel to Paris but arranged for accommodation to be made available for Estelle in a house close to the parish church in Pellevoisin. Unable to consume anything except liquids, Estelle received the sacrament of Extreme Unction. On 14 February, her physician judged that she had only hours left to live.\n\nDuring the night of that same day, Estelle reported experiencing the presence of the Virgin Mary for the first time, who told her that she must suffer for five more days in honour of the five wounds of Christ. At the end of the five days, Estelle would die or be cured; and if she lived, she would obliged to make known ‘Mary’s glory’.\n\nOn the following four nights the Blessed Virgin again appeared to Estelle. On Tuesday, she said: 'If my son grants you life, it will be a blessing for you.' On Wednesday, she said, 'I am all-merciful and the mistress of my Son. Your good deed, fervant prayers and little letter have touched my motherly heart'.\nOn Friday night, Mary did not come and stand at the foot of the bed, as on the previous nights, but drew close to her. She showed Estelle the plaque which she must have placed as a thanksgiving, bearing the words: 'I called upon Mary in the depths of my misery. She obtained for me, from her Son, my complete cure.' The plaque was not plain white, but had a golden rose on each corner, and at the top, a heart on fire, crowned with roses, pierced by a sword. Indeed, on Saturday, Estelle was cured when she received Holy Communion. Immediately she was able to eat and drink normally, and within a few days, she resumed domestic and gardening duties with no sign of fatigue.\n\nThe next three apparitions occurred on three consecutive days in July, Saturday 1st - Monday 3rd. 'My son’s heart is so full of love that he will not refuse my demands. I have chosen this particular place for the conversion of sinners. I would like you to remain very peaceful about this!'\nThe Blessed Virgin returned in September (Saturday 9, Sunday 10, Friday 15). On 9 September, the lady drew attention to a small scapular she was wearing. Estelle had seen it there before, as plain white cloth, but on this day it bore the red image of a heart. 'This devotion pleases me', Mary said, and then,'It is here that I shall be honoured'. The lady next appeared on 15 September, speaking of her concern for the Catholic Church in France.\n\nThree further visions followed in November (Wednesday 1, All Saints' Day; Sunday 5; Saturday 11). On 11 November, Estelle set about making a replica of the scapular which she had seen the lady wearing. On the last of these the Virgin told Estelle 'You have been working for me'.\n\nThe final and culminating vision took place on Friday 8 December 1876, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nEstelle died in Pellevoisin on 23 August 1929, a few weeks short of her 87th birthday.\n\nInitial enquiries were carried out by Mgr de La Tour d'Auvergne, Archbishop of Bourges.\n\nOn 30 April 1876, with the permission of the Archbishop, she had an ex voto plaque of thanksgiving placed in the parish church. On December 8, her bedroom was transformed into an oratory. A few days later, the Archbishop received her for an interview and granted permission for her to make and distribute copies of the Scapular of the Sacred Heart.\n\nIn 1877, he set up an enquiry and interviewed 56 persons who knew Estelle; apart from one who preferred not to comment, all spoke favourably. A second enquiry was conducted in December 1878, with similar results.\n\nA confraternity of the All-merciful Mother was erected on 28 July 1877 but no mention was made of Pellevoisin in connection with its approval (but there was reference to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque was referred to). The statutes were approved on August 27.\n\nIn 1892, Pope Leo XIII offered two signs of favour to the shrine: awarding a candle, and declaring certain indulgences for pilgrims who visited it. On 8 May 1894, he raised the confraternity to the status of 'honorary Archconfraternity' and, on 12 May 1896, to 'effective Archconfraternity'. The Pope received her herself in audiences on 30 January and 17–18 February 1900, during which he agreed that the relevant Vatican department, the Congregation of Rites, should consider authorising use of the Scapular of the Sacred Heart. Formal recognition was given on 4 April 1900.\n\nIn 1893, Archbishop Boyer invited the Dominican Friars to establish a monastery in a house close to her chapel.\n\nIn April 1897, Monsignor Servonnet became Archbishop of Bourges. The same year, on 14 October, he renewed permissions given by his predecessors for information about the shrine to be published. In 1899, following numerous petitions from France and Canada, he opened a third canonical enquiry, which again found her to be a credible witness.\n\nOn 16 April 1903, Madame de la Rochefoucauld, who still had administrative rights over the property containing the chapel which had been her bedroom, closed it to the public. The annual pilgrimage still took place on 9 September 1903 with a crowd gathering at the railings of the property; 40 police officers attended. On 19 July 1905, Archbishop Servonnet issued an order that crowds must not gather in front of the chapel.\n\nOn 17 October 1915, Pope Benedict XV commented that Our Lady had chosen Pellevoisin as a privileged place to dispense her graces.\n\nOn 22 December 1922, the Congregation of Rites authorised a votive Mass of Our Lady of Pellevoisin to be celebrated on 9 September in the parish church and adjoining monastery.\n\nOn 7 June 1936, by the hand of Cardinal Pacelli (later to become Pope Pius XII), Pius XI sent a painting of Our Lady of Pellevoisin as a gift to the Dominican community.\n\nOn 7 December 1981, Archbishop Paul Vignancour established a medical commission to examine the apparently miraculous cure. On 6 September 1982, having received its report that the cure was still inexplicable in the light of current medical science, the Archbishop established a theological commission to consider whether this cure might appropriately be called 'miraculous'. On 4 September 1983, while speaking at the annual pilgrimage to Pellevoisin, he announced the commission's findings that the cure had a 'miraculous character'. That was formally confirmed, in writing, on 8 September.\n\nOn 19 September 1984, an Imprimatur was granted for a novena to Our Lady of Pellevoisin.\n\nThe Shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin was under the care of the Dominicans for 105 years from 1895, but since 1998, it has been served by friars and sisters of the Community of St Jean. A community of contemplative sisters form the Monastery of the Merciful Mother, and the friars form the Priory of St Mary Magdalen. The main spiritual activities are daily Mass at 11:30, a weekend celebrating God's mercy around the Second Sunday of Easter each year (Divine Mercy Sunday in the Roman Catholic Church) and the annual pilgrimage on the last weekend in August. Pilgrimages by groups and individuals are welcome throughout the year.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "244219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244219", "title": "Shapeshifting", "text": "Shapeshifting\n\nIn mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability of a being or creature to transform its physical form or shape. This is usually achieved through an inherent ability of a mythological creature, divine intervention or the use of magic. The idea of shapeshifting is present in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest extant literature and epic poems, including works such as the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" and the \"Iliad\", where the shapeshifting is usually induced by the act of a deity.\n\nThe idea persisted through the Middle Ages, where the agency causing shapeshifting is usually a sorcerer or witch, and into the modern period. It remains a common trope in modern fantasy, children's literature and works of popular culture. The most common form of shapeshifting myths is that of therianthropy, which is the transformation of a human being into an animal or conversely, of an animal into human form. Legends allow for transformations into plants and objects and the assumption of another human countenance (e.g. fair to ugly).\n\nPopular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), the huli jing of East Asia (including the Japanese kitsune and Korean kumiho), and the gods, goddesses, and demons of numerous mythologies, such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and such creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. Therianthropy is the more general term for human-animal shifts, but it is rarely used in that capacity. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants.\n\nOther terms for shapeshifters include metamorph, the Navajo skin-walker, mimic, and therianthrope. The prefix \"were-,\" coming from the Old English word for \"man\" (masculine rather than generic), is also used to designate shapeshifters; despite its root, it is used to indicate female shapeshifters as well.\n\nWhile the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.\n\nExamples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Circe's transforming of Odysseus' men to pigs in Homer's \"The Odyssey\", and Apuleius's Lucius becoming a donkey in \"The Golden Ass\". Proteus was noted among the gods for his shapeshifting; both Menelaus and Aristaeus seized him to win information from him, and succeeded only because they held on during his various changes. Nereus told Heracles where to find the Apples of the Hesperides for the same reason.\n\nThe Titan Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, she was so proud, that her husband, Zeus, tricked her into changing into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father's head, fully grown, and in battle armor.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them.\n\nWhile the Greek gods could use transformation punitively – such as Medusa, turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse with Poseidon in Athena's temple – even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. Zeus repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:\n\nVertumnus transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to Pomona's orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him.\n\nIn other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from rape, and was transformed (Daphne into laurel, Cornix into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods' shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed.\n\nIn one tale, Demeter transformed herself into a mare to escape Poseidon, but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. Caenis, having been raped by Poseidon, demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became Caeneus, a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death.\n\nAs a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, Baucis and Philemon were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees.\n\nIn some variants of the tale of Narcissus, he is turned into a narcissus flower.\n\nAfter Tereus raped Philomela and cut out her tongue to silence her, she wove her story into a tapestry for her sister, Tereus's wife Procne, and the sisters murdered his son and fed him to his father. When he discovered this, he tried to kill them, but the gods changed them all into birds.\n\nSometimes metamorphoses transformed objects into humans. In the myths of both Jason and Cadmus, one task set to the hero was to sow dragon's teeth; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. Cadmus is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. Pygmalion fell in love with Galatea, a statue he had made. Aphrodite had pity on him and transformed the stone to a living woman.\n\nFairies, witches, and wizards were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the spriggans, and others to a few forms and other fairies might have only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called \"glamour,\" to create illusions. But others, such as the Hedley Kow, could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others.\n\nWitches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.\n\nMany British fairy tales, such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\" and \"The Black Bull of Norroway\", feature shapeshifting.\n\nPwyll was transformed by Arawn into Arawn's own shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll's, so that they could trade places for a year and a day.\n\nLlwyd ap Cil Coed transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turned himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom.\n\nMath and Gwydion transform flowers into a woman named Blodeuwedd, and when she betrays her husband Lleu, who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl.\n\nGilfaethwy committed rape with help from his brother Gwydion. Both were transformed into animals, for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys.\n\nGwion, having accidentally taken some of wisdom potion that Ceridwen was brewing for her son, fled her through a succession of changes that she answered with changes of her own, ending with his being eaten, a grain of corn, by her as a hen. She became pregnant, and he was reborn in a new form, as Taliesin.\n\nTales abound about the selkie, a seal that can remove its skin to make contact with humans for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist's foundation myths include of a union between the founder of the clan and a shapeshifting selkie. Another such creature is the Scottish selkie, which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In \"The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\" the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies.\nScottish mythology features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans. Water spirits such as the each uisge, which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man. Other tales include kelpies who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman in order to ensnare and kill weary travelers. Tam Lin, a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown him into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is a common thread in folktales.\n\nPerhaps the best known Irish myth is that of Aoife who turned her stepchildren, the Children of Lir, into swans to be rid of them. Likewise in the Wooing of Etain Fuamnach jealously turns Étaín into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of Tuan mac Cairill, the only survivor of Partholón's settlement of Ireland. In his centuries long life he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk and finally a salmon prior to being eaten and (as in the Wooing of Étaín) reborn as a human.\n\nThe Púca is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms.\n\nSadhbh, the wife of the famous hero Fionn mac Cumhaill was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich.\n\nIn the Lokasenna, Odin and Loki taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th century Edda relates Loki taking the form of a mare to bear Odin's steed Sleipnir which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear Fenrir.\n\nSvipdagr angered Odin, who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess Freyja, refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdag, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went. In the \"Hyndluljóð\", Freyja transformed her protégé Óttar into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion.\n\nThe Volsunga saga contains many shapeshifting characters. Siggeir's mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, Sigmund, survived, he and his nephew and son Sinfjötli killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become werewolves.\n\nThe dwarf Andvari is described as being able to magically turn into a pike. Alberich, his counterpart in Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", using the Tarnhelm, takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/Wotan.\n\nFafnir was originally a dwarf, a giant or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants he transformed into a dragon—a symbol of greed—while guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, Ótr, enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki.\n\nIn Scandinavia, there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge monster half human and half wolf. If a female at midnight stretches the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras.\n\nThe Nisse is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to Huldra.\n\nGunnhild, Mother of Kings (\"Gunnhild konungamóðir\") (c. 910  –  c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the Icelandic Sagas, according to which she was the wife of Eric Bloodaxe, was credited with magic powers - including the power of shapeshifting \nand turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel \"Mother of Kings\" by Poul Anderson, which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting abilities.\n\nIn Poland, in the parish church of Schwarzenstein, hang two horse-shoes related to the story of the tavern-keeper of Eichmedian. A greedy woman, she charged double the honest rate for board and lodging. Late one evening, a group of guests accused her of cheating them. Defending herself, she swore an oath before them, saying: \"If my business is not just, then ride my back the Devil must!\"\n\nThe room suddenly darkened and the Devil suddenly appeared before her. He gestured, and unable to resist, she knelt on all fours and found herself changing into a bay mare. The Devil mounted, gave a great laugh and rode her out of the village. At headlong speed he rode to the town of Schwarzenstein, and to a blacksmith's shop there, arriving in the small hours of the morning. He roused the blacksmith and demanded that his steed be shod at once. The blacksmith, yawning, complained of the late hour and that his forge was shut down and cold. But the Devil insisted and promised gold if it were done swiftly, and so the blacksmith agreed. He lit his furnace, and had the Devil work the bellows. The blacksmith had not long begun his work however when the mare began to speak, evidently having worked out how to form human words with her equine lips. \"Don't you know me?\" she begged. \"It is I, the tavern-keeper of Eichmedian!\" The blacksmith was horrified and nothing could persuade him to continue with the shoeing. The Devil raged but there was nothing he could do, and as a cock heralded the arrival of dawn, the spell was broken. The Devil vanished and the tavern-keeper returned to her human form. Repenting of her greedy ways, she had the two horse-shoes which the smith had already fashioned nailed up in the church as a warning to other cheats.\n\nIn Armenian mythology, shapeshifters include the \"Nhang\", a serpent-like river monster than can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial \"Shahapet\", a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.\n\nAncient Indian mythology tells of Nāga, snakes that can sometimes assume human form. Scriptures describe shapeshifting Rakshasa (demons) assuming animal forms to deceive humans. The \"Ramayana\" also includes the Vanara, a group of ape-like humanoids who possessed supernatural powers and could change their shapes.\n\nIn the Indian fable \"The Dog Bride\" from Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas, a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes.\n\nPhilippine mythology includes \"aswang\", a vampire-like monster capable of transforming itself into either a large black dog or a black boar in order to stalk humans at night. The folklore also mentions other beings such as \"kapre\", \"tikbalang\", and \"engkanto\", which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens. Also, talismans (called \"\"anting-anting\" or \"birtud\"\" in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift. In one tale, \"Chonguita the Monkey Wife\", a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man.\n\nTatar folklore includes Yuxa, a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men in order to have children.\n\nChinese mythology contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the huli jing, a fox spirit which usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. \"Madame White Snake\" is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials that she and her husband faced.\n\nIn Japanese folklore ōbake are a type of yōkai with the ability to shapeshift. The fox, or kitsune is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the bakeneko, the mujina and the tanuki.\n\nKorean mythology also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the kumiho is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho. The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human).\n\nIn Somali mythology \"Qori ismaris\" (\"One who rubs himself with a stick\") was a man who could transform himself into a \"Hyena-man\" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.\n\nThe Ligahoo or loup-garou is the shapeshifter of Trinidad and Tobago's folklore. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old creole families, and is usually associated with witch-doctors and practitioners of African magic.\nThe name of the Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): \"Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)\", from \"nahuel\", \"puma (or jaguar)\", and \"huapí\", \"island\". There is, however, more to the word \"Nahuel\" - it can also signify \"a man who by sorcery has been transformed into a puma\" (or jaguar).\n\n\nShapeshifting may be used as a plot device, such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast's transformation in \"Beauty and the Beast\" indicates Belle's ability to accept him despite his appearance.\nWhen a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is \"bound\" to the new form. In extreme cases, such as petrifaction, the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible.\n\nExamples of this are in fairy tales. A prince who is forced into a bear's shape (as in \"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\") is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear's shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in \"The She-Bear\") escapes with her new shape. In the Earthsea books, Ursula K. Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard's mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example for a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis.\nBeyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as Italo Calvino's \"The Canary Prince\" is a Rapunzel variant in which shapeshifting is used to gain access to the tower.\n\nIn many cases, imposed forms are punitive in nature. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths (as in many of the Metamorphoses) or produce origin myths.\nIn many fairy tales and ballads, as in Child Ballad #44, \"The Twa Magicians\" or \"Farmer Weathersky\", a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with other shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk, and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing.\n\nThe Grimm Brothers fairy tale \"Foundling-Bird\" contains this as the bulk of the plot. In the Italian Campania Fables collection of \"Pentamerone\" by Gianbattista Basile, tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes in a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect.\n\nIn other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale \"The Master Maid\", where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles. This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.\n\nIn fairy tales of the Aarne–Thompson type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in \"The Grateful Prince\", \"King Kojata\", \"Foundling-Bird\", \"Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter\", or \"The Two Kings' Children\") or an obstacle chase (as in \"The Battle of the Birds\", \"The White Dove\", or \"The Master Maid\").\n\nIn a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift in order to break a hold on him. Proteus and Nereus's shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them. Tam Lin, once seized by Janet, was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe, and Patricia A. McKillip references it in her \"Riddle-Master trilogy\": a shapeshifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it.\n\nOne motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears in order to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about.\n\nIn many fairy tales, the hero's talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in \"The Three Enchanted Princes\" and \"The Death of Koschei the Deathless\", the hero's three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.\n\nIn an early Mayan text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, has the ability to change his appearance and to manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens, and lived together for eternity.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" has been interpreted as a young woman's coming-of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry.\n\nSome shapeshifters are able to change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In \"Bisclavret\" by Marie de France, a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. The most common use of this motif, however, is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include swan maidens and the Japanese \"tennin\".\n\nThe power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology, and the inversion of the \"liberation\" theme, as in Dr Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde.\n\nSome transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place, so that the transformer can usurp it. Bisclaveret's wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in \"The Wonderful Birch\", changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer so as to put her daughter in the queen's place. In the Korean \"Transformation of the Kumiho\", a kumiho, a fox with magical powers, transformed itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In \"Brother and Sister\", when two children flee their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. \"The Six Swans\" are transformed into swans by their stepmother, as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology.\n\nMany fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised wishes to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them. At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. \"Hans My Hedgehog\" was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: Giambattista Basile included in his \"Pentamerone\" the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and Italo Calvino, in his \"Italian Folktales\", a girl born as an apple.\n\nSometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one, but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in the transformed birth. In \"Prince Lindworm\", the woman eats two onions, but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a lindworm. In \"Tatterhood\", a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one.\n\nLess commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. \"The Seven Ravens\" are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them. In \"Puddocky\", when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise.\n\nSuch wished-for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.\n\nThe heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady; although he was told that this was half-way, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely. In \"Tatterhood\", Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn't ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. Puddocky is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in Child ballad 34, \"Kemp Owyne\", where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times.\n\nSometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. \"Hans My Hedgehog\", \"The Donkey\" and \"The Pig King\" fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in \"Prince Lindworm\", the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.\n\nIn some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period of time not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in \"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\"), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals' skins. In \"The Brown Bear of Norway\", \"The Golden Crab\", \"The Enchanted Snake\" and some variants of \"The Frog Princess\", burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other.\n\nGhosts sometimes appear in animal form. In \"The Famous Flower of Serving-Men\", the heroine's murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In \"The White and the Black Bride\" and \"The Three Little Men in the Wood\", the murdered – drowned – true bride reappears as a white duck. In \"The Rose Tree\" and \"The Juniper Tree\", the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form.\n\nIn some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in \"Beauty and Pock Face\", \"A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers\", and \"The Boys with the Golden Stars\". This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain.\n\nSimilarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In \"The Wounded Lion\", the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into water. Less drastic but no less apparently fatal, the fox in \"The Golden Bird\", the foals in \"The Seven Foals\", and the cats in \"Lord Peter\" and \"The White Cat\" tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape. In the Greek tale of Scylla, Scylla's father Nisus turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9761047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9761047", "title": "Shia–Sunni relations", "text": "Shia–Sunni relations\n\nShia Islam are the two major denominations of Islam. They chose sides following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in AD 632. A dispute over succession to Islamic prophet Muhammad as a caliph of the Islamic community spread across various parts of the world, which led to the Battle of Jamal and Battle of Siffin. The dispute intensified greatly after the Battle of Karbala, in which Hussein ibn Ali-A and his household were killed by the ruling Umayyad Caliph Yazid I, and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community.\n\nThe present demographic breakdown between the two denominations is difficult to assess and varies by source, but a good approximation is that 85% of the world's Muslims are Sunni and 10% are Shia, with most Shias belonging to the Twelver tradition and the rest divided between many other groups. Sunnis are a majority in most Muslim communities: in Southeast Asia, China, South Asia, Africa, and most of the Arab world. Shia make up the majority of the citizen population in Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, Iran and Azerbaijan, as well as being a politically significant minority in Pakistan, Syria and Yemen. Azerbaijan is predominantly Shia; however, practicing adherents are far fewer.\n\nToday, there are differences in religious practice, traditions, and customs, often related to jurisprudence. Although all Muslim groups consider the Quran to be divine, Sunni and Shia have different opinions on hadith.\n\nIn recent years, Sunni–Shia relations have been increasingly marked by conflict, particularly the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict. Sectarian violence persists to this day from Pakistan to Yemen and is a major element of friction throughout the Middle East and South Asia. Tensions between communities have intensified during power struggles, such as the Bahraini uprising, the Iraq War, and most recently the Syrian Civil War and in the formation of the self-styled Islamic State of Iraq and Syria that has launched a genocide against Shias.\n\nSunnis are a majority in most Muslim communities in champion, China, South Asia, Africa, most of the Arab World, and among Muslims in the United States (of which 85–90% are Sunnis). This can also be confusing because the majority of Arab Muslims in the United States are Shia, while the majority of Arab Americans are Christians, the conflation of Arab and Muslim being quite common.\n\nShias make up the majority of the Muslim population in Iran (around 95%), Azerbaijan (around 90%), Iraq (around 75%) and Bahrain (around 70%). Minority communities are also found in Yemen where over 47% of the population are Shia (mostly of the Zaidi sect), according to the UNHCR. Others put the numbers of Shias at 30%. About 15–20% of Turkey's population belong to the Alevi sect. The Shia constitute around 30–40% of Kuwait, 45–55% of the Muslim population in Lebanon, 25% of Saudi Arabia, 12% of Syria, and 20–25% of Pakistan. Around 15–20% of Afghanistan, less than 75% of the Muslims in Nigeria, and around 5% of population of Tajikistan are Shia.\n\nThe Mahdi is the prophesied redeemer of Islam. While Shias and Sunnis differ on the nature of the Mahdi, many members of both groups believe that the Mahdi will appear at the end of the world to bring about a perfect and just Islamic society.\n\nIn Shia Islam \"the Mahdi symbol has developed into a powerful and central religious idea.\" Twelvers believe the Mahdi will be Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Imam returned from the Occultation, where he has been hidden by Allah since 874. In contrast, mainstream Sunnis believe the Mahdi will be named Muhammad, be a descendant of Muhammad, and will revive the faith, but will not necessarily be connected with the end of the world.\n\nThe Shias accept some of the same \"hadiths\" used by Sunnis as part of the \"sunnah\" to argue their case. In addition, they consider the sayings of \"Ahl al-Bayt\" that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shias do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology can be proven of how they were recorded. Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example is that because of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for four years only, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and Ali each.\n\nShiism and Sufism are said to share a number of hallmarks: Belief in an inner meaning to the Quran, special status for some mortals (saints for Sufi, Imams for Shias), as well as veneration of Ali and Muhammad's family.\n\nThe Five Pillars of Islam (Arabic: أركان الإسلام) is the term given to the five duties incumbent on every Muslim. These duties are \"Shahada\" (profession of faith), salat (prayers), \"Zakāt\" (giving of alms), \"Sawm\" (fasting, specifically during Ramadan) and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). These five practices are essential to Sunni and Shia Muslims. Shia theology has two concepts that define religion as a whole. There are Roots of Religion (\"Usūl al-Dīn\") and Branches of Religion (\"Furu al Din\").\n\nMany distinctions can be made between Sunnis and Shiaīs through observation alone:\n\nWhen prostrating during ritual prayer (\"salat\"), Shias place their forehead onto a piece of naturally occurring material, most often a clay tablet (\"mohr\"), soil (\"turbah\") at times from Karbala, the place where Hussein ibn Ali was martyred, instead of directly onto prayer rug.\n\nSome Shia perform prayers back to back, sometimes worshipping two times consecutively (1+2+2 i.e. \"fajr\" on its own \"Dhuhr\" with \"Asr\" and \"Maghrib\" with \"Isha'\"), thus praying five times a day but with a very small break in between the prayer, instead of five prayers with at some gap between them as required by Sunni schools of law.\n\nShias and the followers of the Sunni Maliki school hold their hands at their sides during prayer; Sunnis of other schools cross their arms (right over left) and clasp their hands; it is commonly held by Sunni scholars especially of Maliki school that either is acceptable.\n\nTwelver Shia as the main branch of Shia Islam permit \"Nikah mut‘ah\"—fixed-term temporary marriage—which is not acceptable within the Sunni community, the Ismaili Shia or the Zaidi Shia and is believed a planned and agreed fornication. Twelvers believe that Mutah was permitted until Umar forbade it during his rule. Mutah is not the same as \"Misyar\" marriage or \" 'Arfi\" marriage, which has no date of expiration and is permitted by some Sunnis. A Misyar marriage differs from a conventional Islamic marriage in that the man does not have financial responsibility of the woman by her own free will. The man can divorce the woman whenever he wants to in a Misyar marriage.\n\nBoth Sunni and Shia women wear the \"hijab\". Devout women of the Shia traditionally wear black and yellow as do some Sunni women in the Persian Gulf. Some Shia religious leaders also wear a black robe. Mainstream Shia and Sunni women wear the \"hijab\" differently. Some Sunni scholars emphasize covering of all body including the face in public whereas some scholars exclude the face from hijab. Shias believe that the hijab must cover around the perimeter of the face and up to the chin. Like Sunnis, some Shia women, such as those in Iran and Iraq, use their hand to hold the black \"chador\", in order to cover their faces when in public.\n\nShia are sometimes recognizable by their names, which are often derived from the names of Ahl al-Bayt. In particular, the names Fatima, Zaynab, Ali, Abbas, Hussein, and Hassan are disproportionately common among Shias, though they may also be used by Sunnis. Umar, Uthman, Abu Bakr, Aisha, Muawiya, being the names of figures recognized by Sunnis but not Shias, are commonly used as names for Sunnis but are very rare, if not virtually absent, for Shias.\n\nThe Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by a new dynasty, the Abbasids. The first Abbasid caliph, As-Saffah, recruited Shia support in his campaign against the Umayyads by emphasising his blood relationship to Muhammad's household through descent from his uncle, ‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. The Shia also believe that he promised them that the Caliphate, or at least religious authority, would be vested in the Shia Imam. As-Saffah assumed both the temporal and religious mantle of Caliph himself. He continued the Umayyad dynastic practice of succession, and his brother al-Mansur succeeded him in 754.\n\nJa'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shia Imam, died during al-Mansur's reign, and there were claims that he was murdered on the orders of the caliph. (However, Abbasid persecution of Islamic lawyers was not restricted to the Shia. Abū Ḥanīfa, for example, was imprisoned by al-Mansur and tortured.)\n\nShia sources further claim that by the orders of the tenth Abassid caliph, al-Mutawakkil, the tomb of the third Imam, Hussein ibn Ali in Karbala, was completely demolished, and Shias were sometimes beheaded in groups, buried alive, or even placed alive within the walls of government buildings still under construction.\n\nThe Shia believe that their community continued to live for the most part in hiding and followed their religious life secretly without external manifestations.\n\nMany Shia Iranians migrated to what is now Iraq in the 16th century. \"It is said that when modern Iraq was formed, some of the population of Karbala was Iranian\". In time, these immigrants adopted the Arabic language and Arab identity, but their origin has been used to \"unfairly cast them as lackeys of Iran\". However many of these Shias come from Sayyid families with origins in tribes from Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain, one of said tribes being al-Musawi, and two prevalent families that are descended from it and lived in Iran for some time before settling in Iraq are the al-Qazwini and al-Shahristani families. Other Iraqi Shias are ethnic Arabs with roots in Iraq as deep as those of their Sunni counterparts.\n\nShafi'i Sunnism was the dominant form of Islam in most of Iran until rise of the Safavid Empire although a significant undercurrent of Ismailism and a very large minority of Twelvers were present all over Persia.\n\nThe Sunni hegemony did not undercut the Shia presence in Iran. The writers of the Shia Four Books were Iranian, as were many other great scholars. According to Morteza Motahhari:\n\nThe domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaidis of Tabaristan, the Buwayhid, the rule of the Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. 1304–1316) and the Sarbedaran. Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, Twelver and Zaidi Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, the Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufa, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Al Hillah. Shia were dominant in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar. In many other areas the population of Shias and Sunni was mixed.\n\nThe first Zaidi state was established in Daylaman and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864 by the Alavids; it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the Samanids in 928. Roughly forty years later the state was revived in Gilan (north-western Iran) and survived under Hasanid leaders until 1126. After which from the 12th-13th centuries, the Zaidis of Daylaman, Gilan and Tabaristan then acknowledge the Zaidi Imams of Yemen or rival Zaidi Imams within Iran.\n\nThe Buyids, who were Zaidi and had a significant influence not only in the provinces of Persia but also in the capital of the caliphate in Baghdad, and even upon the caliph himself, provided a unique opportunity for the spread and diffusion of Shia thought. This spread of Shiism to the inner circles of the government enabled the Shia to withstand those who opposed them by relying upon the power of the caliphate.\n\nTwelvers came to Iran from Arab regions in the course of four stages. First, through the Asharis tribe at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century. Second through the pupils of Sabzevar, and especially those of Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, who were from Rey and Sabzawar and resided in those cities. Third, through the school of Hillah under the leadership of Al-Hilli and his son Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin. Fourth, through the scholars of Jabal Amel residing in that region, or in Iraq, during the 16th and 17th centuries who later migrated to Iran.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ismaili da‘wah (\"missionary institution\") sent missionaries (\"du‘āt\", sg. \"dā‘ī\") during the Fatimid Caliphate to Persia. When the Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in northern Persia. Hassan-i Sabbah conquered fortresses and captured Alamut in 1090. Nizaris used this fortress until the Mongols finally seized and destroyed it in 1256.\n\nAfter the Mongols and the fall of the Abbasids, the Sunni Ulama suffered greatly. In addition to the destruction of the caliphate there was no official Sunni school of law. Many libraries and madrasahs were destroyed and Sunni scholars migrated to other Islamic areas such as Anatolia and Egypt. In contrast, most Shia were largely unaffected as their center was not in Iran at this time. For the first time, the Shia could openly convert other Muslims to their movement.\n\nSeveral local Shia dynasties like the Marashi and Sarbadars were established during this time. The kings of the Kara Koyunlu dynasty ruled in Tabriz with a domain extending to Fars and Kerman. In Egypt the Fatimid government ruled.\n\nMuhammad Khudabandah, the famous builder of Soltaniyeh, was among the first of the Mongols to convert to Shiaism, and his descendants ruled for many years in Persia and were instrumental in spreading Shī‘ī thought. Sufism played a major role in spread of Shiism in this time.\nIsmail I initiated a religious policy to recognize Shiism as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran and Azerbaijan remain majority-Shia states is a direct result of Ismail's actions.\n\nUnfortunately for Ismail, most of his subjects were Sunni. He thus had to enforce official Shiism violently, putting to death those who opposed him. Under this pressure, Safavid subjects either converted or pretended to convert, but it is safe to say that the majority of the population was probably genuinely Shia by the end of the Safavid period in the 18th century, and most Iranians today are Shia, although there is still a Sunni minority.\nThis led to a wide gap between Iran and its Sunni neighbors, particularly its rival, the Ottoman Empire, in the wake of the Battle of Chaldiran. This gap continued until the 20th century.\n\nShias claim that despite these advances, many Shias in Syria continued to be killed during this period for their faith. One of these was Muhammad Ibn Makki, called \"Shahid-i Awwal (the First Martyr)\", one of the great figures in Shia jurisprudence, who was killed in Damascus in 1384.\n\nShahab al-Din Suhrawardi was another eminent scholar, killed in Aleppo on charges of cultivating Batini teachings and philosophy.\n\nSunni–Shia clashes also occurred occasionally in the 20th century in South Asia. There were many between 1904 and 1908. These clashes revolved around the public cursing of the first three caliphs by Shias and the praising of them by Sunnis. To put a stop to the violence, public demonstrations were banned in 1909 on the three most sensitive days: Ashura, Chehlum and Ali's death on 21 Ramadan. Intercommunal violence resurfaced in 1935–36 and again in 1939 when many thousands of Sunni and Shias defied the ban on public demonstrations and took to the streets. Shia are estimated to be 21–35% of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the two groups and practice of \"taqiyya\" by Shia.\n\nSunni razzias which came to be known as \"Taarajs\" virtually devastated the community. History records 10 such Taarajs also known as \"Taraj-e-Shia\" between the 15th and 19th centuries in 1548, 1585, 1635, 1686, 1719, 1741, 1762, 1801, 1830, 1872 during which the Shia habitations were plundered, people slaughtered, libraries burnt and their sacred sites desecrated.\n\nShia in South Asia faced persecution by some Sunni rulers and Mughal Emperors which resulted in the killings of Shia scholars like Qazi Nurullah Shustari (also known as \"Shaheed-e-Thaalis\", the third Martyr) and Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi (also known as\" Shaheed-e- Rabay\", the fourth Martyr) who are two of the five martyrs of Shia Islam. Shias in Kashmir in subsequent years had to pass through the most atrocious period of their history.\n\nIn addition to Iran, Iraq has emerged as a major Shia government when the Twelvers achieved political dominance in 2005 under American occupation. The two communities have often remained separate, mingling regularly only during the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca. In some countries like Iraq, Syria, Kuwait and Bahrain, communities have mingled and intermarried. Some Shia have complained of mistreatment in countries dominated by Sunnis, especially in Saudi Arabia, while some Sunnis have complained of discrimination in the Twelver-dominated states of Iraq and Iran.\n\nSome tension developed between Sunnis and Shia as a result of clashes over Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police at the hajj. Millions of Saudi adhere to the school of Salafism which is a branch of Sunni Islam.\n\nAccording to some reports, as of mid-2013, the Syrian Civil War has become \"overtly sectarian\" with the \"sectarian lines fall most sharply\" between Alawites and Sunnis. With the involvement of Lebanese Shia paramilitary group Hezbollah, the fighting in Syria has reignited \"long-simmering tensions between Sunnis and Shi’ites\" spilling over into Lebanon and Iraq. Ex-Ambassador Dimitar Mihaylov further claims that the current post-Arab Spring situation (encompassing ISIS, the Syrian civil war, Yemen, Iraq and others) represents a \"qualitatively new\" development in the history of Shi'a-Sunni dynamics. Historically, the inner rifts within Islamic ideology were to be hidden from the public sphere, while the new violent outbreaks highlight said rift in an obvious manner and is nourished by the two extremes of their mutual rivalry which will strongly affect both globally and regionally.\n\nAt least one scholar sees the period from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire through the decline of Arab nationalism as a time of relative unity and harmony between traditionalist Sunni and Shia Muslims—unity brought on by a feeling of being under siege from a common threat, secularism, first of the European colonial variety and then Arab nationalist.\n\nAn example of Sunni–Shia cooperation was the Khilafat Movement which swept South Asia following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the seat of the Caliphate, in World War I. Shia scholars \"came to the caliphate's defence\" by attending the 1931 Caliphate Conference in Jerusalem, although they were theologically opposed to the idea that non-imams could be caliphs or successors to Muhammad, and that the caliphate was \"the flagship institution\" of Sunni, not Shia, authority. This has been described as unity of traditionalists in the face of the twin threats of \"secularism and colonialism.\"\n\nIn these years Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi travelled to Cairo and started his efforts for reforming Islamic unity at Al-Azhar University, since 1938. Finally, his efforts and contacting with scholars such as Mahmud Shaltut and Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi led to the founding of Dar-al-Taghrib (community for reforming unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims).\n\nAnother example of unity was a fatwā issued by the rector of Al-Azhar University, Mahmud Shaltut, recognizing Shia Islamic law as the fifth school of Islamic law. In 1959, al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most influential center of Sunni learning, authorized the teaching of courses of Shia jurisprudence as part of its curriculum.\n\nThe year of the Iranian Islamic Revolution was \"one of great ecumentical discourse\", and shared enthusiasm by both Shia and Sunni Islamists.\nAfter the Iranian Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini endeavored to bridge the gap between Shiites and Sunnis by declaring it permissible for Twelvers to pray behind Sunni imams and by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali—an issue that had caused much animosity between the two groups. In addition, he designated the period of Prophet's Birthday celebrations from 12th to the 17th of Rabi Al-Awwal as the \"Islamic Unity Week\", there being a gap in the dates of when Shiites and Sunnis celebrate Muhammad's birthday.\n\nFollowing this period, Sunni–Shia strife has seen a major upturn, particularly in Iraq and Pakistan, leading to thousands of deaths. Among the explanations for the increase are conspiracies by outside forces to divide Muslims, the recent Islamic revival and increased religious purity and consequent takfir, upheaval, destruction and loss of power of Sunni caused by the US invasion of Iraq, and sectarianism generated by Arab regimes defending themselves against the mass uprisings of the Arab Spring.\n\nMany in the Muslim world explain the bloodshed as the work of conspiracies by outside forces—\"the forces of hegemony and Zionism which aim to weaken [Arabs]\" (Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Yusuf al-Qaradawi), unspecified \"enemies\" (Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad), or \"oppressive pressure by the imperialist front.\" (Mahmoud Ahmadinejad).\n\nSome Western analysts assert that the US is practicing divide and rule strategy through the escalation of Sunni-Shia conflict. Nafeez Ahmed cites a 2008 RAND Corporation study for the American military which recommended \"divide and rule\" as a possible strategy against the Muslim world in \"the Long War.\" Dr. Christopher Davidson argues that the current crisis in Yemen is being “egged on” by the US, and could be part of a wider covert strategy to “spur fragmentation in Iran allies and allow Israel to be surrounded by weak states”.\n\nOthers lay the blame for the strife at a very different source, the unintended effects of the Islamic revival. According to scholar Vali Nasr, as the Muslim world was decolonialised and Arab nationalism lost its appeal, fundamentalism blossomed and reasserted the differences and conflicts between the two movements, particularly in the strict teachings of Sunni scholar Ibn Taymiyyah. The Iranian Islamic revolution changed the Shia–Sunni power equation in Muslim countries \"from Lebanon to India\" arousing the traditionally subservient Shia to the alarm of traditionally dominant and very non-revolutionary Sunni. \"Where Iranian revolutionaries saw Islamic revolutionary stirrings, Sunnis saw mostly Shia mischief and a threat to Sunni predominance.\"\n\nAlthough the Iranian revolution's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, was very much in favor of Shia–Sunni unity, he also challenged Saudi Arabia, in his view an \"unpopular and corrupt dictatorship\" and an \"American lackey\" ripe for revolution. In part because Saudi Arabia was the world's major international funder of Islamic schools, scholarships, and fellowships, this angered not only Saudi Arabia but its many fundamentalist allies and benefactors throughout the Arab world, according to Nasr.\n\nAnother effect noted by political scientist Gilles Kepel, is that the initial attraction of the Islamic Revolution to Sunnis as well as Shia, and Khomeini's desire to export his revolution motivated the Saudi establishment to shore up its \"religious legitimacy\" with more strictness in religion (and with jihad in Afghanistan) to compete with Iran's revolutionary ideology. But doing so in Saudi meant a more anti-Shia policies because Saudi's own native Sunni school of Islam is Wahhabism, which includes the prohibition of Shia Islam itself, as strict Wahhabis do not consider Shia to be Islamic. This new strictness was spread not only among Saudis in the kingdom but thousands of students and Saudi funded schools and international Islamist volunteers who came to training camps in Peshawar Pakistan in the 1980s to learn to fight jihad in Afghanistan and went home in the 1990s to fight jihad. Both groups (especially in Iraq and Pakistan) saw Shia as the enemy. Thus, although the Iranian revolution's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, was very much in favor of Shia–Sunni unity, and \"the leadership position that went with it\", his revolution worked against it.\n\nFrom the Iranian Revolution to 2015, Shia groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, supported by Iran have recently won \"important political victories\" which have boosted Iran's regional influence.\nIn Lebanon, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia and political movement is the \"strongest political actor\" in the country. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq removed Saddam Hussein from power and instituted elected government, the Shia majority has dominated the parliament and its prime ministers have been Shia. In Syria, a Shia minority—the heterodox Alawi sect that makes up only about 13 percent of the population—dominate the upper reaches of the government, military and security services in Syria, and are the \"backbone\" of the forces fighting to protect the Bashir al-Assad regime in Syria's civil war. In Yemen, Houthi rebels have expanded their territory south of Saudi Arabia, and become the country's \"dominant power\".\n\nOlivier Roy, research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, sees the \"Shia awakening and its instrumentalisation by Iran\" as leading to a \"very violent Sunni reaction\", starting first in Pakistan before spreading to \"the rest of the Muslim world, without necessarily being as violent.\" According to Roy, \"two events created a sea change in the balance of power between Shia and Sunnis: the Islamic revolution in Iran and the American military intervention in Iraq\" in 2003. \"Today, Azerbaijan is probably the only country where there are still mixed mosques and Shia and Sunnis pray together.\"\n\nFrom 1994 to 2014 satellite television and high-speed Internet has spread \"hate speech\" against both Sunni and Shia. Fundamentalist Sunni clerics have popularized slurs against Shia such as \"Safawis\" (from the Safavid empire, thus implying their being an Iranian agents), or even worse \"rafidha\" (rejecters of the faith), and \"majus\" (Zoroastrian or crypto Persian). In turn, Shia religious scholars have \"mocked and cursed\" the first three caliphs and Aisha, Mohammed's youngest wife who fought against Ali.\n\n\nAmong those blaming the US invasion of Iraq are Fawaz Gerges, who writes in his book \"ISIS: A History\",\n\nBy destroying state institutions and establishing a sectarian-based political system, the 2003 US-led invasion polarized the country along Sunni-Shia lines and set the stage for a fierce, prolonged struggle driven by identity politics. Anger against the United States was also fueled by the humiliating disbandment of the Iraqi army and the de-Baathification law, which was first introduced as a provision and then turned into a permanent article of the constitution.\n\nMalise Ruthven writes that the post invasion de-Ba'athification by the US occupiers deprived Iraq of \"the officer class and administrative cadres that had ruled under Saddam Hussein, leaving the field to sectarian-based militias\". Many of officers joined the anti-Shia takfiri ISIL group.\n\nThe US-led invasion also “tilted the regional balance of power decisively\" in favor of Shia Iran, alarming Sunni and leading to talk of a “Shia Crescent”.\n\n\nMarc Lynch in his book \"The New Arab Wars: Uprisings and Anarchy in the Middle East\", argues that as old regimes or political forces sought to control \"the revolutionary upsurge\" of the Arab Spring, sectarianism became “a key weapon” to undermine unity among the anti-regime masses. Christians were pitted \"against Muslims in Egypt, Jordanians against Palestinians in Jordan, and, above all, Sunnis against Shi’ites wherever possible.”\n\nShia–Sunni discord in Iraq starts with disagreement over the relative population of the two groups. According to most sources, including the CIA's \"World Factbook\", the majority of Iraqis are Shia Arab Muslims (60%-70%), and Sunni Arab Muslims represent between 32% and 37% of the population. However, Sunni are split ethnically among Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. Many Sunnis hotly dispute their minority status, including ex-Iraqi Ambassador Faruq Ziada, and many believe Shia majority is \"a myth spread by America\". One Sunni belief shared by Jordan's King Abdullah as well as his then Defense Minister Shaalan is that Shia numbers in Iraq were inflated by Iranian Shias crossing the border. Shia scholar Vali Nasr believes the election turnout in summer and December 2005 confirmed a strong Shia majority in Iraq.\n\nThe British, having put down a Shia rebellion against their rule in the 1920s, \"confirmed their reliance on a corps of Sunni ex-officers of the collapsed Ottoman empire\". The British colonial rule ended after the Sunni and Shia united against it.\n\nThe Shia suffered indirect and direct persecution under post-colonial Iraqi governments since 1932, erupting into full-scale rebellions in 1935 and 1936. Shias were also persecuted during the Ba'ath Party rule, especially under Saddam Hussein. It is said that every Shia clerical family of note in Iraq had tales of torture and murder to recount. In 1969 the son of Iraq's highest Shia Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim was arrested and allegedly tortured. From 1979–1983 Saddam's regime executed 48 major Shia clerics in Iraq. They included Shia leader Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and his sister. Tens of thousands of Iranians and Arabs of Iranian origin were expelled in 1979 and 1980 and a further 75,000 in 1989.\n\nThe Shias openly revolted against Saddam following the Gulf War in 1991 and were encouraged by Saddam's defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north. However, Shia opposition to the government was brutally suppressed, resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression by Saddam's forces. The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis for nearly a century until the 2003 Iraq War.\n\nSome of the worst sectarian strife ever has occurred after the start of the Iraq War, steadily building up to the present. The war has featured a cycle of Sunni–Shia revenge killing—Sunni often used car bombs, while Shia favored death squads.\n\nAccording to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq. Sunni suicide bombers have targeted not only thousands of civilians, but mosques, shrines, wedding and funeral processions, markets, hospitals, offices, and streets. Sunni insurgent organizations include Ansar al-Islam. Radical groups include Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad, Jaish al-Ta'ifa al-Mansurah, Jeish Muhammad, and Black Banner Organization.\n\n\"Takfir\" motivation for many of these killings may come from Sunni insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Before his death Zarqawi was one to quote Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, especially his infamous statement urging followers to kill the Shia of Iraq, and calling the Shias \"snakes\". An al-Qaeda-affiliated website posted a call for \"a full-scale war on Shiites all over Iraq, whenever and wherever they are found.\" Suicide bombers continue to attack Iraqi Shia civilians, and the Shia ulama have in response declared suicide bombing as \"haraam\":\n\nSome believe the war has strengthened the takfir thinking and may spread Sunni–Shia strife elsewhere.\n\nOn the Shia side, in early February 2006 militia-dominated government death squads were reportedly \"tortur[ing] to death or summarily\" executing \"hundreds\" of Sunnis \"every month in Baghdad alone,\" many arrested at random. According to the British television Channel 4, from 2005 through early 2006, commandos of the Ministry of the Interior which is controlled by the Badr Organization, and\nThe violence shows little sign of getting opposite sides to back down. Iran's Shia leaders are said to become \"more determined\" the more violent the anti-Shia attacks in Iraq become. One Shia Grand Ayatollah, Yousef Saanei, who has been described as a moderate, reacted to the 2005 suicide bombings of Shia targets in Iraq by saying the bombers were \"wolves without pity\" and that \"sooner rather than later, Iran will have to put them down\".\n\nIran is unique in the Muslim world because its population is overwhelmingly more Shia than Sunni (Shia constitute 95% of the population) and because its constitution is theocratic republic based on rule by a Shia jurist.\n\nAlthough the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, supported good Sunni–Shia relations, there have been complaints by Sunni of discrimination, particularly in important government positions. In a joint appearance with former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for Shia-Sunni unity, Sunni Shiekh Yusuf al-Qaradawi complained that no ministers in Iran have been Sunni for a long time, that Sunni officials are scarce even in the regions with majority of Sunni population (such as Kurdistan, or Balochistan) and despite the presence of Christian churches, as a prominent example of this discrimination. Although reformist President Mohammad Khatami promised during his election campaign to build a Sunni mosque in Tehran, none was built during his eight years in office. The president explained the situation by saying Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would not agree to the proposal. As in other parts of the Muslim world, other issues may play a part in the conflict, since most Sunnis in Iran are also ethnic minorities.\n\nSoon after the 1979 revolution, Sunni leaders from Kurdistan, Balouchistan, and Khorassan, set up a new party known as \"Shams\", which is short for Shora-ye Markaz-e al Sunaat, to unite Sunnis and lobby for their rights. But six months after that they were closed down, bank accounts suspended and had their leaders arrested by the government on charges that they were backed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.\n\nA UN human rights report states that:\nMembers of the 'Balochistan Peoples Front' claim that Sunnis are systematically discriminated against educationally by denial of places at universities, politically by not allowing Sunnis to be army generals, ambassadors, ministers, prime minister, or president, religiously insulting Sunnis in the media, economic discrimination by not giving import or export licenses for Sunni businesses while the majority of Sunnis are left unemployed.\n\nThere has been a low level resistance in mainly Sunni Iranian Balouchistan against the regime for several years. Official media refers to the fighting as armed clashes between the police and \"bandits,\" \"drug-smugglers,\" and \"thugs,\" to disguise what many believe is essentially a political-religious conflict. Revolutionary Guards have stationed several brigades in Balouchi cities, and have allegedly tracked down and assassinated Sunni leaders both inside Iran and in neighboring Pakistan. In 1996 a leading Sunni, Abdulmalek Mollahzadeh, was gunned down by hitmen, allegedly hired by Tehran, as he was leaving his house in Karachi.\n\nMembers of Sunni groups in Iran however have been active in what the authorities describe as terrorist activities. Balochi Sunni Abdolmalek Rigi continue to declare the Shia as \"Kafir\" and \"Mushrik\". These Sunni groups have been involved in violent activities in Iran and have waged terrorist attacks against civilian centers, including an attack next to a girls' school according to government sources. The \"shadowy Sunni militant group Jundallah\" has reportedly been receiving weaponry from the United States for these attacks according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. The United Nations and several countries worldwide have condemned the bombings. \"(See 2007 Zahedan bombings for more information)\"\n\nNon-Sunni Iranian opposition parties, and Shia like Ayatollah Jalal Gange’i have criticised the regime's treatment of Sunnis and confirmed many Sunni complaints.\n\nFollowing the 2005 elections, much of the leadership of Iran has been described as more \"staunchly committed to core Shia values\" and lacking Ayatollah Khomeini's commitment to Shia–Sunni unity. Polemics critical of Sunnis were reportedly being produced in Arabic for dissemination in the Arab Muslim world by Hojjatieh-aligned elements in the Iranian regime.\n\nIranian government denies any allegations of discrimination against its Sunni citizens citing facts that there are Sunni mayors, police officers, judges, lawyers, clerics. Sunnis in Iran run multiple religious schools and own mosques that can accommodate thousands of worshipers at any given time. There are 10,000–15,000 Sunni mosques all over Iran, with 9 in Tehran alone. According to the Iranian law, Shias are not allowed to build mosques in Sunni majority areas and vice versa.\n\nSyria is approximately three quarters Sunni, but its government is predominantly Alawite, a Shia sect that makes up less than 15% of the population. Under Hafez al-Assad, Alawites dominated the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, a secular Arab nationalist party which had ruled Syria under a state of emergency from 1963 to 2011. Alawites are often considered a form of Shia Islam, that differs somewhat from the larger Twelver Shia sect.\n\nDuring the 20th century, an Islamic uprising in Syria occurred with sectarian religious overtones between the Alawite-dominated Assad government and the Islamist Sunni Muslim Brotherhood, culminating with the 1982 Hama massacre. An estimated 10,000 to 40,000 Syrians, mostly civilians, were killed by Syrian military in the city. During the uprising, the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood attacked military cadets at an artillery school in Aleppo, performed car bomb attacks in Damascus, as well as bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including Hafez al-Assad himself, and had killed several hundred.\n\nHow much of the conflict was sparked by Sunni versus Shia divisions and how much by Islamism versus secular-Arab-nationalism, is in question, but according to scholar Vali Nasr the failure of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic of Iran to support the Muslim Brotherhood against the Baathists \"earned [Khomeini] the Brotherhood's lasting contempt.\" It proved to the satisfaction of the Brotherhood that sectarian loyalty trumped Islamist solidarity for Khomeini and eliminated whatever appeal Khomeini might have had to the MB movement as a pan-Islamic leader.\n\n\nThe Syrian Civil War, though it started as a political conflict, developed into a struggle between the Alawite-dominated Army and government on the one hand, and the mainly Sunni rebels and former members of the regular army on the other. The casualty toll of the war's first three years has exceeded that of Iraq's decade-long conflict, and the fight has \"amplified sectarian tensions to unprecedented levels\". Rebel groups with 10,000s of Sunni Syrian fighters such as Ahrar ash-Sham, the Islamic Front, and al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front, employ anti-Shia rhetoric and foreign Arab and Western Sunni fighters have joined the rebels. On the other side Shia from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kata'ib Hezbollah militias from Iraq have backed the Syrian government. \"Even Afghan Shia refugees in Iran\", driven from Afghanistan by Sunni extremism, have \"reportedly been recruited by Tehran for the war in Syria\".\n\nWhile Shia make up roughly 15% of Saudi Arabia's population, they form a large portion of the residents of the eastern province of Hasa—by some estimates a majority—where much of the petroleum industry is based. Between 500,000 and a million Shia live there, concentrated especially around the oases of Qatif and Al-Hasa. The Majority of Saudi Shia belong to the sect of the Twelvers.\n\nThe Saudi conflict of Shia and Sunni extends beyond the borders of the kingdom because of international Saudi \"Petro-Islam\" influence. Saudi Arabia backed Iraq in the 1980–1988 war with Iran and sponsored militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan who—though primarily targeting the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan in 1979—also fought to suppress Shia movements.\n\nRelations between the Shia and the Wahhabis are inherently strained because the Wahhabis consider the rituals of the Shia to be the epitome of \"shirk\", or polytheism. In the late 1920s, the Ikhwan (Ibn Saud's fighting force of converted Wahhabi Bedouin Muslims) were particularly hostile to the Shia and demanded that Abd al Aziz forcibly convert them. In response, Abd al Aziz sent Wahhabi missionaries to the Eastern Province, but he did not carry through with attempts at forced conversion. In recent decades the late leading Saudi cleric, Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz, issued fatwa denouncing Shia as apostates, and according to Shia scholar Vali Nasr \"Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin, a member of the Higher Council of Ulama, even sanctioned the killing of Shias, a call that was reiterated by Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002.\"\n\nGovernment policy has been to allow Shia their own mosques and to exempt Shia from Hanbali inheritance practices. Nevertheless, Shia have been forbidden all but the most modest displays on their principal festivals, which are often occasions of sectarian strife in the Persian Gulf region, with its mixed Sunni–Shia populations.\n\nAccording to a report by the Human Rights Watch:\nAnd Amnesty International adds:\nAs of 2006 four of the 150 members of Saudi Arabia's \"handpicked\" parliament were Shia, but no city had a Shia mayor or police chief, and none of the 300 girls schools for Shia in the Eastern Province had a Shia principal. According to scholar Vali Nasr, Saudi textbooks \"characterize Shiism as a form of heresy ... worse than Christianity and Judaism.\"\n\nForced into exile in the 1970s, Saudi Shia leader Hassan al-Saffar is said to have been \"powerfully influenced\" by the works of Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and Jamaat-e-Islami and by their call for Islamic revolution and an Islamic state.\n\nFollowing the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Shia in Hasa ignored the ban on mourning ceremonies commemorating Ashura. When police broke them up three days of rampage ensued—burned cars, attacked banks, looted shops—centered around Qatif. At least 17 Shia were killed. In February 1980 disturbances were \"less spontaneous\" and even bloodier. Meanwhile, broadcasts from Iran in the name of the Islamic Revolutionary Organization attacked the monarchy, telling listeners, \"Kings despoil a country when they enter it and make the noblest of its people its meanest ... This is the nature of monarchy, which is rejected by Islam.\"\n\nBy 1993, Saudi Shia had abandoned uncompromising demands and some of al-Saffar's followers met with King Fahd with promises made for reform. In 2005 the new King Abdullah also relaxed some restrictions on the Shia. However, Shia continue to be arrested for commemorating Ashura as of 2006. In December 2006, amidst escalating tensions in Iraq, 38 high ranking Saudi clerics called on Sunni Muslims around the world to \"mobilise against Shiites\".\n\nShia Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi is reported to have responded:\nA large fraction of the foreign Sunni extremists who have entered Iraq to fight against Shia and the American occupation are thought to be Saudis. According to one estimate, of the approximately 1,200 foreign fighters captured in Syria between summer 2003 and summer 2005, 85% were Saudis.\n\nAnother reflection of grassroots Wahhabi or Saudi antipathy to Shia was a statement by Saudi cleric Nasir al-Umar, who accused Iraqi Shias of close ties to the United States and argued that both were enemies of Muslims everywhere.\n\nSome Wahabi groups, often labeled as \"takfiri\" and sometimes linked to Al-Qaeda, have even advocated the persecution of the Shia as heretics. Such groups have been allegedly responsible for violent attacks and suicide bombings at Shi'a gatherings at mosques and shrines, most notably in Iraq during the Ashura mourning ceremonies where hundreds of Shias were killed in coordinated suicide bombings, but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, in a video message, Al-Qaeda deputy Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri directed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, not to attack civilian targets but to focus on the occupation troops. His call seems to have been ignored, or swept away in the increasing tensions of Iraq under occupation.\n\nThough sectarian tensions in Lebanon were at their height during the Lebanese Civil War, the Shia–Sunni relations were not the main conflict of the war. The Shia party/militia of Hezbollah emerged in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War as one of the strongest forces following the Israeli withdrawal in the year 2000, and the collapse of the South Lebanese Army in the South. The tensions blew into a limited warfare between Shia dominated and Sunni dominated political alliances in 2008.\n\nWith the eruption of the Syrian Civil War, tensions increased between the Shia-affiliated Alawites and Sunnis of Tripoli, erupting twice into deadly violence—in June 2011, and the second time in February 2012. The Syrian war has affected Hezbollah, which was once lauded by both Sunnis and Shi'ites for its battles against Israel, but now has lost support from many Sunnis for its military assistance to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAlthough the country of Jordan is 95% Sunni and has not seen any Shia–Sunni fighting within, it has played a part in the recent Shia-Sunni strife. It is the home country of anti-Shia insurgent Raed Mansour al-Banna, who died perpetrating one of Iraq's worst suicide bombings in the city of Al-Hillah. Al-Banna killed 125 Shia and wounded another 150 in the 2005 Al Hillah bombing of a police recruiting station and adjacent open air market. In March 2005 Salt, al-Banna's home town, saw a three-day wake for al-Banna who Jordanian newspapers and celebrants proclaimed a martyr to Islam, which by definition made the Shia victims \"infidels whose murder was justified.\" Following the wake Shia mobs in Iraq attacked the Jordanian embassy on March 20, 2005. Ambassadors were withdrawn from both countries. All this resulted despite the strong filial bonds, ties of commerce, and traditional friendship between the two neighboring countries.\n\nAlthough according to some sources, almost all of Egypt's Muslims are Sunni, others put the number of Shias somewhere between 800,000 to about two to three million. The Syrian Civil War has brought on an increase in anti-Shia rhetoric, and what Human Rights Watch states is \"anti-Shia hate speech by Salafis\". In 2013 a mob of several hundred attacked a house in the village of Abu Musallim near Cairo, dragging four Shia worshipers through the street before lynching them. Eight other Shia were injured.\n\nMuslims in Yemen include the majority Shafi'i (Sunni) and the minority Zaidi (Shia). Zaidi are sometimes called \"Fiver Shia\" instead of Twelver Shia because they recognize the first four of the Twelve Imams but accept Zayd ibn Ali as their \"Fifth Imām\" rather than his brother Muhammad al-Baqir. Shia–Sunni conflict in Yemen involves the Shia insurgency in northern Yemen.\n\nBoth Shia and Sunni dissidents in Yemen have similar complaints about the government—cooperation with the American government and an alleged failure to following Sharia law—but it's the Shia who have allegedly been singled out for government crackdown.\n\nDuring and after the US-led invasion of Iraq, members of the Zaidi-Shia community protested after Friday prayers every week outside mosques, particularly the Grand Mosque in Sana'a, during which they shouted anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans, and criticised the government's close ties to America. These protests were led by ex-parliament member and Imam, Bader Eddine al-Houthi. In response the Yemeni government has implemented a campaign to crush to the Zaidi-Shia rebellion\" and harass journalists.\n\nThese latest measures come as the government faces a Sunni rebellion with a similar motivation to the Zaidi discontent.\n\nA March 2015 suicide bombing of two mosques (used mainly by supporters of the Zaidi Shia-led Houthi rebel movement), in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, killed at least 137 people and wounded 300. The Sunni Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant movement claimed responsibility, issuing a statement saying: \"Let the polytheist Houthis know that the soldiers of the Islamic State will not rest until we have uprooted them.\" Both the Sunni al-Qaeda and \"Islamic State\" consider Shia Muslims to be heretics.\n\nThe small Persian Gulf island state of Bahrain has a Shia majority but is ruled by Sunni Al Khalifa family as a constitutional monarchy, with Sunni dominating the ruling class and military and disproportionately represented in the business and landownership. According to the CIA World Factbook, Al Wefaq the largest Shia political society, won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the legislature. However, Shia discontent has resurfaced in recent years with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence.\" Bahrain has many disaffected unemployed youths and many have protested Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's efforts to create a parliament as merely a \"cooptation of the effendis\", i.e. traditional elders and notables. Bahrain's 2002 election was widely boycotted by Shia. Mass demonstrations have been held in favor of full-fledged democracy in March and June 2005, against an alleged insult to Ayatollah Khamenei in July 2005.\n\nPakistan's citizens have had serious Shia-Sunni discord. Almost 80% of Pakistan's Muslim population is Sunni, with 20% being Shia, but this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country, larger than the Shia majority in Iraq.\n\nUntil recently Shia–Sunni relations have been cordial, and a majority of people of both sects participated in the creation the state of Pakistan in the 1940s. Despite the fact that Pakistan is a Sunni majority country, Shias have been elected to top offices and played an important part in the country's politics. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the father of the nation who served as the first Governor-General of Pakistan was a Shia. Several other top Pakistani Generals such as General Muhammad Musa. Pakistan's President Yahya Khan were Shia. Former President Asif Ali Zardari is a Shia. There are many intermarriages between Shia and Sunnis in Pakistan.\n\nUnfortunately, from 1987–2007, \"as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died\" in Shia-Sunni sectarian fighting in Pakistan\", 300 being killed in 2006. Amongst the culprits blamed for the killing are Al-Qaeda working \"with local sectarian groups\" to kill what they perceive as Shia apostates, and \"foreign powers ... trying to sow discord.\" Most violence takes place in the largest province of Punjab and the country's commercial and financial capital, Karachi. There have also been conflagrations in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Azad Kashmir, with several hundreds of Shia Hazara killed in Balochistan killed since 2008.\n\nArab states especially Saudi Arabia and GCC states have been funding extremist Deobandi Sunnis and Wahhabis in Pakistan, since the Afghan Jihad. Whereas Iran has been funding Shia militant groups such as Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan, resulting in tit-for-tat attacks on each other. Pakistan has become a battleground between Saudi Arabia-funded Deobandi Sunni and Wahhabis and Iran-funded Shia resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims.\n\nSome see a precursor of Pakistani Shia–Sunni strife in the April 1979 execution of deposed President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on questionable charges by Islamic fundamentalist General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Ali Bhutto was Shia, Zia ul-Haq a Sunni.\n\nZia-ul-Haq's Islamization that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as \"Sunnification\" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni \"fiqh\". In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the Islamization laws in the capital Islamabad. Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.\n\nShia formed student associations and a Shia party, Sunni began to form sectarian militias recruited from Deobandi and Ahl al-Hadith madrasahs. Preaching against the Shia in Pakistan was cleric Israr Ahmed. Muhammad Manzour Numani, a senior Indian cleric with close ties to Saudi Arabia published a book entitled \"Iranian Revolution: Imam Khomeini and Shiism\". The book, which \"became the gospel of Deobandi militants\" in the 1980s, attacked Khomeini and argued the excesses of the Islamic revolution were proof that Shiism was not the doctrine of misguided brothers, but beyond the Islamic pale.\n\nAnti-Shia groups in Pakistan include the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, offshoots of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI). The groups demand the expulsion of all Shias from Pakistan and have killed hundreds of Pakistani Shias between 1996 and 1999. As in Iraq they \"targeted Shia in their holy places and mosques, especially during times of communal prayer.\" From January to May 1997, Sunni terror groups assassinated 75 Shia community leaders \"in a systematic attempt to remove Shias from positions of authority.\" Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has declared Shia to be \"American agents\" and the \"near enemy\" in global jihad.\n\nAn example of an early Shia–Sunni \"fitna\" shootout occurred in Kurram, one of the tribal agencies of the Northwest Pakistan, where the Pushtun population was split between Sunnis and Shia. In September 1996 more than 200 people were killed when a gun battle between teenage Shia and Sunni escalated into a communal war that lasted five days. Women and children were kidnapped and gunmen even executed out-of-towners who were staying at a local hotel.\n\n\"Over 80,000 Pakistani Islamic militants have trained and fought with the Taliban since 1994. They form a hardcore of Islamic activists, ever-ready to carry out a similar Taliban-style Islamic revolution in Pakistan.\", according to Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid.\n\nShia–Sunni strife in Pakistan is strongly intertwined with that in Afghanistan. Though now deposed, the anti-Shia Afghan Taliban regime helped anti-Shia Pakistani groups and vice versa. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, have sent thousands of volunteers to fight with the Taliban regime and \"in return the Taliban gave sanctuary to their leaders in the Afghan capital of Kabul.\"\n\nShia–Sunni strife inside of Afghanistan has mainly been a function of the puritanical Sunni Taliban's clashes with Shia Afghans, primarily the Hazara ethnic group.\n\nIn 1998 more than 8,000 noncombatants were killed when the Taliban attacked Mazar-i-Sharif and Bamiyan where many Hazaras live. Some of the slaughter was indiscriminate, but many were Shia targeted by the Taliban. Taliban commander and governor Mullah Niazi banned prayer at Shia mosques and expressed takfir of the Shia in a declaration from Mazar's central mosque:\nAssisting the Taliban in the murder of Iranian diplomatic and intelligence officials at the Iranian Consulate in Mazar were \"several Pakistani militants of the anti-Shia, Sipah-e-Sahaba party.\"\n\nIn Nigeria—the most populous country in Africa—until recently almost all Muslims were Sunni. As of 2017, estimates of the number of Nigeria's 90–95 million Muslims who are Shia vary from between 20 million (Shia estimate), to less than five million (Sunni estimate).\n\nIn the 1980s, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky—a Nigerian admirer of the Iranian Revolution who lived in Iran for some years and converted to Shia Islam—established the Islamic Movement of Nigeria. The movement has established \"more than 300 schools, Islamic centers, a newspaper, guards and a `martyrs’ foundation`\". Its network is similar to that of Hezbollah in Lebanon, with a focus on Iran, its Supreme Leader, and fighting America as the enemy of Islam. According to a former U.S. State Department specialist on Nigeria, Matthew Page, the Islamic Movement receives \"about $10,000 a month\" in Iranian funding. Many of the converted are poor Muslims.\n\nThe Shia campaign has clashed with Saudi Arabian, which also funds religious centers, school, and trains students and clerics, but as part of an effort to spread its competing Wahabbi interpretation of Islam. According to Wikileaks, \"Saudi cables\" released in 2015 \"reveal concern\" about \"Iran-driven Shiite expansion from Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Nigeria\" to Shia Islam has taken place in Nigeria since the Iranian Revolution.\n\nShia Muslims protest that they have been persecuted by the Nigerian government. In 1998 Nigerian President General Sani Abacha accused Ibrahim El-Zakzaky of being a Shia. In December 2015 the Nigerian government alleged that the Islamic Movement attempted to kill Nigeria's army chief-of-staff. In retaliation, troops killed more than 300 Shiites in the city of Zaria. Hundreds of El-Zakzaky's followers were also arrested. As of 2017, El-Zakzaky was still imprisoned.\n\nIslam is the dominant religion in Indonesia, which also has a larger Muslim population than any other country in the world, with approximately 202.9 million identified as Muslim (88.2% of the total population) as of 2009.\n\nThe majority adheres to the Sunni Muslim tradition mainly of the Shafi'i madhhab. Around one million are Shias, who are concentrated around Jakarta. In general, the Muslim community can be categorized in terms of two orientations: \"modernists,\" who closely adhere to orthodox theology while embracing modern learning; and \"traditionalists,\" who tend to follow the interpretations of local religious leaders (predominantly in Java) and religious teachers at Islamic boarding schools (pesantren). In Indonesia, in 2015, Sunni clerics denounced the Shia as \"heretics\", and the mayor of Bogor proposed banning the Shia Ashura holy day. The Shia community has also been subject to hate campaigns and intimidation, with fears of this escalating into violence.\n\nMalaysia claims to be a tolerant Islamic state, however since 2010 it has banned the preaching of Shia Islam, with a \"particular ferocity\" and warns against Shiism with its, \"evil and blasphemous beliefs\".\n\nIn late 2006 or early 2007, in what journalist Seymour Hersh called \"The Redirection\", the United States changed its policy in the Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, with the goal of \"containing\" Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups. Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia. During the Iraq War, the United States feared that a Shiite-led, Iran-friendly Iraq could have major consequences for American national security. However, nothing can be done about this as Iraq's Shiite government were democratically elected. Shadi Bushra of Stanford University wrote that the United States’ support of the Sunni monarchy during the Bahraini uprising is the latest in a long history of US support to keep the Shiites in check. The United States fears that Shiite rule in the Persian Gulf will lead to anti-US and anti-Western sentiment as well as Iranian influence in the Arab majority states. One analyst told CNN that the US strategy on putting pressure on Iran by arming its Sunni neighbors is not a new strategy for the United States.\n\nIn Europe Shia-Sunni acrimony is part of life for tens of millions of European Muslims.\n\nConflict between religious groups in the Middle East have spread to the Australian Muslim community and within Australian schools.\n\nAs of March 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (or ISIS/ISIL, Daesh), a Salafi jihadi extremist militant group and self-proclaimed caliphate and Islamic state led by Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria, had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, as well as limited territorial control in some other countries. The United Nations has held ISIS responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a \"historic scale\", including attacks on Shia Muslims.\n\nAccording to Shia rights watch, in 2014 ISIS forces killed over 1,700 Shia civilians at Camp Speicher in Tikrit Iraq, and 670 Shia prisoners at the detention facility on the outskirts of Mosul. In June 2014, the New York Times wrote that as ISIS has \"seized vast territories\" in western and northern Iraq, there have been \"frequent accounts of fighters’ capturing groups of people and releasing the Sunnis while the Shiites are singled out for execution\". The report listed questions ISIS uses to \"tell whether a person is a Sunni or a Shiite\"—What is your name? Where do you live? How do you pray? What kind of music do you listen to?\n\nAfter the collapse of the Iraqi army and capture of the city of Mosul by ISIS in June 2014, the \"most senior\" Shia spiritual leader based in Iraq, the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who had been known as \"pacifist\" in his attitudes, issued a fatwa calling for jihad against ISIS and its Sunni allies, which was seen by the Shia militias as a \"de facto legalization of the militias’ advance\". In Qatari another Shiite preacher, Nazar al-Qatari, \"put on military fatigues to rally worshipers after evening prayers,\" calling on them to fight against “the slayers of Imams Hasan and Hussein” (the second and third Imams of Shia history) and for Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIn the 13th edition of the ISIS magazine \"Dabiq\", the feature article is entitled \"The Rafidah: From Ibn Saba’ to the Dajjal\" and contains \"pages of violent rhetoric directed against Shiites\" who it claims are \"more severely dangerous and more murderous...than the Americans\". The article justifies the killing of Shia Muslims, who ISIS claim are apostates.\n\nShia militias fighting ISIS have also been accused of atrocities. Human Rights Watch has accused government-backed Shia militias of kidnapping and killing scores of Sunni civilians in 2014.\n\nIn a special interview broadcast on Al Jazeera on February 14, 2007, former Iranian president and chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and highly influential Sunni scholar Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, \"stressed the impermissibility of the fighting between the Sunnis and the Shi’is\" and the need to \"be aware of the conspiracies of the forces of hegemony and Zionism which aim to weaken [Islam] and tear it apart in Iraq.\"\n\nEven on this occasion there were differences, with Rafsanjani openly asking \"more than once who started\" the inter-Muslim killing in Iraq, and Al-Qaradawi denying claims by Rafsanjani that he knew where \"those arriving to Iraq to blow Shi’i shrines up are coming from\".\n\nIn a milestone for the two countries' relations, on March 3, 2007 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held an extraordinary summit meeting. They displayed mutual warmth with hugs and smiles for cameras and\npromised \"a thaw in relations between the two regional powers but stopped short of agreeing on any concrete plans to tackle the escalating sectarian and political crises throughout the Middle East.\"\n\nOn his return to Tehran, Ahmadinejad declared that:\nSaudi officials had no comment about Ahmadinejad's statements, but the Saudi official government news agency did say:\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz said:\nEffort to bring unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims had been attempted by Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10157520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10157520", "title": "Steven Tari", "text": "Steven Tari\n\nSteven Garasai Tari (1971 – 29 August 2013), also known as Black Jesus, was a Papua New Guinean religious figure, leader of a Christian-influenced cargo cult, who claimed to be the Messiah or the Christ, and is notorious for alleged rape and murder.\n\nHe was convicted of four counts of rape in 2010 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He escaped in March 2013, and remained at large for several months, until he was killed by villagers on 29 August 2013.\n\nTari was born on Manus Island in 1971. He studied to become a Lutheran minister at Amron Bible College in Madang, but left the school prematurely after rejecting the teachings of the Bible, leaving behind both his clothing and his belongings. He retreated into the mountain village of Gal, where he formed a personality cult around himself as the Messiah, adopting the moniker \"Black Jesus\". According to some reports, he was expelled from the school for theft.\n\nTari's cult, which is estimated to have numbered as many as 6,000, became notorious for its alleged use of \"flower girls\" who served as concubines for Tari. The girls dress in scant clothing. The Lutheran Church, very prominent in Papua New Guinea, declared Tari an \"enemy of the church\".\n\nTari was pursued by Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary police in 2005 as a result of his teachings, which included promises of material goods and well-being for the villagers' worship. Under recent law, intended to combat the widespread occurrence of cults in the country, it is illegal to make such promises.\n\nThe first rape/murder accusation against Tari involves the fate of Rita Herman, who joined the cult at age 13 as a personal \"flower girl\" of the self-styled messiah. According to accusations, in October 2006, Tari and a select circle of his ex-Lutheran aides, along with Barmarhal Herman, the girl's mother and reported \"queen\" of the flower girls, took 14-year-old Rita into a private tent where she was raped by Tari. Barmarhal instructed her daughter to submit, as she and her family would be blessed by Tari and would receive great gifts of material goods and wealth as reward for the ritual.\n\nAfter the rape, Tari killed the girl with multiple knife stabs. Barmarhal's other daughter had been previously jailed for being one of Tari's flower girls. Barmarhal has denied being present at the event. \n\nTari was initially captured in 2005, but escaped prior to his trial with the help of a Lutheran pastor, Logan Sapus, who had been assigned to counsel him but became converted to Tari's cult instead. Back in the jungle, Tari cultivated an honour guard and recruited a new crop of flower girls from the remote villages, promising them blessings of wealth in exchange. Tari enlisted only virgins, reportedly some as young as 8 years old. Tari ordered the destruction of rival Lutheran churches and terrorized nearby villages who would not submit to him. About 50 of Tari's followers, including about 30 flower girls, were rounded up in an operation in June 2006. Those followers publicly renounced Tari and reconciled with their churches.\n\nIn 2007, Tari was captured after rival villagers traveled into his mountain stronghold at Matepi village, in the Transgogol area of Madang Province, and attacked and captured him. One of the villagers climbed into a tree to obtain a cellphone signal and called the authorities.\n\nTari's appearance in court was delayed due to the injuries he suffered in that assault. He appeared in court in October 2007 charged with sexual offences. The claims of murder were never tested in court. He argued in his defence that \"Those women were flower-girls and this was the work of the minister and permitted by the religion. And I don’t know if the charges laid against me are wrong or right.\" Because he had no legal representation the trial was adjourned until December. He was held in Madang's Beon Prison. In April 2010 it was reported that Tari again attempted escape from custody but was caught quickly afterwards. In October 2010 he was found guilty of four counts of rape, and sentenced to twenty years in prison.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, Tari escaped with 40 other prisoners in a mass breakout from Beon Prison Camp. On 31 August, police reported that Tari had been killed by the villagers in Gal, a small Madang village, two days earlier, allegedly after murdering a local woman. An investigation is pending, although national newspapers have reported that Tari was \"chopped to death\" by the angry villagers.\n"}

The caves are located 6 km south west from Vijayawada, 22 km north east of Guntur City of Andhra Pradesh. It is one of the centrally protected monuments of national importance.\n\nThese caves are said to be found in 7th century. They are associated with the Vishnukundi kings of 420-620 A.D.. These caves are dedicated to Anantha Padmanabha and Lord Narashimha. Buddhist monks used these as Rest Houses.\n\nThese caves were carved out of solid sandstone on a hillside in the 4th to 5th centuries A.D. There are several caves and the best known largest one has four stories with a huge recreated statue of Vishnu in a reclining posture, sculpted from a single block of granite inside the second floor. Undavalli caves are an example of how many Buddhist artifacts and stupas in Andhra were converted into Hindu temples and deities. It was originally a Jain cave resembling the architecture of Udayagiri and Khandgiri. The main cave is one of the earliest examples of Gupta architecture, primarily primitive rock-cut monastery cells carved into the sandstone hills.\nInitially the caves were shaped as a Jain abode and the first floor abode still retains the Jain style; the vihara exhibits Jain monastics and includes tirthankara sculptures. This first level of the cave is a carved vihara and includes Buddhist art work. The site served as the Bhikkhu monastic complex during ancient period. The walls of the caves display sculptures carved by skilled craftsmen.\n\nThe caves are surrounded by the green countryside. From the high hill above the cave overlooking the Krishna River many fine specimens of rock cut architecture can be seen.\n\nIt is an Impressive Four storey rock cut temple with East facing facade of 29m long, 16m wide. There are variation in depth of each floor. Ground floor is an unfinished low pillared hall with 8 pillars and 7 door openings on façade. First storey accommodates triple shrine at back, each with pillared hall in front, originally dedicated to the Trinity (Siva, Vishnu and Brahma).\n\nSculptures on the walls represents Vaishnava deities. Second storey has a pillared rectangular shrine of Lord Vishnu on a Serpent. Sculptures of Shiva and Vaishnava and a few like the Vaishnava Alwars are sculptured later on.

The founding director was Robert Dexter, who had served in a diplomatic role for the American Unitarian Association for more than a decade and had been moved, in particular, by the plight of refugees in Czechoslovakia, a country with a large Unitarian congregation. The organization established an office in Lisbon and the first American Unitarians to be posted there were Rev. Waitstill Hastings Sharp, a minister of the Unitarian Church in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, and his wife Martha. Later, Rev. Charles Joy, Elisabeth Anthony Dexter and Noel Field were recruited to work in the organization's Lisbon and Marseille offices and they, along with many refugee volunteers, expanded the relief and emigration programs. The Sharps were posthumously honored by Israel in 2006 as the second and third Americans to be added to the list of Righteous among the Nations.\n\nThe organization’s first board of directors was chaired by William Emerson, the former dean of the MIT School of Architecture. Other board members included Harold Hitz Burton, mayor of Cleveland, Ohio and a future Supreme Court justice; Percival Brundage, senior partner in the Price Waterhouse and future budget director for President Dwight D. Eisenhower; Louise Wright, chairwoman of the voters department of government and foreign policy for the League of Women Voters.\n\nToday, UUSC is active in coordinating relief efforts around the world and investigating reports of human rights abuses. UUSC has four program areas: Rights in Humanitarian Crisis, Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, and Civil Liberties. Its recent activities have focused on the conflict in Darfur, organizing volunteers to help survivors of the Gulf Coast hurricanes, workers' rights and the human right to water. The organization is also active in lobbying corporations engaged in business with governments that it has identified as abusing basic human rights.\n\n"}
