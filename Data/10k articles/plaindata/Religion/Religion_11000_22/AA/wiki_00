{"id": "6948291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6948291", "title": "Amalickiah", "text": "Amalickiah\n\nIn the Book of Mormon, Amalickiah (; Ameleckiah as a frequent scribal variant in the Original Manuscript) was a Nephite leader of a movement to reestablish a king, specifically himself, as the king of the Nephites. When he failed to gain power through a popular uprising he dissented to the Lamanites becoming their king and using them as a means to gain power over the Nephites. He was killed during the ensuing war.\n\nThe Amalickiahite () movement arose during a power vacuum following the separation of church and state and by the transfer of leadership of the church from Alma the Younger to his son Helaman. Helaman succeeded his father as High Priest over the Nephite Church but did not have any political authority. His father was the last High Priest who also held the post of Chief Judge (or governor) of the Nephites. Alma the Younger had found that the church suffered from neglect due to his political duties and so resigned the latter office.\n\nAmalickiah is described as a large and strong man who was also an eloquent speaker. He may have been a lower (i.e. local) judge, for many of his followers (called Amalickiahites) held that office. It is noted that he was also a member of the Nephite Church, and that the lower judges were members themselves. They were upset with the reforms or \"regulation\" of the church established by Helaman following the last war with the Lamanites. They were angry over the preaching by Helaman and his high priests — So angry that they were willing to kill Helaman and all those that held an opposing view.\n\nCaptain Moroni learned of the Amalickiahites' rebellion, and rallied the Nephite people against it. He raised the Title of Liberty over the capital, and then over every city of the land where the rebellion was taking place. Those that followed the Title of Liberty and the reformed church called themselves Christians. The rebels were soon outnumbered in the land, their hopes for power broken.\n\nAmalickiah led his followers away into the wilderness to join the Lamanites when he realized his political campaign had failed. Moroni did not want their enemy to gain any further strength so he set off in pursuit with the army. Moroni's army defeated the rebels, but Amalickiah and a small band of trusted followers escaped to the land of Nephi.\n\nAmalickiah and his men went to the court of the Lamanite king and persuaded him to issue a call to arms against the Nephites. However, this proved unpopular with the majority of warriors, the Lamanites having just lost a costly war against the Nephites. Amalickiah flattered the king and got appointed to command the loyalists. He is ordered to go and compel the rest of the warriors into the army to fight for the king.\n\nThe rebels outnumbered the loyalist army that Amalickiah commands. Knowing he would likely fail to press the warriors into the army, he came up with plan to use his greatest strengths: flattery and treachery. Setting up camp at the base of a large hill where the rebels were in their defensive position, he secretly sent word to the rebel leader Lehonti that he will betray the loyalists into the rebels' hands if he is made second in command of the rebel army. Lehonti agrees, and Amalickiah sets his own men as guards, allowing the rebel army to approach and surround the loyalist camp. When the loyal warriors woke to see themselves in a hopeless position, they begged Amalickiah to allow them to surrender and join the rebels to save their lives. Amalickiah gains standing with the rebels, \"saves\" his men, and becomes second-in-command of the combined Lamanite army.\n\nThis was not enough for Amalickiah, for he wanted to be king. He slowly poisoned Lehonti while the army is marching to the capital. When Lehonti died on the march, command then fell to Amalickiah. At the capital the Lamanite king got word that his army is approaching with general Amalickiah at the head. The king was pleased and, accompanied by his closest servants, went to meet him. As the king neared, the henchmen of Amalickiah went before him bowing to the king. The king raised his arm beckoning them to rise. As the first henchman does he drew a dagger and thrust it up into the chest of the king. He fell, slain by the assassins.\n\nThe servants of the king then turned to run away. Amalickiah's henchmen shouted to the army that the king has been slain by his own servants. Amalickiah led the warriors to the fallen king and feigns heartache at such treachery. He goaded the warriors, former loyalist and rebel alike, to go and slay the king's servants. Despite pursuit, the servants escape to the Nephites and tell the tale of Amalickiah's deceit.\n\nMeanwhile, as commander of the army, Amalickiah goes to the court to tell the queen the awful news. After telling of the treacherous attack by the king's servants, he brings forth his assassins who swear that the servants fled because of their perfidity. Amalickiah comforts and woos the grieving queen. Soon he marries her to become the next king of the Lamanites.\n\nAs the new king Amalickiah proceeded to aggravate the Lamanites to war against the Nephites. Staying behind with his new queen, he sent his armies to attack the Nephites under the command of Nephite dissenters. Their plan was to attack those cities that had previously shown to be weakest. Unfortunately for them, Captain Moroni had fortified all the Nephite cities, in case of such a sneak attack. The Lamanites proceeded to assault the walls of these \"weak\" cities, never once managing to slay a single Nephite in the process, while losing many men and all their chief captains who led the forlorn hope. They returned to relate the tale of bad news to their king.\n\nKing Amalickiah, however, was not to be deterred. As the Nephites were dealing with king-men, Amalickiah saw his advantage, and began to capture Nephite cities on the eastern coast, well away from Captain Moroni and his main army. After taking seven cities, however, he was met by Teancum whose force stood up to the king. Teancum's warriors wore the Lamanite army down till they withdrew into camp for the night. Teancum sneaked into the king's camp with a trusted aide and killed Amalickiah with a javelin.\n"}
{"id": "99881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99881", "title": "Andy Kaufman", "text": "Andy Kaufman\n\nAndrew Geoffrey Kaufman (; January 17, 1949 – May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, actor, writer, and performance artist. While often called a comedian, Kaufman described himself instead as a \"song and dance man\". He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in a rare introspective interview, \"I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ... The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can.\"\n\nAfter working in small comedy clubs in the early 1970s, Kaufman came to the attention of a wider audience in 1975, when he was invited to perform portions of his act on the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". His Foreign Man character was the basis of his performance as Latka Gravas on the hit television show \"Taxi\" from 1978 until 1983. During this time, he continued to tour comedy clubs and theaters in a series of unique performance art / comedy shows, sometimes appearing as himself and sometimes as obnoxiously rude lounge singer Tony Clifton. He was also a frequent guest on sketch comedy and late-night talk shows, particularly \"Late Night with David Letterman\". In 1982, Kaufman brought his professional wrestling villain act to Letterman's show by way of a staged encounter with Jerry \"The King\" Lawler of the Continental Wrestling Association (although the fact that the altercation was planned in advance was not publicly disclosed for over a decade).\n\nKaufman died of lung cancer in 1984, at the age of 35. Because pranks and elaborate ruses were major elements of his career, persistent rumors have circulated that Kaufman faked his own death as a grand hoax. He continues to be respected for the variety of his characters, his uniquely counterintuitive approach to comedy, and his willingness to provoke negative and confused reactions from audiences.\n\nKaufman was born on January 17, 1949, in New York City, the oldest of three children. His mother was Janice (née Bernstein), a homemaker and former fashion model, and his father was Stanley Kaufman, a jewelry salesman. Andy, along with his younger brother Michael and sister Carol, grew up in a middle-class Jewish family in Great Neck, Long Island. He began performing at children's birthday parties at age 9, playing records and showing cartoons. Kaufman spent much of his youth writing poetry and stories, including an unpublished novel, \"The Hollering Mangoo\", which he completed at age 16. Following a visit to his school from Nigerian musician Babatunde Olatunji, Kaufman began playing the congas. \n\nAfter graduating from Great Neck North High School in 1967, Kaufman took a year off before enrolling at the now defunct two-year Grahm Junior College in Boston, where he studied television production and starred in his own campus television show, \"Uncle Andy's Fun House.\" In August 1969, he hitchhiked to Las Vegas to meet Elvis Presley, showing up unannounced at the International Hotel. Soon after, he began performing at coffee houses and developing his act, as well as writing a one-man play, \"Gosh\" (later renamed \"God\" and published in 2000). After graduating in 1971, he began performing stand-up comedy at various small clubs on the East Coast.\n\nJim Knipfel and Mark Evanier claim that Kaufman was inspired by Dick Shawn.\n\nKaufman first received major attention for his character Foreign Man, who spoke in a meek, high-pitched, heavy-accented voice and claimed to be from \"Caspiar\", a fictional island in the Caspian Sea. It was as this character that Kaufman convinced the owner of the famed New York City comedy club The Improv, Budd Friedman, to allow him to perform on stage.\n\nAs Foreign Man, Kaufman would appear on the stage of comedy clubs, play a recording of the theme from the \"Mighty Mouse\" cartoon show while standing perfectly still, and lip-sync only the line \"Here I come to save the day\" with great enthusiasm. He would proceed to tell a few (purposely poor) jokes and conclude his act with a series of celebrity impersonations, with the comedy arising from the character's obvious ineptitude at impersonation. For example, in his fake accent Kaufman would say to the audience, \"I would like to imitate Meester Carter, de president of de United States\" and then, in exactly the same voice, say \"Hello, I am Meester Carter, de president of de United States. T'ank you veddy much.\"\nAt some point in the performance, usually when the audience was conditioned to Foreign Man's inability to perform a single convincing impression, Foreign Man would announce, \"And now I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley\", turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into a rousing, hip-shaking, excellent rendition of Presley singing one of his hit songs. Like Presley, he would take off his leather jacket during the song and throw it into the audience, but unlike Presley, Foreign Man would immediately ask for it to be returned. After the song's finale, he would take a simple bow and say in his Foreign Man voice, \"T'ank you veddy much.\"\n\nPortions of Kaufman's Foreign Man act were broadcast in the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". The Mighty Mouse number was featured in the October 11, 1975, premiere, while the joke-telling and celebrity impressions (including Elvis) were included in the November 8 broadcast that same year.\n\nKaufman first used his Foreign Man character in nightclubs in the early 1970s, often to tell jokes incorrectly and do weak imitations of famous people before bursting into his Elvis Presley imitation. The character was then changed into Latka Gravas for ABC's sitcom \"Taxi\", appearing in 79 of 114 episodes in 1978-83. Bob Zmuda confirms this: \"They basically were buying Andy's Foreign Man character for the \"Taxi\" character Latka.\" Kaufman's longtime manager George Shapiro encouraged him to take the gig.\n\nKaufman disliked sitcoms and was not happy with the idea of being in one, but Shapiro convinced him that it would quickly lead to stardom, which would earn him money he could then put into his own act. Kaufman agreed to appear in 14 episodes per season, and initially wanted four for Kaufman's alter ego Tony Clifton. After Kaufman deliberately sabotaged Clifton's appearance on the show, however, that part of his contract was dropped.\n\nHis character was given multiple personality disorder, which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode of \"Taxi\", Kaufman's character came down with a condition that made him act like Alex Reiger, the main character played by Judd Hirsch. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was the womanizing Vic Ferrari.\n\nSam Simon, who early in his career was a writer and later showrunner for \"Taxi\", stated in a 2013 interview on Marc Maron's \"WTF\" podcast that the story of Kaufman having been generally disruptive on the show was \"a complete fiction\" largely created by Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a vested interest in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was \"completely professional\" and that he \"told you Tony Clifton was him\", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have \"loved\" Zmuda's version of events.\n\nKaufman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made For Television for \"Taxi\" in 1979 and 1981.\n\nAnother well-known Kaufman character is Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing lounge singer who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Clifton's \"good name\" in order to make money and become famous.\n\nAs a requirement for Kaufman's accepting the offer to star on \"Taxi\", he insisted that Clifton be hired for a guest role on the show as if he were a real person, not a character. After throwing a tantrum on the set, Clifton was fired and escorted from the studio lot by security guards. Much to Kaufman's delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers.\n\nAt the beginning of an April 1979 performance at New York's Carnegie Hall, Kaufman invited his \"grandmother\" to watch the show from a chair he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood up, took her mask off and revealed to the audience that she was actually comedian Robin Williams in disguise.\n\nKaufman also had an elderly woman (Eleanor Cody Gould) pretend to have a heart attack and die on stage, at which point he reappeared on stage wearing a Native American headdress and performed a dance over her body, \"reviving\" her.\n\nThe performance is most famous for Kaufman's ending the show by actually taking the entire audience, in 24 buses, out for milk and cookies. He invited anyone interested to meet him on the Staten Island Ferry the next morning, where the show continued.\n\nThe \"Taxi\" deal with ABC included giving Kaufman a television special/pilot. He came up with \"Andy's Funhouse\", based on an old routine he had developed while in junior college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979. It featured most of Andy's famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children's television character Howdy Doody and the \"Has-been Corner\"). There was also a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with, fearing that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel—which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present. \"Andy's Funhouse\" was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman.\n\nIn March 1980, Kaufman filmed a short segment for an ABC show called \"Buckshot.\" The segment was just over six minutes long and was called \"Uncle Andy's Funhouse\". It featured Kaufman as the host of a children's show for adults, complete with a peanut gallery and Tony Clifton puppet.\n\nIn 1983, a show very similar to \"Andy's Funhouse\" and \"Uncle Andy's Funhouse\" was filmed for PBS's SoundStage program, called \"The Andy Kaufman Show\". It too featured a peanut gallery, and opened in the middle of an interview Kaufman is doing in which he is laughing hysterically. He then proceeds to thank the audience for watching and the credits roll.\n\nIn 1981 Kaufman made three appearances on \"Fridays\", a variety show on ABC that was similar to \"Saturday Night Live\". In his first appearance, during a sketch about four people out on a dinner date who excuse themselves to the restroom to smoke marijuana, Kaufman broke character and refused to say his lines.\n\nIn response, cast member Michael Richards walked off camera and returned with a set of cue cards and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman who responded by splashing Richards with water. Co-producer Jack Burns stormed onto the stage, leading to a brawl on camera before the show abruptly cut away to a commercial.\n\nRichards has claimed that this incident was a staged practical joke that was known only to him, associate producer Burns, and Kaufman, but Melanie Chartoff, who played Kaufman's wife in the sketch, has stated that, just before airtime, Burns told her, Maryedith Burrell, and Richards that Kaufman was going to break the fourth wall.\n\nKaufman appeared the following week in a videotaped apology to the home viewers. Later that year, Kaufman returned to host \"Fridays\". At one point in the show, he invited a \"Lawrence Welk Show\" gospel and standards singer, Kathie Sullivan, on stage to sing a few gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married, then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in Jesus (Kaufman was Jewish). That was also a hoax. Later, following a sketch about a drug-abusing pharmacist, Kaufman was supposed to introduce the band The Pretenders. Instead of introducing the band, he delivered a nervous speech about the harmfulness of drugs while the band stood behind him ready to play. After his speech, he informed the audience that he had talked for too long and had to go to a commercial.\n\nInspired by the theatricality of \"kayfabe\", the staged nature of the sport, and his own tendency to form elaborate hoaxes, Kaufman began wrestling women during his act and proclaimed himself \"Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World\", taking on an aggressive and ridiculous personality based on the characters invented by professional wrestlers. He offered a $1,000 prize to any woman who could pin him. He employed performance artist Laurie Anderson, a friend of his, in this act for a while.\n\nKaufman initially approached the head of the World Wrestling Federation, Vince McMahon Sr., about bringing his act to the New York wrestling territory. McMahon dismissed Kaufman's idea as the elder McMahon was not about to bring \"show business\" into his Pro Wrestling society. Kaufman had by then developed a friendship with wrestling reporter/photographer Bill Apter. After many discussions about Kaufman's desire to be in the pro wrestling business, Apter called Memphis wrestling icon Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and introduced him to Kaufman by telephone.\n\nKaufman finally stepped into the ring (in the Memphis wrestling circuit) with a man—Lawler himself. Kaufman taunted the residents of Memphis by playing \"videos showing residents how to use soap\" and proclaiming the city to be \"the nation's redneck capital\". The ongoing Lawler-Kaufman feud, which often featured Jimmy Hart and other heels in Kaufman's corner, included a number of staged \"works\", such as a broken neck for Kaufman as a result of Lawler's piledriver and a famous on-air fight on a 1982 episode of \"Late Night with David Letterman\".\n\nFor some time after that first match, Kaufman appeared wearing a neck brace, insisting that his injuries were much worse than they really were. Kaufman would continue to defend the Inter-Gender Championship in the Mid-South Coliseum and offered an extra prize, other than the $1,000: that if he were pinned, the woman who pinned him would get to marry him and that Kaufman would also shave his head.\n\nEventually it was revealed that the feud and wrestling matches were staged works, and that Kaufman and Lawler were friends. This was not disclosed until more than 10 years after Kaufman's death, when the Emmy-nominated documentary \"A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman\" aired on NBC in 1995. Jim Carrey, who revealed the secret, later went on to play Kaufman in the 1999 film \"Man on the Moon.\" In a 1997 interview with the \"Memphis Flyer\", Lawler said he had improvised during their first match and the \"Letterman\" incident.\n\nAlthough officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman's neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography \"It's Good to Be the King ... Sometimes\", Lawler detailed how they came up with the angle and kept it quiet. Even though Kaufman's injury was legitimate, the pair exaggerated it. He also said that Kaufman's furious tirade and performance on \"Letterman\" was Kaufman's own idea, including when Lawler slapped Kaufman out of his chair. Promoter Jerry Jarrett later recalled that for two years, he would mail Kaufman payments comparable to what other main-event wrestlers were getting at the time, but Kaufman never deposited the checks.\n\nKaufman appeared in the 1983 film \"My Breakfast with Blassie\" with professional wrestling personality \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie. The film was a parody of the art film \"My Dinner with Andre.\" Lynne Margulies, sister of the film's director, Johnny Legend, appears in it, and became romantically involved with Kaufman.\n\nIn 2002, Kaufman became a playable character in the video game \"Legends of Wrestling II\" and a standard character in 2004's \"\". In 2008, Jakks Pacific produced for their WWE Classic Superstars toy line an action figure two-pack of Kaufman and Lawler, as well as a separate figures release for each of them.\n\nAlthough Kaufman made a name for himself as a guest on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\", his first prime-time appearances were several guest spots as the \"Foreign Man\" on the Dick Van Dyke variety show \"Van Dyke and Company\" in 1976. He appeared four times on \"The Tonight Show\" in 1976–78, and three times on \"The Midnight Special\" in 1972, 1977, and 1981. Kaufman appeared on \"The Dating Game\" in 1978, in character as Foreign Man, and cried when the bachelorette chose Bachelor #1, protesting that he had answered all the questions correctly.\n\nHis \"SNL\" appearances started with the first show, on October 11, 1975. He made 16 \"SNL\" appearances in all, doing routines from his comedy act, such as the Mighty Mouse singalong, Foreign Man, and the Elvis impersonation. After he angered the audience with his female-wrestling routine, Kaufman in January 1983 made a pretaped appearance (his 16th) asking the audience if he should ever appear on the show again, saying he would honor their decision. \"SNL\" ran a phone vote, and 195,544 people voted to \"Dump Andy\" while 169,186 people voted to \"Keep Andy\".\n\nDuring the \"SNL\" episode with the phone poll, many of the cast members stated their admiration for Kaufman's work. After Eddie Murphy read both numbers, he said, \"Now, Andy Kaufman is a friend of mine. Keep that in mind when you call. I don't want to have to punch nobody in America in the face\", and Mary Gross read the Dump Andy phone number at a rate so fast that audiences were unable to catch it. The final tally was read by Gary Kroeger to a cheering audience. As the credits rolled, announcer Don Pardo said, \"This is Don Pardo saying, 'I voted for Andy Kaufman.'\"\n\nKaufman made a number of appearances on the daytime edition of \"The David Letterman Show\" in 1980, and 11 appearances on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" in 1982-83. He made numerous guest spots on other television programs hosted by or starring celebrities like Johnny Cash (1979 Christmas special), Dick Van Dyke, Dinah Shore, Rodney Dangerfield, Cher, Dean Martin, Redd Foxx, Mike Douglas, Dick Clark, and Joe Franklin.\n\nHe appeared in his first theatrical film, \"God Told Me To\", in 1976, in which he portrayed a murderous policeman. He appeared in two other theatrical films, including the 1980 film \"In God We Tru$t\", in which he played a televangelist, and the 1981 film \"Heartbeeps\", in which he played a robot.\n\nLaurie Anderson worked alongside Kaufman for a time in the 1970s, acting as a sort of \"straight man\" in a number of his Manhattan and Coney Island performances. One of these performances included getting on a ride that people stand in and get spun around. After everyone was strapped in, Kaufman would start saying how he did not want to be on the ride in a panicked tone and eventually cry. Anderson later described these performances in her 1995 album, \"The Ugly One with the Jewels\".\n\nIn 1983, Kaufman appeared on Broadway with Deborah Harry in the play \"Teaneck Tanzi: The Venus Flytrap\". It closed after just two performances.\n\nKaufman never married. His daughter, Maria Bellu-Colonna (born 1969), was the child of an out-of-wedlock relationship with a high-school girlfriend and was placed for adoption. Bellu-Colonna learned in 1992 that she was Kaufman's daughter when she traced her biological roots by winning a petition of the State of New York for her biological mother's surname. She soon reunited with her mother, grandfather, uncle, and aunt. Bellu-Colonna's daughter, Brittany, briefly appeared in \"Man on the Moon\", playing Kaufman's sister Carol as a young child.\n\nIn December 1969, Kaufman learned Transcendental Meditation at college. According to a BBC article, he used the technique \"to build confidence and take his act to comedy clubs\". For the rest of his life, Kaufman meditated and performed yoga three hours a day. From February to June 1971 he trained as a teacher of transcendental meditation in Majorca, Spain.\n\nLynne Margulies, who met Kaufman during the filming of his \"My Breakfast With Blassie\" (she was in the film), was in a relationship with Kaufman from 1982 until his death in 1984. Margulies later co-directed the 1989 Kaufman wrestling compilation \"I'm From Hollywood\", and published the 2009 book \"Dear Andy Kaufman, I Hate Your Guts!\"\n\nAt Thanksgiving dinner on Long Island in November 1983, several family members openly expressed worry about Kaufman's persistent coughing. He claimed that he had been coughing for nearly a month, visited his doctor, and been told that nothing was wrong. When he returned to Los Angeles, he consulted another physician, then checked himself into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for a series of medical tests. A few days later, he was diagnosed with large-cell carcinoma, an extremely rare type of lung cancer.\n\nAfter audiences were shocked by his gaunt appearance during January 1984 performances, Kaufman acknowledged that he had an unspecified illness which he hoped to cure with natural medicine, including a diet of all fruits and vegetables, among other measures. Kaufman received palliative radiotherapy, but by then the cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. His final public appearance was at the premiere of \"My Breakfast With Blassie\" in March 1984, where he appeared thin and had a partially shaved head. The following day, he and Lynne Margulies flew to Baguio, Philippines, where as a last resort, Kaufman received treatments of a pseudoscientific procedure called psychic surgery.\n\nKaufman died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 16, 1984, at the age of 35.\n\nKaufman often spoke of faking his own death as a grand hoax, with rumors persisting, often fueled by sporadic appearances of Kaufman's character Tony Clifton at comedy clubs after his death.\n\"Clifton\" performed a year after Kaufman's death at The Comedy Store benefit in Kaufman's honor, with members of his entourage in attendance, and during the 1990s made several appearances at Los Angeles nightclubs. Jim Carrey, who portrayed Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\", stated on the NBC special \"Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman\" that the person doing the Clifton character was Bob Zmuda. Kaufman's official website states that his death was not a hoax.\n\nIn 2013, responding to rumors following the appearance of an actress who claimed to be Kaufman's daughter and that he was still alive, Los Angeles County Coroner's office re-released Kaufman's death certificate to confirm he was indeed deceased and buried at Beth David Cemetery.\n\nIn 2014, Zmuda and Lynne Margulies, Kaufman's girlfriend at the time of his death, coauthored \"Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally\", a book claiming that Kaufman's death was indeed a prank, and that he would soon be revealing himself, as his upper limit on the \"prank\" was 30 years.\n\nComedian Elayne Boosler, who dated and lived with Kaufman and credits him with encouraging her to do comedy, wrote an article for \"Esquire\" in November 1984, in his memory. She also dedicated her 1986 Showtime special \"Party of One\" to Kaufman. An audio recording of Kaufman offering encouragement to Boosler is featured in the intro.\n\nIn 1992, the band R.E.M. released the album \"Automatic for the People\", which featured the Andy Kaufman-themed song \"Man on the Moon\". The song's video also featured footage of Kaufman. On March 29, 1995, NBC aired \"A Comedy Salute To Andy Kaufman\". This special featured clips of many of Kaufman's performances, as well as commentary from some of his friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nComedian Richard Lewis in \"A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman\" said of him: \"No one has ever done what Andy did, and did it as well, and no one will ever. Because he did it first. So did Buster Keaton, so did Andy.\" Carl Reiner recalled his distinction in the comedy world: Did Andy influence comedy? No. Because nobody's doing what he did. Jim Carrey was influenced—not to do what Andy did, but to follow his own drummer. I think Andy did that for a lot of people. Follow your own drumbeat. You didn't have to go up there and say 'take my wife, please.' You could do anything that struck you as entertaining. It gave people freedom to be themselves.Reiner also said of Kaufman: \"Nobody can see past the edges, where the character begins and he ends.\"\n\nJim Carrey portrayed Kaufman in the 1999 biopic film \"Man on the Moon\", directed by Miloš Forman; the film took its title from the band R.E.M.'s song of the same name. R.E.M. also did the score for the film and recorded another Kaufman tribute song, \"The Great Beyond\". Carrey's portrayal was met with critical acclaim, earning him a Golden Globe Award for his performance. Forman named his twin sons, born in 1998, Andrew and James, after Kaufman and Carrey. In July 2012, Kaufman's play \"Bohemia West\" was staged in Providence, Rhode Island. Comedian Vernon Chatman compiled and produced Kaufman's first album, \"Andy and His Grandmother\"—via Drag City in 2013.\n\nAndy Kaufman is one of the featured celebrities in the 2005 children's book \"Different Like Me: My Book of Autism Heroes\". Actress Cindy Williams, who was good friends with Kaufman, devoted an entire chapter of her autobiography, \"Shirley, I Jest!: A Storied Life,\" to him. \"The Chris Gethard Show\" paid homage to the Kaufman \"Fridays\" incident in a goof on an episode with comedian Brett Davis throwing water on someone's face.\n\nAt The Comedy Store comedy club in Los Angeles there is a neon likeness of Kaufman on display. The club also features on their menu the \"Andy Kaufman Special\", which consists of \"two cookies and a glass of ice cold milk\". The Vic Ferrari Band took its name from Kaufman's \"Taxi\" character. According to executive producer Bill Oakley, the 1996 \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Bart the Fink\", in which Krusty the Clown fakes his death, was partially inspired by the rumors of Kaufman's faked death.\n\nAl Jean, co-creator of the animated series \"The Critic\", has stated that the first season drawing of Jon Lovitz's character Jay Sherman was loosely based on Kaufman.\n\nFor the 2015 Andy Kaufman Award show, Two Boots Pizza created a special Andy Kaufman pie.

The archaic Javanese prose title translates as \"Palace of the risen mountain\".\n\nThe structure is in traditional Javanese architectural style and occupies parts of the Mangkunegaran Royal Cemetery complex. It is approximately 300 metres from the burial sites of the Solonese royals Mangkunegara I, II and III. Former Indonesian President Suharto was buried in Astana Giribangun on 29 January 2008 with full state military honours following his death in Jakarta the day before. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono presided over the ceremony. Suharto was buried beside his late wife, Mrs (Ibu) Tien Soeharto (Siti Hartinah Soeharto, who had died on April 28, 1996) and her mother.\n\nIn line with traditional Javanese practice, Suharto's family held a memorial ceremony at the Astana Giribangun in October 2010, 1,000 days after Suharto's death.\n\nThe choice of the site caused some controversy at the time. Many Javanese believed Ibu Suharto not to be of true noble blood but, rather, the descendent of a faithful court servant (who was born a commoner). The Mangkunegaran Court reconciled this controversy by decreeing that Suharto could indeed build an Astana (\"istana\" in bahasa Indonesia, or \"palace\") but that it could not be any higher than a pre-existing royal tomb, Astana Mangadeg, near the Astana Giribangun was to be established. The Astana Mangadeg was considered to in a location with special spiritual features by many dukun, spiritualists and soothsayers for the strongly kejawen or kebatinan Suharto to meditate and derive charisma or \"shakti\" (magic).\n\n"}

{"id": "175568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175568", "title": "Bhakti movement", "text": "Bhakti movement\n\nThe Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism and later revolutionised in Sikhism. It originated in eighth-century south India (now Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards. It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.\n\nThe Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, and some sub-religions were Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism. The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nThe movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's caste of birth or gender. Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement ever was a reform or rebellion of any kind. They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualisation of ancient Vedic traditions.\n\nScriptures of the Bhakti movement include the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavata Purana and Padma Purana.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"bhakti\" is derived from the root \"bhaj\", which means \"divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to\". The word also means \"attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation\".\n\nThe meaning of the term \"Bhakti\" is analogous but different than Kama. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection. Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement. Bhakti movement in Hinduism refers to ideas and engagement that emerged in the medieval era on love and devotion to religious concepts built around one or more gods and goddesses. One who practices \"bhakti\" is called a \"bhakta\".\n\nAncient Indian texts, dated to be from the 1st millennium BCE, such as the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the Katha Upanishad and the Bhagavad Gita mention Bhakti.\n\nThe last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, 6.23, uses the word Bhakti as follows,\n\nThis verse is notable for the use of the word \"Bhakti\", and has been widely cited as among the earliest mentions of \"the love of God\". Scholars have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms \"Bhakti\" and \"God\" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the medieval and modern era Bhakti traditions found in India. Max Muller states that the word \"Bhakti\" appears only in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later insertion and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later \"Sandilya Sutras\". Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 is also notable for its use of the word \"Deva Prasada\" (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that \"Deva\" in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to \"pantheistic Brahman\" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean \"gift or grace of his Soul\".\n\nDoris Srinivasan states that the Upanishad is a treatise on theism, but it creatively embeds a variety of divine images, an inclusive language that allows \"three Vedic definitions for personal deity\". The Upanishad includes verses wherein God can be identified with the Supreme (Brahman-Atman, Self, Soul) in Vedanta monistic theosophy, verses that support dualistic view of Samkhya doctrines, as well as the synthetic novelty of triple Brahman where a triune exists as the divine soul (Deva, theistic God), individual soul (self) and nature (Prakrti, matter). Tsuchida writes that the Upanishad syncretically combines monistic ideas in Upanishad and self-development ideas in Yoga with personification of Shiva-Rudra deity. Hiriyanna interprets the text to be introducing \"personal theism\" in the form of Shiva Bhakti, with a shift to monotheism but in henotheistic context where the individual is encouraged to discover his own definition and sense of God.\n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gita\", a post-Vedic scripture composed in 5th to 2nd century BCE, introduces \"bhakti marga\" (the path of faith/devotion) as one of three ways to spiritual freedom and release, the other two being \"karma marga\" (the path of works) and \"jnana marga\" (the path of knowledge). In verses 6.31 through 6.47 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna as an avatar of deity Vishnu, describes \"bhakti yoga\" and loving devotion, as one of the several paths to the highest spiritual attainments.\n\nShandilya and Narada are credited with two Bhakti texts, the \"Shandilya Bhakti Sutra\" and \"Narada Bhakti Sutra\".\n\nThe Bhakti movement originated in South India during the seventh to eighth century CE, spread northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and Maharashtra, and gained wide acceptance in fifteenth-century Bengal and northern India.\n\nThe movement started with the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars, who lived between 5th and 9th century AD. Their efforts ultimately helped spread \"bhakti\" poetry and ideas throughout India by the 12th–18th century CE.\n\nThe Alvars, which literally means \"those immersed in God\", were Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they travelled from one place to another. They established temple sites such as Srirangam, and spread ideas about Vaishnavism. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabhandham, developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on \"bhakti\", have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that \"bhakti\" movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.\n\nLike the Alvars, the Saiva Nayanar poets were influential. The \"Tirumurai\", a compilation of hymns on Shiva by sixty-three Nayanar poet-saints, developed into an influential scripture in Shaivism. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread spiritual ideas built around Shiva. Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets influenced Hindu texts that came to be revered all over India.\n\nSome scholars state that the Bhakti movement's rapid spread in India in the 2nd millennium, was in part a response to the arrival of Islam and subsequent Islamic rule in India and Hindu-Muslim conflicts. This view is contested by some scholars, with Rekha Pande stating that singing ecstatic bhakti hymns in local language was a tradition in south India before Muhammad was born. According to Pande, the psychological impact of Muslim conquest may have initially contributed to community-style bhakti by Hindus. Yet other scholars state that Muslim invasions, their conquering of Hindu Bhakti temples in south India and seizure/melting of musical instruments such as cymbals from local people, was in part responsible for the later relocation or demise of singing Bhakti traditions in the 18th century.\n\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the nature of Bhakti movement may have been affected by the \"surrender to God\" daily practices of Islam when it arrived in India. In turn it influenced devotional practices in Islam such as Sufism, and other religions in India from 15th century onwards, such as Sikhism, Christianity, and Jainism.\n\nKlaus Witz, in contrast, traces the history and nature of Bhakti movement to the Upanishadic and the Vedanta foundations of Hinduism. He writes, that in virtually every Bhakti movement poet, \"the Upanishadic teachings form an all-pervasive substratum, if not a basis. We have here a state of affairs that has no parallel in the West. Supreme Wisdom, which can be taken as basically non-theistic and as an independent wisdom tradition (not dependent on the Vedas), appears fused with highest level of bhakti and with highest level of God realization.\"\n\nThe Bhakti movement witnessed a surge in Hindu literature in regional languages, particularly in the form of devotional poems and music. This literature includes the writings of the Alvars and Nayanars, poems of Andal, Basava, Bhagat Pipa, Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi, Kabir, Nanak (founder of Sikhism), Tulsidas, Gusainji, Ghananand, Ramananda (founder of Ramanandi Sampradaya), Sripadarajaa , Vyasatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanakadasa, Vijaya Dasa, Six goswamis of Vrindavan ,Raskhan, Ravidas, Jayadeva Goswami, Namdev, Eknath, Tukaram, Mirabai, Ramprasad Sen, Sankardev, Vallabha Acharya, Narsinh Mehta, Gangasati and the teachings of saints like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nThe earliest writers from the 7th to 10th century CE known to have influenced the poet-saints driven movements include, Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Sundarar, Nammalvar, Adi Shankara, Manikkavacakar and Nathamuni. Several 11th and 12th century writers developed different philosophies within the Vedanta school of Hinduism, which were influential to the Bhakti tradition in medieval India. These include Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha and Nimbarka. These writers championed a spectrum of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism, qualified nondualism and absolute monism.\n\nThe Bhakti movement of Hinduism saw two ways of imaging the nature of the divine (Brahman) – \"Nirguna\" and \"Saguna\". \"Nirguna\" Brahman was the concept of the Ultimate Reality as formless, without attributes or quality. \"Saguna\" Brahman, in contrast, was envisioned and developed as with form, attributes and quality. The two had parallels in the ancient pantheistic unmanifest and theistic manifest traditions, respectively, and traceable to Arjuna-Krishna dialogue in the Bhagavad Gita. It is the same Brahman, but viewed from two perspectives, one from \"Nirguni\" knowledge-focus and other from \"Saguni\" love-focus, united as Krishna in the Gita. \"Nirguna\" bhakta's poetry were \"Jnana-shrayi\", or had roots in knowledge. \"Saguna\" bhakta's poetry were \"Prema-shrayi\", or with roots in love. In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion, where the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee.\n\nJeaneane Fowler states that the concepts of Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, at the root of Bhakti movement theosophy, underwent more profound development with the ideas of Vedanta school of Hinduism, particularly those of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, and Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta. Two 12th-century influential treatises on bhakti were \"Sandilya Bhakti Sutra\" – a treatise resonating with Nirguna-bhakti, and \"Narada Bhakti Sutra\" – a treatise that leans towards Saguna-bhakti.\n\n\"Nirguna\" and \"Saguna\" Brahman concepts of the Bhakti movement has been a baffling one to scholars, particularly the \"Nirguni\" tradition because it offers, states David Lorenzen, \"heart-felt devotion to a God without attributes, without even any definable personality\". Yet given the \"mountains of \"Nirguni\" bhakti literature\", adds Lorenzen, bhakti for \"Nirguna Brahman\" has been a part of the reality of the Hindu tradition along with the bhakti for \"Saguna Brahman\". These were two alternate ways of imagining God during the bhakti movement.\n\nThe Bhakti movement was a devotional transformation of medieval Hindu society, wherein Vedic rituals or alternatively ascetic monk-like lifestyle for moksha gave way to individualistic loving relationship with a personally defined god. Salvation which was previously considered attainable only by men of Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya castes, became available to everyone. Most scholars state that Bhakti movement provided women and members of the Shudra and untouchable communities an inclusive path to spiritual salvation. Some scholars disagree that the Bhakti movement was premised on such social inequalities.\n\nPoet-saints grew in popularity, and literature on devotional songs in regional languages became profuse. These poet-saints championed a wide range of philosophical positions within their society, ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta. Kabir, a poet-saint for example, wrote in Upanishadic style, the state of knowing truth:\n\nThe early 15th-century Bhakti poet-sant Pipa stated,\n\nThe impact of the Bhakti movement in India was similar to that of the Protestant Reformation of Christianity in Europe. It evoked shared religiosity, direct emotional and intellection of the divine, and the pursuit of spiritual ideas without the overhead of institutional superstructures. Practices emerged bringing new forms of spiritual leadership and social cohesion among the medieval Hindus, such as community singing, chanting together of deity names, festivals, pilgrimages, rituals relating to Saivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Many of these regional practices have survived into the modern era.\n\nThe Bhakti movement introduced new forms of voluntary social giving such as \"Seva\" (service, for example to a temple or \"guru\" school or community construction), \"Dāna\" (charity), and community kitchens with free shared food. Of community kitchen concepts, the vegetarian Guru ka Langar introduced by Nanak became a well established institution over time, starting with northwest India, and expanding to everywhere Sikh communities are found. Other saints such as Dadu Dayal championed similar social movement, a community that believed in Ahimsa (non-violence) towards all living beings, social equality, and vegetarian kitchen, as well as mutual social service concepts. Bhakti temples and matha (Hindu monasteries) of India adopted social functions such as relief to victims after natural disaster, helping the poor and marginal farmers, providing community labor, feeding houses for the poor, free hostels for poor children and promoting folk culture.\n\nSome scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions. In Sikhism, \"nirguni Bhakti\" is emphasised – devotion to a divine without Gunas (qualities or form), but it accepts both nirguni and saguni forms of the divine.\n\nThe \"Guru Granth Sahib\", the scripture of the Sikhs, contains the hymns of the Sikh gurus, thirteen Hindu bhagats, and two Muslim bhagats. Some of the Bhagats whose hymns were included in the Guru Granth Sahib, were bhakti poets who taught their ideas before the birth of Guru Nanak – the first of Sikh Guru. The thirteen Hindu bhagats whose hymns were entered into the text, were poet saints of the Bhakti movement, and included Ramananda, Namdev, Pipa, Ravidas, Beni, Bhikhan, Dhanna, Jayadeva, Parmanand, Sadhana, Sain, Surdas, Trilochan, while the two Muslim bhagats were Kabir and Sufi saint Farid. Most of the 5,894 hymns in the Sikh scripture came from the Sikh gurus, and rest from the Bhagats. The three highest contributions in the Sikh scripture of non-Sikh bhagats were from Bhagat Kabir (292 hymns), Bhagat Farid (134 hymns), and Bhagat Namdev (60 hymns).\n\nWhile Sikhism was influenced by Bhakti movement, and incorporated hymns from the Bhakti poet saints, it was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement. Sikhism, for instance, disagreed with some of the views of Bhakti saints Kabir and Ravidas.\n\nGuru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism, was a Bhakti saint. He taught, states Jon Mayled, that the most important form of worship is Bhakti. \"Nam-simran\" – the realisation of God – is an important Bhakti practice in Sikhism. Guru Arjan, in his \"Sukhmani Sahib\", recommended the true religion is one of loving devotion to God. The Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib includes suggestions for a Sikh to perform constant Bhakti. The Bhakti themes in Sikhism also incorporate Shakti (power) ideas.\n\nSome Sikh sects outside the Punjab-region of India, such as those found in Maharashtra and Bihar, practice Aarti with lamps in a Gurdwara. \"Arti\" and devotional prayer ceremonies are also found in Ravidassia religion, previously part of Sikhism.\n\nBhakti has been a prevalent practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (\"Jina\") and human \"gurus\" are considered superior beings and venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers. John Cort suggests that the \"bhakti\" movement in later Hinduism and Jainism may share roots in \"vandan\" and \"pujan\" concepts of the Jaina tradition.\n\nMedieval-era bhakti traditions among non-theistic Indian traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism have been reported by scholars, wherein the devotion and prayer ceremonies were dedicated to an enlightened guru, primarily Buddha and Jina Mahavira respectively, as well as others. Karel Werner notes that \"Bhatti\" (Bhakti in Pali) has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, \"there can be no doubt that deep devotion or \"bhakti / bhatti\" does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days\".\n\nBhakti, according to William Dyrness, has been a \"point of convergence\" between Christian gospel tradition and the Hindu devotional tradition. It has helped Indian Christians devote themselves to God as distinct from his creation, and as a personal being to love, to expect grace from, through self-giving devotion. Songs were composed by poets such as A.J. Appasamy, Sadhu Sundar Singh and other early converts in the early twentieth century that were rich in lyrics and brought out the mysticism, legends and meaning of Christianity. According to Kugler, some of the pioneers of bhakti in Christian sects in India include Murari David.\n\nPostmodern scholars question whether the 19th- and early 20th-century theories about Bhakti movement in India, its origin, nature and history is accurate. Pechilis in her book on Bhakti movement, for example, states\n\nMadeleine Biardeau states, as does Jeanine Miller, that Bhakti movement was neither a reform nor a sudden innovation, but the continuation and expression of ideas to be found in Vedas, Bhakti marga teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, the Katha Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad.\n\nJohn Stratton Hawley describes recent scholarship which questions the old theory of Bhakti movement origin and \"story of south-moves-north\", then states that the movement had multiple origins, mentioning Brindavan in north India as another center. Hawley describes the controversy and disagreements between Indian scholars, quotes Hegde's concern that \"Bhakti movement was a reform\" theory has been supported by \"cherry-picking particular songs from a large corpus of Bhakti literature\" and that if the entirety of the literature by any single author such as \"Basava\" is considered along with its historical context, there is neither reform nor a need for reform.\n\nSheldon Pollock writes that the Bhakti movement was neither a rebellion against Brahmins and the upper castes nor a rebellion against the Sanskrit language, because many of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins and from upper castes, and because much of the early and later Bhakti poetry and literature was in Sanskrit. Further, states Pollock, evidence of Bhakti trends in ancient southeast Asian Hinduism in the 1st millennium CE, such as those in Cambodia and Indonesia where Vedic era is unknown, and where upper caste Tamil Hindu nobility and merchants introduced Bhakti ideas of Hinduism, suggest the roots and the nature of Bhakti movement to be primarily spiritual and political quest instead of rebellion of some form.\n\nJohn Guy states that the evidence of Hindu temples and Chinese inscriptions from 8th century CE about Tamil merchants, presents Bhakti motifs in Chinese trading towns, particularly the Kaiyuan Temple (Quanzhou). These show Saivite, Vaishnavite and Hindu Brahmin monasteries revered Bhakti themes in China.\n\nScholars increasingly are dropping, states Karen Pechilis, the old premises and the language of \"radical otherness, monotheism and reform of orthodoxy\" for Bhakti movement. Many scholars are now characterising the emergence of Bhakti in medieval India as a revival, reworking and recontextualisation of the central themes of the Vedic traditions.\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\n"}

A major Jewish denomination in the U.S., Conservative Judaism has wrestled with homosexuality and bisexuality as a matter of Jewish law and institutional policy. As with other branches of Judaism debating the acceptability of sexual orientations other than heterosexuality, Conservative Jews faced both long-standing, rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct as well as increasing demands for change in the movement's policies toward gays, bisexuals, and lesbians. Previously, the Conservative movement had changed its policies toward women, for example, by allowing the ordination of women as rabbis in 1983. Similarly, the Conservative leadership has been asked to stop discriminating against gay, bisexual, and lesbian people. This goal has been partially completed with the approval of the ordination of gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis in 2006 and of same-sex marriage ceremonies under Jewish law in 2012; However, the Conservative decision did not call same-sex marriages kiddushin, the traditional Jewish legal term for marriage, because that act of consecration is nonegalitarian and gender-specific. In the traditional kiddushin ceremony, a pair of blessings is recited and the bridegroom gives his bride a ring, proclaiming that he is marrying his bride “according to the laws of Moses and Israel.”.\n\nIn Conservative Judaism, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly makes the movement's decisions concerning Jewish law. The CJLS consistently refused to pass several proposed takkanot concerning the Levitical prohibitions on male-male anal sex, but also on all forms of homosexual intimacy in general. In 1992, the CJLS action affirmed its traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, blessing same-sex unions, and ordaining openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian clergy. However, these prohibitions grew increasingly controversial within the Conservative movement. Regarding ordination, a major criticism for LGBT ordination is not that members of the LGBT movement are not decent individuals. Rather, a widely held view is that Rabbis must be an example for the community, and it would be in direct opposition to the prohibition of gay sex to ordain someone who violates that Jewish law.\n\nA variety of liberal proposals had been brought forth in the non-Orthodox community, including some by Rabbinical Assembly rabbis. Some argued that a change in Jewish understanding and law on this issue must change due to new information about the biology and genetics concerning human sexuality. Others argued that a change was required solely on ethical grounds. No such papers were accepted by the CJLS, as Conservative Judaism sees itself as bound by halakhah.\n\nHowever, these arguments were soon expanded upon within more formal halakhic responsa, one of the most prominent by Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson. He used historical, sociological and ethical considerations to argue that homosexuality, as it is now understood today, was not described by the Torah, or understood by traditional rabbis. As such, one would be able to restrict the understanding of the Torah prohibition to cases not being considered today. His views were considered important, but they were not accepted, by themselves, as halakhically convincing. A few years later Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff used these arguments in his case for re-evaluating Conservative Judaism's stand on sexual orientation, but held that Artson's paper was insufficiently halakhically rigorous. Dorff studied the issue of coercion, arguing that people who were innately homosexual due to biology were not to be regarded as sinning. His early papers on the subject began to gain acceptance among a minority of RA rabbis, but ultimately it was made clear that the CJLS would not accept this argument as sufficient.\n\nTwo additional papers, one by Rabbi Gordon Tucker and one by Rabbis Myron Geller, Robert Fine, and David Fine, went further than Dorff's paper. Tucker's paper stated that it is necessary to expand the definition of the halakhic process, and the Geller, Fine, and Fine paper redefined the corpus of Halakha as the representing the evolving beliefs and ideals of the Jewish people of a particular time and place as distinct from representing an infallible Divine will. While both papers had the support of at least 6 members, a majority of the CJLS found that both papers represented so extensive a change that they could not be accepted as a mere changes of Jewish law, but each should be regarded as a Takkanah that would uproot a Torah prohibition if passed. Under the CJLS rules, once a majority of the committee found a responsum to be a Takkanah, accepting it would require a majority of the Committee (13 of 25 votes), while an ordinary responsum could be accepted as a valid alternative with as few as 6 of 25 votes.\n\nOn December 6, 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted diametrically opposed responsa on the issue of sexual orientation. The CJLS's action permits each congregational rabbi and rabbinical school to decide which responsum to adopt and hence set its own policy on the subject. The adoption of dual, contradictictory responsa represents a straddling of the contemporary societal divide over sexual matters. It also represents a sharp change from previous Conservative policy, which in 1993 had adopted a consensus position reaffirming a blanket prohibition on homosexual conduct while welcoming gay, bisexual, and lesbian people as members.\n\nOne responsum, by Rabbis Elliot N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner, reduced the extent of traditional restrictions and substantially changed Conservative views on homosexual conduct. It characterized most such restrictions as rabbinic in character. It found rabbinic restrictions subject to reconsideration by the CJLS under its interpretation of the principle of Kavod HaBriyot, the Talmudic rule of legal reasoning that rabbinic (but not Biblical) restrictions can be overridden on the basis of \"respect for others\" or \"human dignity\". Holding that the concept of \"kavod habriyot\" interpreted as human dignity reflects Conservative Judaism's evolving understanding of human nature, it found rabbinic restrictions on homosexual conduct inconsistent with human dignity contemporarily understood and accordingly declared such restrictions lifted. Finding that it lacked authority under the \"kavod habriyot\" principle to lift biblical prohibitions, it analyzed the Biblical passages involved and found that male-male anal sex was the sole \"De'oraitha\" (Biblical) restrictions. It held that as a Biblical prohibition such conduct remained prohibited in Conservative Judaism. The responsum permitted Conservative rabbis to allow same-sex union ceremonies, and gave the option for Conservative rabbinical schools to admit and ordain openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis. It held that same-sex couples should be presumed not to engage in prohibited conduct in the same way that Conservative Judaism presumes that married heterosexual couples observe sexual prohibitions such as Niddah.\n\nThe responsum begins with a quote from Rabbi Abraham Yitzhak HaKohen Kook,\n\nAfter a discussion of contemporary theories of sexuality and a warning against promiscuity, the responsum interprets Leviticus and as pertaining to male-male anal sex only:\n\nThe responsum also insisted that Jewish law could not be interpreted any more permissively:\n\nThe responsum described rabbinic prohibitions on sexual relations as mere fences, many of which, it said, the Conservative movement had already lifted. It compared Rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct to strictures on a husband approaching or touching his wife during the Niddah (post-menstrual) period:\n\nThis teshuvah makes a distinction between a Torah mitzvah and later rabbinical fence laws. It argues (page 8) that:\n\nThe responsum questioned whether requiring celibacy for same-sex couples was feasible, quoting Deutoronomy :\n\nThe responsum invoked and extensively commented on the concept of \"Kevod HaBriyot\", \"human dignity,\" noting that the concept is traditionally limited to Rabbinic enactments:\n\nAfter an extensive discussion of this principle, the responsum applies it to declare all rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct overridden, leaving only what it finds to be the biblical one:\n\nIn conclusion, the responsum declined to rule on the status of same-sex relationships, but declared that \"the celebration of such a union is appropriate.\"\n\nThe CJLS also adopted two restrictive responsa, one as a majority and one as a minority opinion. The majority responsum, by Rabbi Joel Roth, was also adopted by 13 votes. It maintained traditional prohibitions on homosexual conduct and forbade Conservative rabbis from blessing same-sex unions and rabbinical schools from ordaining gay, bisexual, and lesbian clergy. On December 10, Rabbi Roth published an editorial in the Jewish Theological Seminary's newsletter \"JTS News\" providing some of the reasoning behind his responsum and explaining why he resigned following the CJLS's vote.\"\n\nAccording to Rabbi Roth, the central problem with the permissive responsum is that it adopted a claim that the Biblical prohibition on homosexual conduct is limited to anal sex only based on insufficient support in precedent, the view of only \"one sage\". Rabbi Roth argued that it is impermissible to adapt such a minority view:\n\nRabbi Roth also said that \"Even if the prohibition against sexual behavior other than male intercourse is rabbinic in authority and not biblical, what justifies our abrogating that prohibition?\" He argued that the Talmudic concept of Kavod HaBriyot, which the permissive responsum used as justification for doing so, is simply not the same thing as the idea of \"human dignity\" in contemporary liberalism:\n\nRabbi Roth stated that in his perception, the supporters of the permissive responsum were blinded by their predisposition to rule favorably and were unable to view the issue with a dispassionate legal mind.\n\nRabbi Roth argued that the halakhic legitimacy of the Conservative movement was at stake:\n\nRabbi Roth ended by articulating what he regarded as the fundamental difference between the traditionalist and the liberal wings of the Conservative movement. From the traditionalist point of view, acceptance of the hypothesis that the Torah was transmitted through multiple manuscripts and redactors in no way changes its status as a Divine, \"legally infallible\" document, a \"given\" reality to which any theological theory must conform:\n\nRabbi Leonard Levy's responsum, adopted as a minority opinion by six votes, delineated ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.\n\nThe CJLS rejected a proposed responsum by Rabbi Gordon Tucker which would have lifted all restrictions on homosexual conduct. Although it gained seven votes, the minimum to accept a responsum, it was classified as a takkanah (legislative decree) rather than a judicial interpretation. By CJLS procedural rules a takkanah requires 13 votes to pass. Accordingly, it was published as a dissenting opinion with a note that \"concurring and dissenting opinions are not official positions of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards\". The fundamental premise of the dissenting opinion was that the Torah is not infallible, legally or otherwise, but is subject to reconsideration based on subsequent knowledge:\n\nRabbis Myron Geller, Robert Fine, and David Fine wrote a dissent arguing for complete abolition of strictures against homosexual conduct, and explicit recognition of same-sex religious commitment ceremonies, on grounds that strictures were no longer socially relevant and religious support was now socially required. The opinion characterized Halakha as\n\nThe responsum argued that so regarded, Halakah can and should be updated to reflect changed values and social circumstances as they arise.\n\nThe consequences of the decision have been mixed, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nOn the one hand, four members of the Committee, Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, Mayer Rabinowitz, and Joseph Prouser, resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change. On the other hand, the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies of the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it would immediately begin admitting gay, bisexual, and lesbian students as soon as the law committee passed a policy that sanctions such ordination. On March 26, 2007, the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program .\n\nMeanwhile, many Conservative synagogues outside of the US, which have historically been somewhat more traditional than the American movement, continued to maintain a complete ban on homosexual conduct, gay, bisexual, and lesbian clergy, and same-sex unions. The head of the Israeli Masorti Movement's \"Vaad Halakha\" (equivalent to the CJLS), Rabbi David Golinkin, wrote the CJLS protesting its reconsideration of the traditional ban on homosexual conduct. The Masorti movements in Argentina and the United Kingdom and the Neologs in Hungary at first indicated that they will not admit or ordain homosexual rabbinical students.\n\nThe Masorti Movement's Israeli Seminary also rejected a change in its view of the status of homosexual conduct, stating that \"Jewish law has traditionally prohibited homosexuality.\" However, the Seminary reversed its position in April 2012, when it approved the ordination of gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis in Israel.\n\nOn June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13-0 vote. The British Masorti Movement voted to allow its rabbis to conduct same-sex marriages in 2014. However, each of the 12 Masorti communities will be free to decide, whether they want to conduct same-sex marriage or remain only with heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe Torah mentions explicitly two times that male homosexuality is prohibited. Once in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13, directed at men, but interpreted for both genders in the Conservative movement and Halacha overall. While lesbian acts are never discussed directly in Biblical texts, the law extends to men and women based on religious interpretations of the text. The 2006 decision ruled on anal sex in particular, leaving room for interpretation for Jewish lesbian couples who do not participate in this act. \n\nProgress has been made for same-sex couples in Conservative Judaism, where they are now allowed to marry and receive guidance and support. In 2012, the Conservative movement endorsed gay marriage and provided guidelines for same-sex divorce. While conservative Judaism blesses same-sex marriage, it still does not allow gay men to have anal sex precisely because of a verse in the Bible, and the movement recommends that bisexual people pursue heterosexual relationships. The Conservative movement also believes that heterosexuality is the ideal sexual orientation. Conservative Judaism does fall one step behind the Reform movement, where the Reform movement recognizes same-sex marriages as \"kiddushin.\" The two Biblical verses continue to cause trouble for the Conservative movement's interpretation of this text. \n\nRegarding rights, in 2013, the USCJ found these results in Conservative synagogues:\n\n\nIn Israel, many laws are governed by religious authorities, marriage included in this. Because religious law governs marriage, same-sex couples are not recognized as married by religious law. There are some non-profit organizations: Shoval, Bat Kol, and Havruta devoted to educating religious communities on acceptance and tolerance of the LGBT community in Israeli society. Among secular Israeli society, same-sex couples receive most of the same benefits as heterosexual couples. However, among the religious jurisdiction, same-sex couples cannot legally marry in Israel, barring them from being recognized as married by the religious authorities.\n\n\n\n"}

The original reference was to the gathering of mendicants who spent much of their time travelling. \nTechnically, a \"monastery\" or \"nunnery\" is a community of monastics, whereas a \"friary\" or \"convent\" is a community of mendicants, and a \"canonry\" a community of canons regular. The terms \"abbey\" and \"priory\" can be applied to both monasteries and canonries; an abbey is headed by an Abbot, and a priory is a lesser dependent house headed by a Prior.\n\nIn English usage since about the 19th century the term \"convent\" almost invariably refers to a community of women, while \"monastery\" and \"friary\" are used for men. In historical usage they are often interchangeable, with \"convent\" especially likely to be used for a friary. When applied to religious houses in Eastern Orthodoxy and Buddhism, English refers to all houses of male religious as \"monasteries\" and of female religious \"convents\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8798086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8798086", "title": "De (Chinese)", "text": "De (Chinese)\n\nDe (; ) is a key concept in Chinese philosophy, usually translated \"inherent character; inner power; integrity\" in Taoism, \"moral character; virtue; morality\" in Confucianism and other contexts, and \"quality; virtue\" (\"guna\") or \"merit; virtuous deeds\" (\"punya\") in Chinese Buddhism.\n\nChinese \"de\" 德 is an ancient and linguistically complex word. The following analyzes it in terms of semantics, graphics, and etymology.\n\nThe \"Hanyu Da Zidian\", defines twenty meanings for \"de\" 德, translatable as\nThis dictionary provides early usage examples, and all of these \"de\" meanings occur in Han or pre-Han Chinese classic texts, except for number 17 (\"de\" abbreviating \"Deutschland\").\n\nTranslating \"de\" into English is problematic and controversial. Arthur Waley believed that \"de\" was better translated \"power\" than \"virtue\", and explained with a \"bank of fortune\" metaphor.\nIt is usually translated 'virtue', and this often seems to work quite well; though where the word occurs in early, pre-moralistic texts such a translation is in reality quite false. But if we study the usage of the word carefully we find that \"de\" can be bad as well as good. What is a 'bad virtue'? Clearly 'virtue' is not a satisfactory equivalent. Indeed on examining the history of the word we find that it means something much more like the Indian \"karma\", save that the fruits of \"te\" are generally manifested here and now; whereas \"karma\" is bound up with a theory of transmigration, and its effects are usually not seen in this life, but in a subsequent incarnation. \"Te\" is anything that happens to one or that one does of a kind indicating that, as a consequence, one is going to meet with good or bad luck. It means, so to speak, the stock of credit (or the deficit) that at any given moment a man has at the bank of fortune. Such a stock is of course built up partly by the correct carrying out of ritual; but primarily by securing favourable omens; for unless the omens are favourable, no rite can be carried out at all. (1958:31)\nBased on the cognate relation between \"de\" and \"zhi\" \"to plant\", Waley further noted the early Chinese regarded planting seeds as a \"de\", hence it \"means a latent power, a 'virtue' inherent in something.\"\n\nThe linguist Peter A. Boodberg investigated the semantics and etymology of \"de\" 德, which he called \"perhaps the most significant word, next to \"tao\" 道, in ancient Chinese macro- and microcosmology.\"\n\nThe standard translation for it is \"virtue,\" both in the sense of inherent quality and in that of moral excellence, but with the validity of the traditional rendering somewhat shaken by Arthur Waley's insistence on interpreting it as \"power.\" Indeed, it is believed by many scholars that the term originated in the mytho-magical period of Chinese speculation when \"tê\" was conceived as a kind of \"mana\"-like potency inherent in substances, things, and human beings, a potency which, on the one hand, made them true to their essence, and on the other, made possible their influencing of other entities. It appears often as if it had been imagined as a kind of electric charge permeating the thing in question, waxing or waning in accordance with some mysterious law, and capable of being transmitted, in the case of living beings, from one generation to another. Contrary-minded students of ancient Chinese philosophy dispute this interpretation as rather narrow and possibly anachronistic, and point to the fact that \"tê\" had early acquired, at least in Confucian literature, ethical connotations close to our \"virtue,\" that is, as moral, and only rarely amoral or immoral, efficacy. They find, therefore, no quarrel with rendering \"tê\", almost invariably, as \"virtue.\" Philologists are, however, troubled by the absence in the Chinese term of any connotations reminiscent of the Latin etymon \"vir\", such as manliness and virility. They remind us that \"tê\" is free from any contamination with sexual associations and differs in that from its great counterpart, \"tao\", the Way, which, in one or two expressions, such as \"jên tao\" 人道, \"the way of men and women,\" is suggestive of sexual activity. Other recommended translation, such as \"energy\" and \"essential quality,\" seem also inadequate from the etymological point of view. (1979:32) \n\nVictor Mair explains that the difficulty of accurately translating \"de\",\nMair (1990:135) concludes that Daoist \"de\" is best translated \"integrity\", which \"means no more than the wholeness or completeness of a given entity,\" and like \"de\", \"it represents the selfhood of every being in the universe.\"\n\n\"De\" \"power; virtue\" is written with the Chinese character in both Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. This character 德 combines the \"chi\" 彳 \"footstep; go\" radical (recurring graphic elements that suggest meaning) with \"zhi\" 直 \"straight; vertical\" and \"xin\" 心 \"heart; mind\". \"De\" 德 has rare variant characters of (without the horizontal 一 line) and or (without the 彳 \"footstep\" radical).\n\nThe earliest written forms of \"de\" 德 are oracle script from the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE) and bronzeware script and seal script from the Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE). Oracle characters wrote \"de\" 德 with 彳\"footstep; go\" and 直 \"straight\", later bronze characters added the 心 \"heart; mind\" element. The oracle script for \"zhi\" 直 \"straight; vertical\" ideographically depicted \"shu\" 丨\"vertical line (in a character)\" above \"mu\" 目 \"eye\", the bronze script elaborated the line into \"shi\" 十 \"ten\"', and the seal script separated the eye and heart with a horizontal line.\n\nBoodberg (1979:33-4) undertook a \"graphophonetic analysis\" of \"de\". Based on the phonetic element \"zhi\" 直 \"upright; erect\" and the radical 行 suggesting movement, he translates \"de\" as English \"arrect\" \"set upright; direct upward\" (from Latin \"ad-\" \"to\") or \"insititious\" \"ingrafted; inserted\" potency (from Latin \"insitio\" \"to implant; to graft\"). Interpreting the 心 \"heart; mind\" to connote \"innerness\", he takes the prefix from Latin \"indoles\" \"innate quality; natural disposition\" to further neologize \"indarrect\". Boodberg concludes that the noun \"de\" is best translated \"enrective\" in the passive sense of power, or \"arrective\" in the active sense of influencing others. He says the Chinese understood \"de\" as potent but not coercive, and as arrective rather than corrective. Since early texts describe \"de\" 德 as an acquired quality, he proposes it is a paronym of \"de\" 得 \"to acquire; to obtain\", which is a common definition of \"de\" \"power; virtue\". Lastly, he notes a possible etymology of \"see straight; looking straight at things; intuition\" because early \"zhi\" 直 graphs depicted a straight line over an 目 \"eye\" (horizontally written 罒 in 德).\n\nVictor H. Mair proposes a Proto-Indo-European etymology for \"de\".\n\nAccording to Axel Schuessler's new etymological dictionary of Old Chinese (2007:208), \"de\" < *\"tək\" 德 \"moral force, virtue, character; quality, nature\" is probably in the same word family as \"de\" < *\"tək\" 得 \"to get\" and perhaps \"zhi\" < *\"drək\" 直 \"straight; right\". It quotes the proposal of Edwin G. Pulleyblank that \"de\" 德 and \"de\" 得 are cognate with Tibetan language \"thub\" \"a mighty one, one having power and authority\".\n\nClassic texts of philosophical Daoism frequently refer to \"de\".\n\n\"De\" (德) is a keyword in the \"Daodejing\" where it occurs 44 times, compared to 76 occurrences of \"dao\". The title refers to a textual division between the \"Daojing\" (chapters 1-37, since 1 begins with \"dao\": \"The Way that can be told\") and the \"Dejing\" (chapters 38-81, since 38 begins with \"de\": \"The man of highest \"power\", see below). The (relatively) modern compound word \"daode\" (道德) means \"morality, ethical principles, ethics, moral philosophy\". Two common \"de\" themes are its connection with the \"dao\" and its usefulness in managing people. (Note that \"de\" is \"power\" in the following translations by Arthur Waley.)\n\nThe first \"Daojing\" theme is the interrelationship between \"de\" and \"dao\". \"Such the scope of the All-pervading Power. That it alone can act through the Way.\" (21, tr. Waley). The so-called \"\"De\" Chapter\" has the greatest number of occurrences.\nThe man of highest \"power\" does not reveal himself as a possessor of \"power\";\nTherefore he keeps his \"power\".\nThe man of inferior \"power\" cannot rid it of the appearance of \"power\";\nTherefore he is in truth without \"power\".\nThe man of highest \"power\" neither acts nor is there any who so regards him; The man of inferior \"power\" both acts and is so regarded.\nThe man of highest humanity, though he acts, is not regarded;\nWhereas a man of even the highest morality both acts and is so regarded;\nWhile even he who is best versed in ritual not merely acts, but if people fail to respond\nThen he will pull up his sleeves and advance upon them. That is why it is said:\n\"After Tao was lost, then came the 'power';\nAfter the 'power' was lost, then came human kindness.\"\nAfter human kindness was lost, then came morality,\nAfter morality was lost, then came ritual. (38, tr. Waley)\nHere is another example.\nTruly, if one uses the Way as one's instrument, the results will be like the Way; if one uses the \"power\" as instrument, the results will be like the \"power\". If one uses what is the reverse of the \"power\", the results will be the reverse of the \"power\".\n\nFor to those who have conformed themselves to the Way, the Way readily lends its power. To those who have conformed themselves to the power, the power readily, lends more power. While to those who conform themselves to inefficacy, inefficacy readily lends its ineffectiveness. (23, tr. Waley)\nCompare this third example.\nTao gave them birth;\nThe \"power\" of Tao reared them,\nShaped them according to their kinds,\nPerfected them, giving to each its strength.\nTherefore of the ten thousand things there is not one that does not worship Tao and do homage to its \"power\". No mandate ever went forth that accorded to Tao the right to be worshipped, nor to its \"power\" the right to be worshipped, nor to its \"power\" the right to receive homage.\nIt was always and of itself so.\nTherefore as Tao bore them and the \"power\" of Tao reared them, made them grow, fostered them, harboured them, brewed for them, so you must,\nRear them, but not lay claim to them,\nControl them, but never lean upon them,\nBe chief among them, but not manage them.\nThis is called the \"mysterious power.\" (51, tr. Waley)\nChapters 10 and 65 also use this \"xuande\" (玄德 \"dark/mysterious \"de\"\") phrase.\n\nThe second \"Daodejing\" theme is the efficacy of \"de\" for statesmanship (see meanings 6 and 7 above). A sage ruler can acquire sufficient \"de\" to influence his subjects through, in effect, \"wu wei\" government.\nYou cannot rule men nor serve heaven unless you have laid up a store;\nThis \"laying up a store\" means quickly absorbing,\nAnd \"quickly absorbing\" means doubling one's garnered \"power\".\nDouble your garnered power and it acquires a strength that nothing can overcome.\nIf there is nothing it cannot overcome, it know no bounds,\nAnd only what knows no bounds is huge enough to keep a whole kingdom in its grasp. (59, tr. Waley) \nCompare this description of using one's accumulated \"de\" to affect others.\nThe best charioteers do not rush ahead;\nThe best fighters do not make displays of wrath.\nThe greatest conqueror wins without joining issue;\nThe best user of men acts as though he were their inferior.\nThis is called the power that comes of not contending,\nIs called the capacity to use men,\nThe secret of being mated to heaven, to what was of old. (68, tr. Waley) \n\nMair interprets these \"de\" occurrences.\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" uses \"de\" 191 times. Many contexts praise Daoist \"integrity; inner power\", some mock Confucianist and Mohist \"virtue\", and others make \"de\" wordplays. One of the chapter titles is \"De chong fu\" (5, 德充符, \"The Sign of Complete Virtue\").\n\nSeveral of the \"Zhuangzi\" translators (listed here) explain the difficulties of rendering \"de\" into English. Frederic H. Balfour (1881:xxxvii) succinctly glosses \"de\" with Greek and Chinese.\n德. In ethics, Virtue — \"ἀρετή\" [\"areté\" \"excellence\"]; in physics, Energy — \" δύναμις\" [\"dunamis\" \"potential power; force\"]. 道 [\"The Tao\"] is the 體 [\"body; embodiment\"] of which 德 is the 用 [\"use; function\"]. \nJames Legge (1891:81) gives this footnote to the \"\"De\" Chapter\".\n論德, 'About the Attributes;' of Tâo, that is. It is not easy to render teh here by any other English term than 'virtue,' and yet there would be a danger of its thus misleading us in the interpretations of the chapter.\nThe 'virtue,' is the activity or operation of the Tâo, which is supposed to have come out of its absoluteness. Even Han Fei so defines it here, — 'Teh is the meritorious work of the Tâo.' \nFung Yu-lan (1938:8) cites two examples.\nNext, we come to the conception of \"Tê\", or virtue. Lao Tzŭ said:\n\"\"Tao\" produces a thing; \"Tê\" maintains it.\" – \"\"Tao Tê Ching\",\" \"51\". \nChuang Tzŭ said:\n\"That which things get in order to live is called \"Tê\".\" – \"Chapter XII\". \nSo \"Tê\" is what an individual thing receives from \"Tao\". The total spontaneity of all things is \"Tao\". The spontaneity that an individual thing receives from \"Tao\" is \"Tê\". As some commentator said, the relation between \"Tê\" and \"Tao\" is just like that between the water in river or lake, and water in general. \nBurton Watson (1968:25), whose translation will be cited below, describes the subtle connotations.\nIn nearly all cases I have rendered \"te\" as \"virtue\" except where it has the meaning of a favor or good deed done for someone, This word presents certain difficulties in Chuang Tzu. Sometimes he employs it to mean conventional virtue — that is, virtue in the Confucian or Mo-ist sense — in which case it has bad connotations; at other times he employs it in a good sense to mean the true virtue or vital power that belongs to the man of Tao. (Compare Waley's rendering of the title \"Tao-te-ching\" as \"The Way and Its Power\".) I prefer not to try to distinguish these two usages in the translation because I do not wish to impose upon the English a distinction that is not explicit in the original. The reader should keep in mind, incidentally, that the words \"virtue\" (\"te\") and \"gain\" or \"to get\" (\"te\") are homophones, and this fact is the basis of frequent puns and word plays — that is, the man of true Taoist virtue is one who, as we would say in English, has \"got it.\" \nVictor H. Mair (1994:383) differentiates \"Zhuangzi\"'s contextual usages of \"de\".\nIn Confucian or conventional contexts, \"te\" is translated as \"virtue.\" In Taoist or unconventional contexts, it is translated as \"integrity.\" The most etymologically precise equivalent in English is the archaic word \"dough[tiness].\" \n\n\"De\" was central in Daoist cosmology, and the \"Zhuangzi\" frequently explains it with \"dao\" \"the Way\" and \"tian\" \"heaven; god\". Chapter 12, \"Heaven and Earth\", has two good illustrations.\nIn the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no being, no name. Out of it arose One; there was One, but it had no form. Things got hold of it and came to life, and it was called Virtue. Before things had forms, they had their allotments; these were of many kinds, but not cut off from one another, and they were called fates. Out of the flow and flux, things were born, and as they grew they developed distinctive shapes; these were called forms. The forms and bodies held within them spirits, each with its own characteristics and limitations, and this was called the inborn nature. If the nature is trained, you may return to Virtue, and Virtue at its highest peak is identical with the Beginning. Being identical, you will be empty; being empty, you will be great. You may join in the cheeping and chirping and, when you have joined in the cheeping and chirping, you may join with Heaven and earth. Your joining is wild and confused, as though you were stupid, as though you were demented. This is called Dark Virtue. Rude and unwitting, you take part in the Great Submission. (12, tr. Watson 1968:131-2) \n\nPervading Heaven and earth: that is the Way. Moving among the ten thousand things: that is Virtue. Superiors governing the men below them: that is called administration. Ability finding trained expression: that is called skill. Skill is subsumed in administration; administration in duty; duty in Virtue; Virtue in the Way; and the Way in Heaven. Therefore it is said, those who shepherded the world in ancient times were without desire and the world was satisfied, without action and the ten thousand things were transformed. They were deep and silent and the hundred clans were at rest. The Record says: \"Stick to the One and the ten thousand tasks will be accomplished; achieve mindlessness and the gods and spirits will bow down.\" (12, tr. Watson 1968:126-7) \n\n\"Zhide\" (至德 \"perfect/ultimate \"de\"\") occurs seven times (see the punning proverb quoted below). For instance,\nWhen a man has perfect virtue, fire cannot burn him, water cannot drown him, cold and heat cannot afflict him, birds and beasts cannot injure him. I do not say that he makes light of these things. I mean that he distinguishes between safety and danger, contents himself with fortune or misfortune, and is cautious in his comings and goings. Therefore nothing can harm him.\n\n\"Hence it is said: the Heavenly is on the inside, the human is on the outside. Virtue resides in the Heavenly. Understand the actions of Heaven and man, base yourself upon Heaven, take your stand in virtue, and then, although you hasten or hold back, bend or stretch, you may return to the essential and speak of the ultimate.\" (17, tr. Watson 1968:182-3) \n\nThe people have their constant inborn nature. To weave for their clothing, to till for their food — this is the Virtue they share. They are one in it and not partisan, and it is called the Emancipation of Heaven. Therefore in a time of Perfect Virtue the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze is steady and mild. In such an age mountains have no paths or trails, lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form their flocks and herds, grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them about, or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue men live the same as birds and beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who then knows anything about \"gentleman\" or \"petty man\"? Dull and ununwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity the people attain their true nature.\n\nThen along comes the sage, huffing and puffing after benevolence, reaching on tiptoe for righteousness, and the world for the first time has doubts; mooning and mouthing over his music, snipping and stitching away at his rites, and the world for the first time is divided. Thus, if the plain unwrought substance had not been blighted, how would there be any sacrificial goblets? If the white jade had not been shattered, how would there be any scepters and batons? If the Way and its Virtue had not been cast aside, how would there be any call for benevolence and righteousness? If the true form of the inborn nature had not been abandoned, how would there be any use for rites and music? If the five colors had not confused men, who would fashion patterns and hues? If the five notes had not confused them, who would try to tune things by the six tones? That the unwrought substance was blighted in order to fashion implements — this was the crime of the artisan. That the Way and its Virtue were destroyed in order to create benevolence and righteousness — this was the fault of the sage. (9, tr. Watson 1968:105-6) \n\nThis parable blaming sages for losing the primordial \"dao\" and \"de\" has several \"Zhuangzi\" parallels. Here are two.\nSo it is said, With the sage, his life is the working of Heaven, his death the transformation of things. In stillness, he and the yin share a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share a single flow. He is not the bearer of good fortune, nor the initiator of bad fortune. Roused by something outside himself, only then does he respond; pressed, only then does he move; finding he has no choice, only then does he rise up. He discards knowledge and purpose and follows along with the reasonableness of Heaven. Therefore he incurs no disaster from Heaven, no entanglement from things, no opposition from man, no blame from the spirits. His life is a floating, his death a rest. He does not ponder or scheme, does not plot for the future. A man of light, he does not shine; of good faith, he keeps no promises. He sleeps without dreaming, wakes without worry. His spirit is pure and clean, his soul never wearied. In emptiness, nonbeing, and limpidity, he joins with the Virtue of Heaven.\n\nSo it is said, Grief and happiness are perversions of Virtue; joy and anger are transgressions of the Way; love and hate are offenses against Virtue. When the mind is without care or joy, this is the height of Virtue. When it is unified and unchanging, this is the height of stillness. When it grates against nothing, this is the height of emptiness. When it has no commerce with things, this is the height of limpidity. When it rebels against nothing, this is the height of purity. (15, tr. Watson 1968:168-9) \n\nThe Yellow Emperor said, \"Do-Nothing-Say‑Nothing — he's the one who is truly right. Wild-and-Witless appears to be so. But you and I in the end are nowhere near it. Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Therefore the sage practices the teaching that has no words. The Way cannot be brought to light; its virtue cannot be forced to come. But benevolence — you can put that into practice; you can discourse on righteousness, you can dupe one another with rites. So it is said, When the Way was lost, then there was virtue; when virtue was lost, then there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost, then there was righteousness; when righteousness was lost, then there were rites. Rites are the frills of the Way and the forerunners of disorder. So it is said, He who practices the Way does less every day, does less and goes on doing less, until he reaches the point where he does nothing, does nothing and yet there is nothing that is not done.\" Now that we've already become 'things,' if we want to return again to the Root, I'm afraid we'll have a hard time of it! The Great Man — he's the only one who might find it easy. (22, tr. Watson 1968:235) \nThis theme of sagely rulers using the powers of \"de\" recurs in the \"Heaven and Earth\" chapter.\nHeaven and Earth are huge, but they are alike in their transformations. The ten thousand things are numerous, but they are one in their good order. Human beings are many, but they are all subjects of the sovereign. The sovereign finds his source in Virtue, his completion in Heaven. Therefore it is said that the sovereign of dark antiquity ruled the world through inaction, through Heavenly Virtue and nothing more. (12, tr. Watson 1968:126) \n\nThe man of kingly Virtue moves in simplicity and is ashamed to be a master of facts. He takes his stand in the original source and his understanding extends to the spirits. Therefore his Virtue is far‑reaching. His mind moves forth only when some external thing has roused it. Without the Way the body can have no life, and without Virtue, life can have no clarity. To preserve the body and live out life, to establish Virtue and make clear the Way — is this not kingly Virtue? Broad and boundless, suddenly he emerges, abruptly he moves, and the ten thousand things follow him — this is what is called the man of kingly Virtue. (12, tr. Watson 1968:128) \n\nOne of the Inner Chapters has a dialogue between Confucius and Duke Ai of Lu (r. 494-468 BCE). The Duke describes meeting a hunchback named Ai Taito, who was famously ugly and charismatic, and asks about his incredible popularity, which the Master attributes to formless and water-like \"de\".\nConfucius said, \"I once went on a mission to Ch'u, and as I was going along, I saw some little pigs nursing at the body of their dead mother. After a while, they gave a start and all ran away and left her, because they could no longer see their likeness in her; she was not the same as she had been before. In loving their mother, they loved not her body but the thing that moved her body. When a man has been killed in battle and people come to bury him, he has no use for his medals. When a man has had his feet amputated, he doesn't care much about shoes. For both, the thing that is basic no longer exists. When women are selected to be consorts of the Son of Heaven, their nails are not pared and their ears are not pierced. When a man has just taken a wife, he is kept in posts outside [the palace] and is no longer sent on [dangerous] missions. If so much care is taken to keep the body whole, how much more in the case of a man whose virtue is whole? Now Ai T'ai‑t'o says nothing and is trusted, accomplishes nothing and is loved, so that people want to turn over their states to him and are only afraid he won't accept. It must be that his powers are whole, though his virtue takes no form.\"\n\n\"What do you mean when you say his powers are whole?\" asked Duke Ai.\n\nConfucius said, \"Life, death, preservation, loss, failure, success, poverty, riches, worthiness, unworthiness, slander, fame, hunger, thirst, cold, heat — these are the alternations of the world, the workings of fate. Day and night they change place before us and wisdom cannot spy out their source. Therefore, they should not be enough to destroy your harmony; they should not be allowed to enter the Spirit Storehouse. If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them and never be at a loss for joy, if you can do this day and night without break and make it be spring with everything, mingling with all and creating the moment within your own mind — this is what I call being whole in power.\"\n\n\"What do you mean when you say his virtue takes no form?\"\n\n\"Among level things, water at rest is the most perfect, and therefore it can serve as a standard. It guards what is inside and shows no movement outside. Virtue is the establishment of perfect harmony. Though virtue takes no form, things cannot break away from it.\" (5, tr. Watson 1968:73-74) \n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" is famous for wordplay and witticism. Several passages make puns between \"de\" \"obtain\" and \"de\" \"integrity; virtue\" (see Watson 1968:183, 214). The \"Autumn Floods\" chapter quotes a \"perfect \"de\" does not \"de\"\" (至德不得) proverb; \"I have heard it said, 'The Man of the Way wins no fame, the highest virtue wins no gain, the Great Man has no self.' To the most perfect degree, he goes along with what has been allotted to him.\" (17, tr. Watson 1968:178-9). \"De\" derogatorily means \"virtue; morality\" in some contexts mocking the Confucians, Mohists, and School of Names. For instance, this derision of their sophistry: \"There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues.\" (2, tr. Watson 1968:44). Translating the witty words of \"Zhuangzi\" can be highly complex. A final instance mentions five types of \"xiongde\" (凶德 \"bad/fiendish/terrible \"de\"\"), but only lists the first one \"zhongde\" (中德 \"center/middle \"de\"\"). Compare these \"de\" translations by Watson (\"virtue\") and Mair (\"integrity\").\nThere is no greater evil than for the mind to be aware of virtue, and to act as though it were a pair of eyes. For when it starts acting like a pair of eyes, it will peer out from within, and when it peers out from within, it is ruined. There are five types of dangerous virtue, of which inner virtue is the worst. What do I mean by inner virtue? He who possesses inner virtue will think himself always in the right, and denigrate those who do not do as he does. (32, tr. Watson 1968:359) \nThere is no greater affliction than for integrity to be possessed by the mind and for the mind to be possessed by its eye. Once ruled by the mind's eye, a person looks inward, and when she looks inward she is defeated. There are five types of malevolent integrity and the chief among them is egocentric integrity. What is meant by \"egocentric integrity\"? She who has egocentric integrity is possessed by self-love and ridicules whatever she does not do herself. (tr. Mair 1994:330) \n\nThe word \"bade\" 八德 \"eight virtues/powers\" first appears in the \"Discussion on Making All Things Equal\" chapter. Although many \"Zhuangzi\" commentators and translators try to give \"de\" \"some special meaning other than its ordinary one of \"virtue\" in this context\", notes Watson, \"I believe Chuang Tzu is deliberately parodying the ethical categories of the Confucians and Mo-ists.\"\nThe Way has never known boundaries; speech has no constancy. But because of [the recognition of a] \"this,\" there came to be boundaries. Let me tell you what the boundaries are. There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates, there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues. (2, tr. Watson 1968:43-44) \nLater Confucianists misread this Daoist context and moralistically interpreted \"bade\" as \"xiao\" 孝 \"filial piety\", \"di\" 悌 \"sibling piety\", \"zhong\" 忠 \"loyalty; fidelity\", \"xin\" 信 \"trust; believe\", \"li\" 禮 \"ritual; rites; courtesy\", \"yi\" 義 \"righteousness; right conduct\", \"lian\" 廉 \"upright; honorable; integrity\", and \"zhi\" 恥 \"humility; shame\".\n\nThe Four Books of Confucianism give some insightful explanations of \"de\" \"virtue\". Note that the following quotations cite Charles Muller's scholarly translations of the \"Analects\", \"Doctrine of the Mean\", \"Great Learning\", and \"Mencius\". The more familiar translations of James Legge render \"ren\" \"humaneness; human-heartedness\" as \"perfect virtue\", which occasionally creates confusion with \"de\" as \"virtue\". Compare their translations of these two \"Analects\" passages.\nYen Yüan asked about [仁] perfect virtue. The Master said, \"To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" (12:1, tr. Legge) \nYen Yüan asked about the meaning of [仁] humaneness. The Master said, \"To completely overcome selfishness and keep to propriety is humaneness. If for a full day you can overcome selfishness and keep to propriety, everyone in the world will return to humaneness. Does humaneness come from oneself, or from others?\" (12:1, tr. Muller) \nThe Master said, \"Let the will be set on the path of duty. Let [德] every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped. Let [仁] perfect virtue be accorded with. Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\" (7:6, tr. Legge) \nConfucius said: \"Set your aspirations on the Tao, hold to [德] virtue, rely on your [仁] humaneness, and relax in the study of the arts.\" (7:6, tr. Muller) \n\n\"De\" occurs 40 times in the Confucian \"Lunyu\" or \"Analects\". While Confucius extolled \"de\" \"virtue; morality\" — \"If you are virtuous, you will not be lonely. You will always have friends.\" (4:25) — he frequently criticized his contemporaries for having lost it. He described \"de\" as something that one can augment, and praised sage kings who governed through its compelling powers.\n\nConfucius claimed that the rulers of ancient China had \"zhide\" \"perfect/ultimate \"de\"\" (see above). The two examples below mention the legendary Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun, King Wu, the founder of the Zhou Dynasty, and Tai Bo, who ceded the throne to his nephew King Wen.\nConfucius said: \"T'ai Po can be said to have had a [至德] perfected level of virtue. He declined the rule of the kingdom three times, without the people knowing about it.\" (8:1) \nShun, with five ministers, was able to successfully govern the empire. King Wu said, \"Altogether I have ten ministers.\" Confucius said, \"Their ability is the issue. Don't you think so? When the T'ang [Shang] and Wu [Zhou] dynasties combined, they had as many ministers as you, with a woman and nine men. King Wen (of the Chou) controlled two-thirds of the empire, and with this, served the Yin. Indeed, the [德] virtue of Chou can be called the [至德] epitome of virtue!\" (8:20) \n\nGood government is a central \"Analects\" topic, and the following citations illustrate the importance of \"de\" for rulers and officials.\nConfucius said: \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\" (2:1) \nConfucius said: \"If you govern the people legalistically and control them by punishment, they will avoid crime, but have no personal sense of shame. If you govern them by means of virtue and control them with propriety, they will gain their own sense of shame, and thus correct themselves.\" (2:3) \nConfucius said: \"The Superior Man cares about virtue; the inferior man cares about material things. The Superior Man seeks discipline; the inferior man seeks favors.\" (4:11) \nSomeone said: \"What do you think of the saying: 'Repay harm with virtue'?\" Confucius replied, \"Then how will you repay virtue? Repay harm with Justice and repay virtue with virtue.\" (14:36) \nChi K'ang Tzu asked Confucius about government saying: \"Suppose I were to kill the unjust, in order to advance the just. Would that be all right?\" Confucius replied: \"In doing government, what is the need of killing? If you desire good, the people will be good. The nature of the Superior Man is like the wind, the nature of the inferior man is like the grass. When the wind blows over the grass, it always bends.\" (12:19) \nIn this wind and grass simile, \"de\" clearly does not mean moral \"virtue\", but something like \"nature; character\". Compare these two semantically similar usages.\nConfucius said: \"Heaven gave birth to the virtue within me. What can Huan T'ui [who wanted to kill Confucius] do to me?\" (7:22) \nConfucius said: \"The Southerners have a saying: 'If a man is not constant in his self-cultivation, he cannot be a shaman or a healer.' It is a good proverb. If you are not consistently developing your virtue, what can you give to others? You will not even be able to give a diagnosis.\" (13:22) \n\nConfucius recurrently disparaged his Spring and Autumn period contemporaries for having diminished their natural \"de\" virtue. One notably ironic \"Analects\" passage accuses the Master himself of having lost it.\nChieh Yu, the madman of Ch'u, passed by Confucius, singing: \"Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! Your past cannot be corrected, But your future is yet to come. Give up! Give up! Those who involve themselves in Government now Will be in danger.\" Confucius jumped down, wanting to talk to him, but he ran away, so Confucius couldn't talk to him. (18:5) \nHere are some Confucian quotations about the rarity of people who possessed true \"de\" \"virtue\".\nConfucius said: \"Yu, those who understand virtue are few and far between.\" (15:3) \nConfucius said: \"Even over a long period of time, there have been few people who have actualized the Mean into Manifest Virtue.\" (6:27) \nConfucius said: \"I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as he loves sex.\" (9:17, repeated in 14:12) \nConfucius said: \"The virtuous will certainly have something to say, but those who have something to say are not necessarily virtuous. The humane man is always brave, but the brave man is not necessarily possessed of humaneness.\" (14.5) \nConfucius said: \"Clever words disrupt virtue. Lack of patience in small matters leads to the disruption of great plans.\" (15:26) \nConfucius said: \"The 'conventional townsman' is a thief of virtue.\" (17:13, cf. Mencius 7B:37) \nConfucius said: \"To apprehend the Tao and lecture on it before actualization is to throw away your accumulation of virtue.\" (17:14) \nThis last quote implies that \"de\" can be accumulated, and Confucius was not completely pessimistic about virtue going astray. For example (14:6), he praised his disciple Nangong Kuo as \"a Superior Man, a man of enhanced virtue.\" These four contexts describe \"de\" as a measurable force that one can \"return,\" \"cultivate,\" \"extend,\" and \"heighten\".\nTseng Tzu said: \"When they are careful (about their parents) to the end and continue in reverence after (their parents) are long gone, the virtue of the people will return to its natural depth.\" (1:9) \nConfucius said: \"Having virtue and not cultivating it; studying and not sifting; hearing what is just and not following; not being able to change wrongdoing: these are the things that make me uncomfortable.\" (7:3) \nTzu Chang said: \"Keeping one's virtue without extending it; trusting the Tao without enriching it. What can you gain? And what can you get rid of?\" (19:2) \nFan Chih, while strolling with the Master among the Rain Dance altars, said, \"May I ask how to heighten virtue, overcome wickedness and resolve delusion?\" The Master said, \"An excellent question! If you take care of your responsibilities before you seek your own gain, won't this heighten your virtue? If you attack your own evil rather than the evil of others, won't you overcome wickedness? If, because of a moment's anger, you endanger your own life, as well as that of your parents, is this not delusion?\" (12:21) \n\nThe \"Da Xue\" or \"Great Learning\" is an early Confucianist text that was transmitted as a \"Liji\" chapter. The brief main passage, which is attributed to Confucius, repeats the phrase \"ming mingde\" (明明德 \"brighten the bright \"de\"\"), which Legge translates \"illustrate illustrious virtue\".\nThe way of great learning consists in manifesting one's bright virtue, consists in loving the people, consists in stopping in perfect goodness. … The ancients who wanted to manifest their bright virtue to all in the world first governed well their own states. (tr. Muller) \n\nThe received \"Great Learning\" includes nine commentaries. The first one was supposedly written by Zeng Zi, a disciple of Confucius. It explains \"mingde\" by quoting three \"Shujing\" sections, an otherwise unknown bathtub inscription of King Tang of Shang, and a \"Shijing\" ode.\nIn the \"Announcement to K'ang\" it is said, \"He was able to [明德] manifest his virtue.\" The \"T'ai-chia\" says, \"He contemplated Heaven's unveiled mandate.\" The \"Canon of Yao\" says, \"he was able to [明峻德] manifest his lofty virtue.\" \n\nThe inscription of the bath of King T'ang said, \"If you renew yourself for one day, you can renew yourself daily, and continue to do so.\" In the \"Announcement of K'ang\" it says, \"carry out the renewal of the people.\" The \"Book of Odes\" says, \"Even though Chou was an ancient state, its mandate was sustained anew.\" Therefore there is nothing in which the Superior Man does not fully exert himself. (tr. Muller) \n\nThe \"Zhongyong\" or \"Doctrine of the Mean\", which like the \"Great Learning\" above was included in the \"Liji\", uses \"de\" 22 times.\n\nWhile Confucianist texts generally describe the \"de\" of humans, one passage portrays that of \"guishen\" (鬼神 \"ghosts and spirits; gods\").\nConfucius said: \"The overabundance of the [德] power of spiritual beings is truly amazing! Looking for them, they cannot be seen. Listening for them, they cannot be heard. There is nothing that they do not embody. They cause the people of the world to fast for purification, and wear beautiful clothes in order to participate at the sacrifices. They are overflowing, seeming to be above, seeming to be on the left and on the right. The \"Book of Odes\" says: 'Trying to investigate the spirits, we cannot reach them. How could we possibly grasp them with our thoughts?' The manifestation of the subtle and the inconcealability of sincerity is like this.\"(16, tr. Muller) \nNote how the \"Doctrine of the Mean\" attributes almost mystical powers to \"cheng\" (誠 \"sincerity; truth; honesty\").\nSincerity is just 'perfecting' and the Way is just 'following.' Sincerity is the beginning and end of all things. Without sincerity there is nothing. Thus the Superior Man values the process of \"becoming-sincere.\" But sincerity is not \"just-perfecting\"; it also means \"perfecting all things.\" To perfect yourself, you need \"jen\". To perfect others, you need wisdom. The [德] virtue of our nature is that it is none other than the Way by which inner and outer are merged. Thus we can always use it to set things right. (25, tr. Muller) \n\nOnly that person who has fully actualized sincerity is able to adjust the strings of the Great Net of the World; is able to establish himself in the Great Root of the World; is able to understand the transformations and the nurturing of Heaven and Earth. So sincere is his \"jen\"; so unfathomable is his depth; so vast is his spaciousness. Who is able to understand this, but one who has the firm, acute, luminous sagely intelligence – who is permeated with [天德] Heavenly Virtue? (32, tr. Muller) \n\nTwo passages use the compound \"dade\" (大德 \"big/great \"de\").\nWhat a good son was Shun (the sage emperor)! His [德] virtue was that of a sage, he was venerated as an emperor. His wealth included everything within the Four Seas. He is sacrificed to in the ancestral temple, and his sons and grandsons have preserved his name. Therefore we can say that the [大德] greatly virtuous always attain their appropriate position, always receive their proper reward, always get their recognition and are always long-lived. (17, tr. Muller) \n\nConfucius transmitted the legacy of (sage-emperors) Yao and Shun and modeled his character on that of (sage-kings) Wen and Wu. He was ruled by the Heavenly seasons from above, and combined the Earth and Waters below. He was like Heaven and Earth, which have nothing they do not support, and nothing they do not cover. His function was like the revolution of the four seasons, the alternation of sun and moon. He nourishes the myriad things and they grow up together without harming each other, and they follow their courses simultaneously without interfering with each other. His [小德] smaller power is like the rivers and streams. His [大德] great power is seen in deep transformations. This is why Heaven and Earth are called \"great.\" (30, tr. Muller) \n\nThe \"Doctrine of the Mean\" also mentions the concept of \"zhide\" \"perfect \"de\"\".\nHow great is the Way of the sage! Superabundant, it develops all things, extending up to Heaven. How excellent it is! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of conduct; it waits for the right person and then functions. Hence it is said: \"If you do not [至德] perfect your virtue, the [至道] perfect Way cannot be actualized.\" Therefore the Superior Man esteems his [德] virtuous nature and follows the path of inquiry, extending himself in breadth and greatness, penetrating all subtleties, penetrating its height and brilliance, following the course of the actualization of the Mean. He reviews the old and learns the new, thickening his character through the valorization of propriety. (27, tr. Muller) \n\n\"De\" 德 \"virtue; character\" occurs 41 times in the \"Mengzi\" or \"Mencius\". Many occurrences are in quotations, for instance 6A6 and 6A17 quote \"Shijing\" odes 260 and 247. Mencius frequently quotes Confucius about \"de\"; 3A4 quotes the \"Lunyu\" 12:19 wind and grass metaphor, and 7B37 quotes 17:13 about \"Conventional townsmen are thieves of virtue.\" Three common \"de\" thematic usages are that wise rulers can utilize its powers, should employ people with \"de\", and should understand how it affects friendship.\n\nThe first and most frequent Mencian teaching is that a ruler should develop his \"de\" as a means of controlling people.\nThe king said: \"What kind of [德] qualities are necessary for real kingship?\" Mencius said: \"Take care of the people, and no one can oppose you.\" (1A7, tr. Muller) \n\nThere was king Wen, moreover, with all the virtue which belonged to him; and who did not die till he had reached a hundred years — and still his influence had not penetrated throughout the kingdom. (2A1, tr. Legge) \n\nMencius said, \"He who uses force as a pretense of Humaneness is the de-facto strongman among the princes. But such a strongman must have a large state in order to be effective. The man who uses his virtue to practice Humaneness is the true king. To be a real king you don't need an especially large territory. T'ang did it with only seventy li and King Wen did it with only one hundred li. When you use your power to force people into submission, they will never submit with their hearts; it is only because they don't have enough strength to resist. When people submit to virtue, they are happy from the bottom of their hearts, and they submit sincerely, the way the seventy disciples submitted to Confucius.\" (2A3, tr. Muller) \n\nMencius said, 'When right government prevails in the kingdom, princes of little virtue are submissive to those of great, and those of little worth to those of great. When bad government prevails in the kingdom, princes of small power are submissive to those of great, and the weak to the strong. Both these cases are the rule of Heaven. They who accord with Heaven are preserved, and they who rebel against Heaven perish. (4A7, tr. Legge) \n\nWan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, \"When the disposal of the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yâo and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son.\" Was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. … 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Yü; and moreover there must be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.' (5A6, tr. Legge) \n\nMencius said, 'The administration of government is not difficult — it lies in not offending the great families. He whom the great families affect, will be affected by the whole State; and he whom any one State affects, will be affected by the whole kingdom. When this is the case, such an [sic] one's virtue and teachings will spread over all within the four seas like the rush of water.' (4A6, tr. Legge) \n\n'Confucius said, \"The flowing progress of virtue is more rapid than the transmission of royal orders by stages and couriers.\"' (2A1, tr. Legge) \nNote how these last two examples describe rapidly flowing powers of \"de\".\n\nThe second related theme is that rulers should seek out and employ those individuals who have \"de\".\nIf a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars, giving the worthiest among them places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. (2A2, tr. Legge) \n\nMencius said: \"Humaneness brings glory and non-Humaneness brings disgrace. So if you hate disgrace but still involve yourself in what is not Humaneness, it is like hating moisture and living in a basement. If you really hate it, you should honor virtue and respect the good. Install good men into positions of rank and give jobs to people of ability.\" (2A4, tr. Muller) \n\nTherefore a prince who is to accomplish great deeds will certainly have ministers whom he does not call to go to him. When he wishes to consult with them, he goes to them. The prince who does not honour the virtuous, and delight in their ways of doing, to this extent, is not worth having to do with. (2B7, tr. Legge 214) \n\nChien asked, \"How do you go about 'just being content'?\" Mencius said, \"If you value virtue and enjoy Rightness, you can be content. Hence the gentleman in dire straits does not lose his sense of Rightness, and when successful, does not lose the Path. Since he does not lose his sense of Rightness when in dire straits, the gentleman is able to keep a grasp on himself. Since he does not lose the Path when he becomes successful, the people are not disappointed in him.\" (7A9, tr. Muller) \n\nHsien-ch'iû Mang asked Mencius, saying, 'There is the saying, \"A scholar of complete virtue may not be employed as a minister by his sovereign, nor treated as a son by his father.\" … Mencius replied, 'No. These are not the words of a superior man. They are the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east of Qi.' (5A4, tr. Legge) \n\nA third theme in \"Mencius\" is the connection between \"de\" and friendship.\nWan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask the principles of friendship.' Mencius replied, 'Friendship should be maintained without any presumption on the ground of one's superior age, or station, or the circumstances of his relatives. Friendship with a man is friendship with his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority.' (5B12, tr. Legge) \n\nDuring the frequent interviews of the duke Mû with Tsze-sze, he one day said to him, \"Anciently, princes of a thousand chariots have yet been on terms of friendship with scholars — what do you think of such an intercourse?\" Tsze-sze was displeased, and said, \"The ancients have said, 'The scholar should be served:' how should they have merely said that he should be made a friend of?\" When Tsze-sze was thus displeased, did he not say within himself, — \"With regard to our stations, you are sovereign, and I am subject. How can I presume to be on terms of friendship with my sovereign! With regard to our virtue, you ought to make me your master. How can you be on terms of friendship with me?\" Thus, when a ruler of a thousand chariots sought to be on terms of friendship with a scholar, he could not obtain his wish — how much less could he call him to his presence!' (5B16, tr. Legge) \n\nOne final example of Confucian \"de\" usages is this context where the word has a markedly negative meaning, semantically opposed to moral \"virtue\".\nMencius said, 'Qiu acted as chief officer to the head of the Ji family, whose [德] evil ways he was unable to change, while he exacted from the people double the grain formerly paid.' (4A14, tr. Legge) \n\nSeveral Mawangdui (before 168 BCE) texts named \"Xingde\" 刑德 (\"Punishment and Virtue\") describe De as a mantic function related to the sexagenary cycle and the astronomical notion of the \"Nine Palaces\" ().\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8223762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8223762", "title": "Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism", "text": "Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism\n\nReligion in the Greco-Roman world at the time of the Constantinian shift mostly comprised three main currents:\n\n\nEarly Christianity grew gradually in Rome and the Roman Empire from the 1st to 4th centuries. In 313 it was legally tolerated and in 380 it became the state church of the Roman Empire with the Edict of Thessalonica. Nevertheless, Hellenistic polytheistic traditions survived in pockets of Greece throughout Late Antiquity until they gradually diminished after the triumph of Christianity.\n\nThe Romans tended towards syncretism, seeing the same gods under different names in different places of the Empire, accommodating other Europeans such as the Hellenes, Germans, and Celts, and Semitic and other groups in the Middle East. Under Roman authority, the various national myths most similar to Rome were adopted by analogue into the overall Roman mythos, further cementing Imperial control. Consequently, the Romans were generally tolerant and accommodating towards new deities and the religious experiences of other peoples who formed part of their wider Empire.\n\nThe more philosophical outlook of the Hellenic parts of the Roman empire led to a renaissance of intellectual religious thought around the start of the 2nd century. Writings pseudepigraphically attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, and discussing esoteric philosophy, magic, and alchemy, began to spread from Roman Egypt throughout the empire; while they are difficult to date with precision, these texts are likely to have been redacted between the first and third centuries. Although such hermetica was generally written with the theological aim of spiritual improvement, each text had an anonymous, eclectic, and spontaneous origin, rather than being part of an organised movement.\n\nA more organised form of alatrist henotheistic panentheism emerged in parallel to Hermetism. In the 1st century BC Cicero's friend Nigidius Figulus made an attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines, an effort that was particularly successful under Apollonius of Tyana in the 1st century; within a century, supernatural powers were being ascribed to Apollonius, and accounts of his life had similarities to those of Jesus. At least one major meeting place for followers of this neopythagoreanism was built in Rome itself, near Porta Maggiore, to a design similar to later Christian churches, though subterranean.\n\nIn the 2nd century, Numenius of Apamea sought to fuse additional elements of Platonism into Neopythagoreanism, a direction which Plotinus continued, forming neoplatonism, a religion of theistic monism. Neoplatonism began to be adopted by prominent scholars such as the Christian theologian Origen and the anti-Christian Porphyry. During the rule of Gallienus, the imperial family themselves gave patronage to Plotinus, and encouraged his philosophical activities. Neoplatonism was further developed by Iamblichus, who believed that physical invocations would be able to produce soteriological results, and therefore added religious ritual to the philosophy. Emperor Julian tried to unify traditional Roman religion by mixing it with Iamblichus' form of neoplatonism; the influential Christian thinker Augustine of Hippo lived during this period, and his subsequent writings show heavy neoplatonic influence.\n\nAt some time around the first century, the members of the Roman military began to adopt the mystery cult of Mithraism; this sun-god related cult arose from obscure non-Roman origins, and the first surviving reference dates to Plutarch's mention of a 67 BC observation of certain Mediterranean pirates practising it. As the Roman legions gradually moved around, so too Mithraism spread throughout the Roman Empire; in the beginning it was mainly soldiers who followed its precepts, but it was also adopted by freedmen, slaves, and merchants, in the locations where the legions rested, particularly in frontier areas.\n\nMithraism wasn't exclusive - it was possible and common to follow Mithraism and other cults simultaneously. It eventually became popular within Rome itself, gradually gaining members among the more aristocratic classes, and eventually counting some of the Roman senators as adherents; according to the Augustan History, even the emperor Commodus was a member. Although, for reasons currently unknown, Mithraism completely excluded women, by the third century it had gained a wide following; there are over 100 surviving remains of temples to Mithras, 8 in Rome itself, and 18 in Ostia (Rome's main port), with Rome having over 300 associated Mithraic monuments.\n\nFrom the reign of Septimius Severus, other, less gender-specific, forms of sun-worship also increased in popularity throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nElagabalus used his authority to install El-Gabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon, merging the god with the Roman sun gods to form \"Deus Sol Invictus\", meaning \"God - the Undefeated Sun\", and making him superior to Jupiter, and assigning either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some combination of the three, as El-Gabal's wife. He rode roughshod over other elements of traditional religion, marrying a Vestal Virgin (who were legally required to remain unmarried virgins during their service), and moved the most sacred relics of Roman religion (including the fire of Vesta, the Shields of the Salii, and the Palladium) to a new temple dedicated exclusively to El-Gabal. As much as the religiously conservative senators may have disapproved, the lavish annual public festivals held in El-Gabal's honour found favour among the popular masses, partly on account of the festivals involving the wide distribution of food.\n\nNearly half a century after Elagabalus, Aurelian came to power. He was a reformer, strengthening the position of the sun-god as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon; he even built a brand new temple, in Rome, dedicated to the deity. It's also thought likely that he may have been responsible for establishing the festival of \"the day of the birth of the unconquered sun\" (\"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\"), which was celebrated on December 25, the day when the sun appears to start rising again - four days after having previously reached its lowest point, though the earliest surviving reference to the festival is in the Chronography of 354. He followed the principle of \"one god, one empire\"; his intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they could believe in without betraying their own gods. Lactantius argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had had enough time, but Aurelian only managed to hold on to the position of Emperor for five years.\n\nImperial tolerance only extended to religions that did not resist Roman authority and would respect Roman gods. Religions that were hostile to the state or any that claimed exclusive rights to religious beliefs and practice were not included and some exclusive Eastern cults were persecuted. Jews were given special privileges owing to their dominance in economy, numbers and dispersal, but this tolerance was balanced unevenly on a thin veneer of Jewish submission. Tolerance of Judaism turned to persecution when collaboration was perceived as ending, see Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire. Intolerant sects could also persecute each other; Jewish sects like the early Christians were denounced by the Jewish establishment as dangerous provocateurs, according to some interpretations of the Council of Jamnia and the Birkat haMinim. The results included massacres of Christian communities and Jewish nationalist groups.\n\nThe early Christian community was perceived at times to be an intrinsically destabilising influence and threat to the peace of Rome, a \"religio illicita\". The pagans who attributed the misfortunes of Rome and its wider Empire to the rise of Christianity, and who could only see a restoration by a return to the old ways, were faced by the Christian Church that had set itself apart from that faith and was unwilling to dilute what it held to be the religion of the \"One True God\".\n\nThe same gods whom the Romans believed had protected and blessed their city and its wider empire during the many centuries they had been worshipped were now demonized by the early Christian Church.\n\nAfter the initial conflicts between the state and the new emerging religion, Gallienus (ruled 253 to 260) was the first emperor to issue an edict of toleration for all religious creeds including Christianity. According to Christian polemicists writing after his death, Constantine I was baptized on his deathbed, which would make him the first emperor to become a baptized Christian. Eusebius, a contemporary Christian historian, also praises him for having some pagan temples torn down. Nevertheless, whatever the imperial edicts said, the effects of policy under the Christian emperors down to Valentinian I and Valens were enough to cause a widespread trend to Christian conversion, but not enough to make paganism extinct. Actual persecution was sporadic and generally the result of local initiative, for example Martin of Tours' destructions of holy sites in Gaul in the later fourth century. Official orders may have established an understanding that actual persecution would be tolerated, but in the first century of official Christianity did not generally organize it.\n\nBy the Edict of Milan (313 AD), Constantine continued the policy of toleration, which Galerius had established. His legislation against magic and private divination were driven out of a fear that others might gain power through those means. Nonetheless, this did not mean he or other Roman rulers disfavored divination. Instead, his belief in \"Roman\" divination is confirmed by legislation calling for the consultation of augurs after an amphitheatre had been struck by lightning in the year 320. Constantine explicitly allowed public divination as a practice of State ceremony as well as public pagan practices to continue. Constantine also issued laws confirming the rights of flamens, priests and duumvirs. Additionally, he began the practice of using secular power to establish doctrinal orthodoxy within Christianity, an example followed by all later Christian emperors, which led to a circle of Christian violence, and of Christian resistance couched in terms of martyrdom.\n\nThe actions of Constantius II, who reigned from 337 till 361, marked the beginning of the era of formal persecution against paganism by the Christian Roman Empire, with the emanation of laws and edicts which punished pagan practices.\n\nFrom the 350s, new laws prescribed the death penalty for those who performed or attended pagan sacrifices, and for the worshipping of idols; temples were shut down, and the traditional Altar of Victory was removed from the Senate. There were also frequent episodes of ordinary Christians destroying, pillaging, desecrating, vandalizing many of the ancient pagan temples, tombs and monuments.\n\nThe harsh imperial edicts had to face the vast following of paganism among the population, and the passive resistance of governors and magistrates. The anti-pagan legislation, beginning with Constantius, would in time have an unfavourable influence on the Middle Ages and, in some ways, become the basis of the Inquisition.\n\nUnder the sole rule of Julian from 361–363, Paganism saw an attempt at restoration; while from 363 till 375, under the reigns of Jovian, Valens and Valentinian I, it received a relative tolerance.\n\nJulian was a nephew of Constantine and received a Christian training but the murder of his father, brother and two uncles, in the aftermath of Constantine's death, he attributed to Constantius and by association to Christians in general. This antipathy was deepened when Constantius executed Julian's only remaining brother in 354 AD. After childhood Julian was educated by hellenists and was attracted to the teachings of neoplatonists and the old religions.\n\nJulian's religious beliefs were syncretic and he was an initiate of at least three mystery religions. But Julian's religious open-mindedness did not extend to Christianity due to its belief that it had an exclusive perspective on religious truth. Seeing itself as the only true religion, Christianity was opposed to, and fundamentally incompatible with, the more inclusive syncretism of paganism.\n\nAs Emperor, Julian sought to turn the tide in the attempted suppression of non-Christian religions. As his first task he sought to reestablish the old Roman Pagan practice of incorporation of other religions. But now instead of allowing different cults using different names for the same or similar deities, Julian's training in Christianity and Imperial government influenced him to develop a single pagan religion. Thus, his ideas concerning the revival and organization of the old religion, shaping it into a coherent body of doctrine, ritual and liturgy with a hierarchy under the supervision of the emperor was the hallmark of his reign. Julian organized elaborate rituals and attempted to set forth a clarified philosophy of Neo-Platonism that might unite all Pagans.\n\nJulian allowed religious freedom and avoided any form of actual compulsion. The Christian Sozomen acknowledges that Julian did not compel Christians to offer sacrifice nor did he allow the people to commit any act of injustice towards the Christians or insult them. However, no Christian was allowed to teach or study the ancient classical authors, \"Let them keep to Matthew and Luke\", thus ending any chance they had of a professional career.\n\nHe withdrew the privileges of the Christian clergy, bestowed on them by Constantine, and ordered them to make restitution. Those who had demolished temples during the reign of Constantine and Constantius, were made to rebuild them, or to defray the expenses of their re-erection. Only pagans were allowed to teach in law, rhetoric, philosophy, or practice any form of state sanctioned religious liturgy. Julian required those who had abandoned the deities to purify themselves before they were allowed the privilege of taking part in their worship once again. He was devoted to divination and allowed his subjects to freely practice this art. In general the privileges and immunities given to the Christians were now replaced with those given to pagan philosophers and priests who subscribed to his neo-platonic pagan religion.\n\nAfter the death of Julian, Jovian seems to have instituted a policy of religious toleration which avoided the relative extremes of Constantius and Julian. Under Valentinian I and Valens this period of religious toleration continued. Pagan writers praise both of these emperors for their liberal religious policies.\n\nValentinian and Valens granted complete toleration for all cults at the beginning of their reign in 364. Valentinian, who ruled in the west, even allowed the performance of nocturnal sacrifices, which had been previously prohibited due to the attempt of some people to practice unlawful divination under the cover of the night, after the proconsul of Greece appealed to him. Valentinian also confirmed the rights and privileges of the Pagan priests and confirmed the right of Pagans to be the exclusive caretakers of their temples. Valens, who was ruling in the east, was an Arian and was too engaged with fighting against the Orthodox Christians to bother much with the Pagans. In both the west and east severe laws were once again passed prohibiting private divination. Due to the over zealousness of the populace to stop harmful divination, the haruspices and augurs began to be afraid to show themselves in public. This led the emperors to formally authorize the practice of official and lawful divination by law in 371. Despite the official policy, anti-pagan laws remained in force, and unofficial destruction of pagan holy sites was also tolerated.\n\nUpon the death of his father (Valentinian I) in the year 375, Gratian began his actual reign at the age of sixteen. Six days after the death of Valentinian I, Gratian's half brother, Valentinian II, who was only four years old, was also declared emperor. After the death of Valens, at the battle of Adrianople in 378, Gratian chose a Spaniard named Theodosius I to succeed his uncle. Gratian had been educated by Ausonius who had praised his pupil for his tolerance. Upon the death of his father, Gratian came under the influence of Ambrose, who became his chief advisor. Under the influence of Ambrose, active steps to repress Paganism were taken.\n\nThe influence of Ambrose was a significant force that brought to an end a period of widespread, if unofficial, religious tolerance that had existed since the time of Julian. Gratian dealt Paganism several blows in 382. In this year, Gratian appropriated the income of the Pagan priests and Vestal Virgins, confiscated the personal possessions of the priestly colleges and ordered the removal of the Altar of Victory. The colleges of Pagan priests also lost all their privileges and immunities. Gratian declared that all of the Pagan temples and shrines were to be confiscated by the government and that their revenues were to be joined to the property of the royal treasury.\n\nPagan Senators responded by sending an appeal to Gratian, reminding him that he was still the Pontifex Maximus and that it was his duty to see that the Pagan rites were properly performed. They appealed to Gratian to restore the altar of Victory and the rights and privileges of the Vestal Virgins and priestly colleges. Gratian, at the urging of Ambrose, did not grant an audience to the Pagan Senators. In response to being reminded by the Pagans that he was still the head of the ancestral religion, Gratian renounced the title and office of Pontifex Maximus under the influence of Ambrose, declaring that it was unsuitable for a Christian to hold this office.\n\nThe Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I began in 381, after the first couple of years his reign in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 380s, Theodosius I reiterated Constantius' ban on Pagan sacrifice, prohibited haruspicy on pain of death, pioneered the criminalization of Magistrates who did not enforce anti-Pagan laws, broke up some pagan associations and destroyed Pagan temples.\n\nBetween 389-391 he emanated the \"Theodosian decrees,\" which established a practical ban on paganism; visits to the temples were forbidden, remaining Pagan holidays abolished, the eternal fire in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum extinguished, the Vestal Virgins disbanded, auspices and witchcrafting punished. Theodosius refused to restore the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, as asked by Pagan Senators.\n\nIn 392 he became emperor of the whole empire (the last one to do so). From this moment till the end of his reign in 395, while Pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration, he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the empire, and participated in actions by Christians against major Pagan sites. He issued a comprehensive law that prohibited any Pagan ritual even within the privacy of one's home, and was particularly oppressive of Manicheans. Paganism was now proscribed, a \"religio illicita\". He is likely to have suppressed the Ancient Olympic Games, whose last record of celebration is from 393.\n\nUpon the death of Theodosius I in 395, a political crisis ensued, which the barbarians were quick to take advantage of by invading the empire on an unprecedented scale. Since most of the Germanic tribes infiltrating, settling, or invading the Empire were Arian Christian, many nominal Orthodox Christians became less certain of their religion. Some, in a sense of superstition or ancient Roman pagan patriotism, felt the invasions were the result of abandoning the old ways. Others believed the success of the Germans was because the Orthodox Church was corrupt. Pagans, in their turn, became more aggressive and began to blame the Christians for the disasters affecting the empire.\nDespite the pleas of many pagans for tolerance, Honorius and Arcadius continued the work of their father by enacting even more anti-Pagan laws in an attempt to stop this revival of Paganism. The fact that they had to keep repeating their threats by the enactment of numerous laws against the practice of Paganism indicates that their efforts did not succeed in stamping out the traditional Pagan rites, which continued to be practiced discreetly.\n\nDuring the early part of the reign of Honorius, Stilicho was able to exercise unlimited power over the west. Stilicho exercised moderation in his religious policies and enacted laws that were favorable to the Pagans. Consequently, during the time in which Stilicho held power, the Pagans enjoyed a brief respite from persecution. In 395, Arcadius declared that the solemn days of the pagans were no longer to be included in the number of holidays. In the same year, another law was passed by Arcadius that prohibited anyone from going to a pagan sanctuary or temple or celebrating any kind of pagan sacrifice. This law seems to have been targeted at those Christians who were converting back to paganism as it specifically mentions \"those who are trying to stray from the dogma of the catholic faith.\" In 396, the privileges of pagan priests and other clerics were officially revoked. In the same year, Arcadius ordered that pagan temples standing in the countryside were to be destroyed without disorder or riot. This law seems to indicate that the number of pagans in the countryside was still too large for the Christians to openly destroy the temples that were located there. As a result, Christians had to be content with destroying the pagan temples that were located in mostly municipal areas where they could easily outnumber the pagan inhabitants. The large number of pagans in the east also seems to have forced Arcadius into allowing the ancient festivals and public games to continue.\n\nMeanwhile, three laws were enacted in the west in 399, under the influence of Stilicho, which were relatively favorable to pagans. Due to the riots caused by Christians in their attempts to destroy the temples, the first of these laws protected pagan temples from the destruction of Christians who pretended that they had been authorized by the government to destroy them. The second of these laws acknowledged the right of the people to continue to participate in the traditional banquets, shows, gatherings and amusements associated with the old pagan religion; it did, however, forbid the public performance of any pagan rites or sacrifice. The third law forbade the destruction of pagan temples that had been cleared of forbidden things and ordered that they were to be kept in good repair. After the death of Stilicho, Honorius and his party in the state gained control and harsh laws against paganism were once again enacted. In 408, Honorius enacted a new law which ordered that all statues and altars in the temples were to be removed and that the temple buildings and their income were to be appropriated by the government. This law also forbade the holding of any pagan banquet or celebration in the vicinity of the temples. The execution of this law was placed in the hands of the bishops. Two other laws decreed that buildings belonging to known pagans and heretics were to be appropriated by the churches.\n\nArcadius died in 408 and his eight-year-old son, Theodosius, was thereupon proclaimed emperor in the East. In the same year, Honorius enacted a law that prohibited anyone who was not catholic from performing imperial service within the palace. Zosimus reports that Honorius was forced to repeal this law after one of his best officers, who happened to be a pagan, resigned in protest. At the beginning of 409, Honorius enacted a law that punished judges and officials who did not enforce the laws against pagans. This law even punished men of rank who simply kept silent over any pagan rite performed in their own city or district. The hopes of pagans were revived with the elevation of Priscus Attalus, at Rome, in 409. Alaric, an Arian Christian, soon tired of his puppet, however, and Attalus was deposed in the summer of 410 when Honorius promised to negotiate a peace treaty. When these negotiations failed, Alaric took and sacked the city of Rome. This catastrophe shocked the entire Roman world. Both Christians and pagans quickly began to blame each other for something that had hitherto been thought impossible. In this heated atmosphere, Honorius once again reiterated his anti-pagan legislation.\n\nThere are numerous fragments extant of several Pagan historical works, such as the works of Eunapius and Olympiodorus, which indicate that pagans were now openly voicing their resentment in writing. Even after the sack of Rome, in 410, pagans believed that the recent decline of Rome had been caused by the neglect of the ancestral traditions.\n\nIn 415, Honorius enacted yet another law that appropriated the Pagan temples throughout the Roman Empire to the government and ordered that all objects that had been consecrated for Pagan sacrifices were to be removed from public places.\nA prominent example of the anti-pagan climate at the time is the case of the philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria, killed by a mob in 415.\n\nIn 416, Honorius and Theodosius II ordered that pagans would no longer be admitted to imperial service nor would they be allowed to receive the rank of administrator or judge. In 423, Theodosius II reiterated the previous laws against Pagans and declared that all Pagans who were caught performing the ancient rites would now have all their goods confiscated and be exiled. In August 423, Honorius died and power was seized in the west by John, who had held the office of Primicerius Notariorum. John appears to have ushered in a period of religious toleration. John seems to have attempted to curb the power of ecclesiastics and the privileges of the church in an attempt to treat all people equally. In 423, Theodosius II published a law that demanded that Christians (whether they were really such or pretended to be so) were not to disturb Pagans who were living peaceably and doing nothing contrary to the law. In 425, Theodosius II sent an expedition to the west to depose John and establish Valentinian III as emperor of the west. After John was captured and executed, Valentinian III was proclaimed emperor in the city of Rome. While in the west, Theodosius II enacted two anti-pagan laws in 425. The first of these stipulated that all pagan superstition was to be rooted out. The second law barred pagans from pleading a case in court and also disqualified them from serving as soldiers. Theodosius then left Valentinian to rule the west and returned to Constantinople.\n\nThe numerous laws against apostasy that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius are evidence that the emperors were having a hard time even keeping Christians from going astray. In 426, Theodosius passed yet another law against Christian apostates, who converted to paganism, and those who pretended to become Christian but in reality continued to perform pagan sacrifices. All this legislation proved so ineffective that Theodosius II found it necessary to reiterate his prohibition against pagan rites and sacrifices in 435, this time increasing the penalty to death. This law also ordered that all pagan shrines, temples and sanctuaries that still existed were to be destroyed by the magistrates. Magistrates who failed to carry out this order were ordered to be punished with death. Even the threat of death, however, failed to eradicate paganism as we find Theodosius legislating again, in 438, against Paganism and forbidding Pagan sacrifice once more. Theodosius threatens those who fail to comply with death and the confiscation of their property. In this law, as the Emperor explicitly admits that Pagan sacrifices were still being openly celebrated:\n\nHence our clemency perceives the need of keeping watch over the pagans and their heathen enormities, since by natural depravity and stubborn lawlessness, they forsake the path of true religion. They disdain in any way to perform the nefarious rites of sacrifice and the false errors of their baleful superstition by some means or other in the hidden solitudes, unless their crimes are made public by the profession of their crimes to insult divine majesty and to show scorn to our age. Not the thousand terrors of laws already promulgated nor the penalty of exile pronounced upon them deter these men, whereby, if they cannot reform, at least they might learn to abstain from their mass of their crimes and the multitude of their sacrifices. But their insane audacity transgresses continually; our patience is exhausted by their wicked behavior so that if we desired to forget them, we could not disregard them.\n\nThe continued vitality of paganism led Marcian, who became emperor of the east in 450 upon the death of Theodosius II, to repeat earlier prohibitions against pagan rites. Marcian decreed, in the year 451, that those who continued to perform the pagan rites would suffer the confiscation of their property and be condemned to death. Marcian also prohibited any attempt to re-open the temples and ordered that they were to remain closed. In addition to this, in order to encourage strict enforcement of the law a fine of fifty pounds of gold was imposed on any judge or governor, as well as the officials under him, who did not enforce this law. However, not even this had the desired effect, as we find Leo I, who succeeded Marcian in 457, publishing a new law in 472 which imposed severe penalties for the owner of any property who was aware that Pagan rites were performed on his property. If the property owner was of high rank he was punished by the loss of his rank or office and by the confiscation of his property. If the property owner was of lower status he would be physically tortured and then condemned to labor in the mines for the rest of his life.\n\nTwo more laws against paganism, which may be from this period, are preserved in the Justinian Code. After the deposition of Avitus, who ruled as emperor of the West from 455 to 456, there seems to have been a conspiracy among the Roman nobles to place the pagan general Marcellinus on the throne to restore Paganism; but it came to nothing.\n\nIn the year 457, Leo I became the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople. Anthemius (467-472), one of the last Western Roman emperors, seems to have planned a pagan revival at Rome. He was a descendant of Procopius, the relative of Julian. Anthemius gave Messius Phoebus Severus, a pagan philosopher who was a close friend of his, the important offices of Praefectus urbi of Rome, Consul and Patrician. Anthemius placed the image of Hercules, in the act of vanquishing the Nemean lion, on his coins. The murder of Anthemius (by Ricimer) destroyed the hopes of those pagans who believed that the traditional rites would now be restored. Shortly thereafter, in 476, the western emperor was deposed by Odoacer, who became the first barbarian king of Italy. In spite of this disaster, pagans made one last attempt to revive the pagan rites. In 484, the Magister militum per Orientem, Illus, revolted against Zeno and raised his own candidate, Leontius, to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies and because of this many pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno. Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote Isaurian fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.\n\nAs a result of the revolt, Zeno instituted a harsh persecution of pagan intellectuals. With the failure of the revolt of Leontius, some pagans became disillusioned and many became Christian, or simply pretended to, in order to avoid persecution. The Christianization of the Roman Empire became complete when the emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, who came to the throne in 491, was forced to sign a written declaration of orthodoxy before his coronation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1618754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1618754", "title": "Desert Fathers", "text": "Desert Fathers\n\nThe Desert Fathers (along with Desert Mothers) were early Christian hermits, ascetics, and monks who lived mainly in the Scetes desert of Egypt beginning around the third century AD. The \"Apophthegmata Patrum\" is a collection of the wisdom of some of the early desert monks and nuns, in print as \"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\". The most well known was Anthony the Great, who moved to the desert in AD 270–271 and became known as both the father and founder of desert monasticism. By the time Anthony died in AD 356, thousands of monks and nuns had been drawn to living in the desert following Anthony's example—his biographer, Athanasius of Alexandria, wrote that \"the desert had become a city.\" The Desert Fathers had a major influence on the development of Christianity.\n\nThe desert monastic communities that grew out of the informal gathering of hermit monks became the model for Christian monasticism. The eastern monastic tradition at Mount Athos and the western Rule of Saint Benedict both were strongly influenced by the traditions that began in the desert. All of the monastic revivals of the Middle Ages looked to the desert for inspiration and guidance. Much of Eastern Christian spirituality, including the Hesychast movement, had its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Even religious renewals such as the German evangelicals and Pietists in Pennsylvania, the \"Devotio Moderna\" movement, and the Methodist Revival in England are seen by modern scholars as being influenced by the Desert Fathers.\n\nPaul of Thebes is often credited with being the first hermit monk to go to the desert, but it was Anthony the Great who launched the movement that became the Desert Fathers. Sometime around AD 270, Anthony heard a Sunday sermon stating that perfection could be achieved by selling all of one's possessions, giving the proceeds to the poor, and following Christ (Matt. 19:21). He followed the advice and made the further step of moving deep into the desert to seek complete solitude.\n\nAnthony lived in a time of transition for Christianity—the Diocletianic Persecution in AD 303 was the last great formal persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. Only ten years later, Christianity was made legal in Egypt by Diocletian's successor Constantine I. Those who left for the desert formed an alternate Christian society, at a time when it was no longer a risk to be a Christian. The solitude, austerity, and sacrifice of the desert was seen by Anthony as an alternative to martyrdom, which was formerly seen by many Christians as the highest form of sacrifice. Anthony quickly gained followers eager to live their lives in accordance with this solidarity and separation from material goods. From these prohibitions it is recorded by Athanasius that Anthony received special privileges from God, such as the ability to heal the sick, inspire others to have faith in healing through God, and even converse with God on occasion. Around this time, desert monasticism appeared nearly simultaneously in several areas, including Egypt and Syria.\n\nOver time, the model of Anthony and other hermits attracted many followers, who lived alone in the desert or in small groups. They chose a life of extreme asceticism, renouncing all the pleasures of the senses, rich food, baths, rest, and anything that made them comfortable. They instead focused their energies on praying, singing psalms, fasting, giving alms to the needy, and preserving love and harmony with one another while keeping their thoughts and desires for God alone. Thousands joined them in the desert, mostly men but also a handful of women. Religious seekers also began going to the desert seeking advice and counsel from the early Desert Fathers. By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert that it was described as \"a city\" by Anthony's biographer.\n\nThe Desert Fathers advocated three main approaches to monasticism. One was the austere life of the hermit, as practiced by Anthony and his followers in lower Egypt. Another was the cenobitic life, communities of monks and nuns in upper Egypt formed by Pachomius. The third was a semi-hermitic lifestyle seen mostly in Nitria, Kellia and Scetis, west of the Nile, begun by Saint Amun. The latter were small groups (two to six) of monks and nuns with a common spiritual elder—these separate groups would join together in larger gatherings to worship on Saturdays and Sundays. This third form of monasticism was responsible for most of the sayings that were compiled as the \"Apophthegmata Patrum\" (\"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\").\n\nThe small communities founded by the Desert Fathers were the beginning of Christian monasticism. Initially Anthony and others lived as hermits, sometimes forming groups of two or three. Small informal communities began developing, until the monk Pachomius, seeing the need for a more formal structure, established a monastery with rules and organization. His regulations included discipline, obedience, manual labour, silence, fasting, and long periods of prayer—some historians view the rules as being inspired by Pachomius' experiences as a Roman soldier.\n\nThe first fully organized monastery under Pachomius included men and women living in separate quarters, up to three in a room. They supported themselves by weaving cloth and baskets, along with other tasks. Each new monk or nun had a three-year probationary period, concluding with admittance in full standing to the monastery. All property was held communally, meals were eaten together and in silence, twice a week they fasted, and they wore simple peasant clothing with a hood. Several times a day they came together for prayer and readings, and each person was expected to spend time alone meditating on the scriptures. Programs were created for educating those who came to the monastery unable to read.\n\nPachomius also formalized the establishment of an \"abba\" (father) or \"amma\" (mother) in charge of the spiritual welfare of their monks and nuns, with the implication that those joining the monastery were also joining a new family. Members also formed smaller groups, with different tasks in the community and the responsibility of looking after each other's welfare. The new approach grew to the point that there were tens of thousands of monks and nuns in these organized communities within decades of Pachomius' death. One of the early pilgrims to the desert was Basil of Caesarea, who took the Rule of Pachomius into the eastern church. Basil expanded the idea of community by integrating the monks and nuns into the wider public community, with the monks and nuns under the authority of a bishop and serving the poor and needy.\n\nAs more pilgrims began visiting the monks in the desert, influence from the monastic communities began spreading. Latin versions of the original Greek stories and sayings of the Desert Fathers, along with the earliest monastic rules coming out of the desert, guided the early monastic development in the Byzantine world and eventually in the western Christian world. John Cassian played an important role in mediating the influence of the Desert Fathers to the West. This can be seen, for example, in the Rule of Saint Benedict, where Benedict of Nursia urged his monks to read the writings of John Cassian on the Desert Fathers. The \"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\" was also widely read in the early Benedictine monasteries.\n\nMany of the monks and nuns developed a reputation for holiness and wisdom, with the small communities following a particularly holy or wise elder, who was their spiritual father (\"abba\") or mother (\"amma\"). The individual Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers are mostly known through \"The Sayings of the Desert Fathers\", which included 1,202 sayings attributed to twenty-seven \"abbas\" and three \"ammas\". The greatest number of sayings are attributed to Abba \"Poemen\", Greek for \"shepherd\". Because of the wide disparity of dates for the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen, some scholars believe that \"Poemen\" was a generic name for a combination of different unnamed Abbas. Others conclude that the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen are accurate, based on a notable and historical Abba Poemen. Among the notable Desert Fathers and Mothers with sayings in the book, in addition to Anthony the Great, were Arsenius the Great, Poemen, Macarius of Egypt, Moses the Black, and Syncletica of Alexandria.\n\nOther notable Desert Fathers include Pachomius and Shenouda the Archimandrite, and many individuals who spent part of their lives in the Egyptian desert, including Athanasius of Alexandria, John Chrysostom, Evagrius Ponticus, Hilarion and John Cassian. Cassian's works brought the wisdom of the Desert Fathers into a wider arena.\n\nThe legalization of Christianity by the Roman Empire in 313 gave Anthony a greater resolve to go out into the desert. Nostalgic for the tradition of martyrdom, he saw withdrawal and asceticism as an alternative. He insisted on selling all his material possessions—he left his younger sister a small amount of money to live her life in a convent, and donated the rest to the poor. When members of the church began finding ways to work with the Roman state, the Desert Fathers saw that as a compromise between \"the things of God and the things of Caesar.\" The monastic communities were essentially an alternate Christian society. The hermits doubted that religion and politics could ever produce a truly Christian society. For them, the only Christian society was spiritual and not mundane.\n\n\"Hesychasm\" (from the Greek for \"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\") is a mystical tradition and movement that originated with the Desert Fathers and was central to their practice of prayer. \"Hesychasm\" for the Desert Fathers was primarily the practice of \"interior silence and continual prayer.\" It did not become a formal movement of specific practices until the fourteenth century Byzantine meditative prayer techniques, when it was more closely identified with the Prayer of the Heart, or \"Jesus Prayer\". That prayer's origin is also traced back to the Desert Fathers—the Prayer of the Heart was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert. The earliest written reference to the practice of the Prayer of the Heart may be in a discourse collected in the \"Philokalia\" on Abba Philimon, a Desert Father. \"Hesychast\" prayer was a meditative practice that was traditionally done in silence and with eyes closed—\"empty of mental pictures\" and visual concepts, but with the intense consciousness of God's presence.\n\nThe words \"hesychast\" and \"hesychia\" were frequently used in 4th and 5th century writings of Desert Fathers such as Macarius of Egypt, Evagrius Ponticus, and Gregory of Nyssa. The title \"hesychast\" was used in early times synonymously with \"hermit\", as compared to a cenobite who lived in community. \"Hesychasm\" can refer to inner or outer stillness, though in \"The Sayings of the Desert Fathers\" it referred to inner tranquility.\n\nThe Desert Fathers gave a great deal of emphasis to living and practicing the teachings of Christ, much more than theoretical knowledge. Their efforts to live the commandments were not seen as being easy—many of the stories from that time recount the struggle to overcome negative emotions such as anger and judgment of others. Helping a brother monk who was ill or struggling was seen as taking priority over any other consideration. Hermits were frequently seen to break a long fast when hosting visitors, as hospitality and kindness were more important than keeping the ascetic practices that were so dominant in the Desert Fathers' lives.\n\nThe lives of the Desert Fathers that were organized into communities included frequent recitation of the scriptures—during the week they chanted psalms while performing manual labour and during the weekends they held liturgies and group services. The monk's experience in the cell occurred in a variety of ways, including meditation on scripture. Group practices were more prominent in the organized communities formed by Pachomius. The purpose of these practices were explained by John Cassian, a Desert Father, who described the goal of psalmody (the outward recitation of scripture) and asceticism as the ascent to deep mystical prayer and mystical contemplation.\n\n\nThere are many different collections of sayings of the Desert Fathers. The earliest writings were simply ordered by the initial letter of the Abba's name in the order of the Greek alphabet. So the editors started with Anthony the Great, Arsenius and Agathon and concluded with Cheremon, Psenthaisius and Or. It was those first editors who used the word \"apophthegms\" (meaning: saying, maxim or aphorism)—this is why this collection is now known as\"[Apophthegmata Patrum Alphabetica\" (The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Alphabetic Collection). This collection contains about a thousand items.\n\nThe same editors knew there were also a lot of anonymous sayings and tales of the Desert Fathers and Mothers circulating. This material was gathered into a collection now known as \"[Anonymous Patrum Apophthegmata\" (Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers). These sayings were placed in order of more or less similar subjects (for instance: humility, charity etc.). This collection contains about eight hundred items.\n\nThe collection now known as the Systematic Collection began to emerge a century later (AD 500). It has sayings from the Alphabetic Collection and the Anonymous Sayings, combined and systematically ordered under twenty-one chapters. This collection contains about 1200 items and therefore does not completely combine the two older collections.\n\n\n"}

His great-uncle was Alfred Domett, a poet and politician who became Premier of New Zealand and had allegedly been the subject of Robert Browning's poem \"Waring.\" Dowson attended The Queen's College, Oxford, but left in March 1888 without obtaining a degree.\n\nIn November 1888, he started work with his father at Dowson and Son, a dry-docking business in Limehouse, east London, which had been established by the poet's grandfather. He led an active social life, carousing with medical students and law pupils, going to music halls and taking the performers to dinner. He was also working assiduously at his writing during this time. He was a member of the Rhymers' Club, which included W. B. Yeats and Lionel Johnson. He was a contributor to such literary magazines as \"The Yellow Book\" and \"The Savoy\".\n\nDowson collaborated on two unsuccessful novels with Arthur Moore, worked on a novel of his own, \"Madame de Viole\", and wrote reviews for \"The Critic\". Later in his career, Dowson was a prolific translator of French fiction, including novels by Balzac and the Goncourt brothers, and \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\" by Choderlos de Laclos.\n\nIn 1889, aged 23, Dowson became infatuated with the 11 year old Adelaide \"Missie\" Foltinowicz, daughter of a Polish restaurant owner; in 1893 he unsuccessfully proposed to her. To Dowson's despair, Adelaide was eventually to marry a tailor.\n\nIn August 1894, Dowson's father, who was in the advanced stages of tuberculosis, died of an overdose of chloral hydrate. His mother, who was also consumptive, hanged herself in February 1895. Soon after her death, Dowson began to decline rapidly.\nThe publisher Leonard Smithers gave him an allowance to live in France and write translations, but he returned to London in 1897 (where he stayed with the Foltinowicz family, despite the transfer of Adelaide's affections).\nIn 1899, Robert Sherard found Dowson almost penniless in a wine bar and took him back to the cottage in Catford, where Sherard was living. Dowson spent the last six weeks of his life at Sherard's cottage where he died at age 32. He had become a Catholic in 1892 and was interred in the Roman Catholic section of nearby Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries. After Dowson's death, Oscar Wilde wrote: \"Poor wounded wonderful fellow that he was, a tragic reproduction of all tragic poetry, like a symbol, or a scene. I hope bay leaves will be laid on his tomb and rue and myrtle too for he knew what love was\". Wilde himself was dead before the end of the year.\n\nDowson is best remembered for such vivid phrases as \"Days of Wine and Roses\":\n\nand \"Gone with the wind\":\nThis latter poem was first published in \"The Second Book of the Rhymer's Club\" in 1894, and was noticed by Richard Le Gallienne in his \"Wanderings in Bookland\" column in \"The Idler\", volume 9. This is also the source of the phrase 'I have been faithful..in my fashion'.\n\nMargaret Mitchell, touched by the \"far away, faintly sad sound I wanted\" of the third stanza's first line, chose that line as the title of her novel \"Gone with the Wind\".\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", Dowson provides the earliest use of the word soccer in written language (although he spells it \"socca\", presumably because it did not yet have a standard written form).\n\nHis prose works include the short stories collected as \"Dilemmas\" (1895), and the two novels \"A Comedy of Masks\" (1893) and \"Adrian Rome\" (each co-written with Arthur Moore).\n\n\nHis collaborator Arthur Moore wrote several witty comic novels about the young adult duo of Anthony 'Tony' Wilder and Paul Morrow (one, 'The Eyes of Light' is mentioned by friend E. Nesbit in her book 'The Phoenix and the Carpet'). Tony is based on Dowson, while Paul is based on Moore.\n\nFrederick Delius set a number of Dowson's poems, in his \"Songs of Sunset\" and \"Cynara\".\n\nJohn Ireland included a setting of \"I Was Not Sorrowful (Spleen)\" from \"Verses\" (1896) in his 1912 song cycle \"Songs of a Wayfarer\".\n\nT. E. Lawrence quotes from Dowson's poem, \"Impenitentia Ultima,\" in \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", chapter LIV.\n\nIn anticipation of the anniversary of Dowson's birth on 2 August 2010, his grave, which had fallen derelict and been vandalized, was restored. The unveiling and memorial service were publicised in the local (\"South London Press\") and national (BBC Radio 4 and the \"Times Literary Supplement\") British press, and dozens paid posthumous tribute to the poet 110 years after his death. In the Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson, a 1919 memoir written by Arthur Symons, Symons described Dowson as, \"... a man who was undoubtedly a man of genius ... There never was a poet to whom verse came more naturally ... He had the pure lyric gift, unweighed or unballasted by any other quality of mind or emotion...\"\n\nCitations\nSources\nPrimary Works (modern scholarly editions)\n\nBiographies\n\nCritical Studies on Dowson and the 1890s\n\n"}
{"id": "647442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647442", "title": "Father Divine", "text": "Father Divine\n\nFather Divine (c. 1876September 10, 1965), also known as Reverend M. J. Divine, was an African American spiritual leader from about 1907 until his death. His full self-given name was Reverend Major Jealous Divine, and he was also known as \"the Messenger\" early in his life. He founded the International Peace Mission movement, formulated its doctrine, and oversaw its growth from a small and predominantly black congregation into a multiracial and international church.\n\nFather Divine claimed to be God. He made numerous contributions toward his followers' economic independence and racial equality. He was a contemporary of other religious leaders such as Daddy Grace, Charles Harrison Mason, Noble Drew Ali and James F. Jones (also known as Prophet Jones).\n\nLittle is known about Father Divine's early life, or even his real given name. Father Divine and the Peace Movement he started did not keep many records. Father Divine himself declined several offers to write his biography, saying that the history of God would not be useful in mortal terms. He also refused to acknowledge relationship to any family. Newspapers in the 1930s had to dig up his probable given name: George Baker. (This name is not recognized by the Library of Congress, and from 1979, there is no further use of that name as a heading for Father Divine in libraries' catalogs.) Federal Bureau of Investigation files record his name as George Baker alias \"God\".\n\nIn 1936 Eliza Mayfield claimed to be Father Divine's mother. She stated that his real name was Frederick Edwards from Hendersonville, North Carolina, and had abandoned a wife and five children, although Mayfield offered no proof and claimed to not remember his father's name. (Father Divine replied that \"God has no Mother.\")\n\nFather Divine's childhood remains a contentious point. Some, especially earlier researchers, suppose that he was born in the Deep South, most likely in Georgia, as the son of sharecroppers. Newer research by Jill Watts, based on census data, finds evidence for a George Baker, Jr. of appropriate age born in an African-American enclave of Rockville, Maryland, called Monkey Run. If this theory is correct, his mother was a former slave named Nancy Baker, who died in May 1897. Most researchers agree that Father Divine's parents were freed African-American slaves. Notoriously poor records were kept about this generation of African Americans, so controversy about his upbringing is not likely to be resolved. On the other hand, he and his first wife, Peninnah, claimed that they were married on June 6, 1882.\n\nFather Divine was probably called George Baker around the turn of the century. He worked as a gardener in Baltimore, Maryland. In a 1906 sojourn in California, Father Divine became acquainted with the ideas of Charles Fillmore and the New Thought Movement, a philosophy of positive thinking that would inform his later doctrines. Among other things, this belief system asserted that negative thoughts led to poverty and unhappiness. Songwriter Johnny Mercer credited a Father Divine sermon for inspiring the title of his song \"Accentuate the Positive\".\n\nFather Divine attended a local Baptist Church, often preaching, until 1907, when a traveling preacher called Samuel Morris spoke and was expelled from the congregation. Morris, originally from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had a soft-spoken and uncontroversial sermon until the end, when he raised his arms and shouted, \"I am the Eternal Father!\" This routine had him thrown out of many churches in Baltimore, and was apparently unsuccessful until Morris happened upon the receptive Father Divine.\n\nIn his late 20s, Father Divine became Morris's first follower and adopted a pseudonym, \"The Messenger\". The Messenger was a Christ figure to Morris's God the Father. Father Divine preached with Morris in Baltimore out of the home of former evangelist Harriette Snowden, who came to accept their divinity. Morris began calling himself \"Father Jehovia.\"\n\nDivine and Father Jehovia were later joined by John A. Hickerson, who called himself Reverend Bishop Saint John the Vine. John the Vine shared the Messenger's excellent speaking ability and his interest in New Thought.\n\nIn 1912, the three-man ministry collapsed, as John the Vine denied Father Jehovia's monopoly on godhood, citing 1 John 4:15 to mean God was in everyone:\n\nFather Divine had finally parted ways with his former associates. Denying that Father Jehovia was God, and saying that everyone could not be God, he declared that he himself was God, and the only true expression of God's spirit.\n\nFather Divine traveled south, where he preached extensively in Georgia. In 1913, conflicts with local ministers led to him being sentenced to 60 days in a chain gang. While he was serving his sentence, several prison inspectors were injured in an auto accident, which he viewed as the direct result of their disbelief.\n\nUpon his release, he attracted a following of mostly black women in Valdosta, Georgia. He taught celibacy and the rejection of gender categorizations.\n\nOn February 6, 1914, several followers' husbands and local preachers had Divine arrested for lunacy. This actually expanded his ministry, with reporters and worshippers deluging his prison cell. Some whites even began calling on him. Former Mercer University professor and lay preacher, J. R. Moseley of Macon, Georgia, befriended Divine and arranged for J. B. Copeland, a Mercer alum and respected Valdosta lawyer, to represent him \"pro bono\". Moseley was interested in what he termed \"this unusual man\" in his autobiography \"Manifest Destiny.\" Decades later, in the 1930s, Moseley met Divine in New York City when he received word that the man going by that name might in fact be the same person he met in Georgia. Father Divine was found mentally sound in spite of \"maniacal\" beliefs. He had given no name when arrested and was tried as \"John Doe (alias God)\".\n\nIn 1914, Father Divine traveled to Brooklyn, New York, with a small number of followers and an all-black congregation. Although he claimed to be God incarnate fulfilling Biblical prophecy, he lived relatively quietly.\n\nHe and his disciples formed a commune in a black middle-class apartment building. He forbade sex, alcohol, tobacco and gambling among those who were living with him. By 1919, he had adopted the name Reverend Major Jealous Divine. \"Reverend Major\" was chosen as a title of respect and authority, while \"Jealous\" was a reference to Exodus 34:14, where the Lord says he is a \"jealous god\" and that God's name is Jealous. Exodus 34:14 His followers affectionately called him Father Divine.\n\nIn this period, Father Divine married a follower, Penninah, who was decades his senior. Like Father Divine, her early life is obscure, but she is believed to be from Macon, Georgia. The date of the marriage is unknown but probably occurred between 1914 and 1917.\n\nIn addition to lending her dignified look to Father Divine, Penninah served to defuse rumors of impropriety between him and his many young female followers. Both Penninah, who was often called \"Mother Divine\", and Father Divine would assert that the marriage was never physically consummated.\n\nFather Divine and his disciples moved to Sayville, New York (on Long Island), in 1919. He and his followers were the first black homeowners in town. Father Divine purchased his 72 Macon Street house from a resident who wanted to spite the neighbor he was feuding with. The two neighbors, both German Americans, began fighting when one of them changed his name from Felgenhauer to Fellows in response to anti-German sentiment. His neighbor taunted him, and the feud escalated until Fellows decided to move. As a final insult, he specifically advertised his home for sale to a \"colored\" buyer to presumably lower his neighbors' property values.\n\nIn this period, his movement underwent sustained growth. Father Divine held free weekly banquets and helped newcomers find jobs. He began attracting many white followers as well as black. The integrated environment of Father Divine's communal house and the apparently flaunted wealth of his Cadillac infuriated neighbors. Members of the overwhelmingly white community accused him of maintaining a large harem and engaging in scandalous sex, although the Suffolk County district attorney's office found the claims baseless. Nonetheless, the neighbors continued to complain.\n\nOn May 8, 1931, a Sayville deputy arrested and charged Father Divine with disturbing the peace. Remarkable during the Depression, Father Divine submitted his $1000 bail in cash. The trial, not as speedy as the neighbors wanted, was scheduled for late fall, allowing Father Divine's popularity to snowball for the entire Sayville vacation season.\n\nFather Divine held banquets for as many as 3000 people that summer. Cars clogging the streets for these gatherings bolstered some neighbors' claims that Father Divine \"was\" a disturbance to the peace and furthermore was hurting their property values.\n\nOn Sunday, November 15, at 12:15 am, a police officer was called to Father Divine's raucously loud property. By the time state troopers, deputies and prison buses were called in, a mob of neighbors had surrounded the compound. Fearing a riot, the police informed Father Divine and his followers that they had fifteen minutes to disperse. Father Divine had them wait in silence for ten minutes, and then they filed into police custody. Processed by the county jail at 3 AM, clerks were frustrated, because the followers often refused to give their usual names and stubbornly offered the \"inspired\" names they adopted in the movement. Seventy-eight people were arrested altogether, including fifteen whites. Forty-six pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace and incurred $5 fines, which Father Divine paid with a $500 bill, which the court was embarrassingly unable to make change from. Penninah, Father Divine, and thirty followers resisted the charges.\n\nFather Divine's arrest and heterodox doctrines were sensationally reported. The New York frenzy made this event and its repercussions the single most famous moment of Father Divine's life. Although mostly inaccurate, articles on Father Divine propelled his popularity. By December, his followers began renting buildings in New York City for Father Divine to speak in. Soon, he often had several engagements on a single night. On December 20, he spoke to an estimated 10,000 in Harlem's Rockland Palace, a spacious former basketball venue, Manhattan Casino.\n\nBy May 1932, meetings were regularly held at the Rockland and throughout New York and New Jersey. Father Divine had supporters in Washington state, California and throughout the world thanks to New Thought devotees like Eugene Del Mar, an early convert and former Harlem journalist, and Henry Joerns, the publisher of a New Thought magazine in Seattle. Curiously, although the movement was predominantly black, followers outside the Northeast were mostly middle class whites.\n\nIn this period of expansions, several branch communes were opened in New York and New Jersey. Father Divine's followers finally named the movement: the International Peace Mission movement.\n\nFather Divine's trial was finally held on May 24, 1932. His lawyer, Ellee J. Lovelace, a prominent Harlem African American and former US Attorney had requested the trial be moved outside of Suffolk County, due to potential jury bias. The court acquiesced, and the trial took place at the Nassau County Supreme Court before Justice Lewis J. Smith. The jury found him guilty on June 5 but asked for leniency on behalf of Father Divine. Ignoring this request, Justice Smith lectured on how Father Divine was a fraud and \"menace to society\" before issuing the maximum sentence for disturbing the peace, one year in prison and a $500 fine.\n\nSmith, 55, died of a heart attack days later on June 9, 1932. Father Divine was widely reported to have commented on the death, \"I hated to do it.\" In fact, he wrote to his followers, \"I did not desire Judge Smith to die.… I did desire that MY spirit would touch his heart and change his mind that he might repent and believe and be saved from the grave.\"\n\nThe impression that Justice Smith's death was divine retribution was perpetuated by the press, which failed to report Smith's prior heart problems and implied the death to be more sudden and unexpected than it was.\n\nDuring his brief prison stay, Father Divine read prodigiously, notably on the Scottsboro Nine. After his attorneys secured release through an appeal on June 25, 1932, he declared that the foundational documents of the United States of America, such as the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, were inspired. Father Divine also taught that contemporary leaders strayed from these ideals, but he would become increasingly patriotic through his life.\n\nFather Divine moved to Harlem, New York, where he had accumulated significant following in the black community. Members, rather than Father Divine himself, held most deeds for the movement, but they contributed toward Father Divine's comfortable lifestyle. Purchasing several hotels, which they called \"Heavens\", members could live and seek jobs inexpensively. The movement also opened several budget enterprises, including restaurants and clothing shops, that sold cheaply by cutting overhead. These proved very successful in the depression. Economical, cash-only businesses were actually part of Father Divine's doctrine.\n\nBy 1934, branches had opened in Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, Washington, and gatherings occurred in France, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia, but the membership totals were drastically overstated in the press. \"Time Magazine\" estimated nearly two million followers, but the true figure of adherents was probably a few tens of thousands and a larger body of sympathizers who attended his gatherings. Nonetheless, Father Divine was increasingly called upon to offer political endorsements, which he initially did not. For example, New York mayoral candidates John P. O'Brien and Fiorello H. LaGuardia each sought his endorsement in 1933, but Father Divine was apparently uninterested.\n\nAn odd alliance between Father Divine and the Communist Party of America began in early 1934. Although Father Divine was outspokenly capitalist, he was impressed with the party's commitment to civil rights. The party relished the endorsement, although contemporary FBI records indicate some critics of the perceived huckster were expelled from the party for protesting the alliance.\n\nIn spite of this alliance, the movement was largely apolitical until the Harlem Riot of 1935. Based on a rumor of police killing a black teenager, it left four dead and caused over $1 million in property damage in Father Divine's neighborhood. Father Divine's outrage at this and other racial injustices fueled a keener interest in politics. In January 1939, the movement organized the first-ever \"Divine Righteous Government Convention\", which crafted political platforms incorporating the Doctrine of Father Divine. Among other things, the delegates opposed school segregation and many of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's social programs, which they interpreted as \"handouts\".\n\nAt the zenith of Father Divine's influence, several misfortunes struck the movement. \n\nOn December 16, John Hunt, a white millionaire and disciple from California calling himself John the Revelator, met the Jewett family of Denver, Colorado. He kidnapped their 17-year-old daughter Delight and took her back to California without her parents' consent. Renaming her \"Virgin Mary\", John the Revelator began sexual relations with her. He announced that she would give birth to a \"New Redeemer\" by \"immaculate conception\" in Hawaii. Father Divine summoned Hunt to New York, separated the couple and chastised his eccentric follower. The Jewetts, finding their daughter apparently brainwashed into believing she was literally the Virgin Mary, demanded compensation. After the movement's attorneys conducted an internal investigation, they refused. Outraged, the Jewetts offered their story to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Evening Journal\", an established critic of the movement. After a manhunt and trial, John Hunt was sentenced to three years and adopted a new name, the \"Prodigal Son\". Father Divine publicly endorsed the conviction of John the Revelator, contrary to some expectations (some followers expected him to once again \"smite\" the judge). However, the scandal brought bad publicity to Father Divine. News coverage implied his followers were gullible and dangerous.\n\nIn March 1937, Penninah fell ill in Kingston, New York. Father Divine rarely comforted her on what was widely believed to be her deathbed. He kept running the church, only visiting her once in Kingston, again causing bad publicity. Penninah, however, claimed that she was not seriously ill or in pain.\n\nOn April 20, 1937, a violent outburst occurred in a meeting when two men tried to deliver Father Divine a summons. One of the men, Harry Green, was stabbed as Father Divine fled. Father Divine went into hiding to evade authorities.\n\nDuring this time, one of Father Divine's most prominent followers, called Faithful Mary, defected and took control of a large commune, which was technically in her name. Of the Father she said, \"he's just a damned man.\" She furthermore alleged that he defrauded his followers to maintain a rich lifestyle for himself. Faithful Mary also made a number of sexual allegations, including a charge that Father Divine coerced women to have sex with key disciples.\n\nIn early May, Father Divine was located and extradited from Connecticut and faced criminal charges in New York. That summer, Hearst's Metronone newsreel distributed mocking footage of Father Divine's followers singing outside police headquarters, \"Glory, glory, hallelujah! Our God is in our land!\"\n\nLater in May 1937, an ex-follower called Verinda Brown filed a lawsuit for $4,476 against Father Divine. The Browns had entrusted their savings with Father Divine in Sayville back in 1931. They left the movement in 1935 wishing to live as husband and wife again, but were unable to get their money back. In light of their evidence and testimony from Faithful Mary and others critical of the movement, the court ordered repayment of the money. However, this opened up an enormous potential liability from all ex-devotees, so Father Divine resisted and appealed the judgment.\n\nIn 1938, Father Divine was cleared of criminal charges and Mother Divine recovered. Faithful Mary, impoverished and broken, returned to the movement. Father Divine made her grovel for forgiveness, which she did. By the late 1930s, the movement stabilized, although it had clearly passed its zenith.\n\nFather Divine's political focus on anti-lynching measures became more resolved. By 1940, his followers had gathered 250,000 signatures in favor of an anti-lynching bill he wrote. However, passage of such statutes came slowly in New York and elsewhere.\n\nThe Verinda Brown lawsuit against Father dragged on and was sustained on appeal. In July, 1942, he was ordered to pay Brown or face contempt of court. Instead, Father Divine fled the state and re-established his headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He still visited New York, however. State law forbade serving subpoenas in New York on Sunday, so he often spoke on the Sabbath day in Harlem, the Promised Land (his Kingston commune), and Sayville.\n\nAfter moving to Philadelphia, Father Divine's wife, Penninah, died. The exact date is not known, because Father Divine never talked about it or even acknowledged her death. However, it occurred sometime in 1943, and biographers believe Penninah's death rattled Father Divine, making him aware of his own mortality. It became obvious to Father Divine and his followers that his doctrine might not make one immortal as he asserted, at least not in the flesh.\n\nIn 1944, singer/songwriter Johnny Mercer came to hear of one of Divine's sermons. The subject was \"You got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.\" Mercer said, \"Wow, that's a colorful phrase!” He went back to Hollywood and got together with songwriter Harold Arlen (\"Over The Rainbow\"), and together they wrote \"Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive\", which was recorded by Mercer himself and the Pied Pipers in 1945. It was also recorded by Bing Crosby with the Andrews Sisters that same year.\n\nAfter his first wife died, Father Divine married a white Canadian woman called Edna Rose Ritchings in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 1946. The ceremony was kept secret even from most members until Ritching's visa expired. Critics of the movement believed that Father Divine's seemingly scandalous marriage to 21-year-old Ritchings would destroy the movement. Instead, most followers rejoiced, and the marriage date became a celebrated anniversary in the movement. To prove that he and Ritchings adhered to his doctrine on sexual abstinence, Father Divine assigned a black female follower to be her constant companion.\n\nHe claimed that Ritchings, later called \"Mother S. A. Divine\", was the reincarnation of Penninah. Reincarnation was not previously part of Father Divine's doctrine and did not become a fixture of his theology. Followers believed that Penninah was an exceptional case and viewed her \"return\" as a miracle.\n\nGoing into the 1950s, the press rarely covered Father Divine, and when it did, it was no longer as a menace, but as an amusing relic. For example, light-hearted stories ran when Father Divine announced Philadelphia was capital of the world and when he claimed to inspire invention of the hydrogen bomb. Father Divine's predominantly lower-class following ebbed as the economy swelled.\nIn 1953, follower John Devoute gave Father Divine Woodmont, a 72-acre (0.3 km²) hilltop estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia. This French Gothic manor served as his home and primary site of his increasingly infrequent banquets until his death in 1965.\n\nAs his health declined, he continued to petition for civil rights. In 1951, he advocated reparations to be paid to the descendants of slaves. He also argued in favor of integrated neighborhoods. However, he did not participate in the burgeoning American Civil Rights Movement because of his poor health and especially his dislike of the use of racial labels, denying he was black.\n\nOn September 10, 1965, Father Divine died of natural causes at his Woodmont estate. His widow and remaining followers insist his spirit is still alive and always refer to Father Divine in the present tense. Believers keep the furnishings of Father Divine's personal rooms at Woodmont just as they were as a shrine to his life.\n\nEdna Rose Ritchings became spiritual leader of the movement. In 1972, she fought an attempt by Jim Jones to take over the movement's dwindling devotees. Jones based some of his doctrines on the International Peace Mission movement and claimed to be the reincarnation of Father Divine. Although a few members of the Mission joined Peoples Temple after Jones made his play for leadership of the movement, the power push was, in terms of its ultimate objective, a complete failure. That Jones was 34 years old at the time of Father Divine's death made his claims of being a new incarnation rather hard to sustain - Jones claimed Divine's spirit had entered his body upon the passing of the elder man - and Ritchings was left unimpressed by Jones' impassioned rhetoric. Jones' custom of tape-recording all his sermons was copied from Divine, who \"spoke\" to his followers via archived sermon tapes once ill health forced him to cease speaking at meetings.\n\nFather Divine was a lightly built African American man at a diminutive 5′2″ (1.57 m). Through most of his life, he maintained a fastidious appearance and a neat moustache that he kept well groomed, his hair was invariably neatly combed, and since his days in Sayville, New York, he almost always wore a suit in public.\n\nFather Divine was said to be very charismatic. His sermons were emotionally moving and freely associated between topics. His speech was often peppered with words of his own invention like \"physicalating\" and \"tangiblated\". An attendee at a Harlem \"kingdoms\" meeting in the 1930s recalled that he rhythmically intoned \"Tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions. Tens, hundreds, ... millions.' Although this seemed nonsense to the visitor, he reported that at the end the true believers chanted, \"Yes, he's God. Yes he's God.\" Other eccentricities were drawn from his doctrine. For example, nearly every sermon began with the greeting and exhortation \"Peace!\" Father Divine believed that \"peace\" should replace \"hello\".\n\nFather Divine preached of his divinity even before he was known as \"Father Divine\" in the late 1910s. His doctrine taught that his life fulfilled all Biblical prophecies about the second coming, regarding himself as Jesus Christ reborn. Father Divine also lectured that Christ existed in \"every joint\" of his follower's bodies, and that he was \"God's light\" incarnated in order to show people how to establish heaven on earth and to show them the way to eternal life. For example:\n\nFather Divine and his followers capitalized pronouns referring to him, much like \"LORD\" translated from the tetragrammaton is capitalized in the English Bible.\n\nFather Divine's definition of God became quite celebrated at the time because of its unusual use of language: \"God is not only personified and materialized. He is repersonified and rematerialized. He rematerialized and He rematerialates. He rematerialates and He is rematerializatable. He repersonificates and He repersonifitizes.\"\n\nFather Divine can be considered part of the New Thought Movement; indeed, many of his white followers came from this tradition.\n\nFather Divine was particularly concerned with the downtrodden of society, including but not limited to Blacks. He was opposed to people accepting welfare.\n\nScholars disagree about whether Father Divine, an African American, was a civil rights activist, but he certainly advocated some progressive changes to race relations. For example, because he believed that every human was accorded equal rights, he believed that all members of lynch mobs ought to be tried and convicted as murderers. Father Divine's anti-lynching campaigns resonated in the black ghettos where his congregations lived, and he got over a quarter million people to sign his anti-lynching proposals.\n\nFather Divine advocated that followers think of themselves as simply Americans. He believed that America was the birthplace of the \"Kingdom of God\", which would ultimately encompass truths of all religious principles, promoting equality and brotherhood. The Movement was supportive of the United States Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and particularly the Bill of Rights as inspired documents, believing that they outlined a more ideal life.\n\nToward this life, followers of Father Divine owned and managed property collectively. The movement strove to alleviate poverty by feeding the poor and through education in written English, which the Movement believed was the \"universal language.\"\n\nFather Divine established an \"International Modesty Code\" which forbids smoking, drinking, and profanity. Additionally, it forbade tips, bribes, receiving presents, and \"undue mixing of the sexes,\" along with women wearing slacks or short skirts and men wearing short-sleeves.\n\nAlthough Father Divine himself was married, the movement discouraged marriage, along with any excessive mingling of the sexes. In the \"Heavens\" and other living spaces the Movement maintained, separate areas existed for men and women.\n\nFather Divine advocated a number of economic practices, which his followers abided by. He opposed life insurance (which converts were to cancel), welfare, social security, and credit. Thus, the Movement advocated economic self-sufficiency. His insistence that his followers refuse welfare not related to employment was estimated to have saved New York City $2 million during the Depression.\n\nBusiness owners in the Movement named their ventures to show affiliation with Father Divine, and obeyed all of these practices. They dealt only in cash, refusing credit in any of its forms. Each was to sell below competitor's prices while refusing any sorts of tips or gratuities. Finally, they refrained from trade in alcohol or tobacco.\n\nSome biographers, such as Robert Weisbrot, speculate that Father Divine was a forerunner to the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s, heavily influenced by his upbringing in the segregated South. Others, such as Jill Watts, reject not only this characterization, but also the theory that Father Divine grew up in the Deep South. Watts asserts that Rockville was less oppressive than the South or even Baltimore, Maryland, and believes his civil rights positions are unintelligible without evaluating them in the context of the Doctrine of Father Divine.\n\nAlthough Father Divine strove extensively against lynching and bigotry, he accepted many of the negative characteristics assigned African Americans. He concluded that those who identified themselves as \"black\" manifested these characteristics. In short, he believed blacks perpetuated their own oppression by thinking racially. He once said that he was not poor because he did not belong to a poor downtrodden race—that he was not black.\n\nEdna Rose Ritchings (Mother Divine) conducted services for the old and dwindling congregation until her death. The movement owns several properties, such as Father Divine's Gladwyne estate Woodmont, his former home in Sayville, New York, and the Circle Mission Church on Broad Street in Philadelphia, which also houses the movement's library.\n\nChapters exist in Pennsylvania and possibly elsewhere, but the movement is not centralized and exists through a number of interrelated groups.\n\nIn 2004, \"Gastronomica\" magazine published an article about Mother S. A. Divine and the movement's feasts.\n\nIn 2000, the Divine Lorraine Hotel near Temple University on North Broad Street was sold off by the international Peace Mission Movement. It was a budget hotel with separate floors for men and women in accord with Father Divine's teachings. The Divine Tracy Hotel in West Philadelphia was sold in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

Government policy contributes to the generally free practice of religion. There were no reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. The country is generally characterized by a high degree of religious tolerance.\n\nMuslim centers and Christian churches of various denominations operate freely throughout the country. Approximately 70 percent of the population is at least nominally Christian, 20 percent is at least nominally Muslim, and 10 percent practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs. The Christian population is divided approximately equally between Catholic and Protestant denominations. Christians are concentrated chiefly in the southern and western provinces and Muslims reside in large numbers in every province. Traditional indigenous religious beliefs are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The Government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. There is no official state religion.\n\nChristian and Islamic holy days are celebrated as national holidays. These include the Christian holy days of Good Friday, Ascension Day, Assumption Day, and Christmas Day, and the Islamic holy days of the Feast of the Lamb and Eid al-Fitr, the End of Ramadan.\n\nThe Law on Religious Congregations governs relations between the Government and religious groups. The Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization (MINATD) must approve and register religious groups in order for them to function legally. There were no reports that the Government refused to register any group; however, the process can take a number of years. It is illegal for a religious group to operate without official recognition, but the law prescribes no specific penalties. There was a growth within the major cities of so-called \"sects,\" which their leaders consider to be subgroups of Protestant denominations; few of these are registered, and all of them operate freely. Although official recognition confers no general tax benefits, it allows religious groups to receive real estate as tax-free gifts and legacies for the conduct of their activities.\n\nTo register, a religious denomination must legally qualify as a religious congregation. The definition includes \"any group of natural persons or corporate bodies whose vocation is divine worship\" or \"any group of persons living in community in accordance with a religious doctrine.\" The denomination then submits a file to the MINATD. The file must include a request for authorization, a copy of the group's charter describing planned activities, and the names and functions of the group's officials. The Minister reviews the file and sends it to the presidency with a recommendation to approve or deny. The president generally follows the recommendation of the Minister and grants authorization by a presidential decree. The approval process may take up to several years.\n\nThe only religious groups known to be registered are Christian, Muslim, and Bahai. According to the latest MINATD statistics (released in 2002), there are 38 officially registered denominations, most of which are Christian. There also are numerous unregistered small religious groups that operate freely. The Government does not register traditional indigenous religious groups, stating that the practice of traditional religion is a private concern observed by members of a particular ethnic or kinship group or the residents of a particular locality.\n\nThe MINATD, rather than the judiciary, primarily resolves disputes between or within registered religious groups about control of places of worship, schools, other real estate, or financial assets.\n\nMissionary groups are present and operate without impediment. The licensing requirements for foreign groups are the same as those for domestic religious denominations.\n\nThe practice of witchcraft is a criminal offense under the national penal code, punishable by a 2 to 10-year prison term.\n\nSeveral religious denominations operate primary and secondary schools. Although post-secondary education continues to be dominated by state institutions, private schools affiliated with religious denominations, including Catholic, Protestant, and Qur'anic schools, have been among the best schools at the primary and secondary levels for many years. The law charges the Ministry of Basic Education and the Ministry of Secondary Education with ensuring that private schools run by religious groups meet the same standards as state-operated schools in terms of curriculum, infrastructure, and teacher training. For schools affiliated with religious groups, the Sub-Department of Confessional Education of the Department of Private Education performs this oversight function. School attendance—at public, private, or parochial schools—is mandatory through junior high school. The campuses of the Central Africa Catholic University, [The Cameroon Christian University] and the International Adventist University are located in the country.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church in Cameroon operates one of the country's few modern private printing presses and also the Roman Catholic Church publishes a weekly newspaper through its own Modern printing press.\n\nA 2000 government decree requires potential commercial radio broadcasters to submit a licensing application, pay a fee when the application is approved, and pay an annual licensing fee. The Government has been slow in granting authorization; consequently, there are many unauthorized radio stations operating. Two private religious radio stations, the Pentecostal Radio Bonne Nouvelle and Radio Reine (managed by a Catholic priest although not officially sponsored by the Catholic Church), that had been broadcasting without licenses continued to broadcast while awaiting official authorization, as do many other radio stations awaiting their licenses. The Catholic station Radio Veritas has temporary authorization to broadcast and has been broadcasting without incident.\n\nThe state-sponsored television station, CRTV, carries two hours of Christian programming on Sunday mornings, normally an hour of Catholic Mass and an hour of a Protestant service. There is also one broadcast hour dedicated to Islam on Friday evenings. State-sponsored radio broadcasts Christian and Islamic religious services on a regular basis, and both the radio and television stations periodically broadcast religious ceremonies on national holidays or during national events. State television occasionally broadcasts ecumenical ceremonies on major occasions such as the commemoration of a national event.\n\nGovernment policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion.\n\nThe practice of witchcraft is a criminal offense under the national penal code. People generally are prosecuted for this offense only in conjunction with some other offense such as murder; however, there were no reports of convictions of witchcraft under this law. The Government distinguishes between witchcraft and traditional indigenous religious practices; witchcraft is defined by the law as attempts to do harm by spiritual means and is a common explanation for diseases.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States. In 2004 the Government responded promptly to assist the U.S. Embassy in the case of the forced conversion of American citizens by a private actor.\n\nThere were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice; however, some religious groups reported societal hostility within their regions. Established churches denounced new unaffiliated religious groups, most of which are individually motivated Tele-ministries, as \"sects\" or \"cults,\" claiming that they were detrimental to societal peace and harmony. In practice, such denunciation did not inhibit the practice of the unaffiliated religious groups. In the northern provinces, especially in rural areas, societal hostility by Muslims against Christians and persons who practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs continued.\n\nWhen there have been natural disasters, or to commemorate national events, Christians and Muslims organized ecumenical ceremonies to pray and promote a spirit of tolerance and peace.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16142605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16142605", "title": "Freedom of religion in the Comoros", "text": "Freedom of religion in the Comoros\n\nFreedom of religion in Comoros is addressed in the constitution. However, there are limitations to this right in practice. While government authorities continued to prohibit Christians from proselytizing, there were no known instances where the local authorities and population restricted the right of Christians to practice other aspects of their faith. There was societal discrimination against non-Muslims in some sectors of society; however, accounts of social pressure were anecdotal. Proselytizing for any religion except Islam is illegal, and converts from Islam may be prosecuted under the law. However, such prosecutions are rare and have not resulted in any convictions in recent years. In the past, there were reports of family and community members excluding non-Muslim converts from schools or villages for \"evangelizing Muslims\".\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 711,000. Ninety-nine percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. There is no sharp divide between Sunni and Shi'a, and most Muslims respect the doctrinal differences between the two branches of Islam. Foreigners living on the islands number several hundred, and include Hindus, Jehovah's Witnesses, and members of other Christian groups including Roman Catholics and Protestants.\n\nA few foreign religious groups maintain humanitarian programs, but by agreement with the Government, they did not engage in proselytizing.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, but the Government continued to limit this right in practice. In 2009, an amendment to the Constitution added that Islam is \"the religion of the state.\" In addition, the Constitution states that Islam is the \"permanent inspiration of the principles and rules that govern the Union.\"\n\nThe 2002 Constitution reincorporates Ndzuwani (Anjouan), Ngazidja (Grande Comore), and Moheli into a new federation that grants the islands greater autonomy. There are no legal restrictions that prevent Christians from attending church, and non-citizen Christians are allowed to practice their faith without government intervention as long as they do not attempt to convert citizens. Foreigners caught proselytizing for religions other than Islam are subject to deportation.\n\nWhile the law allows non-Muslims to practice their religion, it prohibits citizens from converting from Islam. The 2002 amended Constitution upholds religious freedom; however, the pre-existing Penal Code prohibits conversion from Islam and has yet to be modified to reflect this standard. Although enforceable, this law is rarely applied.\n\nGovernment authorities continue to prohibit non-Muslims from proselytizing. A law dating from the early 1980s states \"whoever divulges, promotes, or teaches Muslims a religion other than Islam will be punished with a three-month prison sentence and a fine of 50,000 to 500,000 Comoran Francs.\" However, in practice the government does not impose this fine.\n\nThe Grand Mufti is part of the Government and manages a department that handles issues concerning religion and religious administration. The Grand Mufti's position is attached to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, and he counsels the Government on matters of Islamic faith and ensures that Islamic laws are respected. He is nominated by the President. The Grand Mufti periodically consults with a group of elders to assess whether the principles of Islam are respected, and he regularly addresses the nation on the radio regarding social and religious issues such as marriage, divorce, and education.\n\nWhile the study of Islam is not compulsory in public schools, the tenets of Islam are sometimes taught in conjunction with the Arabic language in public schools at the middle school level. There are no separate provisions made for religious minorities in public schools; however, foreigners can request that their children not receive Islamic instruction or Arabic language training. Almost all children between the ages of 4 and 7 also attend schools to learn to recite and understand the Qur'an, although attendance is not compulsory for religious minorities. There are more than 10 private schools on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore), none of which are specifically non-Muslim.\n\nSeveral Islamic holy days, including the Islamic New Year, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Eid al-Fitr, are national holidays.\n\nThe flag of Comoros contains Muslim symbols: crescents and stars on a green background.\n\nThe Government does not require religious groups to be licensed, registered, or officially recognized.\n\nThe Government does not ban specific religions or religious factions. The Government allows organized religious groups to establish places of worship, train clergy to serve believers, and assemble for peaceful religious activities. However, proselytizing for any religion except Islam is illegal and foreigners caught proselytizing for religions other than Islam were subject to deportation under the law.\n\nIn 2013, a law was passed establishing the Sunni Shafi'i doctrine as the only allowable religious practice in the country and placing sanctions on all other religious practice on the grounds of avoiding social unrest and the undermining of national cohesion and unity. The government states it ratified the law due to fears of religious radicalization.\n\nThere were no reports of government sponsorship of speech or materials that foster intolerance or hatred toward any religious groups.\n\nThe Government does not prohibit, restrict, or punish parents for raising their children in accordance with religious teachings and practices of their choice.\n\nThere are no specific religious requirements for membership in the ruling party.\n\nThe Government did not designate religion on passports or national identity documents, either explicitly or in code.\n\nThe Government prohibited the distribution of religious literature, clothing, and symbols. The International Church of Moroni was allowed to import 10,000 gift boxes in April 2007 provided the boxes did not contain religious literature, symbols, or clothing. In 2006 the organization was prohibited from distributing gift boxes of toys for local children containing cross necklaces. In 2006 authorities on Grande Comores barred the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Who Will Follow Me?, created by the Protestant Church in Moroni, from distributing imported T-shirts emblazoned with the NGO's name in Comoran.\n\nBans on alcohol and immodest dress are enforced sporadically, usually during religious months, such as Ramadan. Alcohol can be imported and sold with a permit from the Government.\n\nOn July 6, 2006, in a general amnesty decreed by President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi in celebration of Independence Day, prisoners were released who had been arrested in the preceding 6 months. Among them were four citizens who were convicted of \"evangelizing Muslims\" for hosting Christian religious debates in a private residence. There are rarely cases of religious detainees or prisoners. This was the only reported instance where the Government imposed fines, later waived, for unauthorized religious activity. Local police supported the village of Ndruani's decision to chase out the \"evangelizers.\"\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, the government did not allow non-Sunni Muslim citizens to establish places of worship or assemble for peaceful religious activities.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nThere is societal discrimination against non-Muslims, particularly Christians, in some sectors of society. All citizens face societal pressure to practice elements of Islam, particularly during the month of Ramadan. Most societal pressure and discrimination occurs behind closed doors at the village level, far from the eyes of the Government or media. The extent of de facto discrimination typically depends on the level of involvement of local Islamic teachers. Most non-Muslim citizens did not openly practice their faith for fear of societal rejection. Persons who raise their children with non-Muslim religious teachings face societal discrimination. Societal pressure and intimidation continued to restrict the use of the country's three churches to non-citizens.\n\nThere is concern that Islamic fundamentalism is increasing as young citizens return to the country following Islamic theological studies abroad and seek to impose a stricter adherence to Islamic religious law on their family members and associates; in response, the Union Government has established a university to give young citizens the option of pursuing university studies in the country.\n\n"}

This forum is associated with numerous controversial topics and people regarding terrorism and terror financing.\n\nIts objective, as stated by the general coordinator of the conference, Fahd Albmal, was to create a union to mirror that of the GCC, aimed at discussing broad political reforms and social and political development throughout the gulf. He also indicated that it required four months of planning through the formation of a number of committees and Gulf leaders to complement the GCC. Adel Ali Abdullah, the spokesperson for the conference, stated that these countries, including UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman, were looking to ensure the stability of these countries and hopefully have Yemen join the league. Additionally, he indicated that they hoped to combat the dangers facing the region that threaten their Islamic identity and foreign security risks. Throughout its promotion, the forum indicated that it gathered political and intellectual elites ranging from academic thinkers, writers, politicians, and journalists from all of the Gulf States in the pretext of a forum or conference, representing all spectrums of society and doctrines of thought.\n\nThe conference was attended by 400 individuals from the 6 GCC countries, and hoped to publicize further this union. It featured a series of seminars by 6 speakers over two days. At the end of the conference, the forum issued a statement calling on all citizens and the institutions of civil society to participate in achieving the objectives of the forum, which included comprehensive reform of the governments and people within the countries represented.\n\nThe conference met in Bahrain at the Diplomat Hotel on October 14, 2011, lasting two days. This founding conference was held under the patronage of King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and was promoted via social media accounts.\n\nAccording to its Facebook and Twitter account this forum was meant be its inaugural panel. However, the Facebook page has not been active since the completion of that meeting in October 2011, nor has it been reported that a forum of that scale occurred since then.\n\nOn the other hand, its Twitter page, followed by over 1,300 accounts, has been active between the initiation of the conference and April 2014. Its tweets include YouTube links to various workshops and updates of forum and board meetings that have occurred in Bahrain and Paris. Furthermore, it has tweeted various provocative statements including ones that refer to Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood protesters who died in escalated protests as Allah’s martyrs.\n\nIt is reported that at the conference, the forum announced stances on controversial issues such as the Syrian Civil War and the insurgencies in Yemen stating that they should use whatever means necessary to fight back their repressive states and any form of aggression. They also discussed Western dangers that threaten Islamic identity.\n\nAdditionally, during the conference a board of trustees was chosen, listing six individuals from each country represented, or 36 in total. Of these 36 individuals, at least 4 are known terrorists or are associated with terrorist groups/activities including Saad bin Saad al –Kaabi, an al Qaeda financier and U.S. sanctioned terrorist, Abdul Rahman bin Omair al-Naimi, another al Qaeda financier and U.S. designated terrorist, Hassan Ahmed al-Diqqi, an extremist al Ummah party leader and Syrian rebel financier, and Abdullah Abdul Qader Ahmad Ali al-Hajiri, a Muslim Brotherhood activist, who has been convicted of treason and jailed in the UAE.\n"}
{"id": "2198290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198290", "title": "Harold Camping", "text": "Harold Camping\n\nHarold Egbert Camping (July 19, 1921December 15, 2013) was an American Christian radio broadcaster, author and evangelist. Beginning in 1958, he served as president of Family Radio, a California-based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the United States. In October 2011, he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke, but still maintained a role at Family Radio until his death. Camping is notable for issuing multiple failed predictions of dates for the End Times, which temporarily gained him a global following and millions of dollars of donations.\n\nCamping predicted that Jesus Christ would return to Earth on May 21, 2011, whereupon the saved would be taken up to heaven in the rapture, and that there would follow five months of fire, brimstone and plagues on Earth, with millions of people dying each day, culminating on October 21, 2011, with the final destruction of the world. He had previously predicted that Judgment Day would occur on or about September 6, 1994.\n\nHis prediction for May 21, 2011 was widely reported, in part because of a large-scale publicity campaign by Family Radio, and it prompted ridicule from atheist organizations and rebuttals from Christian organizations. After May 21 passed without the predicted incidents, Camping said he believed that a \"spiritual\" judgment had occurred on that date, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the final destruction of the universe by God. Except for one press appearance on May 23, 2011, Camping largely avoided press interviews after May 21, particularly after he suffered a stroke in June 2011. After October 21, 2011 passed without the predicted apocalypse, the mainstream media labeled Camping a \"false prophet\" and commented that his ministry would collapse after the \"failed 'Doomsday' prediction\".\n\nCamping was reported to have retired from his position at Family Radio on October 16, 2011, only days before his last predicted date for the end of the world. However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at Family Radio while working from home. Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world, in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject. In March 2012, he stated that his attempt to predict a date was \"sinful\", and that his critics had been right in emphasizing the words of : \"of that day and hour knoweth no man\". He added that he was now searching the Bible \"even more fervently...not to find dates, but to be more faithful in [his] understanding.\" After the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio suffered a significant loss of assets, staff and revenue.\n\nHarold Egbert Camping was born on July 19, 1921, in Boulder, Colorado and moved at an early age to California. Both his parents came from the Netherlands – his mother from Friesland, his father from Groningen – but they first met each other in the United States. In 1942, Camping earned a B.S. degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1943, he married his wife, Shirley. He and his family were members of the Christian Reformed Church until 1988.\n\nIn 1958, Camping joined with other individuals of Christian Reformed, Bible Baptist, and conservative Presbyterian backgrounds to purchase an FM radio station in San Francisco, California. The radio station – KEAR, then at 97.3 MHz – was used to broadcast traditional Christian Gospel to the conservative Protestant community and minister to the general public. Through the 1960s, Family Radio acquired six additional FM stations and seven other AM stations under guidelines established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nIn 1961, Family Radio began running the Open Forum, a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011. Listeners were invited to call in, primarily with questions about the meaning of certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging from the nature of sin and salvation to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education. The Open Forum continued running until Camping's partial retirement in July 2011, and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The Open Forum was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via shortwave station WYFR, a network of AM and FM radio stations, a cable television station and the Internet. In October 2012, over a year after the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio began airing repeats of his broadcasts.\n\nFamily Radio runs various programs on its radio stations. Before Camping started teaching that the \"Church Age\" had ended, programs produced outside of Family Radio were welcome provided they did not accept any \"extra-Biblical revelation\", and were associated with teachings accepted by the historic Christian faith. Family Radio also utilized at least three television stations: WFME-TV in the New York City area; KFTL-CD in San Francisco, California; and KHFR-LD in Boise, Idaho. Following the digital transition of 2009, Family Radio used its subchannels of WFME and KFTL for various purposes – in WFME's case, the digital signal of that station broadcasts ten separate subchannels, the first being the main channel, and the others carrying audio feeds of other Family Radio services, as well as one broadcasting NOAA Weather Radio.\n\nFamily Radio spent over US$100 million on the information campaign for Camping's 2011 end times prediction, financed by sales and swaps of broadcast outlets.\n\nIn 1970, Camping published \"The Biblical Calendar of History\" (later greatly expanded in his 1974 book \"Adam When?\"), in which he dated the Creation of the world to the year 11,013 BC and the Flood to 4990 BC. This was in contradiction to Bishop James Ussher's famous 17th-century chronology, which placed the Creation at 4004 BC and the Flood at 2349 BC. Camping argued that Ussher's dates \"agree neither with the Biblical nor the secular evidence\", asserting that Ussher's methodology was flawed.\n\nCamping surmised that the word \"begat\" in the Old Testament scriptures did not necessarily imply an immediate father-son relationship, as had been assumed by Ussher and others who (Camping felt) had not correctly interpreted the biblical timeline. Camping noted the use of the phrase \"called his name\" (\"qara shem\" in Hebrew, found three times in Genesis 4–5), which he characterized as a \"clue phrase\" to indicate an immediate father-son relationship. Despite the fact that this \"clue phrase\" does not occur regarding Noah naming Shem, Camping maintained that there is enough evidence to otherwise conclude that they did, in fact, have an immediate father-son relationship. He also points out the use of \"qara shem\" in Isaiah 7:14, which he interpreted as meaning, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\"\n\nCamping assumed that, since \"qara shem\" implies an immediate father-son relationship (e.g., Adam–Seth, Seth–Enos, and Lamech–Noah), all other relationships between the Antediluvian patriarchs (except Noah–Shem) are of ancestors and their distant descendants. That is, when one patriarch died, the next one who is mentioned was not his son but was actually a distant multi-generational grandson who was born in that same year. Camping thus formulated the concept of the \"reference patriarch,\" i.e., various events are referenced to a specific year of a particular patriarch's life as a means of keeping an accurate chronological record. Although there is no evidence that any ancient civilization kept track of time in this way, Camping used this concept as the basis for his view of Biblical chronology.\n\nCamping taught that a Biblical calendar had been hidden according to Daniel 12:9 and Revelation 22:10, detailing the imminent end of the world (with alleged Biblical evidence pointing to the date for the Rapture as May 21, 2011); of the \"end of the church age\" (which asserts that churches are no longer the vehicle used by God for salvation, 1 Peter 4:17); and of predestination (Ephesians 1:4–5), according to which God determined before the beginning of the world which individuals are to be saved. In Camping's later publications, he stated that May 21, 2011 would be \"the first day of the Day of Judgment\" and October 21, 2011 would be the end of the world.\n\nCamping did not consider Family Radio a church and did not claim ordained or hierarchical authority within a church or institution. Camping claimed that the church institutions do not employ the Bible alone as the sole authority. According to Camping, each church or denomination has its own unique set of doctrines and hermeneutics, which dictate how they understand the Bible. Family Radio's sole focus on the Bible is what he believed distinguishes it from mainstream churches. In his book \"1994?\", he claimed there was a very high likelihood that the world would end in September 1994, although he did acknowledge in the book \"the possibility does exist that I could be wrong\"; Family Radio remained popular despite this failed prediction. Both before and after the failure of his 2011 prophecies, Camping received criticism from a number of leaders, scholars, and laymen within the Christian community, who argued that Jesus Christ taught that no man knows the day or the hour of the Lord's return. Camping responded to those who labelled him a \"date-setter\", following his own method of Biblical interpretation, by asserting that he followed the Bible's method of interpretation.\n\nCentral to Camping's teaching was his belief that the Bible alone is the word of God in its entirety, and thus is absolutely trustworthy. However, he emphasized, this does not mean that each sentence in the Bible is to be understood only literally. Rather, the meaning of individual Biblical passages also needs to be interpreted in the light of two factors. The first is the context of the Bible as a whole. The second is its spiritual meaning. In Camping's words, \"the Bible is an earthly story with a Heavenly meaning.\" This stems from Mark 4:34, which states that Jesus did not speak to the disciples without using parables. Because Christ is said to be the living Word of God, therefore, the historical accounts of the Old Testament can also be seen as parables. For example, in Camping's view, Joshua in the Book of Joshua (whose name in Hebrew is identical to the name \"Jesus\" in Greek) is a picture of Christ, who safely led the Israelites (who supposedly represented those who became saved) across the Jordan River (a representation of the wrath of God) into the land of Canaan (which represents the kingdom of God).\nAfter leaving the Christian Reformed Church in 1988, Camping taught doctrines that explicitly conflicted with the doctrines and confessions of the Christian Reformed Church and churches of the Reformed and Presbyterian traditions. Examples of Camping's teachings which varied from conventional Reformed doctrines include:\n\nCamping's teachings regarding the timing of Christ's second coming were based on the cycles of:\nHe projected these cycles into modern times and combined the results with other information in the Bible.\n\nCamping's date for the crucifixion of Christ – Friday, April 1, AD 33 \n(Gregorian) – is nominally the same day as one of those supported by other twentieth-century commentators: Friday, April 3, AD 33 (Julian). However, the dates differ because Camping used the Gregorian calendar, while most commentators use the older Julian calendar, which had a two-day difference during the 1st century AD (they now differ by thirteen days).\n\nIn 1992, Camping published a book titled \"1994?\", in which he proclaimed that Christ's return might be on September 6, 1994. In that publication, he also mentioned that 2011 could be the end of the world. Camping's predictions use 1988 as a significant year in the events preceding the apocalypse; this was also the year he left Alameda Bible Fellowship. As a result, some individuals criticized him for \"date-setting.\" Camping's later publications, \"We are Almost There!\" and \"To God be The Glory\", referred to additional Bible passages which, in his opinion, pointed to May 21, 2011, as the date for the Rapture and October 21, 2011, as the date for the end of the world.\n\nCamping gained notoriety owing to his prediction that the Rapture would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would subsequently take place five months later on October 21, 2011. Followers of Camping claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 2.8% of the world's 2011 population) would be raptured, and publicized the prediction in numerous countries. It has also been reported that a 14-year old Russian girl named Nastya Zachinova committed suicide over his prediction.\n\nReuters reported on May 21 that the curtains were drawn in Camping's house in Alameda, California, and that no one was answering the door. Camping emerged from his home on May 22, saying he was \"flabbergasted\" that the Rapture had not occurred. He stated that he was \"looking for answers,\" and would say more when he returned to work on May 23.\n\nOn May 23, 2011, in an appearance before the press, Camping stated he had reinterpreted his prophecy. In his revised claim, May 21 was a \"spiritual\" judgment day, and the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the world. Camping said his company would not return money donated by followers to publicize the failed May 21 prediction, stating: \"We’re not at the end. Why would we return it?\"\n\nAtheist and skeptic groups such as American Atheists and IIG gathered across the country with signs attracting attention away from Camping's followers who were in seclusion. \"The issue is the Bible is mythology,\" said Larry Hicok, state director of American Atheists. Meanwhile, mainstream Christian groups distanced themselves from Camping's predictions.\n\nIn September 2011, Camping and several other prognosticators who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for \"teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations\". In October 2011, News24 reported that the size of Camping's congregation had dwindled to \"about 25 adults on a typical Sunday\". Camping and his followers largely avoided the media in the months following May 2011, and he remained in seclusion after October 21 passed without the predicted events. On October 21, \"Time\" magazine's website listed Camping's end times prediction as one of \"Time\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Top 10 Failed Predictions\".\n\nIn March 2012, Camping admitted that his predictions were in error, stating: \"We humbly acknowledge we were wrong about the timing.\" He also announced the \"End to Doomsday Predictions\". In May 2012, a year after the failure of Camping's prophecy, \"Religion Dispatches\" published a report on Camping's disillusioned former followers, some of whom had reportedly come to view him as a cult leader.\n\nIn October 2012, the \"Christian Post\" reported that Family Radio was re-broadcasting recordings of Camping's teachings. In March 2013, it was calculated that Family Stations Inc. spent more than $5 million on billboard advertising in 2011, the year the apocalypse was predicted to occur, and the network was reported to be suffering from a major loss of revenue, forcing it to sell its main radio stations and lay off staff. In January 2014, a month after Harold Camping's death, Family Radio stated that it would maintain his mission and theology, including the belief that all established Christian churches are apostate.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, Camping suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. In June, a neighbor stated his speech had become slurred as a result of the stroke, but on July 15, Family Radio stated Camping's speech was unaffected. After leaving the hospital, he moved to a nursing home for rehabilitation, before returning home to continue his recovery. Previously, on June 23, Family Radio had announced that it would replace Camping's \"Open Forum\" program with new programming.\n\nCamping died on December 15, 2013, as a result of complications from a fall at his home two weeks earlier. His death was confirmed by an employee of the Family Radio Network.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1951662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1951662", "title": "Hinduism in Bangladesh", "text": "Hinduism in Bangladesh\n\n\"For Hinduism in the State of India, see: Hinduism in West Bengal\"\n\nHinduism is the second largest religious affiliation in Bangladesh, covering about 8.96% of the population, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for 2011 Bangladesh census. In terms of population, Bangladesh is the third largest Hindu state in the world after India and Nepal. According to an estimate from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), there were 17million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015.\n\nIn nature, Bangladeshi Hinduism closely resembles the forms and customs of Hinduism practised in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, with which Bangladesh (at one time known as East Bengal) was united until the partition of India in 1947. The vast majority of Hindus in Bangladesh are Bengali Hindus.\n\nThe Goddess (\"Devi\") – usually venerated as Durga or Kali – is widely revered, often alongside her consort Shiva. The worship of Shiva has generally found adherents among the higher castes in Bangladesh. Worship of Vishnu (typically in the form of his \"Avatars\" or incarnation Rama or Krishna) more explicitly cuts across caste lines by teaching the fundamental oneness of humankind in spirit. Vishnu worship in Bengal expresses the union of the male and female principles in a tradition of love and devotion. This form of Hindu belief and the Sufi tradition of Islam have influenced and interacted with each other in Bengal. Both were popular mystical movements emphasizing the personal relationship of religious leader and disciple instead of the dry stereotypes of the brahmins or the ulama. As in Bengali Islamic practice, worship of Vishnu frequently occurs in a small devotional society (\"shomaj\"). Both use the language of earthly love to express communion with the divine. In both traditions, the Bengali language is the vehicle of a large corpus of mystical literature of great beauty and emotional impact.\n\nIn Bangladeshi Hinduism ritual bathing, vows, and pilgrimages to sacred rivers, mountains, and shrines are common practice. An ordinary Hindu will worship at the shrines of Muslim \"pirs\", without being concerned with the religion to which that place is supposed to be affiliated. Hindus revere many holy men and ascetics conspicuous for their bodily mortifications. Some believe that they attain spiritual benefit merely by looking at a great holy man. Durga Puja, held in September–October, is the most important festival of Bangladeshi Hindus and it is widely celebrated across Bangladesh. Thousands of pandals (mandaps) are set up in various cities, towns and villages to mark the festival. Other festivals are Kali Puja, Janmashtami, Holi, Saraswati Puja, Shivratri and Rathayatra, the most popular being the century-old Dhamrai Rathayatra.\n\nThe principle of \"ahimsa\" is expressed in almost universally observed rules against eating beef. By no means are all Bangladeshi Hindus vegetarians, but abstinence from all kinds of meat is regarded as a \"higher\" virtue. Brahmin (\"Brahmon\") or \"Upper-caste\" Bangladeshi Hindus, unlike their counterparts elsewhere in South Asia, ordinarily eat fish and chicken. This is similar to the Indian state of West Bengal which has a similar climate to that of Bangladesh, where Hindus also consume fish, egg, chicken and mutton.There are also non-Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh,majority of the Hajong, Rajbongshi people and Tripuris in Bangladesh are Hindus.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census there are 11,379,000 Hindus in Bangladesh. However, some estimates show that there are about 12 million Hindus in Bangladesh. Hindus in Bangladesh in the late 2000s were almost evenly distributed in all regions, with large concentrations in Gopalganj, Dinajpur, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Mymensingh, Khulna, Jessore, Chittagong and parts of Chittagong Hill Tracts. In the capital city of Dhaka, Hindus are the second-largest religious community after the Muslims and the largest concentration of Hindus can be found in and around Shankhari Bazaar of the old city. The contributions of Hindus in arts, education, literature and sports are far in excess of their numerical strength. In politics, they have traditionally supported the liberal and secular ideology of the Awami League and other left wing parties such as Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB), and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD). However, barring the fundamentalist Islamist parties such as Jamaat-e-Islami, all the major political parties have fielded Hindu candidates. In the current Jatiyo Sangshad, out of 350 members, there are only 13 Hindus: most of them from the Awami League. Hindu institutions and places of worship received assistance through the Bangladesh Hindu Kalyan Trust (Bangladesh Hindu Welfare Trust), which was sponsored by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Government sponsored Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar (radio) broadcast readings and interpretations of Hindu scriptures and prayers.\n\nSince the rise of more explicitly Islamist political formations in Bangladesh during the 1990s, many Hindus have been intimidated or attacked, and fairly substantial numbers are leaving the country to India.\n\nIn present-day Bangladesh, Hindus became a minority only in mid-thirteenth century of the Gregorian Calendar. In 1941 the Hindus formed about 28% of the population, which declined to 22.05% in 1951, as rich and upper caste Hindus migrated to India after Partition of India in 1947. The wealthy Hindus who migrated lost their land and assets through the \"East Bengal Evacuee Act\" and the poor and middle-class Hindus that were left behind became targets of discrimination through new laws. At the outbreak of the 1965 India-Pakistan war, the \"Defense of Pakistan Ordinance\" and later the \"Enemy (Custody and Registration) Order II\", through which the Hindus were labelled as the \"enemy\" and their property expropriated by the state. Since then, it has dropped by about half. Through a combination of mass exodus and genocide in the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, this represents a loss of around 20 million Bangladeshi Hindus and their direct heirs, and reflects one of the largest displacements of population based on ethnic or religious identity in recent history. 1974 census of Bangladesh showed that the population of Hindus had fallen to 13.5%. Even after independence, the Hindus were branded \"Indian stooges\" and untrustworthy citizens. A significant driver of Hindu emigration has been the Enemy Property Act, later renamed as the Vested Property Act, through which the Bangladesh Government has been able to appropriate the property of around 40% of the existing Bangladeshi Hindu population (according to Dr Abul Barkat of Dhaka University).\n\nA significant portion of the middle-class, urban Hindu population left the region that is now Bangladesh immediately after the partition in 1947 when East Pakistan came into existence. Many of these East Bengali refugees went on to contribute actively to Indian society after their migration. In 1971, during the Liberation War of Bangladesh from Pakistan, a similar scenario happened. But even after 1971, Hindu population has continued to decline and currently they form 8.96% of the population. According to a study by Pew Research Organisation, Hindus will constitute 7% of the population of Bangladesh by 2050, while Muslims will form 92% of the population.\n\n\"Source: Census of India 1901-1941, Census of East Pakistan 1951-1961, Bangladesh Government Census 1974-2011,\" \"Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics estimate 2015\"\n\nDespite their dwindling numbers, Hindus still yield considerable influence because of their geographical concentration in certain regions. They form a majority of the electorate in at least two parliamentary constituencies (Khulna-1 and Gopalganj-3) and account for more than 25% in at least another thirty. For this reason, they are often the deciding factor in parliamentary elections where victory margins can be extremely narrow. It is also frequently alleged that this is a prime reason for many Hindus being prevented from voting in elections, either through intimidating actual voters, or through exclusion in voter list revisions.\n\nAccording to an estimate from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), there were 17million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015, out of a total 158.9million population.\n\nHindu temples and shrines are more or less distributed all across the country. The Kantaji Temple is an elegant example of an 18th-century temple. The most important temple in terms of prominence is the Dhakeshwari Temple, located in Dhaka. This temple along with other Hindu organizations arranges Durga Puja and Krishna Janmaashtami very prominently. The other main temples of Dhaka are the Ramakrishna Mission, Joy Kali Temple, Laxmi Narayan Mandir, Swami Bagh Temple and Siddheswari Kalimandir. The famous Ramna Kali Temple in Dhaka was destroyed by the Pakistani Army during the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, and Bangladeshi Hindus have been actively petitioning successive governments since independence to rebuild the temple on the site, where a massacre of around 100 devotees also took place.\n\nBuilt in the early 19th century, Kal Bhairab Temple at Brahmanbaria holds the largest deity of Shiva in the country. Other notable Hindu temples and ashrams of Bangladesh are Chandranath Temple, Adinath Temple, Sugandha, Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple, Pancha Ratna Govinda Temple, Bhabanipur Shaktipeeth, Chatteshwari Temple, Dhamrai Jagannath Rath, Puthia Temple Complex, Kantajew Temple, Comilla Jagannath Temple, Kaliyajeu Temple, Shri Shail, Bishwanath Temple, Boro Kali Bari Temple, Muktagacha Shiva Temple, Shyamsundar Temple, Chandrabati Temple, Lalmai Chandi Temple, Jorbangla Temple, Sonarang Twin Temples, Jagannath Temple, Pabna, Temple of King Kangsa Narayan, Barodi Lokenath Ashram, Sri Satyanarayan Seva Mandir, Sri Angan, Wahedpur Giri Dham, Ramkrishna Sevashram at Chittagong, Ram Thakur Ashram etc.\n\nMany Hindu temples have suffered from implementation of the Vested Property Act through which land and moveable property has been confiscated by agents acting on behalf of successive governments. Hindu temples are also high risk areas during communal disturbances (most recently in 1990, 1992 and 2001) when it has often been necessary to call the army to protect sensitive locations.\n\nThe Hindu community has many similar issues as the predominant Muslim community of Bangladesh. These include women's rights, dowry, poverty, unemployment and others. Issues unique to the Hindu community include maintenance of Hindu culture and temples in Bangladesh. Small sects of Islamists constantly try to politically and socially isolate the Hindus of Bangladesh. Because Hindus of Bangladesh are scattered across all areas (except in Narayanganj), they cannot unite politically. However, Hindus became sway voters in various elections. Hindus have usually voted in large mass for Bangladesh Awami League and communist parties, as these are the only parties which have a nominal commitment to secularism; the alternatives are the increasingly pro-Islamist centrist parties such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jatiya Party (which both incorporate Muslim identity into their version of Bangladeshi nationalism or the outright Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jamaat-e-Islami) which seeks to establish Islamic law under which there would be separate provisions for Hindus as non-Muslims. However, Hindus in general maintain cordial relationships with liberal Muslims and they even participate in each other's festivals such as Durga Puja and Eid al-Fitr.\n\nThe Bangladesh Liberation War resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. As many as 2.4 million Bengali Hindus were killed by the Pakistani Army during the Liberation War and most of the Bengali Hindu-owned businesses were permanently destroyed. The historic Ramna Kali Temple in Dhaka and the century-old Rath at Dhamrai were demolished and burned down by the Pakistani Army.\n\nAn article in \"Time\" magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated \"The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred.\"\n\nSenator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, \"Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked \"H\". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad\". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Sydney Schanberg covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column \"The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored\", he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. \"Other reminders were the yellow \"H\"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army\" (by \"Muslim army\", meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994).\n\nIn the first constitution of the newly independent country, secularism and equality of all citizens irrespective of religious identity was enshrined. On his return to liberated Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his first speech to the nation, specifically recognized the disproportionate suffering of the Hindu population during the Bangladesh Liberation War. On a visit to Kolkata, India in February 1972, Mujib visited the refugee camps that were still hosting several million Bangladeshi Hindus and appealed to them to return to Bangladesh and to help rebuilding the country.\n\nDespite the public commitment of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his government to re-establishing secularism and rights of non-Muslim religious groups, two significant aspects of his rule remain controversial as relates to the conditions of Hindus in Bangladesh. The first was his refusal to return the premises of the Ramna Kali Mandir, historically the most important temple in Dhaka, to the religious body that owned the property. This centuries old Hindu temple was demolished by the Pakistan army during the Bangladesh Liberation War and around one hundred devotees murdered. Under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act it was determined that ownership of the property could not be established as there were no surviving members to claim inherited rights, and the land was handed over to the Dhaka Club.\n\nSecondly, state-authorized confiscation of Hindu owned property under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act was rampant during Mujib's rule, and as per the research conducted by Abul Barkat of Dhaka University, the Awami League party of Sheikh Mujib was the largest beneficiary of Hindu property transfer in the past 35 years of Bangladeshi independence. This was enabled considerably because of the particular turmoil and displacement suffered by Bangladeshi Hindus, who were the primary target of the Pakistan army's genocide, as well documented by international publications such as \"Time\" magazine and the \"New York Times\", and by the declassified Hamoodur Rahman Commission report. With almost 8 million displaced Hindus and more than 200,000 Hindu victims of genocide, it was difficult to establish direct ownership of property within legally specified timeframes. This caused much bitterness among Bangladeshi Hindus, particularly given the public stance of the regime's commitment to secularism and communal harmony.\n\nLargely because of these and other factors, such as the lack of attention to the Human Rights Violations of Hindus in the country, the Hindu population of Bangladesh started to decline through migration.\n\nPresident Ziaur Rahman abandoned the constitutional provision for secularism and began to introduce Islamic symbolism in all spheres of national life (such as official seals and the constitutional preamble). Zia brought back the multi-party system thus allowing organizations such as Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (an offshoot of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan) to regroup and contest elections.\n\nIn 1988 President Hussein Mohammed Ershad declared Islam to be the State Religion of Bangladesh. Though the move was protested by students and left-leaning political parties and minority groups, to this date neither the regimes of the BNP or Awami League has challenged this change and it remains in place.\n\nIn 1990, the Ershad regime was widely blamed for negligence (and some human rights analysis allege active participation) in the anti-Hindu riots following the Babri Mosque incident in India, the largest communal disturbances since Bangladesh independence, as a means of diverting attention from the rapidly increasing opposition to his rule. Many Hindu temples, Hindu neighbourhoods and shops were attacked and damaged including, for the first time since 1971, the Dhakeshwari temple. The atrocities were brought to the West's attention by many Bangladeshis, including Taslima Nasrin and her book Lajja which translated into English means \"shame\".\n\nHindus were first attacked in mass on 1992 by Islamic fundamentalists. More than 200 temples were destroyed. Hindus were attacked and many women were raped and killed. The events were widely seen as a repercussion against the razing of the Babri Mosque in India. Taslima Nasrin wrote her novel \"Lajja\" (The Shame) based on this persecution of Hindus by Islamic extremists. The novel centers on the suffering of the patriotic anti-Indian and pro-Communist Datta family, where the daughter is raped and killed while financially they end up losing everything.\nProminent political leaders frequently fall back on \"Hindu bashing\" in an attempt to appeal to extremist sentiment and to stir up communal passions. In one of the most notorious utterances of a mainstream Bangladeshi figure, the immediate past Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while leader of the opposition in 1996, declared that the country was at risk of hearing \"uludhhwani\" (a Hindu custom involving women's ululation) from mosques, replacing the azaan (Muslim call to prayer) (e.g., see Agence-France Press report of 18 November 1996, \"Bangladesh opposition leader accused of hurting religious sentiment\").\n\nAfter the election of 2001, when a right-wing coalition including two Islamist parties (Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and Islami Oikya Jote) led by the pro-Islamic right wing Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) came to power, many minority Hindus and liberal secularist Muslims were attacked by a section of the governing regime. Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus were believed to have fled to neighbouring India to escape the violence unleashed by activists sympathetic to the new government. Many Bangladeshi Muslims played an active role in documenting atrocities against Hindus during this period.\n\nThe new government also clamped down on attempts by the media to document alleged atrocities against non-Muslim minorities following the election. Severe pressure was put on newspapers and other media outside of government control through threats of violence and other intimidation. Most prominently, the Muslim journalist and human rights activist Shahriyar Kabir was arrested on charges of treason on his return from India where he had been interviewing Hindu refugees from Bangladesh; this was by the Bangladesh High Court and he was subsequently freed.\n\nThe fundamentalists and right-wing parties such as the BNP and Jatiya Party often portray Hindus as being sympathetic to India, and transferring economic resources to India, contributing to a widespread perception that Bangladeshi Hindus are disloyal to the state. Also, the right wing parties claim the Hindus to be backing the Awami League.\nAs widely documented in international media, Bangladesh authorities have had to increase security to enable Bangladeshi Hindus to worship freely following widespread attacks on places of worship and devotees.\n\nAfter recent bombings in Bangladesh by the Islamic fundamentalists, the government has taken steps to strengthen the security during various minority celebrations, specially during Durga Puja and Rathayatra.\n\nOn October 2006, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom published a report titled 'Policy Focus on Bangladesh', said that since its last election, 'Bangladesh has experienced growing violence by religious extremists, intensifying concerns expressed by the country's religious minorities'. The report further stated that Hindus are particularly vulnerable in a period of rising violence and extremism, whether motivated by religious, political or criminal factors, or some combination. The report noted that Hindus had multiple disadvantages against them in Bangladesh, such as perceptions of dual loyalty with respect to India and religious beliefs that are not tolerated by the politically dominant Islamic Fundamentalists of the BNP. Violence against Hindus has taken place \"in order to encourage them to flee in order to seize their property\". The previous reports of the Hindu American Foundation were acknowledged and confirmed by this non-partisan report.\n\nOn 2 November 2006, USCIRF criticized Bangladesh for continuing persecution of minority Hindus. It also urged the Bush administration to get Dhaka to ensure protection of religious freedom and minority rights before Bangladesh's next national elections in January 2007.\n\nIn 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal indicted several Jamaat members for war crimes against Hindus during the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities. In retaliation, violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh was instigated by the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu shops and homes, rape and abductions of Hindu women and vandalising and desecrating the Hindu temples.\n\nEven after the decline of Hindu population in Bangladesh from 13.5% in 1974, just after the independence, Hindus were at around 9.2% of the population in 2001 according to government estimates following the census. However, Hindus accounted for only four members of the 300 member parliament following the 2001 elections through direct election; this went up to five following a by-election victory in 2004. Significantly, of the 50 seats reserved for women that are directly nominated by the Prime Minister, not a single one was allotted to a Hindu. The political representation is not at all satisfactory and several Hindu advocacy groups in Bangladesh have demanded a return to a communal electorate system as existed during the Pakistan period, to enable a more equitable and proportionate representation in parliament, or a reserved quota since persecution of Hindus has continued since 1946.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57240523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57240523", "title": "Israeli printmaking", "text": "Israeli printmaking\n\nThe origins of Israeli printmaking can be found in the Hebrew-Palestinian print from the second half of the 19th century. The field includes the use of various print techniques such as woodcut, etching, Lithography and more. At the same time, the development of the artistic print in the Land of Israel and later in the State of Israel cannot be translated into a continuum of development, but rather a tradition of mutual influences along with expressions of disconnect and disregard caused by various artistic influences and by the development of technological means. \n\nThe beginning of the modern printing industry in Israel can be found in the second half of the 19th century, when a number of printing houses were established in Jerusalem. These printing houses dealt with the printing of texts in which various artistic images were incorporated. The first Hebrew printing house was established by Israel Back (Baal Koreh [Hebrew term for Torah Reader]) in Safed in 1841 and transferred to Jerusalem in 1841. Back worked with presses and tools for casting letters he brought with him from Europe. The first press was a wooden table-shaped press, a heavy metal plate laid on the paper undergoing the printing operation. In 1842, Israel Back received the printing presses nicknamed \"Massat Moshe and Yehudit\" (he: משאת משה ויהודית) from Moses Montefiore. Its area of print was 85 cm long and 57 cm wide. The first book printed by Back in Jerusalem was \"Seder Avodat Hakodes\" (he: סדר עבודת הקודש) by Chaim Yosef David Azulai.[3] His title page is decorated with a hybrid model created using a wood engraving technique. In the center of the description is an image of a two-column gate in the Ionic order, bearing a decorative frieze with an acanthus leaf. Around the gate, Beck created an ornamental frame with vegetal patterns. At the same time, Christian printing houses such as the Armenian St. James Printing House, founded in 1833; the Franciscan printing house, which began in 1846 under the direction of Sebastian Pratschner; the printing house of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which was founded in 1853 and another printing house, established in 1885 at the Schneller Orphanage. \n\nThe main concern of printing houses was the printing of texts using Letterpress printing. However, in the process of printing, various illustrations were sometimes included. These illustrations were created using woodcut, wood engraving or metal engraving techniques and were limited by the size the print. Most of the decorations were assigned to the title page of the book. This page usually consisted of a decorative frame created from a print or image of the Holy Land. In addition, the printing houses created a variety of printed items such as decorated certificates, \"Mizrachs\" [ornamental or sacred pictures hung on the east wall of a house or synagogue in the direction of Jerusalem], etc. The printing houses themselves created some of the printing blocks, while others were commissioned by independent trainers. Abraham Leib Monzon, for example, created some of the printing blocks for his printing house, while others were created by artists like Meir Rozin. On the \"Shiviti\" plate, for example, created by Shimon Israel Shane, three printing blocks (printing plates) that contain descriptions of the Western Wall, Rachel's Tomb and the tombs of the kings of the House of David, with hand-painted and hand-stamped seals, were added. In many cases, these illustrations were reused for various printed materials and even passed between different printing houses.\n\nThe first use of the technique of lithograph printing was at the \"Salomon Printing House\" (he: דפוס סלומון), founded by Yoel Moshe Salomon and Michal HaCohen, who learned the technique in Königsberg. During their studies there HaCohen and Solomon printed a pamphlet entitled \"Altar Stones,\" in which they detailed the process of creating a lithographic print. Their decision to import the technique to Israel probably stemmed from their desire to serve as an alternative to the printing house of Back, which for 20 years had held a monopoly in the field of Jewish printmaking. One of the first works printed by the new printing house was \"Shoshanta\" (1862), the name for a local version of a decorative ornament drawn from European traditions. Along with the descriptions, there were also photographs of places such as the Tomb of Absalom, Tower of David, the Western Wall, etc. \n\nAnother printing press that was known for its artistic works was \"A.L. Monsohn Printing House\" (he: דפוס א.ל. מונזון), which began operations in 1892. The printing house began operating with a hand press and in 1894 brought an automatic machine from Europe that could produce about 1,000 pages per hour.[10] A major part of the work of this printing press was the use of the lithograph printing technique. Among other things, it created prints of up to half a sheet (50x70 cm), from the works of artists such as Rozin, Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi, and others, who also began to make use of photographs created using the lithographic technique, The photographs were converted to lithographs in a process that included the use of the technique of etching and transfer paper (Decalcomania).\n\nWhile the people of the 'Old Yishuv' perceived art as a religious art that served the liturgy, at the beginning of the 20th century, art became more prevalent in modern Hebrew culture. Expressions of Judaism also began to gain national significance, following the expansion of the Zionist movement in Europe. The artists who came from Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, already experienced artists with a standing in the print industry, contributed most to the development of this medium in the Eretz Israel. Another central milestone in the development of this concept is the establishment of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem in 1906.\n\nThe most prominent Jewish artist in the European printing industry was Hermann Struck, who was associated with many Expressionist artists, was even a member of the Sezessionstil in Berlin, and exhibited consistently until 1913. Along with landscapes, Struck created portraits and genre descriptions of Jewish life, particularly in Eastern Europe. He did this in a variety of print techniques such as lithograph and etching. Over the years he published several files of prints as a book, but Struck's most famous and successful book was \"Die Kunst des Radierens\" (The Art of Etching), published in Berlin in 1908 by Paul Kasirer. The book described the process of printing etchings, interspersed with illustrations by Struck. Because of the popularity of the book, which appealed to both artists and to the public as a whole, it was printed in four additional editions between 1912 and 1923. The book established Struck's fame as a leading artist in the print industry.\n\nJacob Steinhardt and Joseph Budko, who studied print with Struck, also dealt often with themes from the Shtetl, not only as an ethnographic depiction, as Struck did, but also as a spiritual expression. Part of the change stemmed from the influence of expressionism on these artists. For Steinhardt, for example, this effect was expressed in a theatrical atmosphere rich in pathos and grotesque expressions.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1935, Steinhardt created about 250 etchings, but in Palestine he began to work in the wood cut ,combining Wood engraving parts, both because of his inability to produce these etchings and as an expression of the influence of the light in Palestine, which he expresses in the contrasting blacks and whites characteristic of this medium.\n\nAlong with their independent works, the two also created Illustrations in various print techniques for various Hebrew publications that were published in Europe at the time. Among these are the woodcuts that Steinhardt created for the Book of Jonah (1924) and the Passover Haggadah (Berlin: Ferdinand Auster, 1923), accompanied by a calligraphic text created by Franzisca Baruch, and the lithographs created by Budko for Shmuel Yosef Agnon’s And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight (1919), as well as his prints for the 50th edition (Berlin: Hovevei Ha-Shir Ha-Ivrit, 1923) of the writings of Hayim Nahman Bialik.\n\nWith the establishment of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts, Ephraim Moses Lilien, one of the leading illustrators in Europe, arrived in Jerusalem. His artistic style derived from the European \"Jugendstil\" and his work expressed the main Zionist national outlook at the time. Lilien was also in the habit of taking photographs from which he would create his drawings and prints. Despite the fact that he lived only a short time in Jerusalem, his style influenced Bezalel's main style of design.\n\nIn 1909, a lithography department was opened at Bezalel, headed by Avraham Gershowitz (Gershuni). This department printed a limited number of artistic works, mainly by artists such as Shmuel Ben-David and Ya’akov (Jacob) Stark. However, the print quality was poor and was not suitable for producing large editions, mainly due to the technical equipment. Boris Schatz himself testified in 1917 that the school had equipment to \"make experimental leaves,\" but that \"we do not have a printing machine.\" In addition to the artistic endeavors, the department also did commercial work such as printing textbooks and other materials, such as lottery cards designed by Shmuel Haruvi. Most of the lithographic work at Bezalel included realistic prints of portraits and genre descriptions, as well as a few commercial works.\n\nIn 1919 Israel Hirshfeld, a student of Bezalel (1915–1917), was sent to Vienna in order to learn professionally the art of lithograph printing. Throughout his stay there, he exchanged letters with Bezalel teachers like Abel Penn, Schatz, and others who asked him to purchase a press and lithographic equipment for Bezalel, despite the fact that they did not send money to him. In 1921 Penn himself went to Vienna and purchased a press and accompanying equipment.[17]See Yigal Zalmona, The Art of Abel Pann- From Montparnasse to the Land of the Bible, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003), p. XIV-XV.</ref> On this press, Penn printed the series of illustrations for the Bible he created. There is however some disagreement with regard to the printing technique of these works. While Penn declared he used lithographic printing, others declared that it was a type of offset, claiming that Jerusalem presses were unsuitable for use as a basis for lithographic printing.\n\nAlongside Bezalel, in 1923 Ze'ev Raban and Meir Gur Arie established a company called \"Industrial Art Studio\" (he: בית עבודה לעבודות אינדוסטריאליות), within which \"Graphica Press\" was created, and which printed posters of a limited size and various prints in the Jugendstil style. Another artist who worked in the field independently was Jacob Eisenberg, who printed etchings in a workshop he set up in his home in Jerusalem.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the influence of modernist art was evident among some Bezalel students who continued their studies in Europe or were exposed to contemporary art. These were works that established an artistic opposition to the school that expressed the spirit of the period of the Tower of David. Artists such as Nachum Gutman, Israel Paldi and others created expressive etchings and, particularly, woodcuts. Among these works is a series of prints called \"The God Seekers\" (1923; he: מבקשי אלוהים), created by Reuven Rubin, and the series of prints \"Jaffa\" (1925) by Israel Paldi. Late recognition was given to the series \"Gray Tura\" (1924; he: טורא אפורה) created by Arieh Allweil in Europe, which was displayed in Israel only in the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1930s, the printing industry began to take on greater importance in the field of Eretz Israeli art. The development of the field was closely linked to the Fifth Aliyah, in which many artists came to Eretz Israel and Jerusalem. These artists, persecuted by their countries of origin in Germany and Austria, sought to continue the spirit of European modernism in general and the heritage of German art movements such as Bauhaus and Expressionism in particular.\n\nIn addition, the art of the time reflected in many ways the construction of Zionist national consciousness. An example of this can be found in stamps issued by the Jewish National Fund, quoting images drawn from artists such as Struck, Lilien, Budko, Steinhardt, and others, who reflected the worldview of the creators of the artistic print, and whose images could at that time easily pass from private to nationalistic art.\n\nThe opening of the Tel Aviv Museum, in 1934, was accompanied by the dedication of one of the two halls of Tel Aviv Museum to works in the various print fields. Other examples of the growing importance of the field can be found in an article published on 20 October 1935, in Haaretz, entitled \"The Question of Hebrew Graphics\" and the printing of a Dictionary of Graphic Arts published by Mordecai Narkis in 1937 by the Bialik Institute and the Hebrew Language Committee. The publication of the dictionary reflected the activities of The Bezalel National Museum in the 1920s and 1930s and the need to create uniform and clear terms for the various print terms. The dictionary of Narkis, dedicated to Hermann Struck on the occasion of his 60th birthday, was based on the German language, whose terms are \"most common among the graphic artists living in Israel.\"\n\nA review of these documents reveals that the term \"graphics\" included both the artistic print and the graphic design field. This mixture would remain a guiding principle in the school of \"New Bezalel School for Arts and Crafts\" which was opened in 1935 in Jerusalem. The curriculum of the school aspired to raise the artistic level of design in Israel, while providing practical opportunities for students to earn a living. This practical approach demonstrated the fact that Hebrew industry (and, to some extent, the Hebrew city) also began to serve as another legitimate expression of Zionist activity. Therefore, the school, whose first director was Budko, did not open an art track, but rather a track for practical graphics, which was headed by Rudi Deutsch (Dayan). The department dealt mainly with lithograph printing, which was the most popular commercial technique at the time.\n\nJacob Steinhardt, who immigrated to Eretz Israel in 1933 opened, in what had been the home of Boris Schatz, a painting and printing studio that was a kind of opposition to the \"New Bezalel\", which was directed by Yosef Budko. After Budko's death in 1940, Steinhardt joined Bezalel's staff and became director of the school's graphics department. During this period, the importance of classical printing techniques, lithography, woodcutting, and engraving as a commercial printing technique became less important, eclipsed by offset printing. However, these techniques were revived through art classes at the school.\n\nDuring the 1940s a small community of artists, who engaged in graphic techniques, including artistic prints of various kinds, was established around the \"New Bezalel.\" A comprehensive view of their works shows the strong influence of German culture on everything connected to the cultural tradition (Bildung). In the prints of these artists, such as Miron Sima, Isidor Aschheim, and Jakob Eisenscher, as well as in the works of artists who worked independently of this group, such as Arieh Allweil, Paul Conrad Henich, Abraham Goldberg, Leo Roth and others, we see an attempt to combine European style with characteristics of the local Eretz Israeli reality and Zionist motifs and themes. This was often accompanied by the adoption of biographical-psychological features, which were largely missing in the works of historic Bezalel's artists.\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 does not constitute a significant historical point in the history of Israeli art, apart from several expressions of nationalism and the development of iconography around the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. However, the opening of Mandatory Palestine to Jewish immigration led to a large population that began to be educated according to the tradition of the young field of the Israeli print, led in these years by Jacob Steinhardt in the new Bezalel. Many of the youngsters who came to Eretz Israel after the Holocaust either under the auspices of Youth Aliyah, or with their families, such as Jacob Pins, Avraham Ofek, Avigdor Arikha, Yehuda Bacon, Moshe Hoffman, among others, became prominent Israeli artists in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nApart from the technique of the woodcut, that could be studied at Bezalel, there were not many places that trained artists in the various print techniques. In Ein Hod and Jerusalem, Rudi Lehman taught the art of the wood cut and sculpture. A large group of artists were influenced by his approach to art, that combined animal images in a \"primitive\" style with a modernist ethos of creativity. This group included artists such as Shoshana Heimann, Raya Bar Adon and others. Some training in the technique of lithograph printing was provided by Cohen, who operated the Hebrew University Press in Jerusalem. Most of the artists printed their works in his studio, or with local artists, such as David Ben Shaul, who had specialized in lithograph printing in Paris. Upon his return to Israel in 1963, he brought a lithographic press and printed works for various artists in his studio in Jerusalem.\n\nBasing themselves on the local tradition and ethos of Paris as the capital of world art, many artists continued to travel to pursue art studies in France and Europe, unaware of the change in the world art scene and the development of the United States as an art center. Aryeh Rothman, for example, went to study at the Académie Julian in 1959, and later studied in Paris at the Johnny Friedlaender engraving workshop. Tuvia Beeri studied at the Académie des Beaux-Arts (1963–1961), and continued his specialization in Friedlaender's engraving workshop. Milka Cizik, however, went to study in East Germany (1965–1961), where she studied various printing techniques at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.\n\nThe French and German influences led to the adoption of modernist techniques, such as Aryeh Rothman's use of the photographic technique of Heliograveur and the \"invention\" by others of various artistic techniques (in the spirit of late Surrealism). Miron Sima, for example, added to his woodcuts, such as \"The Bride\", textures printed from fabrics and chains, which sought to enrich the texture of the print, and to deepen its realism. In addition, the shortage of materials available in Israel led many artists to use other techniques that were available to them, such as Linocut, as a substitute for wood cut. Even Rudi Lehmann, despite his strong connection to artistic tradition, experimented with the use of new materials. He was one of the first artists to create woodcuts on plywood.\n\nThe artistic print field to which these students were exposed upon their return to Israel was very limited. Not only were there no places to print editions of artistic prints, it was also considered a secondary art. In the 1960 album \"Graphic Art in Israel\", Eugen Kolb wrote that \"exhibitions of graphics only are considered (unfairly!) for less important exhibits.\" Elisheva Cohen, curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Bezalel National Museum and at the Israel Museum, had to publish the booklet T\"he Print: What Is It?\" (1965), in order to expose the field to visitors to the museum. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the annual general exhibition of the \"Israel Painters and Sculptors Association\" of 1963, for example, only 7 artistic prints were displayed out of 375 works. Also at the exhibition \"Tazpit\" 1964, which was perceived as more artistic at the time, Tuvia Beeri was the only artist among more than 30 artists who exhibited prints.\n\nHowever, at the same time the print was perceived in various circles as an expression of \"good taste.\" An example of this can be found in the publications of Moshe Spitzer, who commissioned illustrations for publications by Tarshish Publishing House that were done using various print techniques. Among these works are Avigdor Luisada's woodcuts for Yitzhak Shenhar’s \"Between Star and Grass\" (1942) and the engravings of Avigdor Arikha for \"A Stray Dog\" (1958) and the woodcuts created by Jacob Pines for the book Michael Kohlhaas (1953).\n\nIn 1965, the printing workshop of the Artists House Tel Aviv opened under the auspices of the Israel Painters and Sculptors Association and was managed by Tuvia Beeri. The workshop gave artists for the first time a place of work to create works using engraving techniques. At the same time, Beeri opened another workshop at the Avni Institute.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the printing industry underwent a period of unprecedented development in Israel. A variety of print workshops made it possible for artists to create works using various techniques in this medium. A number of artists began to work in prints and in preparing printing plates for other artists in their studio. Moshe Givati established a printing workshop in Haifa that dealt mainly with screen printing technique. David (Dedi) Ben Shaul, printed using lithograph technique, and Avishai Eyal, who worked primarily in the medium of etching, set up a separate studio in Jerusalem. However, the establishment of the large workshops made the independent activities of these artists somewhat redundant. Itche Mambush founded another workshop in the 1960s in Ein Hod, directed by Ora Lahav Shaltiel. In 1972 Jacob Harel founded a commercial print workshop that would become Har-el Printers and Publishers. In 1974 the Jerusalem Print Workshop was established in Jerusalem. The workshop was established as a public benefit company and was initially associated with the Jerusalem Artists Association. In 1975, the Israel Museum set up another public print workshop - the Burston Graphics Center - in Hutzot Hayotzer. In addition, several other printing houses published in the field of artistic printing.\n\nAn example of the rising popularity of the medium could be found in the activity of the Israeli Graphotek, which in 1978 had not yet opened its doors to the public, but had already collected about 1300 works by 105 different artists. By the 1990s, Graphotek had already collected about 4,000 works by about 200 artists and was accessible to the public in six centers around the country. In a 1975 list, Adam Baruch described the growing popularity of artistic prints during those years in Israel and around the world. Baruch distinguished between the reproduction of old works to the medium of the print, and works of art that made critical use of the various techniques of the medium. In addition, attempts were made to mount systematic displays of prints. In 1978, the exhibition \"30 Israeli Artists: Artistic Prints\" was presented at Tel Aviv University, and during the 1980s, attempts were made to establish a triennale for graphics at the Haifa Museum of Art. \n\nMany artists adopted the medium as another technique in their work, a technique of a more commercial nature. Usually prints were produced in editions of between 30 to 150 copies. Some of the works were intended for the international market, especially for the United States. In addition, various albums were also produced that combined 5-10 works by a single artist or by a group of artists. This commercial development led several galleries to continuously produce series of prints for artists, which were printed in the various workshops. The major ones included the Bineth Gallery in Tel Aviv and the Engel Gallery in Jerusalem. The popularity of the print also led to the printing of signed and numbered posters by artists or the production of prints based on the works of deceased artists, by inscribing their signature on the plate. \n\nUnlike most of the artists who worked in the field, in the 1970s and 1980s, a group of artists continued their avant-garde activities concerning everything related to the examination of the artistic object, including in the medium of print. Artists such as Buky Schwartz, Michael Gitlin, Benni Efrat, and others emphasized the plastic nature of the paper by using various artistic means such as repetition and seriality, or by emphasizing the print plate as an object, or by folding and distorting the paper. Pinchas Cohen Gan, for example, made use of plates printed on entire sheets of paper in 1980, leaving him with negatives. In the works of Menashe Kadishman (1983), the artist reconstructed his sculptural activities and converted them into the print media, creating a confrontation between nature and culture. A unique preoccupation with the surface of the print is also found in the works of Joyce Schmidt, who created prints using techniques of stress. Her paper-making business led her to make use of the paper produced by the business. \n\nFrom a technical point of view, the flourishing of lithography technique particularly stands out during this period. The main development of the technique in Israel during this period can be credited to the work of the Burston Graphic Center, which in its first year trained artists in this technique. Alima, who studied this technique at Burston, imported this printing technique to the print workshop at the Artists House in Tel Aviv and the College of Visual Arts in Beersheva. In her independent work she combined the technique of lithography with other techniques such as screen printing and etching. To a great extent, this technique died out in the early 1990s, with the closure of the Burston Center. \n\nIn contrast to the lithography and etching techniques, the screen printing technique (or \"silkscreen printing\" as it was called at the time) was perceived as a secondary technique, mainly because it lacked any artistic tradition. Art in Israel began using industrial techniques in the late 1950s, but until the 1970s it was not widely used in art. As early as 1949, Ellie Gross (Yaari) lectured on serigraphy (screen printing) in the exhibition \"What is Graphics?\" In the Jerusalem Artists House. However, an early example of artistic use of the medium can be found in the book The Jerusalem Hills and all the Anguish (1967) by Malachi Beit-Arie published by Tarshish. The book was accompanied by screen prints created by Myriam Bat-Yosef and printed in a commercial printing press - \"Herut Herut Printing Press\".\n\nThe most significant development in the use of art technique can be attributed to Zvi Tolkovsky, who returned from art studies in the United States and learned the technique there. At the end of the sixties,Tolkovsky returned to Israel and, in 1969-1969, a workshop for printing and screen printing at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. Tolkovsky also taught at the Artists House in Tel Aviv, where screen printing was used as part of a variety of techniques such as calligraphy. An expression of the ambivalent status of the screen print can be found in the work of Moshe Gershuni, who was commissioned to create a series of print works at the Jerusalem Print Workshop in 1984. Gershuni testified that he had a distaste for the print medium, \"especially for screen printing, which in my opinion represented the most extreme form of graphic art.\" However, his works in this technique, including \"Avinu Malkeinu\" [Our Father,Our King] (1984), \"Justice and Charity\" (1984), and others, enjoyed both artistic and commercial success. \n\nHowever, the bulk of the prints were done using various etching techniques. These works were figurative in character and expressive in language. The works of artists such as Raanan Levy, Ofer Lellouche, Tamara Rickman, David Ben-Shaul, were drawings, created using traditional techniques as etching and aquatint. In addition, there were also artists who incorporated new techniques in their works, such as Uri Lifschitz, who combined in works such as \"Mr. Rabinovich\" (1968), etching with photographic etching. Yigal Tumarkin, for example, in the print \"Pieta, Pierre Paolo Pasolini,\" (1979). \n\ncombined several print plates made using the technique of photographic etching, on which he combined drawing and dry etching. The plates were combined in a collage, cut and twisted to give them an expressive character and to create negative spaces in the composition. Artists such as Ivan Schwebel, Asaph Ben Menachem and Avraham Eilat, used this expressionism as an expression of symbolism or metaphysical content. In the famous series \"Kaddish\" (1984), for example, Moshe Gershuni created a tangle of symbols and images that expressed a complex position toward Judaism and the Jewish God. \n\nIn the early 1990s, \"new media art\" began to develop, using visual images created by \"technical reproduction\" without the need to use a manual process of creating print plates and manual printing. The use of computer graphics and digital media, which developed during this period, completely replaced manual design. The use of these methods also led to the perception of the art print industry as archaic. This led to the closure and reduction of many print workshops during the 2000s. Among other things, the workshops of the Faculty of Arts - Hamidrasha at Beit Berl College were closed, and Bezalel's work was greatly reduced. \n\nThe activities of professional workshops were also reduced, and they stopped producing works in large editions and went on to print works in editions of only 12-18 copies. The Burston Center workshop was closed in 1990 after management problems, while the Printmaking Workshop of Tel Aviv Artists House converted its services from printing whole editions to making available the possibility of independent activity and instruction in the use of various techniques. Most of institutionalized artistic activity took place at the Gottesman Etching Center, which was established at Kibbutz Cabri in 1993, at the Har-El Printers & Publishers print workshop in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and at the Jerusalem Print Workshop, which experienced a period of prosperity as a result of the workshop's activity, when it moved to a new business and artistic model in the mid-1980s. \n\nThe shrinking of the field led most of the major artists who worked in the print industry, such as Ofer Lellouche, Larry Abramson, Sharon Poliakine, Asaf Ben Zvi, Hila Lulu Lin and others, to perceive the medium as secondary in their work. However, artists such as Orit Hofshi, Asaph Ben-Menahem and others have made it the primary medium in their work. \n\nAn area that began to develop during this period is the production of \"artists’ books\" - books that combined text - mostly poems - with prints created specifically for this book. Such books replaced folders of prints that artists had previously published as a portfolio. The books were printed in limited editions and numbered in etching or screen printing techniques. As early as the 1980s, the Jerusalem Print Workshop began printing such books. Among the best known are Thirteen Etchings for Poems by Haim Nachman Bialik (1987) by Moshe Gershuni, and in 1989 the workshop created a series of 9 artists’ books in an edition of 40 copies each. Due to the high cost of producing such books, most of the works were printed for renowned artists.\n\nAlthough Israeli museums continued to purchase prints, exhibitions in major galleries in Tel Aviv-Jaffa or museum exhibitions of Israeli prints were unusual, and even the inclusion of prints in group thematic exhibitions was very small.

Her father had previously married one of his cousins, of the prominent García family of the Arecibo, Puerto Rico, region; well-known Puerto Rican writer René Marqués García is one of her nephews. After divorcing his cousin, her father married Peraza's mother, from another Canarian family. When her family moved to their townhouse in Arecibo, Peraza became extremely ill. She made a promise to Mita God that if she was cured, she would always serve him.\n\nPeraza considered it a miracle that she was cured of her illness and she decided to keep her promise. She was one of the first Puerto Rican women to preach religion in Puerto Rico. Soon, she became a leader in the church she attended. This, however, made the majority of the male church members feel uncomfortable with her presence and they told her that she was no longer welcome there.\n\nGarcía Peraza left the Roman Catholic and converted to the protestant religion of the Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal M.I., and then left the church with 11 other members who followed her to start their own religion. In 1940, she and her followers founded their own church in Arecibo, and in 1947 she relocated to the current location of Hato Rey a suburb of San Juan. They claimed that \"The Holy Spirit Spirit of Life\" revealed to García Peraza the new name of \"Mita\". They started calling themselves \"Mitas\" and their religion \"the Mita congregation\". According to the Mita faith, Mita is the new name of the Holy Ghost on earth and Mita God has chosen a successor before (Peraza) dies. [Reference book by David Ramos Torres, Historia de la Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal, M.I., Una Iglesia Ungida Para Hacer Mision (1994), page 127, and the other reference book by Jesus Santos Medina, PhD, Veredas Que Confunden, Un Análisis Histórico y Teológico de Sectas Religiosas (2010), pages 14-16.]\n\nUnder García Perazas' leadership, the church founded many small businesses which provided work, orientation, and help for its members. The first branch of the church outside of Puerto Rico was established in New York City. The church has expanded to Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador, Canada, Curaçao, Ecuador and Spain.\n\nJuanita \"Mita\" García Peraza died on February 21, 1970 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Teófilo Vargas Sein (\"Aarón\"), was appointed Prophet of God. Puerto Rico honored Juanita García Peraza's memory by naming an elementary school after her in San Juan.\n\n"}

{"id": "2625642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2625642", "title": "Kokutai", "text": "Kokutai\n\n\"Kokutai\" originated as a Sino-Japanese loanword from Chinese \"guoti\" (; \"state political system; national governmental structure\"). The Japanese compound word joins and . According to the \"Hanyu Da Cidian\", the oldest \"guoti\" usages are in two Chinese classic texts. The 2nd century BCE \"Guliang zhuan\" () to the Spring and Autumn Annals glosses \"dafu\" () as \"guoti\" metaphorically meaning \"embodiment of the country\". The 1st century CE Book of Han history of Emperor Cheng of Han used \"guoti\" to mean \"laws and governance\" of Confucianist officials.\n\nThe historical origins of \"kokutai\" go back to pre-1868 periods, especially the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868).\n\nAizawa Seishisai (会沢正志斎, 1782–1863) was an authority on Neo-Confucianism and leader of the Mitogaku (水戸学 \"Mito School\") that supported direct restoration of the Imperial House of Japan. He popularized the word \"kokutai\" in his 1825 \"Shinron\" (新論 \"New Theses\"), which also introduced the term \"Sonnō jōi\" (\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\").\n\nAizawa developed his ideas of \"kokutai\" using the scholarly arguments of Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) that the Japanese national myths in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" were historical facts, believing that the Emperor was directly descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu-ōmikami. Aizawa idealized this divinely-ruled ancient Japan as a form of \"saisei itchi\" (祭政一致 \"unity of religion and government\") or theocracy. For early Japanese Neo-Confucian scholars, linguist Roy Andrew Miller (1982:93) says, \"\"kokutai\" meant something still rather vague and ill defined. It was more or less the Japanese \"nation's body\" or \"national structure\".\n\nKatō Hiroyuki (1836–1916) and Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835–1901) were Meiji period scholars who analyzed the dominance of Western civilization and urged progress for the Japanese nation.\n\nIn 1874, Katō wrote the \"Kokutai Shinron\" (国体新論 \"New Theory of the National Body/Structure\"), which criticized traditional Chinese and Japanese theories of government and, adopting Western theories of natural rights, proposed a constitutional monarchy for Japan. He contrasted between \"kokutai\" and \"seitai\" (政体 \"government body/structure\"). Brownlee explains.\nThe \"Kokutai-seitai\" distinction enabled conservatives to identify clearly as \"Kokutai\", National Essence, the \"native Japanese\", eternal, and immutable aspects of their polity, derived from history, tradition, and custom, and focused on the Emperor. The form of government, \"Seitai\", a secondary concept, then consisted of the historical arrangements for the exercise of political authority. \"Seitai\", the form of government, was historically contingent and changed through time. Japan had experienced in succession direct rule by the Emperors in ancient times, then the rule of the Fujiwara Regents, then seven hundred years of rule by \"shōguns\", followed by the allegedly direct rule of the Emperors again after the Meiji Restoration. Each was a \"seitai\", a form of government. In this understanding, the modern system of government under the Meiji Constitution, derived this time from foreign sources, was nothing more than another form of Japanese government, a new \"seitai\". The Constitution was nothing fundamental. (2000:5) \n\nFukuzawa Yukichi was an influential author translator for the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860). His 1875 \"Bunmeiron no Gairyaku\" (文明論の概略 \"An Outline of a Theory of Civilization\") contradicted traditional ideas about \"kokutai\". He reasoned that it was not unique to Japan and that every nation could be said to have a \"kokutai\" \"national sovereignty\". While Fukuzawa respected the Emperor of Japan, he believed \"kokutai\" did not depend upon myths of unbroken descent from Amaterasu.\n\nThe Constitution of the Empire of Japan of 1889 created a form of constitutional monarchy with the \"kokutai\" sovereign emperor and \"seitai\" organs of government. Article 4 declares that \"the Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty\", uniting the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, although subject to the \"consent of the Imperial Diet\". This system utilized a democratic form, but in practice was closer to an absolute monarchy. The legal scholar Josefa López notes that under the Meiji Constitution, \"kokutai\" acquired an additional meaning.\n\nThis stemmed from Itō Hirobumi's rejection of some European notions as unfit for Japan, as they stemmed from European constitutional practice and Christianity. The references to the \"kokutai\" were the justification of the emperor's authority through his divine descent and the unbroken line of emperors, and the unique relationship between subject and sovereign. The \"family-state\" element in it was given a great deal of prominence by political philosophy. Many conservatives supported these principles as central to \"Nihon shugi\" (\"Nihon gunkoku shugi\", Japanese militarism), \"Japanism\", as an alternative to rapid Westernization.\n\nFrom the Xinhai Revolution to the enactment of the Peace Preservation Law (1911–1925), the most important pre-World War II democracy movement \"Taishō Democracy\" occurred. During the Taishō Democracy, the political theorist Sakuzō Yoshino (1878–1933) rejected Western democracy \"minshu shugi\" (民主主義 lit. \"people rule principle/-ism\") and proposed a compromise on imperial democracy \"minpon shugi\" (民本主義 \"people based principle/-ism\"). However, as Japanese nationalism grew, questions arose whether the \"kokutai\" emperor could be limited by the \"seitai\" government.\n\nThe Peace Preservation Law of 1925 forbade both forming and belonging to any organization that proposed altering the \"kokutai\" or the abolishment of private property, effectively criminalizing socialism, communism, republicanism, democracy and other anti-Tenno ideologies. The Tokkō (\"Special Higher Police\") was established as a type of Thought Police to investigate political groups that might threaten Tenno-centered social order of Japan.\n\nTatsukichi Minobe (1873–1948), a professor emeritus of law at Tokyo Imperial University, theorized that under the Meiji Constitution, the emperor was an organ of the state and not a sacrosanct power beyond the state. This was regarded as \"lèse-majesté\". Minobe was appointed to the House of Peers in 1932 but forced to resign after an assassination attempt and vehement criticisms that he was disloyal to the emperor.\n\nGreat efforts were made to foment a \"Japanese spirit\" even in popular culture, as in the promotion of the \"Song of Young Japan.\"\n\nThe national debates over \"kokutai\" led the Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe to appoint a committee of Japan's leading professors to deliberate the matter. In 1937, they issued the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" (国体の本義, \"Cardinal Principles of the National Body/Structure,\" see Gauntlett and Hall 1949). Miller gives this description.\nThe document known as the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" was actually a pamphlet of 156 pages, an official publication of the Japanese Ministry of Education, first issued in March 1937 and eventually circulated in millions of copies throughout the home islands and the empire. It contained the official teaching of the Japanese state on every aspect of domestic policy, international affairs, culture, and civilization. (1982:92)\n\nIt clearly stated its purpose: to overcome social unrest and to develop a new Japan. From this pamphlet, pupils were taught to put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it. It also instructed them in the principle of hakkō ichiu, which would be used to justify imperialism.\n\nBrownlee concludes that after the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" proclamation,\nIt is clear that at this stage in history, they were no longer dealing with a concept to generate spiritual unity like Aizawa Seishisai in 1825, or with a political theory of Japan designed to accommodate modern institutions of government, like the Meiji Constitution. The committee of professors from prestigious universities sought to define the essential truths of Japan, which might be termed religious, or even metaphysical, because they required faith at the expense of logic and reason. (2006:13) \n\nThe Ministry of Education promulgated it throughout the school system.\n\nBy 1937, \"election purification\", originally aimed at corruption, required that no candidate set the people in opposition to either the military or the bureaucracy. This was required because voters were required to support imperial rule.\n\nSome objections to the founding of the \"Taisei Yokusankai\" or Imperial Rule Assistance Association, came on the grounds that \"kokutai\", already required all imperial subjects to support imperial rule.\n\nFor the leaders of Japan's \"fascist-nationalist clique\", writes Miller (1982:93), \"\"kokutai\" had become a convenient term for indicating all the ways in which they believed that the Japanese nation, as a political as well as a racial entity, was simultaneously different from and superior to all other nations on earth.\"\n\nThis term, and what it meant, were widely inculcated in propaganda. The final letters of kamikaze pilots expressed, above all, that their motivations were gratitude to Japan and to its Emperor as the embodiment of \"kokutai\". A sailor might give his life to save the picture of the Emperor on a submarine.\n\nDuring World War II, intellectuals at an \"overcoming modernity\" conference proclaimed that prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been a classless society under a benevolent emperor, but the restoration had plunged the nation into Western materialism (an argument that ignored commercialism and ribald culture in the Tokugawa era), which had caused people to forget their nature, which the war would enable them to reclaim.\n\n\"Japanist\" unions endeavoured to win support by disavowing violence and pledging support for nation and emperor. Nevertheless, because of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with \"councils\" in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict. Like the Nazi councils they were copying, this was part of a program to create a classless national unity.\n\nBecause many religions had figures that distracted from the central emperor, they were attacked, such as the Oomoto sect condemned for worshipping figures other than Amaterasu, and in 1939, the Religious Organization authorized the shutting down of any religion that did not conform to the Imperial Way, which the authorities promptly used.\n\nHirohito evoked the \"Kokutai\" in the Jewel Voice Broadcast, which announced the Japanese acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration (unconditional surrender).\n\nBy the surrender of Japan in 1945, the significance of \"kokutai\" diminished. In autumn 1945, GHQ forbade circulation of the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" and repealed the Peace Preservation Law (15 October 1945). By enact of the Constitution of the State of Japan (3 May 1947), Tenno's sovereignty and the \"lèse-majesté\" were repealed.\n\nNevertheless, some authors, including Miller (1982:95), believe that traces of Japanese \"kokutai\" \"are quite as vivid today as they ever were\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3066574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3066574", "title": "Narakasura", "text": "Narakasura\n\nNarakasura was a legendary figure, the progenitor of the Bhauma dynasty of Pragjyotisha. He is considered to be a son of Bhudevi, fathered by either Vishnu in his Varaha incarnation or Hiranyaksha according to different texts. He is claimed as one who established Pragjyotisha. He was killed by Krishna and his son, Bhagadatta of Mahabharata fame, succeeded him.\n\nIn the 10th century Kalika Purana he is claimed to have come from Mithila and said to have established the kingdom of Pragjyotisha after overthrowing the last of the Kirata king Ghatakasura of Danava dynasty. It was foretold that he would be destroyed by a later incarnation of Vishnu. His mother, the earth, sought the boon from Vishnu that her son should have a long life, and that he should be all powerful. Vishnu granted these boons.\n\nThe legend of Naraka is important in the history of Assam, particularly Kamarupa; since Narakasura is cited as the progenitor of all three dynasties that ruled Kamarupa in historical times. A hill, to the south of Guwahati is named after him. He is also associated with the Hindu belief of the shakti goddess and place of worship Kamakhya.\n\nNarakasura and his kingdom, Pragjyotisha, find mention in both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, in the sections which were written not before the first century, where he is not depicted as the son of Bhudevi (earth) and Varaha incarnation of Vishnu. His son, Bhagadatta, is said to have fought for the Kauravas in the Mahabharata battle. Though the boar Prajapati finds mention as early as the Satapatha Brahmana and the Taittriya Aranyaka from the mid first millennium BCE, the avatars were associated with Vishnu later, and became popular in the Gupta period (320-550 CE) and that the contact with Bhumi engendered a son is first mentioned in the Book II of the \"Harivamsa\" which is assigned to the fifth century. This theme, that of the son Naraka, is further expanded in the later Vishnu Purana (5th-9th century). In the 7th-century copper place inscriptions, Naraka is claimed as the originator of the Varman dynasty and that he lived three thousand years earlier. The Bhagavata Purana (8th-10th century), which was composed even later, expands the story even further. The Naraka myth gets the most extensive elaboration in the Upapurana called Kalika Purana (10th century), which was composed in Assam itself. Here the myth of Janaka of Videha, the father of Sita, is embellished and added to the myth of Naraka.\n\nAccording to other accounts, Naraka is not the son of Vishnu but of Hiranyaksha, an Asura.\n\nThe pious Naraka became evil, in association with Asura named Banasura and 'asura' (demon) was added to his name.\n\nOnce Naraka, motivated by his carnal desire, wanted to marry Devi Kamakhya. When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a staircase from the bottom of the Nilachal Hill to the temple within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him.\nNaraka took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. He was almost about to accomplish the job before it was dawn. When Kamakhya Devi got this news, panic-stricken she strangled a cock and made it crow untimely to give the impression of Dawn to Naraka. Duped by the trick even Naraka thought that it was a futile job and left it half way through. Later he chased the cock and killed it. Now the place is known as Kukurakata situated in the district of Darrang. The incomplete staircase is known as Mekhelauja Path.\n\nDrunk with power, as he knew himself to be unrivalled in prowess, he brought all the kingdoms on earth under his control. Next, he turned his eyes towards Swargaloka. Even the mighty Indra could not withstand the assault of this son of Vishnu and had to flee the heavens. \nNarakasura had become the overlord of both the heavens and earth. Addicted to power, he stole the earrings of Aditi, the heavenly mother goddess, and usurped some of her territory, while also kidnapping 16000 women.\n\nAll the Devas, led by Indra, went to Vishnu to ask him to deliver them from Narakasura. Vishnu promised them that he would attend to this matter, when he would be incarnated as Krishna.\n\nAs promised to Mother Earth, Narakasura was allowed to enjoy a long reign. At last Vishnu was born as Krishna. Aditi, who was a relative of Krishna's wife Satyabhama (believed to be an Avatar of Bhudevi - Narakasura' mother), approached Satyabhama for help. When Satyabhama heard of the Narakasura's ill treatment of women and his behaviour with Aditi, she was enraged. Satyabhama approached Lord Krishna for permission to wage a war against Narakasura. As promised to the Devas and Aditi, Krishna attacked the great fortress of Narakasura, riding his mount Garuda with wife Satyabhama.\nLord Krishna used the Narayanastra and the Agneyastra against the army of Narakasura.\nThe battle was furiously fought. Narakasura possessed 11 Akshauhinis that he unleashed on Lord Krishna. However, the Lord slew them all with little effort. Lord Krishna also killed Mura, Narakasura's general. Thus Krishna is called 'Murāri' (the killer of Mura).\n\nNarakasura used several divine weapons against Lord Krishna, but Krishna easily neutralised all those weapons. Narakasura used the Brahmastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with his own Brahmastra. Narakasura used the Agneyastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Varunastra. Narakasura used the Nagapasha against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Garudastra. In desperation, Narakasura launched the Vaishnavastra on Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with another Vaishnavastra. At last, when Narakasura tried to kill Lord Krishna with a trident, Lord Krishna beheaded him with his Sudarshana Chakra (discus).\n\nBefore Narakasura's death, he requested a boon from his mother, Satyabhama, that everyone should celebrate his death with colorful light. Thus this day is celebrated as 'Naraka Chaturdashi' - the day before Diwali. Krishna's and Satyabhama's victory on Narakasura translated into freedom for all his prisoners and honoring of Aditi.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5164336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5164336", "title": "Our Lady of Pontmain", "text": "Our Lady of Pontmain\n\nOur Lady of Pontmain, also known as Our Lady of Hope is the title given to the Virgin Mary on her apparition at Pontmain, France on 17 January 1871. These apparitions were approved by Pope Pius IX. \n\nThe Franco-Prussian War (War of 1870) was the culmination of years of tension between the two nations, which finally came to a head on 19 July 1870, when Emperor Napoleon III of the second Empire declared war against Prussia. From the first days of the war, defeat followed defeat. By January 1871, Paris was under siege, two-thirds of the country was in the power of the Prussians, and they were advancing.\n\nThe apparition is said to have occurred at the height of the Franco-Prussian War. Pontmain, a hamlet of about 500 inhabitants, lay between the oncoming Prussian army and the city of Laval. The Barbedette family consisted of father César, his wife, Victoire, with their two sons Joseph and Eugène, aged ten and twelve, and another older boy who was away in the army. On the evening of 17 January 1871, the two boys were helping their father in the barn when the elder, Eugène, walked over towards the door to look out. As he gazed at the star studded sky he suddenly he saw an apparition of a beautiful woman smiling at him; she was wearing a blue gown covered with golden stars, and a black veil under a golden crown.\n\nHis father, brother, and a neighbour came out to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked into the night sky and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.\n\nA crowd gathered to pray as word quickly spread among the anxious villagers. Children saw the beautiful Lady, and gleefully pointed up to her. Adults, however, only saw three stars forming a triangle. As they prayed the Rosary, the children saw the garment's stars multiply until it was almost entirely gold. Next, the children saw a banner unfurl beneath the Lady. Slowly, a message appeared: \"But pray, my children. God will hear you in time. My Son allows Himself to be touched.\" Upon hearing the message read aloud, the crowd spontaneously began the hymn \"Mother of Hope\". As they sang, Our Lady laughed and joined in the singing. \n\nThe children squealed with delight as her hands kept time with the music. When the crowd began \"My Sweet Jesus,\" her expression changed to profound sadness and a red crucifix appeared in her hands, with the words \"Jesus Christ\" above it. Her eyes mournfully contemplated the cross during the hymn. As the people sang the \"Ave Maris Stella,\" the cross vanished and her smile returned, though with a touch of melancholy. Two small white crosses then appeared on her shoulders before Our Lady disappeared behind a cloud. As the night prayers came to a close, the apparition ended. It was about nine o'clock. The Apparition had lasted about three hours.\n\nYears later, Joseph Barbadette, who later afterwards became a priest of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, recounted:\nShe was young and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with brilliant gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. Her hands were small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' Her face had the most exquisite delicacy and a smile of ineffable sweetness. The eyes, of unutterable tenderness, were fixed on us. Like a true mother, she seemed happier in looking at us than we in contemplating.\n\nThat same evening the Prussian forces inexplicably abandoned their advance. General von Schmidt of the Prussian Army who was about to move on the city of Laval towards Pontmain, received orders from his Commander not to take the city.\n\nOn the evening of 17 January 1871, the Commander of the Prussian forces, having taken up his quarters at the archiepiscopal palace of Le Mans, told Msgr. Fillion, Bishop of that diocese: \"By this time my troops are at Laval\". On the same evening, the Prussian troops in sight of Laval stopped at half-past five o'clock, about the time when the Apparition first appeared above Pontmain, a few miles off. General Schmidt is reported to have said on the morning of the 18th: \"We cannot go farther. Yonder, in the direction of Brittany, there is an invisible 'Madonna' barring the way.\"\nThe sudden stopping of the Prussian forces in sight of Laval, and their retirement the following morning, meant, together with the saving of Brittany, the turning back of the tide of conquering soldiery from that part of France. The war was practically at an end. On 23 January 1871, the long-hoped for Armistice was signed. Soon all the thirty-eight conscripted men and boys returned home unscathed.\n\nAfter that the devotion to the \"Blessed Virgin\" under the title of that of Notre Dame d'Esperance de Pontmain, \"Our Lady of Hope of Pontmain\", was authorized by the ecclesiastical authorities, and the confraternity of that name has been extended all over the world.\n\nAfter the apparition of Our Lady of Hope on 17 January 1871, pilgrims made up of both the clergy and the laity came to Pontmain. At the same time, inquiries and investigations were made about the apparition; the visionary children were submitted to various intense interrogations. Finally, on the Feast of the Purification, 2 February 1872, Msgr. Wicart, Bishop of Laval, issued a pastoral letter giving a canonical judgment on the apparition. Thus, the veneration of \"Our Lady of Hope\" of Pontmain was given official Church recognition and approval. \n\nJoseph Barbadette became a priest of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate; his brother Eùgene became a secular priest. He was assisted by one of the girls who had seen Mary as his housekeeper, and the other, Jeanne-Marie Lebossé, became a nun.\n\nIn May 1872, Bishop Wicart authorized the construction of a sanctuary, which was consecrated in October 1900. In 1905 Pope Pius X elevated the Sanctuary to the status of a basilica.\n\nPope Pius XI gave a final decision regarding the mass and office in honor of \"Our Lady of Hope\" of Pontmain. A final papal honor was given to \"Our Lady of Hope\" on 16 July 1932 by Cardinal Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII, by passing a decree from the Chapter of St. Peter's Basilica that the statue of the \"Blessed Lady, Mother of Hope,\" be solemnly honored with the crown of gold. \"The Lady\" then was crowned in the presence of archbishop, bishops, priests and the laity by Cardinal Verdier, Archbishop of Paris. The coronation took place on 24 July 1934.\n\nAt Pontmain, it was a matter of a message of prayer, very simple in the dramatic circumstances of war and invasion. At Pontmain, Mary is a sign of hope in the midst of war.

The 2008 documentary feature, \"Prom Night in Mississippi\", featuring actor Morgan Freeman, premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. His most recent film, the feature documentary, \"The Last White Knight—Is Reconciliation Possible?\" premiered at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) in 2012. It features Morgan Freeman, Harry Belafonte, Delay de la Beckwith (son of Byron De La Beckwith) as well as Saltzman himself. He is also founder, CEO and president of the charitable, non-profit organization Moving Beyond Prejudice, which works with police forces, students, educators, youth-at-risk and community groups.\n\nHe was born in 1943 the son of Percy Saltzman, Canada's first English-speaking TV weatherman, and Rose Cohen. After briefly studying mathematics and science, he did congressional civil rights lobbying in Washington, D.C., and in the summer of 1965 he did voter registration work in Mississippi as part of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which would later lead him to go back to the area to explore the concept of prejudice and racism with his first documentary feature film, \"Prom Night in Mississippi\". He lives in the Toronto area, and has one daughter, Devyani Saltzman, a writer and literary curator, with his ex-wife, director and screenwriter Deepa Mehta. His partner is Anne Peace, a writer and joyologist.\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 23, he traveled to India for the first time as sound engineer on the National Film Board of Canada's \"Juggernaut\" documentary. He studied meditation to recover after his girlfriend had broken up with him, by mail. He learned meditation at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in the holy city of Rishikesh, India, and was invited by The Beatles, who coincidentally were visiting the ashram, to join them. While there, he spent time with and photographed the Beatles, Donovan, Mia and Prudence Farrow and Mike Love. His photos have been judged \"some of the best intimate shots\" ever taken of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and have been seen in galleries worldwide. A permanent exhibition of his The Beatles in India photographs can be seen above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport.\n\nIn 2000, Saltzman released a book of his photographs, \"The Beatles in Rishikesh\", with Penguin-Putnam; and in 2006 he self-published a deluxe limited edition box set, \"The Beatles in India\".\n\nOne of the most memorable things Saltzman absorbed during his conversations and life-changing stay with The Beatles was George Harrison's words: \"Like we're The Beatles, after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?\"\n\nSaltzman has been to India over 55 times. He led special tours of India in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016. Called \"India with Paul Saltzman: A Fusion of Colour, Music & Soul\", it shares his love of and favourite places in India. Included is how India impacted and enlightened The Beatles, and led to the group's most creative musical period.\n\nSaltzman began his film and television career at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a researcher, interviewer and on-air host, and then moved to the National Film Board of Canada. He assisted in the launch of a new film format as second-unit director and production manager of the first IMAX film, produced for the Osaka Expo '70. In 1972, he produced and directed his first film, a half-hour documentary on Bo Diddley.\n\nIn 1973, Saltzman founded Sunrise Films Limited. He produced and directed documentaries for the next decade, including the award-winning series \"Spread Your Wings\". His work included producing, directing, writing, editing, cinematography and sound recording. In 1983, he turned to drama, producing and directing the premiere of \"HBO's Family Playhouse\" and a special for \"American Playhouse\". That year, he co-created and produced the family action-adventure television series \"Danger Bay\"; the hit CBC–Disney Channel series ran for six years and 123 episodes.\n\nSince then he has produced television series such as \"My Secret Identity\", \"Matrix\" and \"Max Glick\", as well as miniseries and movies of the week.

His achievements have however been overshadowed by the worldwide fascination with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s campaign to prove his son George innocent of wounding a pony in 1903. The popularity of Julian Barnes’s novel \"Arthur and George\" (2005) has had the same effect.\n\nShapurji Edalji was born in Bombay in 1841 or 1842, the son of Doralji Edalji, a Parsi merchant. He attended the Elphinstone College, where he was taught by Dadabhai Naoroji and was a classmate of Dinshaw Eduljee Wacha, who along with Naoroji, himself a former Elphinstone scholar, became a founder member of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885.\n\nIn defiance of his family, Edalji converted to Christianity in 1856, under the influence of Free Kirk missionary John Wilson. He was admitted to the Free Kirk College in Mumbai in 1864. He then worked for a year as a missionary among the pre-literate Warli people before becoming an Anglican. He published a \"Gujerati and English Dictionary\" (1863), \"The Brahma Samaja\", which was a lecture to the Bombay Dialectic Association (1864), and a \"Grammar of the Gujerati\" Language (1867).\n\nIn 1866 he travelled to St Augustine's College, Canterbury, to train as a missionary. He stayed in England, however, and was eventually ordained in Oxford. In 1869 he received his first curacy at Burford. Afterwards he was curate at Holy Trinity, Oxford (1869–70), in the Lancashire parishes of Farnworth and Toxteth (1870–72, 1874–5), St Levan, Cornwall (1873–4), and Bromley St Leonard (1875–6).\n\nOn 17 June 1874 he married Charlotte Elizabeth Stuart (1842–1924), daughter of Thompson Stoneham, Vicar of Ketley in Shropshire. They had three children: George (1876–1953), Horace (1879–1952 or 1953) and Maud (1882–1961).\n\nIn 1876, George Selwyn, the Bishop of Lichfield, appointed Edalji as Vicar of St Mark's church, and the parish of Great Wyrley, Staffordshire, where he served until his death forty-two years later. In securing this position Edalji may well have been the first South Asian to become the incumbent of an English parish. Collieries and agriculture provided the chief employment in the area. A devoted clergyman, though unflinching and sometimes controversial when it came to defending his fundamental principles, he published his \"Lectures on St Paul's Epistles to the Galatians\" in 1879. He was on the one hand a fine preacher but on the other sometimes a cause of tension in the parish, for example when he engaged in bitter battles over the future of the local Church of England schools.\n\nThe lives of the five Edalji family members were clouded in 1888 by the appearance of a series of abusive letters in Great Wyrley, most of them directed against the Edalji family itself. There was a further flood of offensive letters between 1892 and 1895, and the family was also subject to a series of hoaxes. When the Staffordshire Chief Constable indicated that he suspected George of writing the letters Shapurji argued vehemently in his son's defence. This was also his role after October 1903, when George was convicted of wounding a pony, the 8th of the so-called Wyrley outrages of that year; Shapurji campaigned passionately on his son's behalf, and in 1905 produced a booklet, \"The Case of George Edalji\", which provided a detailed analysis of the woeful police and prosecution case against his son.\n\nEdalji's eyesight faded in later years, and by the time of the First World War he was having difficulty in seeing at all. His daughter had to lead him to the pulpit during church services. He died on 23 May 1918, five weeks after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage, and was buried in the parish churchyard.\n\n"}

{"id": "5794410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5794410", "title": "Stupas in Sri Lanka", "text": "Stupas in Sri Lanka\n\nStupas, also called dagobas and cetiyas, are considered an outstanding type of architectural creation of ancient Sri Lanka. Under the influence of Buddhism, there were several changes in the field of architecture in Sri Lanka. The stupa commands a prominent place among these changes. The Stupa is also known by synonymous names such as Chaithya, Dagaba, Thupa, Seya and Vehera. Stupas designed and constructed in Sri Lanka are the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world. \n\nAfter Mahinda introduced Buddhism during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura (307-267 BCE), in the Sri Lanka’s ancient sacred capital of Anuradhapura, the king built the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, a mahavihara, after dedicating the Nandana and Mahamega royal pleasure gardens to the Maha Sangha. The earliest monument found in Sri Lanka is the Stupa, which is described as a hemispherical dome surmounted with a spire (\"kota\").\n\nMahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara in Mahiyangana, Uva Province is regarded as the first stupa of ancient Sri LankaThe first historical stupa constructed after the arrival of Mahinda in Sri Lanka is Thuparamaya, which was built during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa. Afterwards many stupas were built, some colossal stupas, biggest of which is Jetavanaramaya.\n\nThere are two recorded instances regarding the construction of stupas in Sri Lanka in the lifetime of Gautama Buddha. One of those instances is the construction of the cetiya at Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara at Mahiyangana in the valley of Mahaweli, which enshrines the Buddha's Hair Relic reputedly presented by the Buddha to Saman, a deva.The other instance is the construction of a stupa at Tiriyaya enshrining the Hair Relics presented to the tradesman brothers Tapussa and Bhallika from Okkalapa (present-day Yangon). The gift of the Hair Relics to the brothers is explicitly mentioned in the Pali Tipitaka. The latter This event is mentioned in an inscription written in Sanskrit found at this site.\n\nDuring the time of Ashoka, numerous ‘stupas’ were built at hallowed sites in India. In these were enshrined relics of the Buddha which people venerated. When it was observed that there were no Buddha relics in Sri Lanka, the king, at Mahinda’s suggestion, appealed to Emperor Asoka to send some relics. He responded to the king’s request and sent the right collarbone relic of the Buddha. King Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparamaya to enshrine this relic, the right collarbone of the Buddha. The Thuparamaya is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka. The building of colossal stupas started during the reign of King Dutugamunu. Afterward many kings built stupas.\n\nThe construction of stupas were considered acts of great merit. The purpose of stupas were mainly to enshrine relics of Buddha. The design specifications are consistent within most of the stupas, entrances to stupas are laid out so that their centre lines point to the relic chambers.\n\nThe stupas were covered with a coating of lime plaster, plaster combinations changed with the requirements of the design, items used included lime, clay, sand, pebbles, crushed seashells, sugar syrup, white of egg, coconut water, plant resin, drying oil, glues and saliva of white ants. The fine plaster at Kiri Vehera used small pebbles, crushed seashells mixed with lime and sand were used in the stupas from the fifth to twelfth centuries.\n\nA stupa usually has six parts: \nA stupa consists of three such berms at its base. The three berms rising from the base gradually reduce in size.\nThe hemispherical dome is constructed on the three berms. In the middle of the dagaba was built a relic chamber (Dhathu garbhaya). The Buddha's relics are enshrined there. In the centre of the Relic Chamber was placed a bo-tree made of precious metals, and an image of the Buddha round which were groups of figures representing various events in the life of the Buddha.\nRelics are enshrined in this part too.\nThis is built on the Hatharas Kotuwa. Figures of deities are carved on the surface.\nThis is built on the Devatha Kotuwa. A crystal (chudamanikya) on a pinnacle made of metal is placed at the top of the spire to adorn it.\n\nThere are other constructions associated with the stupa:\nThis is a structure constructed joining the stupa at its four cardinal directions as a decorative flourish. Later these frontispieces came to be decorated or embellished with designs such as the creeper design. Stone slabs erected for the purpose of offering flower at the stupa too have been added to these frontispieces.\nThe chetiyagara is a structure constructed as a protection chamber for the stupa. There is evidence to show that such chambers were erected to shelter the small stupas built during the early years. The roofs of these structures are believed to have been wooden.\n\nBasically, a stupa has several salient features. Buddhist literature mentions six types of stupas differing according to the shape of the dome or body of a dagaba. This is mentioned in \"Vijayantha Potha\". \n\nThey are:\ne.g. : Kelaniya stupa\ne.g. : Ambastala dagaba at Mihintale\ne.g. : Ruwanweli Maha Seya at Anuradhapura, Rankoth Vehera & Kiri Vehera at Pollonnaruwa\n\ne.g. : Situlpavwa, Somawathiya, Kiri Vehera at Kataragama\ne.g. : Vijayarama at Anuradhapura, Puliyankulama, Indikatu Seya at Mihintale\nNo records exist of the finding of this type of stupa in Sri Lanka.\n\nAnother type of stupa is mentioned in the book \"Manju Sri Vasthu Vidya Shastra\"\ne.g. : Nadigamvila stupa\n\nKing Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparama dagaba to enshrine the Right Collar Bone of Lord Buddha. The Thuparama is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka. Originally it was in the shape of a heap of paddy but as restorations were done in later years, it took the form as seen today. It has a diameter of at the base. As the name suggests, Thuparama comprised a ‘stupa’ and an ‘arama,’ a residential complex. Ruins of such a complex can be seen within an area of over around the ‘stupa.’\n\nThe ‘stupas’ built later on were much larger than the Thuparama.It is accepted that the building of colossal stupas started during the reigh of King Dutugemunu. King Dutugemunu (161-137 BC) built the Mirisaveti which has a diameter of at the base and the most venerated ‘stupa’ - Ruvanvali Mahaseya, also known as Ratnamali Mahathupa. While the base has a diameter of , the height is given as 120 cubits (‘riyan’), equivalent to around . It took the form of ‘bubbulakara’ or bubble shape. When the Abhyayagiri dagaba was originally built by King Vattagamani (Valagamba - 103 BC) it was not very large but later enlargements made it larger than the Mahathupa. \nKing Mahasena (276-303 CE) is credited with building the largest of them all - the Jetavana, which has a diameter of at the base. Though the present height is estimated at , the original height is supposed to have been 400 feet.\nThe main feature of Jetavana is its foundation, which goes all the way to the bedrock and deep. The height of Jetavana and the depth of the footing is approximately equal. Large stupas were also built at Mihintale at the site where Arahat Mahinda met the king, Magama, Dighavapi (near Ampara), Kataragama and other places. The builders of ‘stupas’ in Sri Lanka had closely followed the designs of such monuments built in Sanchi and other places in India. In huge monuments, the dome rose from a triple-based platform. The dome was surmounted by a square railing of wood or stone which later became a cube of masonry. A stone pillar embedded in the dome rose above the railing. The ‘stupa’ was crowned by an umbrella (‘chattra’) or a series of umbrellas.\n\nThe Kantaka Chaitya in Mihintale is a fine example of a small dagoba. It features some of the finest stone carvings and terra cotta figures. They are well preserved to this day. The presence of a ‘vahalkada’ or front piece is another interesting feature in this chaitya. \nThere are carvings of animal figures, pot and foliage and other familiar ornamental motifs. These front pieces seen in most dagobas project from the base and face the cardinal points.\n\nIt can be observed that after the 4th century, the building of colossal dagobas has virtually ended. Thereafter smaller ones have been built using Thuparama in Anuradhapura as a model. This type came to be known as ‘vatadage’ or rotunda. It is a circular relic house and apart from Thuparama and Lankarama in Anuradhapura, the best example is seen in Polonnaruwa. \n\nThere are two other beautiful ones at Medirigiriya close to Polonnaruwa and Tiriyaya off the Anuradhapura-Trincomalee road. These circular shrines enclosed stupas of smaller size and had wooden pillars right round. Later they were replaced by carved stone pillars. The pillars are arranged in four to two concentric circles, diminishing in size outwards.\n\n\n\nIt is important to examine the technology applied in the construction of stupas comprising the features mentioned above. Examining the building of the foundation of a stupa to suit its size, one can get an idea of the application of the knowledge of science and geometry prevalent in ancient times. The Jetavana excavations conducted recently confirm that the construction of the platform or base on which a stupa stands has been very solid and strong. The skill shown by the craftsmen in maintaining the shape of the stupa reveals the advanced state of technology prevalent at the time. One wonders how the materials used in building Jetavanaramaya could have been carried to such a height.\n\n\nParanavitana, S, Stupa in Ceylon\nvon Schroeder, Ulrich.

{"id": "34895893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34895893", "title": "The Archaeology of Shamanism", "text": "The Archaeology of Shamanism\n\nThe Archaeology of Shamanism is an academic anthology edited by the English archaeologist Neil Price which was first published by Routledge in 2001. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, it looks at the manner in which archaeologists can interpret shamanism in the archaeological record.\n\nThe origins of \"The Archaeology of Shamanism\" came from Price's doctoral research, which he undertook at the University of York's Department of Archaeology from October 1988 through to May 1992. Under the supervision of the archaeologists Steve Roskams and Richard Hall, Price had initially focused his research on the Anglo-Scandinavian tenements at 16–22 Coppergate in York, although eventually moved away from this to focus on archaeology within Scandinavia itself. Personal circumstances meant that Price was unable to finish his doctoral thesis at York, and in 1992 he emigrated to Sweden, where he spent the following five years working as a field archaeologist. Despite his full-time employment, he continued to be engaged in archaeological research in a private capacity, publishing a series of academic papers and presenting others at conferences. In 1996 joined the Department of Archaeology at the University of Uppsala as a research scholar, beginning full-time work there the following year. At Uppsala, he went on to complete his doctoral thesis and gain his PhD under the supervision of Anne-Sofie Gräslund, which would later be published under the title of \"The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia\".\n\nIn undertaking research for his doctoral thesis, Price took great interest in circumpolar shamanism, attending academic conferences on this subject and reading much published material that had been produced by anthropologists. He found that much of the data which he collected in this area was ultimately of little use for his thesis, and so he included it in an edited anthology which he put together entitled \"The Archaeology of Shamanism\" (2001).\n\nChapter thirteen, \"An ideology of transformation: Cremation rites and animal sacrifice in early Anglo-Saxon England\", is provided by Howard Williams, then a Lecturer in Archaeology at Trinity College, Carmarthen in Wales. Devoted to a discussion of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England, it focuses in on the connection between cremation rites and animal sacrifice, highlighting potentially shamanic elements of such religious practices. Following a brief overview of how earlier scholars have approached the study of Anglo-Saxon paganism, the paper then provides an overview for the archaeological crematory and sacrificial evidence from Anglo-Saxon contexts. Looking at animal designs found on some cremation urns, it highlights the recurring image of the horse within such contexts. Drawing from anthropological comparisons, Williams looks at shamanic cultures across Eurasia and North America which have performed animal sacrifice at funerals, before going on to look at evidence from both Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon literary sources, from which he puts forward the possibility that there may have been a shamanic component to Anglo-Saxon pagan religion.\n\nIn his review for the \"Cambridge Archaeological Journal\", Michael Winkelman of Arizona State University noted that while Price and the other authors \"adopt an approach that shamanism can be differentiated from other forms of religious phenomena\", he believed that they had failed to explain how they had adopted such an approach to the reader. He furthermore opined that the work suffers from \"an inability to determine just what constitutes a shaman\" and how shamanism was \"distinct from other magico-religious practices.\" Believing that the work could have been improved by a greater examination of the neurobiology behind shamanic altered states of consciousness, he notes that this was an issue which was only dealt with by J.D. Lewis-Williams in his paper. Regarding the ethnographic chapters, he remarks that they suffer from \"the problem of cross-cultural reference\", failing to understand the socio-cultural evolution of magico-religious practitioners, assuming that contemporary shamans practice in the same way as their historic and prehistoric forebears. Concluding his review, Winkelman accepts the importance of the anthology in illustrating both that \"there is a substantial basis for an archaeology of shamanism\" and that \"shamanic frameworks are essential for accurate interpretation of prehistory.\" Despite this, he laments that the book's lack of a well defined conceptual framework is indicative that the archaeology of shamanism is still in its \"infancy\".\n\n"}

The word comes from the past participle of the Latin verb \"voveo, vovere\", \"vow, promise\". As the result of this verbal action, a \"votum\" is also that which fulfills a vow, that is, the thing promised, such as offerings, a statue, or even a temple building. The \"votum\" is thus an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion, a bargaining expressed by \"do ut des\", \"I give that you might give.\"\n\nIn everyday life, individuals might make votive offerings to a deity for private concerns. \"Vota privata\" are attested in abundance by inscriptions, particularly for the later Imperial era. These are regularly marked with the letters V.S.L.M., \"votum solvit libens merito\", noting that the person making the dedication \"He has fulfilled his vow, willingly, as it should.\" William Warde Fowler found in these offerings \"expressions of … religious feeling\" and a gratitude for blessings received that go deeper than contractual formalism.\n\nDuring the Republican era, the \"votum\" was a regular part of ceremonies conducted at the Capitoline by a general holding \"imperium\" before deploying. The triumph with its dedication of spoils and animal sacrifices at the Capitol was in part a fulfillment of such a vow. A general who faced an uncertain outcome in battle might make a \"votum\" in the field promising to build a temple out of gratitude for divine aid in a victory. In 311 BC, Junius Bubulcus became the first plebeian general to vow and oversee the building of a temple; he honored the goddess Salus, \"Salvation\". A vow would also be made in connection with the ritual of \"evocatio\", negotiations with the enemy's tutelary deity to offer superior cult. An extreme form of \"votum\" was the \"devotio\", the ritual by which a general sacrificed himself in battle and asked the chthonic deities to take the enemy as offerings along with him.\n\nIn the Republic, \"vota pro salute rei publicae\" (\"vows for the security of the republic\") were offered at the beginning of the year, on the day the consuls took office.\n\nUnder the Empire, the people assembled on January 3 to offer collective vows for the \"salus\" (\"health, safety, wellbeing\") of the emperor. Offerings were made to Jupiter, Juno, Salus, and sometimes other deities. These vows originated in 30 BC, when the senate decreed \"vota\" on behalf of Octavian (later Augustus) as \"princeps\". The \"vota\" for the state continued on January 1, while those on behalf of the emperor and his family became fixed on January 3. In Rome, these ceremonies were conducted by the consuls and pontiffs, and in the provinces probably by governors and local priests and officials.\n\n\"Vota publica\" continued even after Christianity had become the official religion of the Empire, and possibly as late as the 6th century. Because the vows were as much affirmations of political loyalty as religious expressions, they were difficult to abolish without undermining the sacral aura of the emperor's authority.\n\n"}
