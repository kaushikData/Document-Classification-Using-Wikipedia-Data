The bark may be ground into a powder and saturated into water to create a tea, or may be spread onto various foods as a spice and taste enhancer. The wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm³. In Taiwan, its wood is used to make support beams for underground mines. The wood is also converted to charcoal for family use. The plant is used in traditional medicine and is available from herbal medicine shops (草藥店) in Taiwan, but there has been no clinical study to support its effectiveness. It is also frequently used as a durable flooring material.\nPhytochemicals found in \"Acacia confusa\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "521177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=521177", "title": "Astrological sign", "text": "Astrological sign\n\nIn Western astrology, astrological signs are the twelve 30° sectors of the ecliptic, starting at the vernal equinox (one of the intersections of the ecliptic with the celestial equator), also known as the First Point of Aries. The order of the astrological signs is Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.\n\nThe concept of the zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by Hellenistic culture. According to astrology, celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of \"as above, so below\", so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression. Modern discoveries about the true nature of celestial objects has undermined the theoretical basis for assigning meaning to astrological signs, and empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions and recommendations based on these systems are not accurate. Astrology is generally regarded as pseudoscience.\n\nThe twelve sector division of the ecliptic constitutes astrology's primary frame of reference when considering the positions of celestial bodies, from a geocentric point of view, so that we may find, for instance, the Sun in 23° \"Aries\" (23° longitude), the Moon in 7° \"Scorpio\" (217° longitude), or Jupiter in 29° \"Pisces\" (359° longitude). Beyond the celestial bodies, other astrological points that are dependent on geographical location and time (namely, the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Vertex and the houses' cusps) are also referenced within this ecliptic coordinate system.\n\nVarious approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology, although the tradition of the Zodiac's names and symbols remain consistent. Western astrology measures from Equinox and Solstice points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the tropical year), while Jyotiṣa or Vedic astrology measures along the equatorial plane (sidereal year). Precession results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the constellations that carry similar names, while Jyotiṣa measurements still correspond with the background constellations.\n\nIn Western and Indian astrology, the emphasis is on space, and the movement of the Sun, Moon and planets in the sky through each of the zodiac signs. In Chinese astrology, by contrast, the emphasis is on time, with the zodiac operating on cycles of years, months, and hours of the day.\n\nA common feature of all three traditions however, is the significance of the Ascendant – the zodiac sign that is rising (due to the rotation of the earth) on the eastern horizon at the moment of a person's birth.\n\nWhile Western astrology is essentially a product of Greco-Roman culture, some of its more basic concepts originated in Babylonia. Isolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac. Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.\n\nBy the 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of ancient Greece, as did the astrology of ancient Egypt by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of horoscopic astrology, employing the use of the Ascendant (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve houses. Association of the astrological signs with Empedocles' four classical elements was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy's \"Tetrabiblos\", a work that was responsible for astrology's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East, and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.\n\nThe following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss). The longitude intervals, being a mathematical division, are closed for the first endpoint (\"a\") and open for the second (\"b\") – for instance, 30° of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. Association of calendar dates with astrological signs only makes sense when referring to Sun sign astrology.\n\nEmpedocles, a fifth-century BC Greek philosopher, identified Fire, Earth, Air, and Water as elements. He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles called love and strife manipulating the four elements, and stated that these four elements were all equal, of the same age, that each rules its own province, and each possesses its own individual character. Different mixtures of these elements produced the different natures of things. Empedocles said that those who were born with near equal proportions of the four elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.\n\nEach sign is associated with one of the classical elements, and these can also be grouped according to polarity: Fire and Air signs are considered positive or extrovert, masculine signs; while Water and Earth signs are considered negative or introvert, feminine signs. The four astrological elements are also considered as a direct equivalent to Hippocrates' personality types (sanguine = air; choleric = fire; melancholic = earth; phlegmatic = water). A modern approach looks at elements as \"the energy substance of experience\" and the next table tries to summarize their description through keywords.\nClassification according to element has gained such importance, that some astrologers start their interpretation of a natal chart, by studying the balance of elements shown by the position of planets and angles (especially the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant).\n\nEach of the four elements manifests in three modalities: Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable. As each modality comprehends four signs, these are also known as Quadruplicities. They are occasionally referred to as crosses because each modality forms a cross when drawn across the zodiac. Christian astrology relates the three qualities to the three aspects of God in the trinity.\n\nThe combination of element and modality provides a basic sign characterization. For instance, Capricorn is a cardinal earth sign, meaning that it is associated with action (cardinal modality) in the material world (earth element). That can translate into ambition or practical application to the concrete, everyday necessities of life. \nThe next table displays the twelve combinations of elements and modalities.\n\nRulership is the connection between planet and correlated sign and house. In traditional Western astrology, each sign is ruled by one and only one of the seven visible planets (note that in astrology, the Sun and Moon are termed The Lights, while the other bodies are called planets, which literally means \"wanderers\", i.e. wandering stars as opposed to the fixed stars). The traditional rulerships are as follows: Aries (Mars), Taurus (Venus), Gemini (Mercury), Cancer (Moon), Leo (Sun), Virgo (Mercury), Libra (Venus), Scorpio (Pluto), Sagittarius (Jupiter), Capricorn (Saturn), Aquarius (Uranus), and Pisces (Neptune).\n\nPsychologically-oriented astrologers often believe that Saturn is the ruler or co-ruler of Aquarius instead of Uranus; Neptune is the ruler or co-ruler of Pisces instead of Jupiter, and that Pluto is the ruler or co-ruler of Scorpio instead of Mars. Some astrologers believe that the planetoid Chiron may be the ruler of Virgo, while other group of modern astrologers claim that Ceres is the ruler of Taurus instead. Other astrologers, still, use the former planets Pallas, Vesta, Juno and Hygiea in their delineations and rulerships, for example Vesta to Taurus and Pallas to Virgo.\n\nDebate continues between those who consider the newly discovered planets as rulers or co-rulers of certain signs and those that do not. Some astrologers do not even use the astrological signs at all (mostly Cosmobiologists and Uranian Astrologers/Hamburg School). Therefore, they do not take into account planetary rulerships and the essential dignities when interpreting an astrological chart.\n\nNote that, if one starts from Leo and Cancer, the traditional planetary rulers are arrayed outward in the same order from the sun as they occur in the natural solar system. The Lights ruling Leo and Cancer, Mercury ruling Virgo and Gemini, Venus ruling Libra and Taurus, Mars ruling Scorpio and Aries, Jupiter ruling Sagittarius and Pisces, Saturn ruling Capricorn and Aquarius. The result is a symmetry of traditional rulerships across the 0° Leo/Aquarius axis. Note that modern rulerships, which attribute Pluto as ruler of Scorpio, break this symmetry.\n\nThe following table shows both, traditional and modern, rulerships.\n\nSigns can also be listed by opposite, resulting in six couples who are:\n\n\nTo note that Fire and Air (light elements) signs are opposited between them, like happens for Earth and Water ones (heavy elements). Spring signs are opposite to autumn ones, and winter signs are related to summer ones.\n\nA traditional belief of astrology, known as essential dignity, is the idea that the Sun, Moon and planets are more powerful and effective in some signs than others, because the basic nature of both is held to be in harmony. By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. The most important of these categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall.\n\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation (see below), Triplicity, Terms or bounds, and Face or Decan, which together are known as describing a planet's \"Essential dignity\", the quality or ability to give of one's true nature. Contemporary traditional astrologers like John Frawley or J Lee Lehman explain further on the concept of Essential Dignity.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\nIn addition to essential dignity, the traditional astrologer considers \"Accidental dignity\" of planets. This is placement by house in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature. The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of \"Accidental Debilities\", such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.\n\nEach sign can be divided into three 10° sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler. The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last decanate is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.\n\nWhile the element and modality of a sign are together sufficient to define it, they can be grouped to indicate their symbolism. The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs. The last four signs of the zodiac, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, form the group of transpersonal signs.\n\nDane Rudhyar presented the tropical zodiac primary factors, used in the curriculum of the RASA School of Astrology. The tropical zodiac is the zodiac of seasonal factors as opposed to the sidereal zodiac (constellation factors). The primary seasonal factors are based on the changing ratio of sunlight and darkness across the year. The first factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when daylight is increasing, or the half of the year when darkness is increasing. The second factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when there is more daylight than darkness, or the half when there is more darkness than daylight. The third factor is which of the four seasons the chosen time falls in, defined by the first two factors. Thus \n\nIn Indian astrology, there are four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. The master of fire is Mars, while Mercury is of earth, Saturn of air, and Venus of water.\n\nJyotish astrology recognises twelve zodiac signs (Rāśi), that correspond to those in Western astrology. The relation of the signs to the elements is the same in the two systems.\n\nA nakshatra (Devanagari: नक्षत्र, Sanskrit ', from ' 'approach', and ' 'guard') or lunar mansion is one of the 27 divisions of the sky, identified by the prominent star(s) in them, as used in Hindu astronomy and astrology (Jyotisha).\n\nUnlike the Gregorian and Indian zodiacs, the Chinese zodiac signs are not derived from constellations, and are not assigned to sections of the ecliptic. Instead, Chinese astrological signs operate on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (also known as \"shichen\"). A particular feature of the Chinese zodiac is its operation in a 60-year cycle in combination with the Five Phases of Chinese astrology (Wood, Fire, Metal, Water and Earth).\nNevertheless, some researches say that there is an obvious relationship between the Chinese 12-year cycle and zodiac constellations: each year of the cycle corresponds to a certain disposal of Jupiter. For example, in the year of Snake Jupiter is in the Sign of Gemini, in the year of Horse Jupiter is in the Sign of Cancer and so on. So the Chinese 12-year calendar is a solar-lunar-jovian calendar.\n\nThe following table shows the twelve signs and their attributes.\n\nIn Chinese astrology, the zodiac of twelve animal sign represents twelve different types of personality. The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the Rat, and there are many stories about the Origins of the Chinese Zodiac which explain why this is so. When the twelve zodiac signs are part of the 60-year calendar in combination with the four elements, they are traditionally called the twelve Earthly Branches. The Chinese zodiac follows the lunisolar Chinese calendar and thus the \"changeover\" days in a month (when one sign changes to another sign) vary each year. The following are the twelve zodiac signs in order.\n\n\n\nThe five elements operate together with the twelve animal signs in a 60-year calendar. The five elements appear in the calendar in both their yin and yang forms and are known as the ten Celestial stems. When trying to calculate the relevant year of the cycle in relation to the Gregorian calendar, an easy rule to follow is that years that end in an even number are Yang (representing masculine, active and light), those that end with an odd number are Yin (representing feminine, passive and darkness).\n\n"}
{"id": "862270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=862270", "title": "Atar", "text": "Atar\n\nAtar ( (Avestan 𐬁𐬙𐬀𐬭 \"ātar\") is the Zoroastrian concept of holy fire, sometimes described in abstract terms as \"burning and unburning fire\" or \"visible and invisible fire\" (Mirza, 1987:389). It is considered to be the visible presence of Ahura Mazda and his aša. The rituals for purifying a fire are performed 1,128 times a year.\n\nIn the Avestan language, \"ātar\" is an attribute of sources of heat and light, of which the nominative singular form is \"ātarš\", source of Persian \"ātaš\" (fire). It is etymologically related to the Avestan \"𐬁𐬚𐬭𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬀𐬥‎‎ āθrauuan\" / \"aθaurun\" (Vedic अथर्वन् \"atharvan\"), a type of priest. It was later copied by the Latin \"ater\" (black) and possibly a cognate of the Slavic \"vatra\" (fire).\n\nIn later Zoroastrianism, \"ātar\" (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭲𐭥𐭥𐭩 \"ādar\" or \"ādur\") is iconographically conflated with fire itself, which in Middle Persian is 𐭠𐭲𐭧𐭱 \"ātaxsh\", one of the primary objects of Zoroastrian symbolism.\n\n\"Atar\" is already evident in the Gathas, the oldest texts of the compendium of the Avesta and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. At this juncture, as in the \"Yasna Haptanghaiti\" (the seven-chapter Yasna that structurally interrupts the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves), \"atar\" is still—with only one exception—an abstract concept simply an instrument, a medium, of the Creator and is not yet the divinity (\"yazata\") of heat and light that \"atar\" was to become in the later texts.\n\nIn the most ancient texts, \"atar\" is a medium, a faculty, through which judgement is passed and reflects the pre-Zoroastrian institution of ordeal by heat (Avestan: \"garmo-varah\", heat ordeal; \"cf.\" Boyce 1996:ch. 6). So, for example, justice is administered through \"atar\" (\"Yasna\" 31.3, 34.4, 36.2, 47.2), the blazing \"atar\" (31.19, 51.9), through the heat of \"atar\" (43.4), through the blazing, shining, molten metal (\"ayangha Khshushta\", 30.7, 32.7, 51.9). An individual who has passed the fiery test, has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (30.7). However, among all the references to \"atar\" in the oldest texts, it is only once addressed independently of Ahura Mazda. In this exception, \"atar\" is spoken of in the third person masculine singular: \"He detects sinners by hand-grasping\" (\"Yasna\" 34.4). Altogether, \"there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all.\" (Boyce, 2002:1)\n\nAlso in the early texts, tangential to its role in establishing guilt, \"atar\" is the light of revelation through which Zoroaster is selected for prophet-hood, the \"Zarathushtra Mainyu Athra\" (\"Yasna\" 31.3), radiated by Wisdom/Mazda (43.9), bearing the conviction of \"Good Purpose\" (\"Vohu Manah\", 43.4; see also Amesha Spenta), and enlightening one’s inner-self (46.7). Within this framework of the concept of divine illumination, \"atar\" radiates the \"other lights\" (31.7), the essence (of Mazda) from which insight and wisdom permeate the universe. So also Zoroaster's injunction to always pray in the presence of \"atar\"—either towards the sun, or towards their own hearths—so as to better concentrate their devotions on \"asha\", righteousness, and the virtue that should be striven for (\"Yasna\" 43.9, see also Boyce, 1975:455).\n\nThe Gathic role of \"atar\" as the medium for detecting guilt is not directly evident in the later texts of the Avesta, but reappears in modified form as an allegory of burning and annihilating the Angra Mainyu through righteousness, \"where Asha Vahishta is identified at times with the household fire on the hearth.\" There, \"identification in the realms of matter and of spirit serves only to bring more into prominence the main tenets of Zoroaster's teachings in regard to Asha\" (Dhalla, 1938:170). A vestige of the ancient institution of ordeal by heat is nonetheless present in \"Vendidad\" 4.54–55, where speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is punishable by flogging and is detected by the consumption of \"water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt.\" The \"Zend\" translation/commentary on this passage translates \"blazing\" as having brimstone and sulphur, and notes that innocence or guilt was established by the consumption of this \"guilt-detecting liquid\". Similarly, in the \"Denkard\", Adharbad Maraspand—the Sassanid era high-priest to whom the collation of the Avesta texts is attributed—is purported to have nine measures of \"unburning molten zinc\" applied to his chest as proof of accuracy of the sacred texts.\n\nSeen chronologically, the transition from \"atar\" as a vehicle of judgement to \"Atar Yazata\" the divinity presiding over blazing fire is abrupt. While the older Gathic Avestan texts have heat (and thus fire) associated with harsh judgement, the Younger Avestan texts have the divinity \"Atar\" completely representing and being represented by fire itself; and associated with warmth and light and essential for growth. \"Asha Vahishta\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s association with \"atar\" is however carried forward, and they are often mentioned together (\"Yasna\" 62.3, \"Nyashes\" 5.9, etc.). So also in their roles as protectors, for \"when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened\" (\"Yasht\" 13.77)\n\nIt is in the later texts that \"Atar\" is personified as \"the son\" of Ahura Mazda (standard appellation, \"Yasna\" 25.7 et al.) and is addressed as \"full of glory and full of healing remedies\" (\"Nyash\" 5.6). In \"Yasna\" 17.11, \"Atar\" is \"master of the house\", recalling the role of the hearth fire in the Gathas. The same passage enumerates the \"five kinds of fire\":\nThe description of the fires in the Sassanid era commentaries (the \"Zend\" texts) differs slightly from those described in the \"Bundahishn\" (\"Original Creation\", completed in the 11th or 12th century). In the latter, the description of the first and last kind of fire is reversed.\n\nDuring the late Achaemenid era, \"adar\"—as the quintessence of the Yazata \"Adar\"—was incorporated in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of angels. In that position, \"Adar\" is a helper of \"Asha Vahishta\" (Avestan, middle Persian: \"Ardvahisht\"), the Amesha Spenta responsible for the luminaries. From among the flowers associated with the Zoroastrian angels, \"Adar\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s is the marigold (\"calendula\") (\"Bundahishn\" 27.24).\n\nThe importance of the divinity \"Adar\" is evident from a dedication to the entity in the Zoroastrian calendar: \"Adar\" is one of the only five lower-ranking divinities that have a month-name dedication. Additionally, \"Adar\" is the name of the ninth day of the month in the Zoroastrian religious calendar, and the ninth month of the year of the civil Iranian calendar of 1925 (modern Persian: \"Azar\") which has month-names derived from those used by the Zoroastrian calendar. \n\nIn Zoroastrian cosmogony, \"Adar\" was the seventh of the seven creations of the material universe. It is only with \"Adar\"s assistance, who serves as the life-force, that the other six creations begin their work (\"Bundahishn\" 3.7–8; more logically explained in \"Zatspram\" 3.77–83).\n\nAlthough Zoroastrians revere fire in any form, the temple fire is not literally for the reverence of fire, but together with clean water (see Aban), is an agent of ritual purity. Clean, white \"ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life\", which \"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple cult is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\" (Boyce, 1975:455). For, \"the man who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand, with the \"Baresman\" in his hand, with milk in his hand, with the mortar for crushing the branches of the sacred Haoma in his hand, is given happiness\" (\"Yasna\" 62.1; \"Nyashes\" 5.7) \n\nThe Zoroastrian cult of fire is apparently much younger than Zoroastrianism itself and appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult, first evident in the 4th century BCE (roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of \"Adar\" as a divinity). There is no allusion to a temple cult of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any old Persian language word for one. Moreover, Boyce suggests that the temple cult of fire was instituted in opposition to the image/shrine cult, an alien form of worship, and \"no actual ruins of a fire temple have been identified from before the Parthian period\" (Boyce, 1975:454).\n\nThat the cult of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is still evident in the later \"Atash Nyash\": in the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to \"all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal\", which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple cult is an even later development: From Herodotus it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires (\"The Histories\", i.131). Strabo confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in Cappadocia was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky (\"Geographica\" XI.8.4.512).\n\nBy the Parthian era (250 BCE–226 CE), Zoroastrianism had in fact two kinds of places of worship: One, apparently called \"bagin\" or \"ayazan\", sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity, constructed in honor of the patron saint/angel of an individual or family and included an icon or effigy of the honored. The second were the \"atroshan\", the \"places of burning fire\", which as Boyce (1997:ch. 3) notes, became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the Yazatas continued to exist, with the statues—by law—either being abandoned as empty sanctuaries, or being replaced by fire altars (so also the popular shrines to Meher/Mithra which retained the name \"Darb-e Mehr\"—Mithra's Gate—that is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple).\n\nAlso, as Schippman observed (\"loc. Cit.\" Boyce, 1975:462), even during the Sassanid era (226–650 CE) there is no evidence that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. \"It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the \"Atash-i Vahram\" [literally: \"victorious fire\", later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram, see Gnoli, 2002:512] and the lesser \"Atash-i Adaran\", or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter\" (Boyce, 1975:462; Boyce 1966:63). Apparently, it was only in the \"Atash-i Vahram\" that fire was kept continuously burning, with the \"Adaran\" fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that \"the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (\"kadag\", \"man\", and \"xanag\" are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult [...] to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration\" (Boyce, 2002:9).\n\nThe Indian Parsi-Zoroastrian practice of rendering the term \"athornan\" (derived from the Avestan language \"athravan\") as \"fire-priest\" in the English language is based on the mistaken assumption that the \"athra*\" prefix derives from \"atar\" (Boyce, 2002:16–17). The term \"athravan\" does not appear in the Gathas, where a priest is a \"zaotar\", and in its oldest attested use (\"Yasna\" 42.6) the term appears to be synonymous with \"missionary\". In the later \"Yasht\" 13.94, Zoroaster himself is said to have been an \"athravan\", which in this context could not be a reference to \"atar\" if a cult of fire and its associated priesthood did not yet exist in Zoroaster's time. Thus, in all probability, \"the word athravan has a different derivation\" (Boyce, 2002:17) Compare this however with the Sanskrit अथर्वन् (\"atharvan\"), and the content of Atharva-véda. \n\nIn \"Vendidad\" 1, \"Adar\" battles Aži Dahāka, the great dragon of the sky.\n\nIn Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Hoshang, the grandson of the first man \"Gayomard\", discovers fire in a rock. He recognizes it as the divine glory of God, offers homage to it, and instructs his people to so as well. Also in the Shahnameh is the legend of Sevavash, who passes through \"the unburning fire\" as proof of his innocence.\n\nDuring the Sassanid era (226–650 CE), the symbol of Fire plays much the same role that the winged sun Faravahar did during the Achaemenid period (648–330 BCE). Beginning with Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid Empire, many of the kings of the dynasty issued one or more coins with a symbol of Fire on the verso, and seals and bullae with the fire symbol were common. \nThe first silver coins of the empire have helmeted busts of Ardashir I (\"r.\" 226–241) or his father Papak on the obverse (a figure of the ruling monarch on the obverse is consistent throughout the dynasty), with a representation of a fire altar, accompanied by the legend \"atash i artakhshir\", \"Fire of Ardeshir\", on the reverse. Ardashir's son, Shapur I (\"r.\" 241–272), has much the same image but adds two attendants at the fire altar. On the coins of Hormizd I (also known as Ardashir II, \"r.\" 272–273), the emperor himself tends the fire with the help of an attendant. Bahram II (276–293) also appears himself, accompanied by what may be his queen and son. Narseh (\"r.\" 293–303) also attends the fire himself, this time alone. On the coins of Shapur III (\"r.\" 283–388), a divinity appears to be emerging from the fire. The shape of the fire altar in the coins of Yazdegerd II (\"r.\" 438–457) are similar to those in present-day fire temples. The legend introduced under Ardeshir yields to a mint mark and year of issue under Peroz (\"r.\" 457–484), a feature evident in all the coins of the remaining dynasty.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1886571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886571", "title": "Christian vegetarianism", "text": "Christian vegetarianism\n\nChristian vegetarianism is a Christian practice based on effecting the compassionate teachings of Jesus, the twelve apostles, and the early church to all sentient or living beings through vegetarianism or veganism. Alternatively, Christians may be vegetarian for ethical, environmental, nutritional, or other spiritual reasons.\n\nVarious church founders have recommended vegetarianism, such as John Wesley the founder of the Methodist Churches, William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church and Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists. Cowherd, who founded the Bible Christian Church in 1809, helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847.\n\nWhile vegetarianism is not a common practice in current western Christian thought and culture, the concept and practice has scriptural and historical support. According to the Bible, in the beginning, before the Fall, human and nonhuman animals, who are beings who have or are an \"ānima\", Latin for \"soul\", were completely vegan, and \"it was very good\". According to some interpretations of the Bible, raw veganism was the original diet of humankind in the form given to Adam and Eve by God in Genesis 1:29, \"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food\".\n\nImmediately after the Flood, God permitted the eating of meat, but forbade consuming \"blood, which is life\". However, some maintain that God permitted the consumption of meat only \"temporarily\" because all plants had been destroyed as a result of the flood, despite the lack of any reference to this in Genesis itself. Christian vegetarians interpret that passage not as a free pass to kill for eating if the blood is supposedly excluded from alimentation, but as an invitation (rhetoric or not) to necrophagy. \"The biological fact is: no matter what you do you can never remove all the blood from the flesh of a slaughtered animal.\"\n\nOne of the Ten Commandments says categorically, \"Thou shalt not kill\" — without specifying that some animals are allowed to be killed. Isaiah states \"He that killeth an ox [is as if] he slew a man.\" However, specific sacrifices of animals for the atonement of sin were also mandated, by Moses, what may be inconsistent with the principle of grace or that one cannot force God to forgive. When the Moabite king Mesha offered in a holocaust \"his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead\" in order that his army were spared in a war against Israel, the Israelites felt so outraged, that they decided to stop the battle \"and returned to their own land\".\n\nCenturies after Noah, records God giving the Israelites rules about what types of meat may be eaten, suggesting that certain meats were acceptable. The Old Testament says that God commanded the Israelites to eat meat on some occasions. During the Exodus out of Egypt and the first Passover, God commanded that all of the Israelites to slaughter a Passover lamb and eat it. This was to be a lasting tradition. The sacrifices (including the Paschal Lamb), however, are considered as types of the Lamb of God, an \"innocent\" victim, tortured and murdered.\n\nThe Israelites tired of manna, a food of which \"The Rabbis of the Talmud held that […] had whatever taste and flavor the eater desired at the time of eating\" and which probably was not an animal product and was offered to them by God during The Exodus. They preferred meat, and were condemned for it. Because of that lust, the place where the incident happened became known as \"Kibroth Hattaavah\".\n\nA donkey temporarily given the ability to speak showed Balaam more than signs of sentience.\n\nSome Christians believe that the \"Bible\" explains that, in the future, human and nonhuman animals will return to veganism, regarded by animal abolitionists as the moral baseline of : \n\nSome people believe that the Book of Daniel also specifically promotes veganism as empowering. Daniel specifically refuses the king's \"meat\" (\"paṯbaḡ\", Strong's #5698) and instead requests vegetables (\"zērōʿîm\", Strong's #2235). However, current common theology argues that in this instance Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah are rejecting food that is considered to be unholy by their faith (eating food that had been sacrificed to pagan gods), and not meat \"per se\", despite that \"at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat\".\n\nPhilo says that the Essenes, “being more scrupulous than any in the worship of God […] do not sacrifice animals […], but hold it right to dedicate their own hearts as a worthy offering”. They maintained that the sacrifices \"polluted\" the Temple.\n\nAccording to , Jesus ate fish himself after his resurrection, what could be explained by the so-called \"synoptic principle\". According to , \"A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.\"\n\nLuke's Acts of the Apostles portrays a story where the Apostle Peter has a vision where God declares previously unclean meat as \"clean\" and orders Peter to \"kill and eat\". Christian vegetarians maintain that \"Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the dream might mean\". John Vujicic argues that \"In the sheet were also so called CLEAN animals. Peter could have at least selected some sheep or cattle and killed but he didn’t. Simply because he considered all flesh defiled and unclean. Peter was vegetarian as he himself states in Clementine Homilies. […] Peter would not kill any of them because he knew that this vision had another meaning […]. Any animal which is slaughtered is defiled and its meat defiles. Peter explains this in Clementine Homilies.\" He recognized its meaning when the gentile Cornelius invited him to dinner. Peter realized that the dream was instructing him not to go out and eat meat, but to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. The Jewish dietary laws should not prevent the spread of Christianity, and, at Cornelius' dinner, Peter related to his hosts, \"You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\"\n\nA number of Christian leaders, both ancient and modern, observe that vegetarianism was and is a sincere part of Christian faith. The Reverend Andrew Linzey has supported the historical view that Jesus was a vegetarian. In his book, \"The Lost Religion of Jesus\", author Keith Akers presents evidence that the historical Jesus was vegetarian.\n\nIn the Acts of the Apostles, the author recounts that the Jerusalem Council recommended (at least for Gentile Christians) abstention \"from things strangled, and from blood\". Vegetarianism appears to have been a point of contention within early Christian circles. Within the Bible's New Testament, the Apostle Paul appears to ridicule vegetarians, arguing that people of \"weak faith\" \"eat only vegetables\", although he also warns believers to \"stop passing judgment on one another\" when it comes to food in verse 13 and \"[It is] good neither to eat flesh\" in verse 21. Paul also said, \"The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They […] order […] to abstain from certain foods\". According to the Christian Vegetarian Association, Paul was not referring to vegetarianism, which was not an issue in those times, but to the practice of not eating meat from the meat market because of fear that (like the above issue involving Daniel) it were sacrificed to an idol. \"Wherefore, if meat [\"brōma\", Strong's #1033, 'anything used as food'] make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.\"\n\nIn the 4th Century some Jewish Christian groups maintained that Jesus was himself a vegetarian. Epiphanius quotes the Gospel of the Ebionites where Jesus has a confrontation with the high priest. Jesus chastises the leadership saying, \"I am come to end the sacrifices and feasts of blood; and if ye cease not offering and eating of flesh and blood, the wrath of God shall not cease from you; even as it came to your fathers in the wilderness, who lusted for flesh, and did sat to their content, and were filled with rottenness, and the plague consumed them.\"\n\nAccording to Lightfoot, \"the Christianized Essennes […] condemned the slaughter of victims on grounds very different from those alleged in the Epistle of Hebrews, not because they have been superseded by the Atonement, but because they are in their very nature repulsive to God; not because they have ceased to be right, but because they never were right from the beginning\".\n\nOther early Christian historical documents observe that many influential Christians during the formative centuries of Christianity were vegetarian, though certainly not all. The \"Clementine homilies\", a second-century work purportedly based on the teachings of the Apostle Peter, states, \"The unnatural eating of flesh meats is as polluting as the heathen worship of devils, with its sacrifices and its impure feasts, through participation in it a man becomes a fellow eater with devils.\"\n\nAlthough early Christian vegetarianism appears to have been downplayed in favor of more \"modern\" Christian culture, the practice of vegetarianism appears to have been very widespread in early Christianity, both in the leadership and among the laity. Origen's work \"Contra Celsum\" quotes Celsus commenting vegetarian practices among Christians he had contact with. Although not vegetarian himself and vehemently against the idea that Christians must be vegetarians, Augustine nevertheless wrote that those Christians who \"abstain both from flesh and from wine\" are \"without number\".\n\nThe Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance. Cowherd emphasized that vegetarianism was good for health, whilst eating meat was unnatural and likely to cause aggression. Later he is reputed to have said \"If God had meant us to eat meat, then it would have come to us in edible form [as is the ripened fruit].\"\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventists present a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects abstinence from pork, shellfish and other foods proscribed as \"unclean\" in Leviticus. A number of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, including Joseph Bates and Ellen White adopted a vegetarian diet during the nineteenth century, and Ellen White reportedly received visions regarding the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. More recently, members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in California have been involved in research into longevity due to their healthy lifestyle, which includes maintaining a vegetarian diet. This research has been included within a \"National Geographic\" article. Another denomination with common origin, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement recommends vegetarianism as a part of fellowship, with many of its members being practicing vegans as well. Typically, however, these sabbatarian pro-vegetarian Christian fellowships do not \"require vegetarianism as a test of fellowship.\"\n\nThe Word of Wisdom is a dietary law given to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement (also known as Mormonism), which states that \"flesh also of beasts and of fowls of the air... are to be used sparingly,\" and that \"it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\". Unlike injunctions against tobacco and alcohol, compliance with this part of the Doctrine and Covenants has never been made mandatory by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination. Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat, but since Joseph F. Smith became church president in 1901, emphasis on refraining from meat has largely been dropped. An official church publication states, \"[m]odern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season\". As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated \"the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.\" Of note is that the LDS Church owns and operates Deseret Ranches in central Florida, which is one of the largest cow-calf operations in the United States.\n\nSome members of the Religious Society of Friends (also known as Quakers) practice vegetarianism or veganism as a reflection of the Peace Testimony, extending non-violence towards animals. Historically, the early vegetarian movement had many Quaker promoters. Some Ranter sects back in the mid-17th century are known to have been vegetarian as well.\n\nRoman Catholic monastic orders such as the Carthusians and Cistercians follow a strict vegetarian diet. Carmelites and others following the Rule of St. Albert also maintain a vegetarian diet, although the old and sick are permitted to eat meat according to this rule of life. St. Francis of Paola became a vegan, and veganism was a rule of the order he founded, the Order of Minims. However, Pope John III declared an anathema against the Priscillian vegetarian priests at the First Council of Braga in Portugal. (Not necessarily against vegetarianism but because it was related to the Priscillian heresy). \n\nThe Liberal Catholic Movement traditionally had many people who were vegetarians and still have. \n\nChristian anarchists, such as Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy, and Théodore Monod, extend the Christian principles of compassion and nonviolence through following a vegetarian diet.\n\nSome Rastafaris abstain from all flesh whatsoever, asserting that to touch meat is to touch death, and is therefore a violation of the Nazirite vow.\n\nThe Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) is an international, non-denominational Christian vegetarian organization that promotes responsible stewardship of God's creation through plant-based eating. The CVA produced the 2006 film \"Honoring God’s Creation\".\n\nForest gardening can be viewed as a way to recreate the Garden of Eden. Forest gardening is a vegan organic food production and agroforestry system based on woodland ecosystems, incorporating fruit and nut trees, shrubs, herbs, vines and perennial vegetables. Robert Hart adapted forest gardening for temperate zones during the early 1960s with the intention of providing a healthy and therapeutic environment for himself and his brother Lacon.\n\nDuring Lent some Christian communities, such as Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, undertake partial fasting eating only one light meal per day. For strict Greek Orthodox Christians and Copts, all meals during this 40-day period are prepared without animal products and are essentially vegan. Unlike veganism however, abstaining from animal products during Lent is intended to be only temporary and not a permanent way of life.\n\nEastern Orthodox laity traditionally abstains from animal products on Wednesdays (because, according to Christian tradition, Judas betrayed Jesus on the Wednesday prior to the Crucifixion of Jesus) and Fridays (because Jesus is thought to have been crucified on the subsequent Friday), as well as during the four major fasting periods of the year: Great Lent, the Apostles' Fast, the Dormition Fast and the Nativity Fast. Catholic laity traditionally abstain from animal flesh on Fridays and through the Lenten season leading up to Easter (sometimes being required to do so by law, see fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church), some also, as a matter of private piety, observe Wednesday abstinence. \"Fish\" is not considered proper meat in any case (see pescetarianism, though the Eastern Orthodox allow fish only on days on which the fasting is lessened but meat still not allowed). For these practices, \"animal rights\" are no motivation and positive environmental or individual-health effects only a surplus benefit; the actual reason is to practice mortification and some marginal asceticism.\n\nOriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic monastics abstain from meat year-round, and many abstain from dairy and seafood as well. Through obedience to the Orthodox Church and its ascetic practices, the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the \"passions\", or the disposition to sin.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism rules concerning fasting go from full abstinence to meat on every Friday and Wednesday to only Fridays during Lent.\nIn the Eastern Churches of India such as the Indian Orthodox Church, Jacobite Church and Marthoma Church, the bishops and metrapolitans take the vow to remain vegetarian throughout their life.\n\n\n"}

Some Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some, but by no means all, Christians hold such pluralism to be logically impossible. Roman Catholicism believes that while it is the fullest and most complete revelation of God to Man, other Christian denominations have also received genuine revelation from God, although partial and incomplete.\n\nAlthough Calvinists believe God and the truth of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil ordinances of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those who wield that power). Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, as far as it is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.\n\nCalvinism is not pacifistic and Calvinists have been involved in religious wars, notably the French Wars of Religion and the English Civil War. Some of the first parts of modern Europe to practice religious tolerance had Calvinistic populations, notably the Netherlands.\n\nIn recent years, some Christian groups have become more open to religious pluralism; this has led to many cases of reconciliation between Christians and people of other faiths. The liberalization of many Seminaries and theological institutions, particularly in regards to the rejection of the notion that the Bible is an infallible document, has led to a much more human-centered and secular movement within Mainline Christian denominations, particularly in the United States. Some Mainline churches no longer hold to exclusivist views on salvation.\n\nIn recent years there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jewish people. Many modern day Christians, including many Catholics and some liberal Protestants, have developed a view of the New Testament as an extended covenant; they believe that Jews are still in a valid relationship with God, and that Jews can avoid damnation and earn a heavenly reward. For these Christians, the New Testament extended God's original covenant to cover non-Jews. The article Christian–Jewish reconciliation deals with this issue in detail.\n\nMultiple smaller Christian groups in the US and Canada have come into being over the last 40 years, such as \"Christians for Israel\". Their website says that they exist in order to \"expand Christian-Jewish dialogue in the broadest sense in order to improve the relationship between Christians and Jews, but also between Church and Synagogue, emphasizing Christian repentance, the purging of anti-Jewish preliminary attitudes and the false 'Replacement' theology rampant throughout Christian teachings.\"\n\nA number of large Christian groups, including the Catholic Church and several large Protestant churches, have publicly declared that they will no longer proselytize Jews.\n\nOther Modern Christian views, including some conservative Protestants, reject the idea of the New Testament as an extended covenant, and retain the classical Christian view as described earlier.\n\nFor the Catholic Church, there has been a move at reconciliation not only with Judaism, but also Islam. The Second Vatican Council states that salvation includes others who acknowledge the same creator, and explicitly lists Muslims among those (using the term Mohammedans, which was the word commonly used among non-Muslims at the time). The official Catholic position is therefore that Jews, Muslims and Christians (including churches outside of Rome's authority) all acknowledge the same God, though Jews and Muslims have not yet received the gospel while other churches are generally considered deviant to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nThe most prominent event in the way of dialogue between religions has arguably been the 1986 Peace Prayer in Assisi to which Pope John Paul II, against considerable resistance also from within the Roman Catholic church, invited representatives of all world religions. John Paul II’s remarks regarding Christian denominations were found in his Ut unum sint address. This initiative was taken up by the Community of Sant'Egidio, who, with the support of John Paul II, organized yearly peace meetings of religious representatives. These meetings, consisting of round tables on different issues and of a common time of prayer has done much to further understanding and friendship between religious leaders and to further concrete peace initiatives. In order to avoid the reproaches of syncretism that were leveled at the 1986 Assisi meeting where the representatives of all religions held one common prayer, the follow-up meetings saw the representatives of the different religions pray in different places according to their respective traditions.\n\nThe question of whether traditional Chinese ancestor veneration, consists of worshipping a God or veneration of a saint was important to the Roman Catholic church during the Chinese Rites controversy of the early 18th century. This dispute was between the Dominicans who argued that Confucianism and Chinese folk religion was worship, and therefore incompatible with Catholicism, and the Jesuit who argued the reverse. The pope ultimately ruled in favor of the Dominicans, a decision which greatly reduced the role of Catholic missionaries in China. However, this decision was partially reversed by Pope Pius XII in 1939; after this, Chinese customs were no longer considered superstition or idolatry, but a way of honoring esteemed relatives (not entirely dissimilar to the Catholic practice of praying for the dead).\n\nSikhs also believe in one God and follow the Ten Sikh Gurus, unlike Christians who believe in one Almighty God made up of three distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Known as the Trinity). However, there is no heaven or hell in the Sikh religion.\n\nHistorically, the relationship between Christianity and Judaism has been strained. In the past, Christians were often taught that \"the Jews\" killed Christ, for which \"murder\" they bear a collective guilt (an interpretation which most major denominations now reject). Jews meanwhile have tended to associate Christianity with various pogroms, or in better times, with the dangers of assimilation. Anti-Semitism has a long history in Christianity (see Christianity and anti-Semitism), and indeed is far from dead (for example, in contemporary Russia). However, since the Holocaust, much dialogue aimed at Christian–Jewish reconciliation has taken place, and relations have greatly improved. Today, many conservative evangelicals support Christian Zionism, much to the irritation of Arab Christians, based partly on the Millennialist belief that the modern state of Israel represents the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.\n\nThe phenomenon of Messianic Judaism has become something of an irritant to Jewish / Christian relations. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with the recognition of Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups, who dismiss Messianic Judaism as little more than Christianity with Jewish undertones.\n\nThe Jewish conception of the messiah (משיח \"mashiach\" in Hebrew) holds certain similarities to that of Christians, yet there are substantial differences. According to Jews, the Hebrew Scriptures contain a small number of prophecies concerning a future descendant of King David, who will be anointed (Hebrew: moshiach) as the Jewish people's new leader and will establish the throne of David in Jerusalem forever. In the Jewish view, this fully human and mortal leader will rebuild the land of Israel and restore the Davidic Kingdom. This subject is covered in the section on Jewish eschatology. Some Christians have a different understanding of the term \"messiah\", and believe that Jesus is the messiah referred to in the Old Testament prophecies; that the kingdom in these prophecies was to be a heavenly kingdom, not an earthly one; and that Jesus' words and actions in the New Testament provide evidence of his identity as messiah and that the remainder of messianic prophecy will be fulfilled in the Second Coming. Other Christians acknowledge the Jewish definition of \"messiah\", and hold that Jesus fulfills this, being 'fully man' (in addition to being 'fully God'), and believe that the Second Coming will establish the Kingdom of God on earth, where Jesus, as messiah and descendant from David, will reign from Jerusalem.\n\nIslam shares a number of beliefs with Christianity. They share similar views on judgment, heaven, hell, spirits, angels, and a future resurrection. Jesus is acknowledged and respected by Muslims as a great prophet. However, while Islam relegates Jesus to a lesser status than God — \"in the company of those nearest to God\" in the Qur'an, mainstream (Trinitarian) Christianity teaches without question that Jesus is God the Son, one of the three Hypostases (common English: persons) of Christianity's Trinity, divinely co-equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe religions both share a belief in the virgin birth of Jesus, his miracles and healings, and that he ascended bodily into heaven. However, Jesus is not accepted as the son by Muslims, who strictly maintain that he was a human being who was loved by God and exalted by God to ranks of the most righteous. They believe in God as a single entity, not as the Trinity accepted by the vast majority of Christians. Neither do Muslims accept Jesus' crucifixion. Since Muslims believe only in the worship of a strictly monotheistic God who never assumed human flesh, they do not accept the use of icons, and see this as shirk (idolatry). Muslim influence played a part in the initiation of iconoclasm and their conquests caused the iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire. For the same reason, they do not worship or pray to Muhammad, Jesus, or any other prophets; only to God.\n\nAdherents of Islam have historically referred to themselves, Jews, and Christians (among others) as People of the Book since they all base their religion on books that are considered to have a divine origin. Christians however neither recognize the Qur'an as a genuine book of divine revelation, nor agree with its assessment of Jesus as a mere prophet, on par with Muhammad, nor for that matter accept that Muhammad was a genuine prophet.\n\nMuslims, for their part, believe that parts of the Gospels, Torah and Jewish prophetic books have been forgotten, misinterpreted, or distorted by their followers. Based on that perspective, Muslims view the Qur'an as correcting the errors of Christianity. For example, Muslims reject belief in the Trinity, or any other expression of the divinity of Jesus, as incompatible with monotheism.\n\nNot surprisingly, the two faiths have often experienced controversy and conflict (an example being the Crusades). At the same time, much fruitful dialogue has occurred as well. The writings of Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas frequently cite those of the Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, as well as Muslim thinker Averroes ('Ibn-Rushd).\n\nOn May 6, 2001 Pope John Paul II, the first pope to pray in a mosque, delivered an address at Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, saying: \"It is important that Muslims and Christians continue to explore philosophical and theological questions together, in order to come to a more objective and comprehensive knowledge of each other's religious beliefs. Better mutual understanding will surely lead, at the practical level, to a new way of presenting our two religions not in opposition, as has happened too often in the past, but in partnership for the good of the human family.\" This Mosque of Damascus is famous for containing the head of John the Baptist.\n\nBuddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit \"svarga\") and hell (\"Naraka\") are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed.\n\nThere also exist significant similarities in Christian and Hindu theology, most notably in that both religions present a trinitarian view of God. The Holy Trinity of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the Trimurti of Hinduism, whose members -- Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—are seen as the three principal manifestations of Brahman, or Godhead.\n\nChristian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. On one hand, Hinduism's natural tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers, while others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers. (See also: Pierre Johanns, Abhishiktananda, Bede Griffiths, Dalit theology.)\n\nThe Christian Ashram Movement, a movement within Christianity in India, embraces Vedanta and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu ashram model and Christian monasticism with the Hindu \"sannyasa\" tradition.\n\nIn the 19th century, some scholars began to perceive similarities between Buddhist and Christian practices, e.g. in 1878 T.W. Rhys Davids wrote that the earliest missionaries to Tibet observed that similarities have been seen since the first known contact. In 1880 Ernest De Bunsen made similar observations in that with the exception of the death of Jesus on the cross, and of the Christian doctrine of atonement, the most ancient Buddhist records had similarities with the Christian traditions.\n\nBuddhism and Protestantism came into political conflict in 19th century Sri Lanka and in Tibet c. 1904 (the Francis Younghusband Expedition). Various events have cooperated to introduce various strains of Buddhist theology and meditation to several generations of Western spiritual seekers (including some Catholic religious). Relations are generally good between both religions, except perhaps in South Korea where Christians have damaged Buddhist temples and engaged in other forms of Christian extremism. The Russian republic of Kalmykia recognizes both Tibetan/Lamaist Buddhism and Russian Orthodoxy as its official religions.\n\nMany scholars believe the eschatology of Judaism and possibly the idea of monotheism originated in Zoroastrianism, and may have been transferred to Judaism during the Babylonian captivity, thus eventually influencing Christian theology. Bible scholar P.R. Ackroyd states: \"the whole eschatological scheme, however, of the Last Judgment, rewards and punishments, etc., within which immortality is achieved, is manifestly Zoroastrian in origin and inspiration.\" However, the theory is questioned by other mainstream historians and scholars. \"The Oxford History of the Biblical World\" states \"There is little if any effect of Zoroastrian elements on Judaism in the Persian period.\". Nevertheless, scholars such as Soloman Nigosian contend, in regarding the similar ideas of Zoroaster and later Jewish writers, that \"the ideas were indigenous to Iran...it is hardly conceivable that some of the characteristic ideas and practices in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam came into being without Zoroastrian influence.\" The new faith (Zoroastrianism) emerged in larger Persian empires. \" Zoroastrianism reflected the cosmopolitan society of the empires\". During this time Zoroastrianism profoundly effected the beliefs and values of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (\"Traditions & Encounters: A brief global History\", Jerry H. Bentley. pg. 93). It is also possible that Zoroastrianism and later Jewish theology came from a common source.\n\n\"For more on this theory, see Jewish history, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism.\"\n\nIn the Younger Avesta, three divinities of the Zoroastrian pantheon are repeatedly identified as ahuric, meaning that each, as Ahura, act together in both representing and protecting Asha, or the divine truth governing the universe. These three are Ahura Mazda, Mithra and Burz, and hence known as the \"Ahuric triad.\" Similarities with the Christian Trinity can be seen between Ahura Mazda and God the Father, Mithra and Christ the Logos, as well as between Burz and the Holy Spirit, both of which are associated symbolically with water. Both Zoroastrianism and Christianity consider themselves to be monotheistic, but like all other monotheisms they have highlighted certain aspects or energies of the divine to emphasize, and these are not meant to be interpreted as separate divinities. In both religions there are guardian angels, or fravashi, which are considered to be created beings and are distinct from the Energies of God or divine emanations. The Zoroastrian term yazata, however, has variously been interpreted as meaning emanations or \"sparks\" of the divine, or as being roughly synonymous with the term \"angels.\" There have been various theories on the possible relationship between these aspects of Zoroastrianism and ideas of divine emanation in esoteric Christianity, Jewish Kabbalah, Islamic mysticism (Sufism), and other religious systems, such as Gnosticism, Yazidism, and the Druze, among others.\n\nThere are many parallels between Mithraism, the religion of Sol Invictus, and Christianity. Aurelian is believed to have established the \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\" (Day of the Birth of Sol Invictus) as an annual festival held on the day when the sun's daily declination visibly starts rising again after the winter solstice, namely on December 25; the birth of the central figure was thus celebrated on the day which Christians later used to celebrate Jesus' birth (having always celebrated this at Epiphany). Other similarities include the stories of Christ and Mithra as children being visited by shepherds, the trinity, and the immortal soul. Sunday itself was imposed as the official day of rest by Constantine, who referred to it as the \"Day of the venerable Sun\". (Although Christians worshiped on Sunday from at least 150 years before Constantine)\n\nThe earliest attestation of Mithraism is Plutarch's record of it being practised in 68BC by Cilician pirates, the first mithraists. Tertullian, a Christian writer who lived between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, admitted there was a strong similarity between the practises of the two faiths:\n\nJustin Martyr, an earlier 2nd century Church Father, agreed that the similarities existed, claiming that Mithraism had copied the Eucharist. Justin argued that the devil had invented Mithraism to mock Christianity. Christian apologist Ronald H. Nash stated:\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith believes that there is one God who sends divine messengers to guide humanity throughout time, which is called Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)—and is different from the Christian belief of Progressive revelation (Christian). They believe in the divine knowledge and essence of Jesus, among other messengers such as Muhammad, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, and others. Interpretations vary, but the Bahá'í Faith is sometimes considered an Abrahamic faith. The followers of the Bahá'í Faith believe in God, as do Christians, and recognize Jesus' teachings, but they have different views of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus. The Bahá'í view of prophets is that although they have both human and divine characteristics, they are not themselves God, but rather \"divine manifestations.\" They also see the Trinity as symbolic where Jesus and the Holy Spirit are polished mirrors that reflect the pure light from God. Although Bahá'ís affirm the Bible as sacred scripture, they do not consider the Bible to be wholly authentic as Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, affirmed that \"The Bible is not wholly authentic, and in this respect not to be compared with the Qur’án, and should be wholly subordinated to the authentic Sayings of Bahá’u’lláh.\"\n\nBahá'ís share some views with Christianity regarding moral and immoral behavior. Bahá'ís condemn polygamy, premarital sex, and homosexual acts while treating everyone, including homosexuals, with love, respect, and dignity. (See Homosexuality and Bahá'í Faith.)\n\nHubbard described Scientology as \"the Western Anglicized continuance of many earlier forms of wisdom.\" Hubbard includes the teachings of Jesus among belief systems cited as these \"earlier forms of wisdom\". Jesus is recognized in Scientology as part of its \"religious heritage\", though \"is seen as only one of many good teachers\".\n\nIn the 2008 book \"Vintage Jesus: Timeless Answers to Timely Questions\", authors Mark Driscoll and Gerry Breshears write: \"According to Scientology, Jesus is an \"implant\" forced upon a Thetan about a million years ago\", and Jack Huberman writes in \"101 People Who Are Really Screwing America\" that in Scientology Jesus is seen as having been \"implanted in humanity's collective memory\", by the character Xenu from Scientology space opera.\n\nThe spread of Christianity has been international, in some cases entirely displacing the religions and altering the customs encountered among those people to whom it has come. This centuries-long process has been met with violent opposition at times, and likewise the spread of Christianity has in some cases been carried out with martial force. The relationship of Christianity to other faiths is encumbered to some extent by this history, with modern Christians, particularly in the West, expressing embarrassment over the violence in Christianity's past.\n\nConverting adherents of other religions is widely accepted within Christianity. Many Christian organizations believe that they have a duty to make converts among every people. In recent years, ecumenism and dialogue between different religions has been endorsed by many official representatives of the Christian churches, as a way of effecting reconciliation between Christian people and people of other faiths, leading to many cases of reconciliation. In some cases, this endorsement is accompanied by a complete disavowal of all proselytizing efforts under the banner of religious pluralism.\n\nThis is specially marked by the inauguration, or installation, of Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu from Uganda, on November 29, 2005. Dr Sentamu is the first black African archbishop of the Church of England. He is also the first archbishop to beat bongo drums in the cathedral at his own inauguration. The newspaper Guardian, which dedicated its double middle page of the following day to a full picture of the grinning archbishop in full apparel at the porch of the cathedral, says that:\n\"Dr Sentamu's sermon was a stern lecture to the Church of England to grow out of being a 'judgmental and moralising' congregation of 'pew-fillers, sermon-taters, Bible readers, even born-again believers and Spirit-filled charismatics' and go out to make friends in the world. 'We have lost the joy and power that makes real disciples and we've become consumers of religion, not disciples of Jesus-Christ', he said. 'Christians, go and make friends among Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, agnostics, atheists, not for the purpose of converting them to your beliefs but for friendship, understanding, listening, hearing.' His remarks were greeted with applause, not with silence as the order of the service instructed.\"\n\nA special case is the issue of Christian–Jewish reconciliation, in which significant reconciliation has been reached.\n\nChristian converts have often carried some of their previous customs to their new faith. This on occasion has led to syncretisms, that are often not accepted by mainstream Christians:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29998017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29998017", "title": "Criticism of Twelver Shia Islam", "text": "Criticism of Twelver Shia Islam\n\nCriticism of Twelver Shia Islam dates from the initial rift between the two primary denominations of Islam, the Sunni and the Shia. The question of succession to Muhammad, the nature of the Imamate, the status of the twelfth Shia Imam, and other areas in which Shia Islam differ from Sunni Islam have been criticized by Sunni scholars, even though there is no disagreement between the two regarding the centrality of the Quran, Muhammad, and many other doctrinal, theological and ritual matters. Shiite commentators such as Musa al-Musawi and Ali Shariati have themselves, in their attempts to reform the faith, criticized practices and beliefs which have become prevalent in the Shiite community.\nSunnis are particularly critical of the \"love of visual imagery evident in Shia popular devotionalism\" and regularly cite this characteristic (often referred to as 'Shia iconography') as proof of Shia deviance or heresy.\n\nIn the tradition of Twelver Shia Islam, the twelfth and final Shia Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is also considered by Twelver Shia to be the prophesied redeemer of Islam known as the Mahdi, went into \"ghaybah\" (\"occultation\") in 873. However, this belief has long been criticized by Sunni scholars who “often speculate that the twelfth Imam never existed, but was a myth designed to keep the Shia cause alive.” Meanwhile, western scholars have also cast doubt upon the existence of an occulted Imam. According to Robert Gleave, the occultation of the 12th Imam “became subsequent orthodox doctrine” after none of the competing theories that sought to explain the succession to a childless 11th Imam “seemed satisfactory”. According to Bernard Lewis, the occultation and subsequent return of the Imam became a characteristic Shia doctrine following the “suppression of many risings and the disappearance of their leaders”; where the leader disappears and “his followers say that he is not dead; he has gone into concealment”. With each new leader “who disappeared and did not return”, this belief was “enriched” and became more detailed and “essential” as a “feature of Shia Islam.”\n\nHowever, according to Wilferd Madelung in Encyclopedia of Islam, the doctrine of the Occultation was well-documented by traditions of the Imams before the occultation of the Twelfth Imam whom the majority of the Imamiyya came to consider as the Mahdi after the death of the eleventh. As an example he mentions that \"the pattern was already set in regard to Muḥammad b. al-Ḥanafiyya, whose death was denied by the Kaysāniyya [q.v.]. They believed that he was hidden in the mountains of Raḍwā and would return to rule the world. Similar beliefs arose around Muḥammad b. al-Ḥanafiyya’s son Abū Hashim\" Moreover, Madelung names several Sunni scholars who have similar beliefs. In a Hadith upon whose authenticity Shiites and Sunnis agree, Muhammad had said, \"If there were to remain in the life of the world but one day, God would prolong that day until He sends in it a man from my community and my household. His name will be the same as my name. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny.\" However, the majority of Sunnis do not consider the son of eleventh Imam as the promised Mahdi. Shias claim the only possible occasion that the son of eleventh Imam is said to have made a public appearance was at the time of his death, then as a child the boy was seen no more. His birth, Shiite says, like the case of the prophet Moses, was concealed due to the difficulties of the time, and because of the belief that he was the promised Muhammad al-Mahdi, the caliphs of the time had decided definitely to put an end to the Imamate in Shiism once and for all.\n\nTwelvers of the Akhbari and Usuli branches have for centuries debated over the interpretation of religious texts and the responsibilities of Twelver scholars in the absence of the Hidden 12th Imam. This culminated during the latter half of the 18th century with the violent suppression of Akhbari’s, especially under the direction of Usuli scholar Muhammad Baqir Behbahani.\n\nOn the one hand, Akhbaris (nowadays a small minority) reject the use of reasoning in deriving religious laws and verdicts. They believe the Qur'an and Sunnah (traditions of Muhammad and the Imams) provide all the laws necessary for their followers, and that reasoning is open to errors from imperfect scholars in the absence of an infallible Imam. They also criticise what they see as the transgressions of Twelver scholars, in gradually acquiring for themselves the powers and responsibilities of the Hidden Imam. Some Akhbaris have reported their belief this was, among others explanations, a result of the greed for power and wealth of Usuli scholars over laymen.\n\nOn the other hand, Usulis criticise the rigidity and narrow-mindedness of the Akhbaris and interpret the religious texts and take on much of the roles of the 12th Imam in accordance with the naturally evolving requirements of the Twelver Shia community.\n\nNikah mut‘ah (lit. \"pleasure marriage\"), is a fixed-term marriage practiced in Twelver Shia Islam. The duration of this type of marriage is fixed at its inception and is then automatically dissolved upon completion of its term. For this reason, nikah mut‘ah has been widely criticised as the religious cover and legalization of prostitution. The Christian missionary Thomas Patrick Hughes criticized Mut'ah as allowing the continuation of \"one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia.\" The majority of Sunni scholars and Western writers have called it prostitution. Julie Parshall, Zeyno Baran, and Elena Andreeva have written that this kind of marriage is prostitution. According to Shahla Haeri, in Iran the middle class itself considers it to be prostitution which has been given a religious cover by the fundamentalist authorities.\n\nNikah mut‘ah was practiced at the time of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, but was outlawed by the second Caliph, Umar ibn Khattab. Therefore, it is forbidden among Sunnis, but Shia consider Umar's account as legally and religiously invalid, as they argue it's legitimated by Quran 4:24. Shia have systematically contested the criticism that it is a cover for prostitution, and argue their rationales regarding the legal uniqueness of temporary marriage, which distinguishes Mut'ah ideologically from prostitution. Children born of temporary marriages are considered legitimate, and have equal status in law with their siblings born of permanent marriages, and do inherit from both parents. Women must observe a period of celibacy (idda) to allow for the identification of a child’s legitimate father, and a woman can only be married to one person at a time, be it temporary or permanent. Some Shia scholars also view Mut'ah as a means of eradicating prostitution from society.\n\n\"Taqiyya\" is a Shia practice under which it is permissible to hide one's faith in order to preserve life. The Shia have been criticised for this practice, an act deemed against the virtues of bravery and courage. Critics argue that the Twelvers have taken dissimulation far beyond life-threatening situations and have allowed its use in any scenario that is judged to benefit the continuation or propagation of the Twelver creed, as is emphasized by the \"celebrated\" reputed saying of the 6th Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, “[t]aqiyyah is my religion and the religion of my forefathers”; along with his other often quoted saying from Kitab al-Kafi: \"Nine tenths of faith is taqiyya.\" The practice is widely criticized by Sunni Muslims as indicative of the problems that they face when interacting with Shi'ites. According to Patricia Crone, Twelvers even extended the use of taqiyya “to protect their secret wisdom from exposure to the uncomprehending masses (including their own co-religionists), who might pervert it or denounce it as heretical.\" This view has been supported by Faysal Noor in his book \"Taqiyyah: The Other Face.\" \n\nLiving as a minority among the Sunni majority, however, made such a doctrine important to Shiite.Besides, the practice of concealing one's beliefs in dangerous circumstances originates in the Qur'an, which deems blameless those who disguise their beliefs in such cases. The practice of taqiyya in difficult circumstances is considered legitimate by Muslims of various sects. Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse refers to the case of 'Ammar b. Yasir, who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture. This practice was emphasized in Shia Islam whereby adherents may conceal their religion when they are under threat, persecution, or compulsion. Taqiyya was developed to protect Shia who were usually in minority and under pressure. In the Shia view, taqiyya is lawful in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby. Shia commentators have argued that taqiyya has precedents from the time of Muhammad, including the story of Ammar ibn Yasir, Such commentators argue that to not avoid certain death is illogical, and that dissimulation is permissible under various circumstances, such as to preserve life, to protect the chastity of women, or avoid destitution.\n\nOne allegation commonly leveled against the Twelvers is that they disrespect the Sunni Caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman who supported Mohammad as per Sunni belief during the early days of Islam but later turned enemies of Mohammad's household (Ahl al Bayt) as per Shia belief. Such Shia practices include the recited Dua Sanamain Quraish, which calls God's curse on the first two Sunni caliphs following Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr and Umar. Following the Safavid empire's conversion to the Shia sect of Islam, the first three caliphs, whom the Shia felt usurped Ali's right to be caliph, were cursed during Friday sermons.\n\nAs Sunni scholar Shaykh Saleh Al-Fawzan summarises the views of the Rafidis as compared to the Nasibis:\n\nDuring the 1960s, when an incipient ecumenical movement called for the unification of Shia and Sunni Islam, religious writers cited this \"disrespect\" for the Sahabah as a barrier to unification. In 1980s and 1990s, three major religious writers in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan again cited this argument, noting that until all \"profanity\" against the Sahabah was abandoned, dialogue with Shia scholars could not begin.\n\nIn 2010, Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa which bans any insult to the Sahabah (companions of Muhammad) as well as Muhammad's wives. The fatwa was issued in an effort to reconcile legal, social, and political disagreements between Sunni and Shia. The same fatwas were issued from Ali al-Sistani and other Shiite Marja'.\n\nHowever, other Shia scholars such as Shaykh Tusi, Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, Hossein Vahid Khorasani, Ruhollah Khomeini, Mohammad Jamil Hammoud al-Amili, Yasser Al-Habib, cursed and/or allow(ed) for disrespecting of the figures revered by the Sunnis, on the grounds that religious truth can't be compromised in the name of a false unity.\n\nTwelvers have been criticised for the practice of \"Tatbir\" (a form of self-flagellation) during Ashura, the observation of the martyrdom of Husayn traditionally accompanied by acts of ritual self-harm, which is often described as barbaric.\n\nThe practice is contested among Shi'a clerics: while traditionalist clerics allow believers to indulge in Tatbir, modernist clerics deem it not to be permissible because it is considered as self-damage and haram in Islam. Suffering and cutting the body with knives or chains was banned by the Shiite marja Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran and by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Khamenei issued a fatwa on 14 June 1994 banning this practice. He considered it irreligious and not suitable for good Muslims.\n\nAccording to Salafi Sunni scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, the celebration of Ashura is itself a blatant and primary example of the propensity of the Shia to indulge in \"Bid‘ah\" (religious innovation). They argue that the annual mourning occasion for Husayn (or any other individual) was never instituted or practiced by Muhammad—not even for his closest family members—and hence has no validity in Islam. Likewise, Ibn Rajab in his \"Kitab al-Iata'if\" argued against Ashura: \"Neither God..., nor His Messenger...have ordered that days on which prophets met with calamities and the day of their death be instituted as a day of mourning. How much more is this true for a person lesser than they?\"\n\nThree of the Twelve Imams, held by the Shia to be God's representatives on Earth, were less than ten years old when they assumed the undisputed and exclusive leadership of the Twelver Shia community. The 9th Imam, Muhammad al-Taqi, was 7 and a half years old at the time he assumed the Imamate; the 10th Imam, Ali al-Hadi, was between 6.5 and 8.5 years, and the 12th and final Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, was 4 and a half years old. Pakistani Islamic scholar and polemicist Ehsan Elahi Zaheer argues against the possibility of these personalities assuming the leadership of the Imamate at such young ages. Wilferd Madelung notes, however, that in Shia belief the knowledge of an Imam comes from \"inspiration, not acquisition\", and thus that even a young Imam is not considered unprepared, receiving revelation upon the death of his predecessor.\n\nShias further claim that ninth Imam the Shiite could not help asking from his father, the eighth Imam whether a child at that age could take on such a responsibility if something happened to Imam Ali al-Ridha; and al-Ridha used to illustrate the story of the Jesus who was even younger when he had become the prophet of his time however Sunnis state ascribing prophetic values to Shia Imams is another example of Shirk. John the Baptist was also a child when he was given wisdom. His reading and understanding of the scriptures, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time.\n\nShias claim that the Shiite account of al-Ma'mun's first meeting with Muhammad al-Jawad shows that wisdom is given to the Twelve Imams. After which the Caliph called together a great gathering in which all kinds of questions were asked from the young Imam, who astonished them all with his judgment and learning. Then al-Ma'mun declared formally that he gave him his daughter in marriage thereby.\n\nOther criticisms include the fact that Imamah is not mentioned in the Quran and the absence of such a crucial pillar in Shia Islam brings into question the validity of such claims. The Twelver Imamah doctrine is not shared by the majority of Sunni Muslims. The Syrian mufti Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 AH/1328 AD) composed a long refutation of it in his \"Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah\".\n\nTwelver Shi'ism has been criticized for exaggerating the holiness and infallibility of its Imams. Al-Kulayni in al-Kafi claims that the Imams know when they die and they do not die unless by their own choice, they know everything in the past and in the future and every time when God informs Muhammad, He orders him to inform Ali too. In \"Islamic Government\" Khomeini writes: \"Amongst the necessities in our doctrine is that our Imams have a dignity which no favored angel nor sent prophet could ever reach. As it has been narrated, the Imams were lights under the shadow of the throne before creating this world”. According to critics this purity is close to that of the prophet Muhammad, if not quite on the same level, and reflects excessiveness of view. Shia Islam has been criticised for magnifying the role of the Imams alongside, or even above, that of Muhammad.\n\nBoth Shiite and Sunni are in agreement over the two functions of prophet hood: to reveal God's law to men, and to guide men toward God. However, while Sunnis believe that both have come to an end with the death of Muhammad, Shiites believe that whereas legislation ended, the function of guiding and \"explaining divine law continued through the line of Imams.\" In Shiite theology, thus, God does not guide via authoritative texts (i.e. the Qur'an and Hadith) only but also guides through some specially equipped individuals known as Imams. \nThis constitution, Shiite says, is not limited to Islam, but each great messenger of God had two covenants, one concerning the next prophet who would eventually come, and one regarding the immediate successor, the Imam. For example, Sam was an imam for Noah, Ishmael was an Imam for Abraham, Aaron or Joshua for Moses, Simon, John and all the disciples for Jesus, and Ali and his descendants for Muhammad. It is narrated from the sixth imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq who had said \"where there to remain on the earth but two men, one of them would be the proof of God\".\nThe difference between apostles (Rasuls), the prophets(Nabi) and the Imams, thus, is described as follows:\nRasul sees and hears the angel in awakness and sleep. Nabi hears the angel and sees him while asleep, but does not see him while awake though hears the speech. Imam (muhaddith) is the one who hears the angel in awakness while does not see him in awakness or sleep.\nAccording to Shiite, the status and authority attributed to Imams will be senseless if they are prone to the same weakness found in general people. God must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people and to interpret the Quran.\nShias claim their sources state that the Ahl al-Bayt which are described pure of sin in the verse of purification are Ahl al-Kisa involved only specific members of the Prophet's family, and Shis claim this as an argument for their infallibility.\n\nAccording to some Twelver Shia scholars, Muhammad's daughter Fatimah received divine revelations after her father's death. During the 75 days that Fatimah had contact and communication with Gabriel, her husband Ali wrote down and recorded the revelations that were made to Fatimah which she dictated to him, to form the Book of Fatimah.\n\nSunnis argue that Fatimah never received divine revelations from Allah. According to the Shia fifth Imam, however, this kind of revelation is not the revelation of prophethood but rather like the inspiration (ilham) which came to Mary (mother of Jesus), the mother of Moses and to the bee.\n\nAccording to Twelver religious practice, Khums is an annual taxation on 20% of all profits. This wealth is collected and managed by Shia religious leaders. However, according to scholars such as Musa al-Musawi, the modern development of the practice of collecting khums exclusively by Shia religious leaders, especially the sayyid clerical elite, is simply a case of the usurpation of the place of the hidden Imam Mahdi and as a way of enriching the clerical class.\n\nKhums, according to Shiite, is divided into two portions. One portion went to the descendants of Muhammad, the other portion was divided equally and one part given to Imam and clergy, while the other part went to the orphaned and poor Muslims. Khums became a major source of income and financial independence of the clergy in Shia regions.\n\nShias justify the practice of khums by the fact that unlike Sunni religious leaders, non-Iranian Shia ones, aren't state sponsored and supported in their mission. For example, Turkish \"Presidency of Religious Affairs\" only trains and employs all of Turkey’s Sunni imams, as well as administers only Sunni worshiping places, despite the fact that Shias make up 25-30% of Turkish citizens and on non-voluntary basis participate in the financing of the Sunni mosques and the salaries of Sunni imams, while their places of worship, which are not officially recognized by the State, don't receive any funding.\n\nWhile Sunnis have 5 salat (prayer) sessions per day, Twelvers can opt to pray only 3 times per day by doubling their prayers on 2 occasions—combining the 2nd prayer with the 3rd and the 4th prayer with the 5th. However, Sunnis argue this very practice defeats the purpose of having 5 distinct prayers, since God ordered 5 prayers for 5 separate times of the day rather than 3 prayers for 3 separate times of the day and that Shia have misrepresented the ambiguity of the issue in the Quran for their own convenience. Twelvers extract this ruling from the two most important sources of jurisprudence which are the Quran and the Sunnah of the Messenger Muhammad who was praying this way, as it is also reported by Sunni sources, thus they believe this backs their claims accepted within a Sunni point of view. It is even reported from the hadith that the Messenger did this so that \"no one among his Ummah should be put to [unnecessary] hardship\" however this can also be interpreted for people in long journey or ill health, Shias believe this is enough to reject any accusation of not basing their actions from Quran and Traditions. \nHowever many Hadiths exist which support the practice of 5 prayers per day.\n\nTwelvers reject predestination. This has led to Sunni criticism of Twelvers, along with their associated belief in Bada' (change in God's will), as being deniers of God's complete sovereignty and as being imitators of the Mu'tazila school of Islamic theology.\n\nTo show that there is no contradiction between being predestined, and free will, Shiite states that matters relating to the human destiny is of two kinds: definite and indefinite; to explain the definitive one, Shiite argues that God has definite power over the whole of existence, however, whenever He wills, He can replace a given destiny with another one; and that is what is called indefinite destiny. some of these changes of destiny, thus, are brought about by man himself, who can through his free will, his decisions, and his way of life—lay the groundwork for a change in his destiny as been pointed out in the verses: \"Truly, God will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change Their state themselves.\" Both types of destinies, however, are contained within God's foreknowledge, Shiite argues, so that there could be no sort of change (Bada)concerning His knowledge. So the first type of destiny does not mean a limitation of God’s power; since God, in contrast to the belief of Jews who says \"the hand of God is tied’\" asserts: \"Nay, His hands are spread out wide ...\". So God has the power to change everything he wills and God's creativity is continuous. Accordingly, as Sobhani puts it, \"all groups in Islam regard \"bada\" as a tenet of the faith, even if not all actually use the term.\"\n\nTwelvers are often criticised by Sunnis for believing that the Quran was altered by the Sahaba (companions of Muhammad). Groups such as the Deobandis accuse Twelvers of believing that the complete version of the original Quran is in the possession of their 12th Imam. Twelvers are also accused of believing that the present Quran is omitted of the verses which support the Imamate of Ali because Caliph Uthman removed them during the Qurans compilation—noting the incompatibility of the belief that the codification and propagation of the Quran was truthfully undertaken by the Sahaba, who, in Shi'a tradition, represent the earliest people to take the Caliphate from its rightful claimants and to have corrupted the religion of Islam. As a result, such Sunni groups reject the Shia defense that they believe in the same Quran as Sunnis, accusing Shiites of lying in line with their practice of taqiyya so as not to expose themselves to the certain Sunni backlash.\n\nMost of Shiites nowadays believe that nothing have been omitted or added to the Quran, however, traces of earlier views can be find in some Hadith books like Bihar al-Anwar. The contemporary Shiite scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei states that even if The Book of Ali (a copy of Quran written by Ali containing Ali's commentary, which sometimes is called the Book of Ali) incorporated additions that are not part of the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.\n\nTwelvers have been accused of raising Karbala to holiness and prominence—which in itself is \"frowned upon by Sunnis\"—above even Makka, Medina and Jerusalem. This belief is exemplified by the attribution of the title \"Karbala-i\" for one who has performed pilgrimage there (just as one who makes the Hajj is titled Hajji), its annual attraction of more pilgrims for Ashura and Arba'een than the Hajj (seen as \"a counterweight and a challenge to the annual haj taking place in Mecca\"), prostrating during salat on turbah commonly made from the clay of Karbala and to numerous hadith attributed to the Imams which are interpreted by critics as placing the land of Karbala above the Kaaba. Sunni criticism has recently extended to a proposal by former Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki to even make Karbala the Qibla (direction of prayer).\n\nIran, the Twelver Shia bastion, is accused of the persecution of its Sunni minority and the historical persecution of Sunnis since at least Safavid times, e.g. there are no Sunni mosques in any of Iran’s large cities. It is also accused of supporting the suppression of Sunnis in such countries as Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, both directly and through the militias it funds, such as Hezbollah and the private militias in Iraq. Another common target of persecution by the Iranian Twelver religious establishment is the Bahá'í community.\n\nHowever, Twelvers have themselves often been victims of Anti-Shia violence.\n\n"}
{"id": "13680492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13680492", "title": "Discourses of Epictetus", "text": "Discourses of Epictetus\n\nThe Discourses of Epictetus (, \"Epiktētou diatribai\") are a series of informal lectures by the Stoic philosopher Epictetus written down by his pupil Arrian around 108 AD. Four books out of an original eight are still extant. The philosophy of Epictetus is intensely practical. He directs his students to focus attention on their opinions, anxieties, passions and desires, so that \"they may never fail to get what they desire, nor fall into what they avoid.\" True education lies in learning to distinguish what is our own from what does not belong to us, and in learning to correctly assent or dissent to external impressions. The purpose of his teaching was to make people free and happy.\n\nThe \"Discourses\" have been influential since they were written. They are referred to and quoted by Marcus Aurelius. Since the 16th-century they have been translated into multiple languages and reprinted many times.\n\nThe books did not have a formal title in ancient times. Although Simplicius called them \"Diatribai\" (Διατριβαί, Discourses), other writers gave them titles such as \"Dialexis\" (Διαλέξεις, Talks), \"Apomnêmoneumata\" (Ἀπομνημονεύματα, Records), and \"Homiliai\" (Ὁμιλίαι, Conversations). The modern name comes from the titles given in the earliest medieval manuscript: \"Arrian's \"Diatribai\" of Epictetus\" (). The Greek word \"Diatribai\" literally means \"informal talks\".\n\nAs to the date, it is generally agreed that the \"Discourses\" were composed sometime in the years around 108 AD. Epictetus himself refers to the coins of Trajan, which shows he was teaching during that reign. Arrian was suffect consul in around 130, and since forty-two was the standard age for that position, he would have been at the right age of around twenty in 108. Furthermore the \"commissioner\" of the \"free cities\" to whom \"Discourse\" iii. 7 is addressed is thought to be the same man Pliny the Younger addresses his \"Letter\" viii. 24—a letter which has been dated to around 108.\n\nThere were originally eight books, but only four now remain in their entirety, along with a few fragments of the others. In a preface attached to the Discourses, Arrian explains how he came to write them:\nThe \"Discourses\" purport to be the actual words of Epictetus. They are written in Koine Greek unlike the Attic Greek Arrian uses in his own compositions. The differences in style are very marked, and they portray a vivid and separate personality. The precise method Arrian used to write the \"Discourses\" has long been a matter of vigorous debate. Extreme positions have been held ranging from the view that they are largely Arrian's own compositions to the view that Epictetus actually wrote them himself. The mainstream opinion is that the \"Discourses\" report the actual words of Epictetus, even if they cannot be a pure \"verbatim\" record. A. A. Long writes:\nThe \"Discourses\" are set in Epictetus' own classroom in Nicopolis and they show him conversing with visitors, and reproving, exhorting, and encouraging his pupils. These pupils appear to have been young men like Arrian, of high social position and contemplating entering the public service. The \"Discourses\" are neither formal lectures nor are they part of the curriculum proper. The regular classes involved reading and interpreting characteristic portions of Stoic philosophical works, which, as well as ethics, must have included instruction in the logic and physics which were part of the Stoic system. The \"Discourses\" instead record conversations which followed the formal instruction. They dwell on points which Epictetus regarded as of special importance, and which gave him an opportunity for friendly discourse with his pupils and to discuss their personal affairs. They are not, therefore, a formal presentation of Stoic philosophy. Instead the \"Discourses\" are intensely practical. They are concerned with the conscious moral problem of right living, and how life is to be carried out well.\n\nEpictetus divides philosophy into three fields of training, with especial application to ethics. The three fields, according to Epictetus, are, (1) desire (ὄρεξις); (2) choice (ὁρμή); (3) assent (συγκατάθεσις):\n\nThe first and most essential practice is directed towards our passions and desires, which are themselves only types of impression, and as such they press and compel us. A continued practice is thus required to oppose them. To this first practice must be added a second, which is directed towards that which is appropriate (duty), and a third, the object of which is certainty and truth; but the latter must not pretend to supplant the former. Avoidance of the bad, desire for the good, direction towards the appropriate, and the ability to assent or dissent, this is the mark of the philosopher.\n\nScholars disagree on whether these three fields relate to the traditional Stoic division of philosophy into Logic, Physics, and Ethics. The third field unambiguously refers to logic since it concerns valid reasoning and certainty in judgment. The second field relates to ethics, and the first field, on desires and aversions, appears to be preliminary to ethics. However Pierre Hadot has argued that this first field relates to physics since for the Stoics the study of human nature was part of the wider subject of the nature of things.\n\nTrue education lies in learning to distinguish what is our own from what does not belong to us. But there is only one thing which is fully our own,—that is, our will or choice (prohairesis). The use which we make of the external impressions is our one chief concern, and upon the right kind of use depends exclusively our happiness.\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for the ideas that present themselves to our consciousness, we are absolutely responsible for the way in which we use them. In the realm of judgement the truth or falsity of the external impression is to be decided. Here our concern is to assent to the true impression, reject the false, and suspend judgement regarding the uncertain. This is the act of choice. Only that which is subject to our choice is good or evil; all the rest is neither good nor evil; it concerns us not, it is beyond our reach; it is something external, merely a subject for our choice: in itself it is indifferent, but its application is not indifferent, and its application is either consistent with or contrary to nature. This choice, and consequently our opinion upon it, is in our power; in our choice we are free; nothing that is external of us, not even Zeus, can overcome our choice: it alone can control itself. Nothing external, neither death nor exile nor pain nor any such thing, can ever force us to act against our will.\nWe are bound up by the law of nature with the whole fabric of the world. In the world the true position of a human is that of a member of a great system. Each human being is in the first instance a citizen of one's own nation or commonwealth; but we are also a member of the great city of gods and people. Nature places us in certain relations to other persons, and these determine our obligations to parents, siblings, children, relatives, friends, fellow-citizens, and humankind in general. The shortcomings of our fellow people are to be met with patience and charity, and we should not allow ourselves to grow indignant over them, for they too are a necessary element in the universal system.\n\nThe universe is wholly governed by an all-wise, divine Providence. All things, even apparent evils, are the will of God, and good from the point of view of the whole. In virtue of our rationality we are neither less nor worse than the gods, for the magnitude of reason is estimated not by length nor by height but by its judgments. The aim of the philosopher therefore is to reach the position of a mind which embraces the whole world. The person who recognizes that every event is necessary and reasonable for the best interest of the whole, feels no discontent with anything outside the control of moral purpose.\n\nThe historical models to which Epictetus refers to are Socrates and Diogenes. But he describes an ideal character of a missionary sage, the perfect Stoic—or, as he calls him, the Cynic. This philosopher has neither country nor home nor land nor slave; his bed is the ground; he is without wife or child; his only home is the earth and sky and a cloak. He must suffer beatings, and must love those who beat him. The ideal human thus described will not be angry with the wrong-doer; he will only pity his erring.\n\nThe earliest manuscript of the \"Discourses\" is a twelfth-century manuscript kept at the Bodleian Library, Oxford as MS Auct. T. 4. 13. In the Bodleian manuscript, a blot or stain has fallen onto one of the pages, and has made a series of words illegible; in all the other known manuscripts these words (or sometimes the entire passage) are omitted, thus all the other manuscripts are derived from this one archetype.\n\nIt is thought that the Bodleian manuscript may be a copy of one owned by Arethas of Caesarea in the early 10th century. The Bodleian manuscript contains marginal notes which have been identified as by Arethas. Arethas was an important collector of manuscripts and he is also responsible for transmitting a copy of Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations\".\n\nThe manuscript is however \"full of errors of all kinds\". Many corrections were made by medieval scholars themselves, and many emendations have been made by modern scholars to produce a clean text.\n\nThe \"Discourses\" were first printed (in Greek) by Vettore Trincavelli, at Venice in 1535, although the manuscript used was very faulty. This was followed by editions by Jakob Schegk (1554) and Hieronymus Wolf (1560). John Upton's edition published 1739–41 was an improvement on these since he had some knowledge of several manuscripts. This in turn was improved upon by the five volume edition by Johann Schweighäuser, 1799–1800. A critical edition was produced by Heinrich Schenkl in 1894 (second edition 1916) which was based upon the Bodleian manuscript.\n\nThe first English translation did not appear until 1758 with the appearance of Elizabeth Carter's translation. This proved to be very successful, with a second edition appearing a year later (1759), a third edition in 1768, and a fourth edition published posthumously in 1807. It influenced later translations: e.g. those of Higginson and George Long (see his Introduction for comments, some critical of Carter).\n\nA complete list of English translations is as follows:\n\n\nAll of these are complete translations with the exception of Robert Dobbin's book which only contains 64 out of the 95 Discourses. Robin Hard has produced two translations: the first (for Everyman in 1995) was just a revision of Elizabeth Carter's version, however his 2014 edition (for Oxford University Press) is the first complete original translation since the 1920s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27119791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27119791", "title": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", "text": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\n\nEverybody Draw Mohammed Day (or Draw Mohammed Day) was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It stemmed from a protest against censorship of the American television show \"South Park\" episode \"201\", led by the show's distributor Comedy Central, in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing Mohammed was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that \"everybody\" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.\n\nU.S. cartoonist Molly Norris of Seattle, Washington created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for depicting Muhammad in an episode of \"South Park\". Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as Zachary Adam Chesser) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.\n\nNorris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, radical Islamist terrorists would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on Facebook, was supported by numerous bloggers, and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others \"taking up the cause\". Facebook had an \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named \"Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'\" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20). Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.\n\nIn the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom.\n\n\"South Park\" episodes \"200\" and \"201\", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad. The \"South Park\" episode sparked statements from the extremist website Revolution Muslim, which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where \"South Park\" is made. Comedy Central self-censored the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word \"Muhammad\" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the \"South Park\" episode.\n\nMolly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\". The drawing showed various anthropomorphized objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate transliteration of \"Mohammed\" on her poster. Across the top of the illustration she wrote: The poster included a claim of sponsorship by an organization named \"Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor or CACAH (pronounced ca-ca)\", which Norris later said was purely fictional. Norris dedicated the cartoon to the creators of \"South Park\", Matt Stone and Trey Parker.\n\nIn late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: \"This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!\" She also wrote, \"I, the cartoonist, NEVER launched a draw Mohammed day. It is, in this FICTIONAL poster sponsored by this FICTIONAL GROUP\", referring to the \"Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor\" wording in the cartoon. \"SATIRE about a CURRENT EVENT, people!!! (That's what do!)\"\n\nNorris circulated the cartoon to bloggers based in Seattle, Washington. She sent a copy of her illustration to Dan Savage, who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of KIRO, a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question \"Are you sure you want to do this?\", and said \"Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid.\" The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the \"South Park\" creators, but also to support the right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She also said, \"it's a cartoonist's job to be non-PC.\" On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.\n\nAn \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" Facebook page was created by Jon Wellington. By the morning of April 26, the page had almost 6,000 confirmed guests. By April 25, someone (whose identity is unknown) had started a \"Ban Everybody Draw Muhammad Day\" counter-protest page on Facebook, which had 800 confirmed guests. Bloggers at \"The Atlantic\", \"Reason\", \"National Review Online\" and Glenn Reynolds in his \"Instapundit\" blog, all posted comments and links about the proposed day, giving it wide publicity. Blogs at \"The Washington Post\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" websites also posted news about the idea. \"Newser\" categorized the protest movement among, \"online movements against tyranny\". \"The Raw Story\" called the idea of the protest movement \"a snarky response\" to the threats from Revolution Muslim against \"South Park\". A blog was created for the fictional group \"\"Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor\", at www.cacah.org.\n\nBy April 27, there were over 9,000 confirmed guests that planned to participate in the event. A story about the protest movement was one of the most popular articles highlighted on the website Digg.com. On April 28, \"The Malaysian Insider\" reported that the protest movement \"appears to be gaining ground\", and some schools planned to join in the event. Michael C. Moynihan of \"Reason\" stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website. By May 3, 2010, there were 11,000 members of the protest movement on Facebook, and individuals had submitted over 460 pictures.\n\nOn April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: \"I did not intend for my cartoon to go viral. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the First Amendment by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!\" On April 26, she wrote on her website: \"I am NOT involved in \"Everybody Draw Mohammd [\"sic\" ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff\". She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, \"Because I'm an idiot.\"\n\nNorris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. \"I just want to go back to my quiet life\", she told the writer of a blog about comics at \"The Washington Post\". Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. \"I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet,\" he wrote. \"Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out.\" Norris acknowledged, \"I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid.\" On April 29, Norris suggested that \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" be called off: \"Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights.\" On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.\n\nNorris' change in position received varying reactions from commentators. Kathleen Parker, an opinion columnist for \"The Washington Post\", wrote, \"Norris's cartoon was a fine idea, but she should be relieved of further duty or responsibility.\" Writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Alex Spillius commented, \"No one should blame Norris for withdrawing from the fray, for this kind of case throws up lingering and insidious uncertainties. Any threat could blow over quickly or endure, Rushdie-style, for decades. The row over the cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten percolated for months before bubbling over into violent protests.\" William Wei of \"The Business Insider\" was more critical of the decision by the cartoonist to withdraw from the protest movement, with an article titled, \"Artist Who Proposed 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!' To Protest South Park Censorship Wimps Out.\"\n\nAn information technology specialist named Mimi, based in Toronto, Canada, helped to lead the protest movement in the wake of the departures of Norris and Wellington. Mimi stated to \"AOL News\" that the protest movement should be regarded as, \"pro-free speech, not anti-Muslim.\" She commented, \"If [Muslims] are offended, they have the right to be offended – just like Christians.\" With regard to keeping with the tenets of Freedom of Speech, Mimi is permitting a wide array of depictions of Muhammad \"except for those inciting violence or pornographic in nature.\" \"Mainstream society does whatever the Muslim society asks out of fear of violence or political correctness. But if you want to live in a Western society and use the system to protect your rights, you have to be willing to allow others to have theirs as well,\" said Mimi.\n\nAccording to \"Paste Magazine\", by April 30, 2010, \"Norris’ small protest [had] grown to encompass 32 Facebook events with a combined total of over 11,000 people planning to participate.\" Ron Nurwisah of \"National Post\" noted, \"Norris' backtracking might be a bit late as the event seems to have taken a life of its own,\" and \"Fox 9\" also pointed out, \"she may have started something she can't stop. Others have taken up the cause of 'Everybody Draw Muhammed Day'.\" Tim Edwards of \"The First Post\" pointed out, \"It seems that nothing can now stop May 20, 2010 becoming the inaugural 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'. Even if, in an ironic twist, its biggest backers have now been scared off.\"\n\nWriting for \"ComicsAlliance\", Laura Hudson noted that the website supported the protest movement and would participate in the event on May 20, 2010: \"There is power in numbers, and if you're an artist, creator, cartoonist, or basically anyone who would like to exercise your right to free speech in a way that it is actively threatened, that would be the day to do it. ... if you're an artist, cartoonist, or creator who plans to participate, drop us a line and let us know—we'll be adding our own terribly drawn rendition of the prophet here on ComicsAlliance when the day rolls around and we'd love it if you joined us.\" In a May 3, 2010 piece for \"The Washington Post\" blog, the founder and president of the Secular Coalition for America, Herb Silverman, wrote in support of the protest movement. Silverman stated he agreed with the rationale behind the idea, commenting, \"Whether this succeeds or not, and I have no personal interest in drawing Muhammad, I support the concept. We must join together to stop injustice.\"\n\nA columnist for The Washington Post Writers Group wrote that Norris should not be regarded as having further responsibility related to the movement; and affirmed that her Muhammad cartoon had significantly impacted a greater discussion about the issue. \"Telepolis\" described some of the pictures submitted to the Facebook group in support of the protest movement as, \"funny, crude, silly, original, the whole range of possibilities.\" \"The Jawa Report\" urged individuals to participate in the protest movement, but encouraged them to post images reflecting positively on Muhammad. Writing in an editorial for \"The Washington Times\", Jason Greaves urged individuals to participate in the protest event on May 20. Greaves concluded, \"Theo van Gogh was murdered for making a movie critical of Islam. 'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are threatened with the same fate. They deserve our solidarity, and I will stand with them by hosting images of Muhammad on my own website. Please stand with us.\"\n\nIn a May 17, 2010 article in \"The Daily Bruin\", writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both supporters and critics of the protest movement were increasing: \"The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong. Both are gaining members rapidly.\" In a May 18, 2010 article, \"Why We're Having an Everybody Draw Mohammed Contest on Thursday May 20\", \"Reason\" editor Nick Gillespie explained: \"No one has a right to an audience or even to a sympathetic hearing, much less an engaged audience. But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats.\" Gillespie asserted, \"Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what is at the core of a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights.\" As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, \"I'm against my own concept becoming a reality... If I had wanted to be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day. The one-off cartoon is not good as a long term plan because it's offensive.\" Fox News Channel reported that on May 19, 2010, a Facebook group supporting the protest movement had 41,000 members, and \"The Register\" reported this increased to 43,000 the same day. Norris told Fox News Channel in a statement on May 19, \"It's turned into something completely different, nothing I could've imagined it morphing into. I'm happy some people are talking, because obviously this needs to be addressed.\" By May 20, the \"Toronto Sun\" reported that both the \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" group and the \"Against 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'\" Facebook group protesting against the initiative had attracted more than 100,000 supporters, at 101,870 members and 106,000 members respectively.\n\nOn May 20, 2010, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch of \"Reason\" announced the winners of the publication's \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" contest. Gillespie and Welch warned the reader not to view the image \"if you are offended by graphical representations of the Prophet Mohammed.\" Of the images highlighted, Gillespie and Welch explained: \"The single most important element–and the thing that ties these selections together–is that each image forces the viewer to do two things. First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself.\" There were two images in the position of runner-up – one was an artistic rendition of a tobacco smoking pipe. The depiction references surrealist artist René Magritte, and includes the text, \"This is not a pipe. This is Muhammed.\" The \"Reason\" journalists commented that the image toyed with Magritte's \"famous statement about the necessary disjuncture between a picture and the thing it seeks to represent.\" The second runner-up was a parody of the \"Where's Waldo?\" series, and the winner was a connect the dots picture. Commenting on the winner of the \"Reason\" contest, Gillespie and Welch concluded, \"There is a deeper lesson here: Connect the dots and discover that we all must be Spartacus on Everybody Draw Mohammad Day. And that in a free society, every day is Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.\"\n\nSubsequent to an order from the Lahore High Court on May 19, 2010, the government of Pakistan, through its agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), indefinitely banned Facebook in the country, in response to the impending May 20 date at the focus of the protest movement. The order to carry out the shut down of Facebook in Pakistan was given by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which also publicized an email address and phone number and requested individuals contact the agency to let them know about \"all similar URLs where such objectionable material is found\". Representative Khoram Ali Mehran of the Pakistan agency stated to CNN, \"Obviously it (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked. We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it then that's what we will do.\" The agency was responding to an action by a group of Islamic attorneys based in Pakistan, who had acted to get the court order due to a Facebook group \"Everybody Draw Mohammad Day—May 20\". Azhar Siddique had filed the petition to the Lahore High Court on behalf of the organization, the Islamic Lawyers Forum. The government faced pressure from public protests against Facebook. In its petition to the government, the Islamic Lawyers Forum described the \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" event as \"blasphemous\". Siddique told \"The Times\", \"The court has also ordered the foreign ministry to investigate why such a competition is being held.\" The lawyers succeeded in getting the government to block the Facebook group itself individually on May 18, but the Islamic lawyers requested a full block of the entirety of the Facebook site, because the organization had permitted the posting of the particular group on its site. They argued that unless the entire Facebook website were blocked, it would be difficult to stop the protest movement campaign on the site. The Lahore court carried out this request, and ordered the government to issue a temporary block on Facebook to stand until May 31, 2010. Justice Ejaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court issued the ruling of the court. The court's ruling determined that the content of the protest movement on Facebook would damage the religious beliefs of the 45 million users of the website in Pakistan. The force of the ban was effective immediately after the ruling of the court. Those present for the court's ruling included many religious clerics, attorneys, and students. The court held an in-depth hearing on the matter on May 31, 2010.\n\nThe deputy attorney general of Punjab province, Naveed Inayat Malik, confirmed to the Press Association that the Lahore court had ordered Facebook banned in the country until May 31, 2010. The Secretary of the Pakistan Ministry of Information Technology, Naguib Malik, told the Associated Press that he requested the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority to carry out the ruling of the Lahore court. Pakistan Law Minister Babar Awan told \"ABC News\", \"this issue will be raised on all international forums.\" According to \"Press Trust of India\", by mid-day on May 19, 2010, individuals in Pakistan were not able to gain access to the Facebook site via computer, but could get entry using a smartphone. \"The Hindu\" reported that prior to the court's ruling, multiple Internet service providers had taken independent action to block Facebook, in light of protests against the website in Pakistan.\n\nThe May 20 plans of the protest movement sparked demonstrations in the streets of Pakistan and objections to Facebook by groups including the Pakistan-based Muslim Lawyers Movement. In several Pakistani cities demonstrators burned the Norwegian flag although the Norwegian News Agency reported that the Norwegian flag was burned mistakenly in the belief that it was the Danish. In Lahore both Swedish and Danish flags were burned, A lawyer involved in the action in the Lahore court, Rai Bashir, told \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"There are so many insults to the Prophet on the Internet and that's why we felt we had to bring this case. All Muslims in Pakistan and the world will be supporting us.\" Bashir explained to \"Sky News\", \"We moved the petition in the wake of widespread resentment in the Muslim community against the Facebook contest.\" Islamic Lawyers Forum attorney, Chaudhry Zulfikar Ali, told \"Xinhua News Agency\", \"The competition has hurt the sentiments of the Muslims.\" Protesters against Facebook and \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" converged in Karachi on May 19, 2010, and held up signs and yelled phrases critical of Facebook. According to the Associated Press, approximately 2,000 female students protested in Karachi, urging the banning of Facebook for permitting the \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" movement on the site. \"Agence France-Presse\" compared this to the 2006 protests over the depictions of Muhammed in European newspapers. They went on to report that there were approximately 20 individuals demonstrating outside the court in Lahore after its decision, holding signs which were negative regarding Facebook. Picketers outside the court held up signs praiseworthy of Muhammad. One protest sign at a picket in Lahore read: \"We love Muhammad. Say No to Facebook.\" \"BBC News\" noted reports in Pakistan media that there were protests against Facebook on May 19, 2010 outside parliament in Islamabad. Individuals passed on text messages, requesting other Facebook users to support the ban on the website. Attorneys standing outside the Lahore court on May 19, 2010 were repeating the phrase, \"Down with Facebook\". Protests against Facebook were organized in Lahore, Kasur, Narowal, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi and Peshawar; by Pakistan-based religious parties including Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Jamiat Tulba and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. According to \"The Financial Express\", \"protests against the website were held across the country\". \"The Vancouver Sun\" reported that Hamid Saeed Kazmi, Pakistan Religious Affairs Minister, \"strongly condemned\" the Facebook groups' efforts and requested Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani \"to take immediate action and call a Muslim conference\".\n\nThe Facebook group had supporters including Dutch politician Geert Wilders, former Dutch politician and feminist activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. An Islamic student association based in Lahore, Pakistan, handed out pamphlets requesting individuals to boycott Facebook; the pamphlet stated: \"The west is conspiring against the honour of the prophet and of Muslims. The real purpose of freedom of speech is to provoke the sentiments of Muslims.\" A representative of the Karachi-based Internet company Creative Chaos named Shakir Husain told \"The Guardian\" that a ban of Facebook would not be easy to carry out due to the ability to circumvent it using tactics such as proxy servers. Husain noted, \"By banning this web page, it will just make people more curious. It's pouring petrol on a small fire that could become a lot bigger. You can't police the Internet. The Saudis have tried it, as have other governments, and all have failed. It's a waste of state money.\"\n\nThe CEO of the company Nayatel, Wahaj-us-Siraj, told Reuters that the decision of the Lahore court was not wise: \"Blocking the entire website would anger users, especially young adults, because the social networking website is so popular among them and they spend most of their time on it. Basically, our judges aren't technically sound. They have just ordered it, but it should have been done in a better way by just blocking a particular URL or link.\" The Gabriel Consulting Group analyst Dan Olds commented about the Pakistan government's ban to \"Computerworld\", \"I think we can expect to see more of this type of thing coming from dictatorial countries as they try to keep their citizenry locked down.\" Olds observed, \"Trying to stop citizens from accessing the Internet is increasingly becoming like a little kid trying to stop the tide with a toy shovel and a bucket.\" An editorial in the Pakistan-based newspaper the \"Express Tribune\" commented on the ban of Facebook, \"Many users of the social media website have put up their own pages expressing their admiration for the Holy Prophet — surely this is a better response. Furthermore, the said page is one of millions on Facebook and blocking it entirely means that millions of users in Pakistan will be unable to access a site which has become part of their daily life. A better way would be to block the offensive web page but allow users in this country access to the rest of Facebook.\"\n\nA representative of Facebook told CBS News that the block of the website in Pakistan was under investigation by the company. The company released a statement on May 19, 2010: \"While the content does not violate our terms, we do understand it may not be legal in some countries. We are investigating this. In cases like this, the approach is sometimes to restrict certain content from being shown in specific countries.\" \"The Jakarta Globe\" reported that several Muslim religious scholars in Indonesia were critical of Facebook in light of the protest movement. Rohadi Abdul Fatah the Indonesia, Religious Affairs Ministry director of Islam and Shariah Law, announced that Facebook was to be considered \"haram\" (forbidden) according to Muslim law. Rohadi Abdul Fatah stated, \"We cannot tolerate it. Those who created the account were extremely irresponsible.\" Indonesia Communication and Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring stated to \"The Jakarta Globe\", \"I consider this an act of provocation to mess up religious harmony enjoyed by Indonesians. I call on everybody to stay calm. Let us all just cool down.\" Sembiring stated his intention to write the management of Facebook, and noted, \"Removing it is useless because other party can just post it again on the account. Therefore, we all need to be aware of this.\"\n\nOn May 20, 2010, the Internet ban by the government of Pakistan related to \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" was extended to include the video-sharing website, YouTube. YouTube released a statement, saying it is \"looking into the matter and working to ensure that the service is restored as soon as possible\". The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority stated it ordered the shut down of YouTube in the country due to \"blasphemous content\". A representative of YouTube told \"BBC News\", \"YouTube offers citizens the world over a vital window on cultures and societies and we believe people should not be denied access to information via video. Because YouTube is a platform for free expression of all sorts, we take great care when we enforce our policies. Content that violates our guidelines is removed as soon as we become aware of it.\" Additional websites including Flickr were blocked in Pakistan on May 20. The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority had first tried to block separate pages on YouTube; representatives of the agency stated to Reuters, \"but the blasphemous content kept appearing so we ordered a total shut down\".\n\nPakistan restricted access to Wikipedia and banned viewing of certain pages on the website in the country on May 20, 2010, according to \"Fast Company\", \"The New York Times\", \"Radio France Internationale\", \"The Express Tribune\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Computerworld\", \"Newsweek\", \"Agence France-Presse\", and the \"Financial Times\". \"Agence France-Presse\" noted, \"The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) extended a ban on Facebook, ordered by a court until May 31, to popular video sharing website YouTube and restricted Wikipedia.\" \"The Washington Post\" reported, \"At least 450 sites, including Wikipedia, were also cut off by midday\" on May 20. \"Radio France Internationale\" quoted the editor of \"The Friday Times\", who stated, \"They’ve banned not just Facebook, now you have YouTube. They’re also blocking Flickr, I’ve just heard that they’ve blocked Wikipedia ... eager beavers sitting in the PTA and in other ministries are just going on and blocking sites.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that the ban, \"also included certain pages on Flickr and Wikipedia\". According to \"Radio France Internationale\", and \"Newsweek\", pages were blocked on Wikipedia by the Pakistan agency due to what the government described as \"growing sacrilegious contents\". Ahmad Rafay Alam of the Pakistani English-language daily newspaper \"The Express Tribune\" commented, \"the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has taken it upon itself to block Wikipedia, among other things.\" \"The Christian Science Monitor\" reported, \"Pakistan blocked YouTube, Wikipedia, and other websites ... to try to suppress a Facebook page declaring Thursday Everybody Draw Mohammad Day.\" \"Reuters\" reported on May 20 that \"websites, including Wikipedia and Flickr, have been inaccessible in Pakistan\" since the previous evening. According to \"Agence France-Presse\", a representative of the organization the Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, Wahaj us Siraj, stated \"Wikipedia had been blocked\" in the country.\n\nA representative of the United States Department of State weighed in on the actions of the Pakistan government with respect to the images. Assistant Secretary of State Philip J. Crowley stated that the United States was critical of a \"deliberate attempt to offend Muslims\". Crowley commented, \"Pakistan is wrestling to this issue. We respect any actions that need to be taken under Pakistani law to protect their citizens from offensive speech.\" The Assistant Secretary of State went on to note, \"At the same time, Pakistan has to make sure that in taking any particular action, that you’re not restricting speech to the millions and millions of people who are connected to the Internet and have a universal right to the free flow of information.\" On May 22, 2010, the Ambassador to the United States from Pakistan, Hussain Haqqani, formally issued a complaint to the U.S., in communications with U.S. Special Representative Richard Holbrooke. The Pakistan embassy in the United States sent a formal complaint to the U.S. Department of State. The Lahore High Court had ordered the Pakistan representative to issue the complaint to the U.S. regarding the images on Facebook. Pakistan's embassy in the U.S. told the U.S. Department of State that the images on Facebook \"immensely hurt and discomforted the people and the government of Pakistan\"; the embassy requested the U.S. government \"take effective measures to prevent, stop or block this blasphemous contest immediately\". On May 25, 2010, \"The Nation\" reported that a poll of citizens of Pakistan conducted by \"ProPakistani.pk\" revealed that 70 percent of those polled wanted Facebook to be permanently banned in the country.\n\nOn May 31, 2010, \"PC World\" reported that the Lahore High Court had lifted the ban on Facebook. The magazine quoted the government of Pakistan as saying that \"the web site had promised to make material considered derogatory inaccessible to users in Pakistan.\" This was in line with an earlier statement by a Facebook spokeswoman, stating that Facebook \"may consider IP blocking in Pakistan upon further review of local regulations, standards and customs\". Pakistan's secretary of IT and telecom said in an interview that Facebook had \"apologized\" and agreed to block access to the page from Pakistan. Facebook had already blocked access to the page for users from India the previous week, at the request of the Indian authorities. On May 30, 2010, the day before the Facebook ban in Pakistan was lifted, Bangladesh imposed its own ban on Facebook.\nJustice Ijaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court planned to review the case on June 15, 2010 to see if Facebook had allowed more blasphemous material to be displayed. This review was postponed to July 9, 2010.\n\n\"Millat\" of Millat Ibrahim (faith of Abraham) is a word used to describe the Muslim faith. Due to the block on Facebook in Pakistan, a spinoff version of the site, MillatFacebook, was created to cater primarily to Muslims. This is Pakistan's first social networking site and a writer for Agence France Presse reported in May 2010 that it had received poor reviews and drawn few adherents.\n\nThe idea for the May 20 protest received support from Kathleen Parker, an opinion columnist for \"The Washington Post\": \"Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now.\" The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as Michael C. Moynihan at \"Reason\" magazine's \"Hit & Run\" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings. Moynihan stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website. Moynihan commented, \"In the South Park episode that started all this, Buddha does lines of coke and there was an episode where Cartman started a Christian rock band that sang very homo-erotic songs. Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?\" Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact self-censorship of the \"South Park\" episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.\n\nMaayana Miskin of \"Arutz Sheva\" characterized the movement as \"a mass protest\". Writing for \"The American Thinker\", Ethel C. Fenig described the protest movement as a cause for freedom of speech. \"Westword\" commented positively on the protest idea, \"Sounds like an idea we'd like to frame.\" The editor of \"Family Security Matters\", Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement from the perspective of freedom of speech, and commented, \"I realize that in a free society, someone is always going to be doing or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer.\" Andrew Mellon of \"Big Journalism\" wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, \"The bottom line is that the First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. We are an equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American.\" Mario Roy of \"La Presse\" discussed the incident, and noted, \"it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship. Fearing a possible threat, nothing is worse than the fear of fear.\"\n\nWriting for \"The American Spectator\", Jeremy Lott commented positively about the protest movement: \"While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, people across the country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold.\" Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. \"Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side,\" he told the NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). \"I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not.\" Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. \"I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area,\" he said. In an analysis of the protest movement and surrounding controversy, staff writer Liliana Segura of \"AlterNet\" noted, \"In a democratic society where free speech is vigilantly protected, it is perfectly reasonable to call out censorship, particularly when it springs from some form of tyrannical religious extremism.\"\n\nLaw professor and blogger Ann Althouse rejected the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day idea because \"depictions of Muhammad offend millions of Muslims who are no part of the violent threats.\" James Taranto, writing in the \"Best of the Web Today\" column at \"The Wall Street Journal\", also objected to the idea, not only because depicting Mohammed \"is inconsiderate of the sensibilities of others\", but also because \"it defines those others—Muslims—as being outside of our culture, unworthy of the courtesy we readily accord to insiders.\" Bill Walsh of \"Bedford Minuteman\" wrote critically of the initiative, which seemed \"petulant and childish\" to him: \"It attempts to battle religious zealotry with rudeness and sacrilege, and we can only wait to see what happens, but I fear it won’t be good.\" Janet Albrechtsen wrote in \"The Australian\", \"As a cartoon, it was mildly amusing. As a campaign, it's crass and gratuitously offensive.\" Writing for New York University's Center for Religion and Media publication, \"The Revealer\", Jeremy F. Walton called the event a \"blasphemous faux holiday\", which would \"only serve to reinforce broader American misunderstandings of Islam and Muslims\".\n\nFranz Kruger, writing for the \"Mail & Guardian\", called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a \"silly Facebook initiative\" and found \"the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'\" in it \"disturbing\", noting that \"it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'.\" The \"Mail & Guardian\", which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it \"claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment.\" Hugo Rifkind, writing for \"The Times\", called the Facebook initiative a \"grubby project\": \"... there’s something here that makes me twitch. I think it’s the 'everybody'. It’s the 'everybody' of a man at the back of a mob, trying to persuade other people to get lynching. If a cartoonist wants to satirise Islam by drawing Mohammed, I’m on his side all the way. But among the 13,000 pictures on the EDMD Facebook page, you have Mohammed as a dog in a veil, Mohammed as a pig and Mohammed as a monkey. That’s not resistance, but picking a fight. Issuing a death threat against somebody who drew a picture isn’t my thing, but this isn’t either.\" Bilal Baloch, writing for \"The Guardian\", called the initiative \"juvenile\" and \"an irresponsible poke-in-the-eye\", while at the same time criticizing the Pakistani government's response, and calling on \"Pakistan's Internet community to engage in an organised and compelling dialogue: if not with the offenders, then most certainly with the rest of the world that is watching.\"\n\nIn Pakistan, an editorial in \"Dawn\", the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative \"was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation,\" adding that it was \"debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities.\" However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a \"knee-jerk reaction,\" saying that, \"many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs,\" and that the block might \"have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision.\"\n\nThe protest movement and incidents surrounding the censorship of the \"South Park\" episode were discussed on the National Public Radio program, \"Talk of the Nation\", where commentators including Ross Douthat analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon. Stephanie Gutmann of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the 2010 Times Square car bomb attempt was found to be related to the \"South Park\" episode \"200\", \"this sort of protest will be more important than ever.\" Writing for \"The Faster Times\", journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, \"was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment.\" Writing for \"Financial Times\", John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement and noted, \"Molly Norris proposed a 'let’s everyone draw Mohammed day' – then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away.\"\n\nWriting for \"Religion Dispatches\", Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to Martin Luther, stating, \"Forget the \"South Park\" dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent.\" Dacey argued, \"The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between \"conflicting\" religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy.\"\n\nIn an analysis of the protest movement for the \"Daily Bruin\", journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking jingoistic, American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards.\" In an analysis of the protest movement for \"Spiked\", Brendan O'Neill was critical of the concept of \"mocking Muhammad,\" writing, \"... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the flag-burning, street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business.\"\n\nSeveral editorial cartoonists quoted by \"The Washington Post\" blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to. The president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists opposed involvement because, \"something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression.\" Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, \"childish and needlessly provocative,\" or demurred because they dislike, \"choreographed punditry.\"\n\nTarek Kahlaoui, an assistant professor of Islamic Art at Rutgers University, analyzed the reasons behind Islamic aniconism in an article on Global Expert Finder, pointing out that despite aniconism the depiction of Muhammad is not wholly forbidden in Islam, and so in principle it should be possible for non-Muslims to draw him as well, although stating, \"What should be an issue, however, are all possible implications between visual representation and bigotry.\" He also defended the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in the way that it's an important right of all Americans.\n\nOn July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the al-Qaeda magazine \"Inspire,\" Al-Awlaki wrote, \"The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved,\" and was quoted as saying, The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ... But even then our campaign should not be limited to only those who are active participants.\nFBI officials reportedly notified Norris warning her that they considered it a \"very serious threat.\"\n\nNorris has since changed her name and gone into hiding. According to the \"Seattle Weekly\" (her former employer), this decision was based on \"the insistence of top security specialists at the FBI.\"\n\nThe threat against Norris appeared to be renewed when Al Qaeda's \"Inspire\" included her in its March 2013 edition with eleven others in a pictorial spread entitled \"Wanted: Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam,\" and captioned, \"Yes We Can: A Bullet A Day Keeps the Infidel Away.\" The cartoonist Stéphane \"Charb\" Charbonnier was also added to Al-Qaeda's most wanted list, along with Lars Vilks and three \"Jyllands-Posten\" staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose.\n\nAs of 2015, Norris is still in hiding and jihadist threats against her life continue.\n\n\n\n"}

The church's stated mission is to carry on the legacy of Anton LaVey through \"the study of Satanism and the occult sciences\". The church operates The 600 Club, an internet forum dedicated to discussions of Satanism.\n\nThe church's website claims the organization to have been founded in 1966, and the 1999 date to be a \"re-establishment\" of the Church of Satan, claiming direct continuity with Anton LaVey. Karla asserts that she is re-representing the original teachings of her father from which the current administration of the Church of Satan has departed, and maintains an elitist stance of her fathers original organization. Anton LaVey's book, \"The Satanic Bible\" is stated as required reading prior to joining the First Satanic Church.\n\nOn Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, Anton LaVey founded the \"Satanic Church\" (which he would later rename the \"Church of Satan\"). On October 29, 1997, Anton LaVey died of pulmonary edema. On November 7, 1997, Karla held a press conference to announce Anton's death. It was at this time that Blanche Barton and Karla LaVey announced that they would run the Church of Satan as co-High Priestesses. Several days later, Barton produced a hand written will claiming that LaVey had left all of his belongings, property, writings, and royalties, including the Church of Satan, to be put in a trust managed by Barton. Karla contested this will, which was later found to be invalid. A settlement was later reached in which Anton’s belongings, writings, and royalties would be split among his three children and that Barton would receive the “corporation known as Church of Satan.” \n\nBlanche Barton, LaVey's partner and confidant, assumed the administrative role of the Church. Shortly thereafter, Barton appointed Peter H. Gilmore and his wife Peggy Nadramia to the positions of High Priest and Priestess, and the Church's headquarters were subsequently moved to New York City. Karla was critical of Barton's administration of the Church, as she felt the Church's move to New York to be a disservice to her father's legacy. Ms. LaVey and Barton's parting of ways was primarily due to legal disputes regarding Anton LaVey's will and inheritance. Consequently, Karla founded the \"First Satanic Church\" to carry on the legacy of her father, and continues to run it out of San Francisco, California.\n\nThe organization maintains only a modest internet presence. The church held a Walpurgisnacht Show in April 2005 at the 12 Galaxies nightclub in San Francisco, as well as a pre-Halloween benefit show in October 2005 at Edinburgh Castle (also in San Francisco) to help the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Since 1998, the Satanic Church has been presenting its Annual Black X-Mass Show every December. These events are open to the public, although membership is not open to the public.\n\nKarla LaVey hosts a Satanic radio show every week in San Francisco in which she talks and plays the music that she grew up enjoying with her father. Listeners are encouraged to send in their CDs for playing.\n\n"}
{"id": "2177462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177462", "title": "Freedom of religion in Sri Lanka", "text": "Freedom of religion in Sri Lanka\n\nThe constitution of Sri Lanka states under Chapter II, Article 9, \"The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).\" Articles 10 and 14(1)(e) provide all citizens the freedom to adopt, practice and teach any religion of their choice. Concurrently in 1978, Buddhism was declared as the State religion by President J. R. Jayawardene. This preferential treatment to Buddhism is therefore highly controversial in Sri Lanka, and is seen as the prime factor in the rise of Tamil separatism.\n\nMatters related to family law, e.g., divorce, child custody and inheritance are adjudicated under customary law of the applicable ethnic or religious group. For example, the minimum age of marriage for women is 18 years, except in the case of Muslims, who continued to follow their customary religious practices of girls attaining marrying age with the onset of puberty and men when they are financially capable of supporting a family.\n\nAt times, local police and government officials appeared to be acting in concert with Buddhist nationalist organizations. In addition, in 2013 NGOs allege that government officials provided assistance, or at least tacitly supported the actions of societal groups targeting religious minorities.\n\nIn 2014, the government established a special religious police unit to deal with religious complaints. The new unit reports to the Ministry of Law and Order, although it is housed in the Buddhist Division of the Ministry of Buddhist Sasana and Religious Affairs. Critics argue that it will bolster and strengthen the violent Buddhist groups.eg:-BBS (srilankan buddhist terror group) \n\nThere is no existing legislation which restricts the right of individuals to proselytize members of one faith to convert them to another religion. Foreign clergy may work in the country, but for the last three decades, the government has limited the issuance of temporary work permits. Work permits for foreign clergy are issued for one year (rather than five years as in the past). It is possible to obtain extensions of work permits.\n\nThis coexistence has been recently marred by isolated incidents and attacks on religious places by Buddhist terrorists mobs and by LTTE. Similarly Sri Lankan air force particularly has air raided Hindu, Christian shrines during the peak of war thinking that LTTE is taking shelter in there. \n\nSeveral Hindu temples were attacked in the riots of 1983 in Colombo and South of Sri Lanka.\n\nTwo of the holiest sites for Buddhists in Sri Lanka, the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree and the Temple of the Tooth, have been attacked and bombed by the LTTE. In recent times, the LTTE have also attacked several Muslim mosques in the North-Eastern parts of the country. \n\nNavaly church bombing is one instance where the bombing of a church was blamed on the Sri Lankan air force, although there was no adequate evidence to clearly establish whether the Sri Lankan air force or the LTTE terrorists were responsible for this bombing incident.\n\nFreedom of religion in Sri Lanka is however claimed to have been historically upheld through religious tolerance . The practice of Hinduism was allowed under Sinhala kings since the Anuradhapura era. Buddhist Sinhala kings gave protection to Muslims fleeing from Portuguese persecution and to Catholics fleeing from persecution by the Dutch after having been defeated by the Portuguese.\n"}
{"id": "33574019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33574019", "title": "God in Tenrikyo", "text": "God in Tenrikyo\n\nIn Tenrikyo, God is a single divine being and creator of the entire universe. The first two characters in the Japanese kanji for Tenri-O-no-Mikoto are 天理, where 天 refers to heaven or divinity, and 理 refers to reason or knowledge, thus \"Tenri\" (天理) refers to divine or heavenly knowledge, and in a sense adds a divine nature to truth itself whereas \"天理\" also means \"natural law\" or its pseudonym, \"divine law.\" The English name most frequently used to refer to Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto outside of ritual is \"God the Parent\"; in Japanese, the equivalent common name is \"Oyagamisama\". In Tenrikyo, God has no gender.\n\nTenrikyo followers vary in their understanding of this creator, from the early understanding of spirit (\"kami\", god/deity) through the underlying natural causality (\"Tsukihi\", moon-sun) and eventually to an understanding of a parental relationship between the creator and themselves (\"oya\", parent). This progression of understanding is a key teaching of Tenrikyo, where it is accepted that everything must proceed \"step by step\" — by small stages of understanding instead of by great leaps of faith.\n\nIn historical documents and scriptures related to Tenrikyo, a number of different appellations are ascribed to God. \n\nIn the \"Ofudesaki\", God identified as three different entities. In 1869, when the first verses were composed, God initially identified as \"kami\" (神), a spirit in the Japanese Shinto tradition. The designation \"kami\" was broader than the Abrahamic notion of God, as it could be applied to any object that possessed divine power or inspired awe, such as animals, trees, places, and people. However, the \"Ofudesaki\" stressed the uniqueness of the \"kami\" by adding various qualifiers such as \"moto no kami\" (God \"of origin\"), \"shinjitsu no kami\" (God \"of truth\"), and \"kono yō o hajimeta kami\" (God \"who began this world\"). From 1874, God began to identify as \"tsukihi\" (月日), or moon-sun, and from 1879, God began to identify as \"oya\" (をや), or parent, though \"kami\" and \"tsukihi\" continued to be used until the last part of the scripture. \n\nIn Tenrikyo's creation story, outlined in the \"Ofudesaki\" and elaborated upon in various notes on her talks known collectively as \"kōki\", there are ten figures credited with the creation of human beings. Some Tenrikyo authorities suggest that two of these figures, \"Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto\" and \"Omotari-no-Mikoto\", represent \"tsukihi\", or more precisely the duality \"tsuki-sama\" and \"hi-sama\". The other eight figures are tools subordinate to \"tsukihi\" that were drawn in, consulted, and trained in the creation of human beings. \n\nIn the \"Mikagura-uta,\" the songs of Tenrikyo's liturgy, God is commonly referred to as \"kami.\" At the end of most of the songs, God is invoked with the name \"Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto,\" (てんりおうのみこと or 天理王命) or \"absolute ruler of divine reason.\"\n\nThe historical sources written during Nakayama Miki's lifetime and in the years following her death suggest a number of other appellations of God. In Nakayama Shinnosuke's \"Oyasama gyoden,\" the source on which \"The Life of Oyasama\" is primarily based, Miki refers to God as \"ten no shōgun\" (Shōgun of Heaven) in the initial revelation. In early attempts to obtain religious sanctions from the Yoshida Administrative Office of Shinto and a Shingon Buddhist temple, the name of God was recorded as \"Tenrin-Ō-Myōjin\" (天輪王明神) and \"Tenrin-Ō-Kōsha\" (転輪王講社) respectively. An early doctrine of the Tenrikyo church, written to conform to the State Shinto doctrine at the time, records the name as \"Tenri-Ōkami\".\n\nTenrikyo's current doctrine maintains that \"Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto\" is the divine name to be used in the context of prayer. The doctrine frequently refers to God as God the Parent (親神様 \"oyagamisama\"), emphasizing the parental nature of God revealed toward the end of the \"Ofudesaki\". The doctrine claims that the changes in God's names in the \"Ofudesaki\", from \"kami\" to \"tsukihi\" to \"oya\", were made in accordance with the spiritual growth of the early followers.\n\nA number of qualities have been ascribed to God as understood in Tenrikyo, by both Tenrikyo and religious studies scholars.\n\nOut of a fundamental desire to see people thrive, God, through Nakayama Miki, showed followers several ways by which they could receive God's healing power. At first, Miki administered the grant of safe childbirth, where she would lay her hands and breathe on the hands of pregnant women and would assure them of easy delivery if they relied on God. Later, Miki taught a healing prayer called the \"Sazuke\" and a liturgy called the Service, intended as specific rituals followers could perform to heal people physically and spiritually. In addition, Miki gave sacred amulets to those who had visited her residence, which she said would protect her followers from disease and decay. However, Miki asserted that, for God's healing to be effective, the participants must have full faith in God and the desire to purify their hearts (Ofudesaki X:20–24, XII:91–94).\n\nIn Tenrikyo, God is immanent in the sense that God provides for all matter in the universe, such as human bodies, living organisms and inanimate objects, and sustains all of the physical processes behind them. In the \"Ofudesaki\", the universe is referred to as the \"body of God\" (Ofudesaki III:40, 135). In Tenrikyo's doctrine, God's providence over the universe explained as the \"ten aspects of God's complete providence\" (十全の守護 \"jūzen no shugō\"; see section on Providences).\n\nA frequently appearing term in the \"Ofudesaki\" is \"jūyō\" or \"jūyōjizai\", translated as \"omnipotence\" or \"free and unlimited workings.\" This omnipotence permeates the physical world and its laws, for example, the God of Tenrikyo is the cause of natural disasters such as rainstorms and earthquakes (Ofudesaki VI:91), and of events in one's personal life, such as dreams and diseases (Ofudesaki VIII:58). However the physical laws of the world can be superseded at times in order to produce miracles, which suggests that God's power is not purely mechanical or rigid.\n\nThe \"Ofudesaki\" imply God's omniscience by asserting that there is nothing that God does not know (Ofudesaki VIII:11, XVI:42) and that God scrutinizes the hearts of all people (VIII:52–3, XVII:29). With this omniscience, God gives appropriate returns to each individual depending on how close his or her mind is in accordance with God's intention.\n\nIn Tenrikyo, God is a personal god who acts as an idealized parent. Just as parents conceive and raise their children, God took part in the conception of human beings and continues to be involved in their upbringing. God moves, plans, acts, and expresses emotions such as love and regret in order to guide human beings toward greater spiritual maturity and joy.\n\nThe God of Tenrikyo transcends time and space and rejects systematic classification. Because of this quality, God has the ability to become finite and limited so that God's teachings could be understood by human beings, i.e. through the life and writings of Nakayama Miki.\n\nTenrikyo's doctrine claims that God was revealed through Nakayama Miki on the lunar calendar date of 26 October 1838, in order to clarify the means of humankind's salvation. Because God was hidden before that time, God's teachings could not be fully understood by human beings. Verses in the \"Ofudesaki\" acknowledge the revealed nature of God (e.g. I:3, XI:67), and the \"Osashizu\" makes a number of references to the time when God became revealed.\n\nThe immanent providence of God in Tenrikyo is distinguished into ten aspects, each endowed with a sacred name, a function in the human body, and a function in the world. These aspects are represented by dancers in the portion of Tenrikyo's liturgy known as the Kagura Service.\n\nIn 1880, in order to evade continuous persecution by the government, Tenrikyo placed itself under the administration of a Shugendo temple named Jifukuji. During this time \"Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto\" was officially called \"Tenrin-Ō-Nyorai\" and the \"kanji\" of various other deities were changed, but by 1890 Tenrikyo was given approval by the Meiji government and the original names were restored.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24476576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24476576", "title": "Gut (ritual)", "text": "Gut (ritual)\n\nGut, kut or goot () are the rites performed by Korean shamans, involving offerings and sacrifices to gods and ancestors. They are characterised by rhythmic movements, songs, oracles and prayers. These rites are meant to create welfare, promoting commitment between the spirits and mankind. The major categories of rites are the \"naerim-gut\", the \"dodang-gut\" and the \"ssitgim-gut\".\n\nThrough song and dance, the shaman begs the gods to intervene in the fortune of men. The shaman wears a very colourful costume and normally speaks in ecstasy. During a rite, the shaman changes his or her costume several times. Rituals consist of various phases, called \"gori\".\n\nThe \"gut\" is meant as a crossroads where three participants met: The gods, the believers, and the shamans who mediate between them. The communion between spirits and mankind is believed to take place through a cup of purified wine, called \"bokjan\" or \"cup of blessings\". There are different types of \"gut\", which vary from region to region. The procedure and style of these rites largely depends on the purpose of the ceremony, and on the character and abilities of the performing shaman. However, the rites generally show threefold structures—for instance, dances and songs repeated three times. \n\nThreefold repetition has an important symbolic meaning in Korean shamanism, being considered the best way to complete an action. Its meaning is grounded in the theological conception of the threefoldness of God—\"Hwanin\", \"Hwanung\", \"Dangun\"—, the three stages of manifestation of \"Haneullim\".\n\nPurity of both the body and the mind is a state that is required for taking part in rituals. Purification is considered necessary for an efficacious communion between living people and ancestral forms. Before any \"gut\" is performed, the altar is always purified by fire and water, as part of the first \"gori\" of the ritual itself. The colour white, extensively used in rituals, is regarded as a symbol of purity. The purification of the body is performed by burning white paper. Of course these specifics depend upon the Korean shaman's spiritual lineage/house.\n\nThis gut is an initiation rite. As part of the rite, someone becomes a shaman by being possessed by spirits who are officiated by Heaven to become gods. This rite is only able to be done through another Korean shaman and cannot be held on one's own. This ritual causes the \"shinbyeong\", a temporary acute psychotic manic episode, to disappear.\n\nThis communal rite is common in central provinces in South Korea. Its aim is to wish for the well-being and prosperity of a particular village or hamlet. This rite is normally held annually or once every few years. It is always held either around the New Year or in spring or autumn. The \"dodang-gut\" is distinguished by giving prominent roles to the female \"mudang\".\n\nThis rite is used to cleanse the spirit of a deceased person. Since ancient times there is a Korean belief that when somebody dies, their body cannot enter the world of the dead because of the impurity of their spirit. The \"ssitgim-gunt\" washes away this impurity. It is observed mainly in the provinces in the south west of South Korea.\n\nDuring the sequential performance of the twelve segments that comprise a typical \"chaesugut\", more than half of the costumes the \"mansin\" wears are male. The most interactive and dynamic portions of the \"gut\" usually occur during the \"mansin's\" possession by the \"pyolsang\" (spirits of the other world) and the greedy \"taegam\" (the overseer), which require male costumes. This cross-dressing serves several purposes. First, since the \"mansin\" is often possessed by both male and female spirits and can thus become an icon of the opposite sex, it is reasonable that she use the attire of both sexes. But in a context in which women are publicly demeaned, where their symbolic value is reduced by strong Confucian ideology, the female \"mansin's\" cross-dressing becomes complex and multi-functional.\n\nIn semiotic terms, the costume is an icon for the person or the spirit it represents. The mansin in the costume assumes the role of that icon, thereby becoming a female signifying a male; she is a cross-sex icon about 75% of the time during a typical \"gut\". In the context of the \"gut\", the \"mansin\" is a sexually liminal being; by signifying a man, she not only has access to the male authority in the Confucian order, she provides the female audience an opportunity to interact with that authority in ways that would, in a public context, be unthinkable. Her performance is often a parody of the male authority figures; she often makes off-color jokes and ribald comments, and argues with the audience.\n\nThe traditional rites are not linked to the Gregorian calendar. They are linked either to a particular event, such as a death, or the lunar calendar.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4185579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4185579", "title": "Islam in Kenya", "text": "Islam in Kenya\n\nIslam is the religion of approximately 11.1 percent of the Kenyan population, or approximately 4.3 million people. The Kenyan coast is mostly populated by Muslims. Nairobi has several mosques and a notable Muslim population.\n\nThe vast majority of Muslims in Kenya follow the Sunni Islam of Shafi school of jurisprudence. There are also sizeable populations of Shia and Ahmadi adherents. In large part, Shias are Ismailis descended from or influenced by oceanic traders from the Middle East and India. These Shia Muslims include the Dawoodi Bohra, who number some 6,000-8,000 in the country.\n\nPioneer Muslim traders arrived on the Swahili Coast around the eighth century. The tension surrounding the succession of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and the already established trade links between the Persian Gulf and the Swahili Coast were some of the factors leading to this development.\n\nArchaeological evidence attests to a thriving Muslim town on Manda Island by the Tenth Century AD. The Moroccan Muslim traveller, Ibn Battuta, visiting the Swahili Coast in 1331 AD, reported a strong Muslim presence. Ibn Battuta said:\nThe inhabitants are pious, honourable, and upright, and they have well-built wooden mosques.\n\nOn arrival, the Muslims settled along the coast, engaging in trade. The Shirazi intermarried with the local Bantu people resulting in the Swahili people, most of who converted to Islam. Swahili, structurally a Bantu Language with heavy borrowings from Arabic, was born.\n\nPrimarily, Islam spread through the interactions of individuals, with the Arab Muslims who had settled in small groups maintaining their culture, and religious practices. Despite encountering local communities, Islam was not ‘indigenized’ along the patterns of the local Bantu communities. Nevertheless, Islam grew through absorption of individuals into the newly established Afro-Arabic Muslim communities. This resulted in more ‘Swahilization’ than Islamization.\n\nThere was strong resistance toward Islam by the majority of communities living in the interior. The resistance was because conversion was an individual act, leading to detribalization and integration into the Muslim community going against the socially acceptable communal life.\n\nIslam on the Swahili Coast was different from the rest of Africa. Unlike West Africa where Islam was integrated to the local communities, the local Islam was ‘foreign’; the Arab-Muslims lived as if they were in the Middle East.\n\nThe primary concern for the early Muslims was trade with a few interested in propagating Islam. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th Century interrupted the small work in progress. On the other hand, the interstate quarrels that ensued meant that much effort was now directed towards restoring normality and not Islamization.\n\nIslam remained an urban and coastal phenomenon. The Spread of Islam was low-keyed with no impact amongst the local non-Swahili African Community. There were no intermediary Africans to demonstrate that, adoption of a few Islamic institutions would not disrupt society.\n\nThe spread of Islam to the interior was hampered by several factors: for instance, the nature of the Bantu society’s varied beliefs, and scattered settlements affected interior advancement. Other factors included, harsh climatic conditions, the fierce tribes like the Maasai, tribal laws restricting passage through their land, health factors, and the lack of easy mode of transportation. For Trimingham, the brand of Islam introduced to the region was equally to blame.\n\nMuslim traders were not welcome in the social structures thereby impeding any meaningful progress until the beginning of European occupation.\n\nOther factors affecting Islamic movement into the interior included; atrocities committed during slave trading, as these unfavourably affected the spread of Islam. In addition, the embracing of Islam by large portions of coastal tribes in the Nineteenth Century aided in its spread.\n\nBesides, local Muslim preachers and teachers played major roles in teaching religion (Ar. dīn) and the Qur’ān at the Qur’ān Schools (Swa. vyuo) and Madrasa attached to the Mosques.\n\nThe coming of the second wave of Europeans, in the Nineteenth Century, brought mixed fortunes to the coastal Muslims, their strong sense of pride and belonging was greatly diminished, with efforts being redirected to self adjustments.\nNonetheless, Muslim agents deployed by Europeans as subordinate labourers to assist in the establishment of Colonial administration centres, were advantageously placed throughout the country, bringing the Islamic influence to the interior.Each place where a European installed himself, military camp, government centre, or plantation, was a centre for Muslim influence.\n\nIn the interior, the Muslims neither integrated nor mingled with the local communities, yet, non-Swahili Africans began joining the Swahili trends in trade with some returning as Muslims. Swahili became the trade and religious language. Alongside the interpersonal contacts, intermarriages also yielded some conversions.\n\nAlthough coastal rulers did not send missionaries to the interior, local Africans embraced Islam freely through attraction to the religious life of the Muslims. Close integration with the local population helped to foster good relations resulting in Islam gaining a few converts, based on individual efforts.\n\nSubjectively, most of the surrounding Bantu communities had a close-knit religious heritage, requiring strong force to penetrate. The pacification and consolidation by European powers provided the much-needed force to open up the communities for new structures of power and religious expression (Trimingham:1983:58).\n\nBasically, progress in the spread of Islam in Kenya came between 1880 and 1930. This was when most social structures and the African worldviews were shattered, leaving them requiring a new, wider worldview encompassing or addressing the changes experienced.\n\nConsequently, Islam introduced new religious values through external ceremonial and ritualistic expressions, some of which could be followed with no difficulty.\n\nSocio-culturally, Muslims presented themselves with a sense of pride and a feeling of superiority. Islamic civilization was identified with the Arab way of life (Ustaarabu), as opposed to ‘barbarianism’ (Ushenzi) hence the domination of a form of Arabism over the local variety of Islam.\n\nThe ease, with which Islam could be adopted, meant adding to the indigenous practices, new religious rites and ceremonies to the African ways, with new ways of defining one’s identity by new forms of expression. Mingling with Muslims led to conversion meaning returning home as Muslims and not aliens. Lacunza-Balda shows that Islam could be adopted easily.\n\nAlthough most of the conversions were of individuals, there were communities that embraced Islam en-masse. Some of these included the Digo and Pokomo of the Lower Tana region. From these communities Islam slowly penetrated inland.\n\nPioneer Muslim missionaries to the interior were largely Tanganyikans, who coupled their missionary work with trade, along the centres began along the railway line, such as, Kibwezi, Makindu and Nairobi.\n\nOutstanding amongst them was Maalim Mtondo, a Tanganyikan credited with being the first Muslim missionary to Nairobi. Reaching Nairobi at the close of the Nineteenth Century, he led a group of other Muslims, and enthusiastic missionaries from the coast to establish a ‘Swahili village’ in the present day Pumwani.\n\nA small mosque was built to serve as a starting point and he began preaching Islam in earnest. He soon attracted several Kikuyus and Wakambas, who became his disciples.\n\nLocal men converted and having learned from their teachers took up the leadership of religious matters. Khamis Ngige was a prominent local convert of the early outreach. Having learned from Maalim Mtondo, he later became the Imam of the Pumwani Mosque.\nDifferent preachers scattered in the countryside from 1900 to 1920, introducing Islam to areas around, Mt. Kenya, Murang’a, Embu, Meru, Nyeri and Kitui. This serious missionary move interior was out of personal enthusiasm with the influence being highly localized. Only a few Africans were converted, and the impact was short lived.\n\nMuslim traders introduced Islam to the western region between 1870 and 1885. The chief Mumia of Nabongo accorded the Swahili traders warm welcome. During an intertribal war, the Muslims assisted Chief Mumia to overcome his enemies. In return, one Idd day, Chief Mumia, his family and officials of his court converted to Islam. Henceforth, Islam spread to the surrounding areas of Kakamega, Kisumu, Kisii and Bungoma.\n\nThe Influence and the new trends in Islamic outreach\nAlthough the struggle for independence in Kenya was a very crucial time for all Kenyans, very little is documented on Muslim’s participation. Given that there were Muslims involved in the negotiation for the inclusion of the Kadhi courts in the Independent Kenya’s constitution, points to key Muslim involvement.\n\nEvents in the Muslim world from the nineteen-nineties, the experiences of crises and failures, power and success served as catalysts for the reassertion of Islam in public and private world, through a call for a return to true Islam. John Esposito sees the goal for the revivalisms as transformation of the society through Islamic formation of individuals at the grass roots (1999:20).\n\nThe growing religious revivalism in personal and public Islamic life, created awareness on Islamic beliefs, culminating to increased religious observance, building of mosques, prayer and fasting, proliferation of religious programming, publications, and emphasis on Islamic dress and values. Lately, Islamic reassertion in public life, like the quest for the upgrading of the Kadhi Courts in Kenya have not gone unnoticed (Esposito:1999:9).\n\nContemporary Islamic activisms are indebted to the ideology and organizational model of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhoods (Ikhwhan) led by Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb; and the Islamic Society Jamaat-I-Islami led by Mawlana Abul ala Mawdudi. Their ideas and methods of revivalism are observed in different parts of the world today. They blamed the west for misleading the Muslim leaders and the Muslim leaders for blindly following the European ways.\n\nWhereas the Qur’ān and Hadith are fundamental, in responding to the demands and challenges of modernity, revival movements are crucial in spreading and restoring true Islam. Prolonged Muslim awareness has led to attraction to Islam, giving the converted a sense of pride.\n\nMethods used in recent trends of Islamization, are twofold, some directed to the Muslims, and others reaching to non-Muslims. There has been increased social action, building of schools, health facilities, and relief food distribution. Moreover, proselytization is carried out through print media, broadcasting, increased formation of Missionary organizations, and organization of public debates (Mihadhara).\nJoseph M.

Dance has long been used by Jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions. Dancing was a favorite pastime and played a role in religious observance.\n\nDances associated with Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, especially Jewish wedding dances, are an integral part of Jewish life in America and around the world. Folk dances associated with Zionism and the formation of the State of Israel became popular in the 1950s.\n\nAmong Ashkenazi Jews dancing to klezmer music was an integral part of weddings in the shtetl. Jewish dance was influenced by local non-Jewish dance traditions, but there were clear differences, mainly in hand and arm motions, with more intricate legwork by the younger men. The religious community frowned on mixed dancing, dictating separate circles for men and women.\n\nIn Hasidic Judaism, dance is a tool for expressing joy and is believed to have a therapeutic effect: It purifies the soul, promotes spiritual elation and unifies the community.\n\nThe Horah is a Jewish circle dance typically danced to the music of \"Hava Nagila\". It is traditionally danced at Jewish weddings and other joyous occasions in the Jewish community. The hora was introduced in Israel by the Romanian Jewish dancer Baruch Agadati. In 1924, he worked together with a composer and songwriter to choreograph a show performed by the Ohel Theater Company, which toured the pioneer settlements of the Jezreel Valley. \"Horah Agadati,\" as the dance was known, became an instant success.\n\nThe Yemenite step (Tza'ad Temani) is a form of dancing based on hopping in place. Tza'ad Temani is typical of this dance form. The Tza'ad Temani is frequently incorporated in public dancing at Jewish weddings and celebrations. The Inbal Dance Theater specializes in Yemenite dancing in Israel.\n\nIn Russia and France, the Ballets Russes was \"primarily a Jewish creation,\" according to Paul Johnson. In the United States, Jewish choreographers and dancers have been leading figures in the dance world, among them Jerome Robbins, Anna Sokolow, Michael Bennett, Michael Kidd, Ron Field, Arthur Murray, Helen Tamiris and Pearl Lang. Lincoln Kirstein was one of the founders of the School of American Ballet, The American Ballet and the New York City Ballet.\n\nOne of the pioneers of modern dance in Israel was Gertrud Kraus, who immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1935 and formed a modern dance company affiliated with the Tel-Aviv Folk Opera. In 1950-1951, she founded the Israel Ballet Theatre, and became its artistic director. Contemporary dance in Israel is influenced by Israeli folk dance and European traditions. Dance companies include the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company, Inbal Dance Theater, Bat-Dor Dance Company and Batsheva Dance Company.\n\nIn 2010, Silvia Duran, an Israeli flamenco dancer, was honored by King Juan Carlos I of Spain for training generations of flamenco dancers at her studio in Tel Aviv, The citation was awarded for her \"contribution to the culture of Spain and the Spanish people.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "261924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261924", "title": "Kafir", "text": "Kafir\n\nKafir ( '; plural ', ' or '; feminine \"\") is an Arabic term (from the root K-F-R \"to cover\") meaning \"unbeliever\", or \"disbeliever\". The term alludes to a person who rejects or disbelieves in God as described by Islam according to the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and denies the dominion and authority of the Islamic god, and is thus often translated as \"infidel\". Muhammad Asad held \"infidels\" to be an erroneous translation of \"kafir\" made by several scholars and western Quran translations, since it is not synonymous with \"non-Muslim\"; thus, someone who does good deeds without any expectation of worldly rewards is not a \"kafir\". At the same time, \"kafir\" is sometimes used as a derogatory term, particularly by members of Islamist movements. Unbelief is called \"kufr\". \"Kafir\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"mushrik\" (, those who commit polytheism), another type of religious wrongdoer mentioned frequently in the Quran and other Islamic works. The practice of declaring another self-professed Muslim a \"kafir\" is known as \"takfir\". The person who denies the existence of a creator is called \"Dahriya\".\n\nThe word ' is the active participle of the root K-F-R. As a pre-Islamic term it described farmers burying seeds in the ground. One of its applications in the Quran is also the same meaning as farmer. Since farmers cover the seeds with soil while planting, the word ' implies a person who hides or covers. Ideologically, it implies a person who hides or covers the truth. Poets personify the darkness of night as kâfir, perhaps as a survival of pre-Islamic religious or mythological usage. The noun for disbelief, \"blasphemy\", \"impiety\" rather than the person who disbelieves, is \"kufr\".\n\nThe Hebrew words \"\"kipper\" and \"kofer\" share the same root as \"kafir\"\" כִּפֵּר, or K-F-R. \"Kipper\" has many meanings including, to \"deny\", \"atone for\", \"cover\", \"purge\", \"represent\", or \"transfer\". The last two meanings involve \"kofer\" that mean \"ransom\". \"Kipper\" and \"kofer\" are mostly likely used together in the Jewish faith to indicate God's transfer of guilt from innocent parties using guilty parties as \"ransom\".\n\nThe practice of declaring another Muslim as a \"kafir\" is \"takfir\". \"Kufr\" (unbelief) and \"shirk\" (polytheism) are used throughout the Quran and sometimes used interchangeably by Muslims. According to Salafist scholars, \"Kufr\" is the \"denial of the Truth\" (truth in the form of articles of faith in Islam), and \"shirk\" means devoting \"acts of worship to anything beside God\" or \"the worship of idols and other created beings\". So a mushrik may worship other things while also \"acknowledging God\".\n\nThe distinction between those who believe in Islam and those who do not is an essential one in the Quran, the book of Islam. \"Kafir\", and its plural \"kuffaar\", is used directly 134 times in Quran, its verbal noun \"kufr\" is used 37 times, and the verbal cognates of \"kafir\" are used about 250 times.\n\nBy extension of the basic meaning of the root, \"to cover\", the term is used in the Quran in the senses of ignore/fail to acknowledge and to spurn/be ungrateful. The meaning of \"disbelief\", which has come to be regarded as primary, retains all of these connotations in the Quranic usage. In the Quranic discourse, the term typifies all things that are unacceptable and offensive to the Islamic God. Charles Adams writes that the most fundamental sense of \"kufr\" in the Quran is \"ingratitude\", the willful refusal to acknowledge or appreciate the benefits that the Islamic God bestows on humankind, including clear signs and revealed scriptures.\n\nAccording to the \"E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936, Volume 4\", the term first applied in the Quran to unbelieving Meccans, who endeavoured \"to refute and revile the Prophet\". A waiting attitude towards the \"kafir\" was recommended at first for Muslims; later, Muslims were ordered to keep apart from unbelievers and defend themselves against their attacks and even take the offensive. Most passages in the Quran referring to unbelievers in general talk about their fate on the day of judgement and destination in hell.\n\nAccording to scholar Marilyn Waldman, as the Quran \"progresses\" (as the reader goes from the verses revealed first to later ones), the meaning behind the term \"kafir\" does not change but \"progresses\", i.e. \"accumulates meaning over time\". As the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's views of his opponents change, his use of \"kafir\" \"undergoes a development\". \"Kafir\" moves from being \"one\" description of Muhammad's opponents to the primary one. Later in the Quran, \"kafir\" becomes more and more connected with \"shirk\". Finally, towards the end of the Quran, \"kafir\" begins to also signify the group of people to be fought by the \"mu'minīn\" (believers).\n\nThe status of the People of the Book (\"ahl al-kitab\"), particularly Jews and Christians, with respect to the Islamic notions of unbelief is not clearcut. Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with \"kufr\" for rejecting Muhammad's message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God's unity. The Quranic verse 5:73 (\"Certainly they disbelieve [\"kafara\"] who say: God is the third of three\"), among other verses, has been traditionally understood in Islam as rejection of the Christian Trinity doctrine, though modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations. Other Quranic verses strongly deny the deity of Jesus Christ, son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will be doomed to eternal punishment in Hell. While the Quran does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself, it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel. Some Muslim thinkers such as Mohamed Talbi have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (5:19, 5:75-76, 5:119) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church.\n\nCyril Glasse criticizes the use of \"kafirun\" [pl. of \"kafir\"] to describe Christians as \"loose usage\". According to the \"Encyclopedia of Islam\", in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, \"ahl al-kitab\" are \"usually regarded more leniently than other \"kuffar\" [pl. of \"kafir\"]...\" and \"in theory\" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian: \"Thou unbeliever\".\n\nHistorically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as \"dhimmi\", while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as \"musta'min\".\n\n\"Mushrikun\" (pl. of \"mushrik\") are those who practice \"shirk\", which literally means \"association\" and refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside the god of the Muslims - Allah (as God's \"associates\"). The term is often translated as polytheism. The Quran distinguishes between \"mushrikun\" and People of the Book, reserving the former term for idol worshipers, although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of \"shirk\". \"Shirk\" is held to be the worst form of disbelief, and it is identified in the Quran as the only sin that God cannot pardon (4:48, 4:116).\n\nAccusations of \"shirk\" have been common in religious polemics within Islam. Thus, in the early Islamic debates on free will and theodicy, Sunni theologians charged their Mu'tazila adversaries with \"shirk\", accusing them of attributing to man creative powers comparable to those of God in both originating and executing his own actions. Mu'tazila theologians, in turn, charged the Sunnis with \"shirk\" on the grounds that under their doctrine a voluntary human act would result from an \"association\" between God, who creates the act, and the individual who appropriates it by carrying it out.\n\nIn classical jurisprudence, Islamic religious tolerance applied only to the People of the Book, while \"mushrikun\", based on the Sword Verse, faced a choice between conversion to Islam and fight to the death, which may be substituted by enslavement. In practice, the designation of People of the Book and the \"dhimmi\" status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples, such as Hinduism. Following destruction of major Hindu temples during the Muslim conquests in South Asia, Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent came to share a number of popular religious practices and beliefs, such as veneration of Sufi saints and worship at Hindu shrines.\n\nWhether a Muslim could commit a sin great enough to become a \"kafir\" was disputed by jurists in the early centuries of Islam. The most tolerant view (that of the \"Murdji'a\") was that even those who had committed a major sin (\"kabira\") were still believers and \"their fate was left to God\". The most strict view (that of Kharidji Ibadis, descended from the Kharijites) was that every Muslim who dies having not repented of his sins was considered a \"kafir\". In between these two positions, the \"Mu'tazila\" believed that there was a status between believer and unbeliever called \"rejected\" or \"fasiq\".\n\nThe Kharijites view that the self-proclaimed Muslim who had sinned and \"failed to repent had ipso facto excluded himself from the community, and was hence a kafir\" (a practice known as \"takfir\") was considered so extreme by the Sunni majority that they in turn declared the Kharijites \"kafir\",\nfollowing the hadith that declared, \"If a Muslim charges a fellow Muslim with \"kufr\", he is himself a \"kafir\" if the accusation should prove untrue\".\n\nNevertheless, in Islamic theological polemics \"kafir\" was \"a frequent term for the Muslim protagonist\" holding the opposite view, according to \"Brill's Islamic Encyclopedia\".\n\nAnother group that are \"distinguished from the mass of kafirun\" are the \"murtad\", or apostate ex-Muslims, who are considered renegades and traitors, the concept of freedom of religion not being accepted. Their traditional punishment is death, even, according to some scholars, if they recant their abandonment of Islam.\n\nNon-Muslims living under the protection of an Islamic state.\n\nMuslim belief/doctrine is often summarized in \"the Six Articles of Faith\", (the first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an 2:285).\n\n\nAccording to the Salafi scholar Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali, \"\"kufr\" is basically disbelief in any of the articles of faith. He also lists several different types of major disbelief, (disbelief so severe it excludes those who practice it completely from the fold of Islam):\n\n\nMinor disbelief or \"Kufran-Ni'mah \" indicates \"ungratefulness of God's Blessings or Favours\".\n\nAccording to another source, a paraphrase of the Tafsir by Ibn Kathir, there are eight kinds of \"Al-Kufr al-Akbar\" (major unbelief), some are the same as those described by Al-Hilali (\"Kufr-al-I'rad\", \"Kufr-an-Nifaaq\") and some different.\n\n\nIn Islam, jahiliyyah (\"ignorance\") refers to the time of Arabia before Islam. It may also refer to modern secularist states.\n\nWhen the Islamic empire expanded, the word \"kafir\" was used broadly for all pagans and anyone who disbelieved in Islam.\nHistorically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers \"impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom\" prevailed even to the time of the Crusades, particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey brought about application of the term \"kafir\" even to Persians in Turkish fatwas. During the era of European colonialism, the political decline of Islam impeded organized state action against the pressure from Western nations, and the resulting feeling of impotence contributed to a rise of hatred against unbelievers and its periodic manifestations, such as massacres.\n\nHowever, there was extensive religious violence in India between Muslims and non-Muslims during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire (before the political decline of Islam).\nIn their memoirs on Muslim invasions, enslavement and plunder of this period, many Muslim historians in South Asia used the term Kafir for Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains.\n\nRaziuddin Aquil states that \"non-Muslims were often condemned as \"kafirs\", in medieval Indian Islamic literature, including court chronicles, Sufi texts and literary compositions\" and fatwas were issued that justified persecution of the non-Muslims.\n\nRelations between Jews and Muslims in the Arab world and use of the word \"kafir\" were equally as complex, and over the last century, issues regarding \"kafir\" have arisen over the conflict in Israel and Palestine. Calling the Jews of Israel, \"the usurping kafir\", Yasser Arafat turned on the Muslim resistance and \"allegedly set a precedent for preventing Muslims from mobilizing against 'aggressor disbelievers' in other Muslim lands, and enabled 'the cowardly, alien kafir' to achieve new levels of intervention in Muslim affairs.\"\n\nA hadith in which Muhammad states that his father was in hell has become a source of disagreement about the status of Muhammad's parents. Over the centuries, Sunni scholars have dismissed this hadith despite its appearance in the authoritative \"Sahih Muslim\" collection. It passed through a single chain of transmission for three generations, so that its authenticity was not considered certain enough to supersede a theological consensus which stated that people who died before a prophetic message reached them—as Muhammad's father had done—could not be held accountable for not embracing it. Shia Muslims scholars likewise consider Muhammad's parents to be in Paradise. In contrast, the Salafi website IslamQA.info argues that Islamic tradition teaches that Muhammad's parents were \"kuffār\" (disbelievers) who are in Hell.\n\nBy the 15th century, the word Kaffir was used by Muslims in Africa to refer to the non-Muslim African natives. Many of those \"kufari\" were enslaved and sold by their Muslims captors to European and Asian merchants, mainly from Portugal, who by that time had established trading outposts along the coast of West Africa. These European traders adopted that Arabic word and its derivatives.\n\nSome of the earliest records of European usage of the word can be found in \"The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation\" by Hakluyt, Richard, 1552–1616. In volume 4, Hakluyt writes: \"calling them \"Cafars\" and \"Gawars\", which is, infidels or disbelievers. Volume 9 refers to the slaves (slaves called \"Cafari\") and inhabitants of Ethiopia (and they use to go in small shippes, and trade with the \"Cafars\") by two different but similar names. The word is also used in reference to the coast of Africa as \"land of Cafraria\". The 16th century explorer Leo Africanus described the \"Cafri\" as \"negroes\", and one of five principal population groups in Africa. He identified their geographical heartland as being located in remote southern Africa, an area which he designated as \"Cafraria\".\n\nBy the late 19th century the word was in use in English-language newspapers and books. One of the Union-Castle Line ships operating off the South African coast was named SS \"Kafir\". In the early twentieth century, in his book \"The Essential Kafir\", Dudley Kidd writes that the word \"\"kafir\" had come to be used for all dark-skinned South African tribes. Thus, in many parts of South Africa, \"kafir\"\" became synonymous with the word, \"native\". Currently in South Africa, however, the word \"kaffir\" is regarded as a racial slur, applied pejoratively or offensively to blacks.\n\nThe song \"Kafir\" by American technical death metal band Nile from their sixth album \"Those Whom the Gods Detest\" uses as subject matter the violent attitudes that Muslim extremists have toward Kafirs.\n\nThe Nuristani people were formally known as Kaffirs of Kafiristan before the Afghan Islamization of the region. Moreover, their native name was Kapir, due to the lack of a \"P\" in Arabic, they coincidentally were called Kafirs, which was incorrect but again correct since they were polytheists, moreover Henotheists.\n\nThe Kalash people located in the Hindu Kush mountain range south west of Chitral are known as Kafirs by the Muslim population of Chitral.\n\nIn modern Spanish, the word \"cafre\", derived from the Arabic \"kafir\" by way of Portuguese, also means \"uncouth\" or \"savage\".\n\n\nNon-Islam specific:\n\n"}
{"id": "56324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56324", "title": "Khat", "text": "Khat\n\nKhat or qat (\"Catha edulis\", \"qat\" from ) is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Khat contains the alkaloid cathinone, a stimulant, which is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria. Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat chewing has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of coca leaves in South America and betel nut in Asia.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) classified it in 1980 as a drug of abuse that can produce psychological dependence, although the WHO does not consider khat addiction to be seriously problematic. It is a controlled substance in some countries, such as Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while its production, sale, and consumption are legal in other nations, including Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen. Consumption of the plant's leaves in its natural state is also permitted in Israel. The plant has been targeted by anti-drug organizations such as the DEA.\nKhat goes by various traditional names, such as \"kat\", \"qat\", \"qaad\", \"ghat\", \"chat\", \"Abyssinian Tea\", \"Somali Tea\", \"Miraa\", \"Arabian Tea\", and \"Kafta\" in its endemic regions of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. In the African Great Lakes region, where \"Catha edulis\" is in some areas cultivated, it is known as \"miraa\", \"muhulo\" and \"muirungi\". In South Africa, the plant is known as \"Bushman's Tea\". Other names for khat include \"Chat Tree\" and \"Flower of Paradise\".\n\nKhat is a slow-growing shrub or tree that typically attains a height of . However, it can reach heights of up to in equatorial areas. The plant usually grows in arid environments, at a temperature range of . It has evergreen leaves, which are long and broad. The shrub's flowers are produced on short axillary cymes that are in length. Each flower is small, with five white petals. The samara fruit is an oblong, three-valved capsule, which contains one to three seeds.\n\nThe khat plant is known by a variety of names, such as \"qat\" and \"gat\" in Yemen, \"qaat\" and \"jaad\" in Somalia, and \"chat\" in Ethiopia. It is also known as \"jimaa\" in the Oromo language and mayirungi in Luganda Language. Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in the central region, Kasenge Nakawuka Road, Nkugulutale, Nisozi, Nsaggu and some parts of the western region of the country . In Kenya it is grown in Meru County.\nAlthough the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the Red Sea area, the khat plant has over the years found its way to Southern Africa as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands. The shrub is today scattered in the KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa, in addition to Swaziland and Mozambique.\n\nIts fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation; it also has anorectic (appetite-reducing) side effects. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew. In recent years, however, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity, and as a result, the plant has been reported in England, Wales, Rome, Amsterdam, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. In the United-States, freshly packed khat leaves are sold on the markets of New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas, where the demand is most high. Traditionally, khat is used as a socialising drug as in Yemen where khat-chewing is predominantly a male habit.\n\nKhat is so popular in Yemen that its cultivation consumes much of the country's agricultural resources. An estimated 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it, with production increasing by about 10% to 15% every year. One \"daily bag\" of khat requires an estimated of water to produce. Water consumption is high and groundwater levels in the Sanaa basin are diminishing, so government officials have proposed relocating large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea.\n\nOne reason for khat being cultivated in Yemen so widely is the high income it provides for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from cultivating khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while fruits brought only 0.57 million rials per hectare. Between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated was estimated to have grown from 8,000 to 103,000 hectares. In 2000, according to a World Bank estimate, khat accounted for 30% of Yemen’s economy.\n\nIn other countries, outside of its core area of growth and consumption, khat is sometimes chewed at parties or social functions. It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.\n\nIt takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer.\n\nKhat consumption induces mild euphoria and excitement, similar to that conferred by strong coffee. Individuals become very talkative under the influence of the plant. The effects of oral administration of cathinone occur more rapidly than the effects of amphetamine pills; roughly 15 minutes as compared to 30 minutes in amphetamine. Khat can induce manic behaviours and hyperactivity, similar in effects to those produced by amphetamine.\n\nThe use of khat results in constipation. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) are prominent during khat consumption, reflecting the sympathomimetic effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term use can precipitate permanent tooth darkening (of a greenish tinge), susceptibility to ulcers, and diminished sex drive.\n\nKhat is an effective anorectic, causing loss of appetite.\n\nIt is unclear if the consumption of khat directly affects the mental health of the user or not. Occasionally, a psychotic episode can result, resembling a hypomanic state in presentation.\n\n\n\n\nThe stimulant effect of the plant was originally attributed to \"katin\", cathine, a phenethylamine-type substance isolated from the plant. However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid cathinone was isolated, and its absolute configuration was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and norephedrine. These chemicals belong to the PPA (phenylpropanolamine) family, a subset of the phenethylamines related to amphetamines and the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine. Khat is sometimes confused with methcathinone (also known as \"cat\"), a Schedule I substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use.\n\nWhen khat leaves dry, the more potent chemical, cathinone, decomposes within 48 hours, leaving behind the milder chemical, cathine. Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.\n\nWhen the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the reuptake of epinephrine and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.\n\nReceptors for serotonin show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat. In mice, cathinone produces the same types of nervous pacing or repetitive scratching behaviours associated with amphetamines. The effects of cathinone peak after 15 to 30 minutes, with nearly 98% of the substance metabolised into norephedrine by the liver.\n\nCathine is somewhat less understood, being believed to act upon the adrenergic receptors causing the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. It has a half-life of about three hours in humans. The medication bromocriptine can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours.\n\nAn estimated 5 to 10 million people globally use khat on a daily basis. It is grown principally by communities in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula, where khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years.\n\nThe traditional form of khat chewing in Yemen involves only male users; khat chewing by females is less formal and less frequent. Researchers estimate about 70–80% of Yemenis between 16 and 50 years old chew khat, at least on occasion. Approximately 60-90% of male and 35% of female Yemenis chew khat daily. Prior to Yemeni unification in 1990, khat chewing was largely confined to the north-west mountains of the country, where khat grows. Yemenis spend an estimated 14.6 million man-hours per day chewing khat. Researchers have also estimated that families spend about 17% of their income on khat.\n\nAccording to some sources, khat was first grown in Ethiopia, with the explorer Sir Richard Burton suggesting the plant was later introduced to Yemen from Ethiopia in the 15th century. He specifically mentions the eastern city of Harar as the birthplace of the plant.\n\nHowever, amongst communities in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia) and the Arabian Peninsula, khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years.\n\nAncient Egyptian imperial cults considered the khat plant a sacred substance, which was capable of realizing a user's divinity. These early Egyptians consumed the plant ceremoniously in attempts to transcend into \"apotheosis\" and or garner and manifest mystical experiences, systemic trances, and other metaphysical experiences rather than habitual recreational use or abuse. Sufis also used it to intensify their mystical experience and to facilitate a sense of union with God.\n\nThe earliest known documented description of khat is found in the \"Kitab al-Saidala fi al-Tibb\" , an 11th-century work on pharmacy and materia medica written by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, a Persian scientist and biologist. Unaware of its origins, al-Bīrūnī wrote that khat is:\n\nIn 1854, Malay author Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir noted that the custom of chewing khat was prevalent in Al Hudaydah in Yemen:\n\nIn 1856, English writer Charles Dickens also described the custom of khat chewing in the Horn region and the adjacent Gulf territories, likening it to drinking strong green tea:\n\nNowadays khat consumption is limited to East Africa and South Western Arabia. These countries include Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia (includes Somaliland), Uganda, and Yemen. The author Yousif Al Zarouni writes in his book:\n\nFollowing a ban on khat in the British-governed Aden Protectorate, the Qāt Commission of Inquiry in Aden concluded: \"Qāt does not create an addiction, like opium or hashish, in that those who are suddenly deprived of it, do not suffer physical consequences.\"\n\nIn 1965, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs' \"Fourteenth Report\" noted, \"The Committee was pleased to note the resolution of the Economic and Social Council with respect to khat, confirming the view that the abuse of this substance is a regional problem and may best be controlled at that level.\" For this reason, khat was not scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. In 1980, the WHO classified the plant as a drug of abuse that can produce mild to moderate psychological dependence (less than tobacco or alcohol), although the WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive. It is a controlled or illegal substance in some countries, but is legal for sale and production in others.\n\nKhat is legal in Ethiopia.\n\nKhat is legal in Somalia.\n\nKhat is legal in Djibouti.\n\nKhat is legal in Kenya. However, two of its active components, cathinone and cathine, are classed as Class C substances.\n\nIn South Africa, \"Catha edulis\" is a protected tree.\n\nThe use of khat is illegal.\n\nMiraa is legal in Uganda but efforts are underway (October 2015) to ban it.\n\nKhat is illegal in China.\n\nKhat is regarded as a dangerous drug in Hong Kong. Traffickers can face a penalty up to HK$5 million as well as life imprisonment.\n\nKhat, called \"Gat\" in Israel, is consumed mainly by Yemenite Jews. The raw plant is also available for sale in several open markets. A cocktail of Arak and minced frozen khat, mixed with grapefruit juice, has become popular in the south of the country in recent years. However, as of June 2012, the Israeli anti-drug authority announced that beverages containing Khat are considered illegal as per the dangerous drug ordinance of the state of Israel. In 2003, Hagigat, a pill based on extracted cathinone, began to be sold in kiosks in Israel. Following several cases of hospitalisation, the Israeli Ministry of Health classified cathinone as a dangerous drug, and \"Hagigat\" was outlawed. The plant itself is allowed to be chewed and sold in its natural state, as no harm was found in normal quantities. Etrogat is a popular juice from Jerusalem sold by Uzi-Eli Hezi and also many variations of Khat juice can be found across Israel.\n\nKhat is illegal in Indonesia.\n\nKhat is illegal in Malaysia.\n\nKhat is illegal in the Philippines.\n\nKhat is illegal in Saudi Arabia.\n\nKhat is legal in Thailand.\n\nKhat is illegal in the United Arab Emirates under federal law number 14 of 1995 on the Countermeasures against Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Schedule No. 4, Part 2(5), provides for the prohibition of the cultivation and possession of Khat (Catha Edulis).\nThe possession and selling of Khat may lead to life imprisonment.\n\nKhat is legal in Yemen. However, cultivation of the crop and the selling of its leaves are governed by a series of regulations. In 2007, the Yemeni government passed a law that restricted the cultivation of khat in a number of agricultural flatlands and basins with high water stress. The Law Concerning the General Sales Tax in 2005 also set the tax rate on khat at 20% of its retail price.\n\nThe widespread cultivation of khat in Yemen has exacerbated a severe water shortage. Khat is much more water-intensive to grow than other crops. It has also played a major role in a famine in the country.\n\nKhat has been illegal in Belgium since 2006.\n\nKhat has been illegal in Denmark since 1993. In 2009, the Danish Health Authority investigated khat use among Somalis in Denmark. A questionnaire with 848 respondents was used. The responses indicated that 48% of Somali males and 16% of females used the narcotic on a monthly basis and that 29% of males and 6% of females used it two times or more a week. Half the respondents had never used khat. The responses indicated that Somalis constituted the great majority of users in Denmark.\n\nThe report also investigated attitudes towards khat use among Somalis in Denmark. In total 2 out of 3 state that khat is a problem for social integration into Danish society, while 1 of 3 users state this. Responses indicated that 2 out of 3 considered khat to be part of Somali culture, although 2 out of 3 stated that they agree that khat should be banned in Denmark.\n\nKhat is classified as an illegal drug in Finland, and possession, use and sale of the substance is prohibited and punishable. As with all illegal drugs, operating a motor vehicle with detectable levels of Khat or its metabolites in one's system can also lead to a conviction for driving under the influence, even if the driver does not appear intoxicated.\n\nKhat is prohibited in France as a stimulant.\n\nIn Germany, cathinone is listed as a \"non-trafficable substance\", which makes the possession, sale and purchase of fresh khat illegal. The derivative cathine is only available on prescription, while norephedrine is not listed.\n\nIn August 2010 the Icelandic police intercepted khat smuggling for the first time. 37 kg were confiscated. The drugs were most likely intended for sale in Canada. Again in May 2011 the police intercepted around 60 kg.\n\nKhat is a controlled drug for the purpose of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988. As such its unauthorised possession and supply is prohibited.\n\nKhat is inserted in the Table I of the Italian official list of psychoactive drugs under the name \"Catha edulis pianta\" (it. \"Catha edulis weed\") and thus detention is prohibited.\n\nIn the areas of Netherlands, the active ingredients of khat, cathine and cathinone, are qualified as hard drugs and forbidden. Use is mostly limited to the Somali community. In 2008 health minister Ab Klink decided against qualifying the unprocessed plant as drugs after consultation with experts. However, on 9 January 2012 the Dutch government announced a ban on khat.\n\nIn Norway, khat is classified as a narcotic drug and is illegal to use, sell and possess. Most users are Somali immigrants and khat is smuggled from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\n\nNorwegian Customs seized 10 metric tons of khat in 2010, an increase from less than 4 in 2006.\n\nIn 2016, Oslo municipality estimated 50-70% of Somali immigrant males to be habitual users.\n\nIn Poland, khat is a classified narcotic drug, and is illegal to use, sell and possess.\n\nKhat is illegal in Romania.\n\nThe drug was prohibited in Sweden in 1989, without research. In 2007, it was estimated that 30% of Somali males in Sweden were using khat. Smuggling seizures by police amounted to about 9 tonnes annually.\n\nIn Switzerland, khat is illegal. It is classified as a narcotic drug.\n\nKhat was made illegal in the UK on 24 June 2014. Concerns had been expressed by commentators, health professionals and community members about the use of khat in the UK, particularly by immigrants from Somalia, Yemen and Ethiopia. Studies of the effects of khat use by immigrants on their mental health suggested that there was a need for better research on khat-chewing and its possible link with psychiatric disorders; it also suggested that public discourse on the issue displayed elements of a moral panic. Some Somali community organisations also campaigned for khat to be banned. As a result of these concerns, the Home Office commissioned successive research studies to look into the matter, and in 2005, presented the question of khat's legal status before the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. After a careful review of the evidence, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended in January 2006 that the status of khat as a legal substance should remain for the time being.\n\nIn 2008, Conservative politician Sayeeda Warsi stated that a future Conservative government would ban khat. The website of the Conservative Party, which in 2010 became the larger party in a UK coalition government, previously stated that a Conservative government would \"Tackle unacceptable cultural practices by\", amongst other measures, \"classifying Khat\". In 2009, the Home Office commissioned two new studies in the effects of khat use and in June 2010, a Home Office spokesperson stated: \"The Government is committed to addressing any form of substance misuse and will keep the issue of khat use under close scrutiny\".\n\nDuring a parliamentary debate on the legality issue on 11 January 2012, Mark Lancaster, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Milton Keynes, stated that the importation of Khat into the UK stands at 10 tonnes every week.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said there was \"insufficient evidence\" that khat caused health problems. The ACMD said there was \"no evidence\" khat was directly linked with serious or organised crime, and was chewed to obtain a \"mild stimulant effect much less potent than stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine\".\n\nOn 3 July 2013, the British Home Secretary Theresa May announced that khat was to be banned in Britain, designating it a Class C substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.\n\nAlex Miller, a journalist from the Montreal, Canada-based magazine and television channel Vice, looked into the use of the substance and the potential impact of the ban for BBC nightly current affairs programme Newsnight and for a Vice documentary.\n\nKenyan MPs appealed to the UK not to \"condemn people\" by banning the herbal stimulant khat\n\nIn March 2014, the United Kingdom House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee announced that it would continue to lobby for the UK government not to go through with its intended ban on khat. The committee had shortly before also completed an inquiry and a report recommending that the British authorities refrain from banning the plant.\n\nOn 12 May 2014, the House of Lords passed a Motion to Approve the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Designation)(Amendment) (No. 2)(England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2014, in order to control \"Catha edulis\" as a Class C drug. An amendment was proposed stating that, \"this House regrets that Her Majesty’s Government’s plans for the introduction of the Order do not include provisions for a 12-month review of the impact of the reclassification of khat in view of the highly unusual community focus of its use, for putting a detailed policing strategy in place before a ban takes effect, or for a health strategy to prevent a transfer of addiction to other substances; and do not commit the Department for International Development to do more work with the government of Kenya to alleviate the effect of the reclassification on the Kenyan economy.\" However, the amendment was defeated by vote. The prohibition came into effect on 24 June 2014.\n\nIn January 2015, the \"Bristol Post\" reported that most khat houses in the city had closed down, \"forcing users to take the drug in their homes instead\". The local police had initially not sought to enforce the ban, giving users a grace period, but according to the \"Bristol Post\" had recently started to take action against khat use and had issued three warnings and a caution. Additionally, in September 2014 the police had seized 24 bags of dried khat from a property in Easton, but no arrests were made. Additionally, the Somali Resource Centre indicated that the ban seemed to have been effective, and that the prohibition had all but destroyed the import market since the plant has to be fresh in order to be consumed. A consultation with Somalis in Glasgow undertaken by the national voluntary organisation Fast Forward at the request of the Somali Association in Glasgow in October 2014 suggested that khat continues to be used in both fresh and dried forms by some Somalis in the city, and that the ban has also led some users to seek out other substances. The ban has reportedly served to increase the price of khat in the UK. Channel 4 News reported in September 2014 that prior to the ban, 20 tonnes of khat arrived at Heathrow Airport daily, and it would sell for £3 per bundle. After the ban, it was reportedly selling at £30 per bundle.\n\nIn Canada, khat is a controlled substance under Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA), meaning it is illegal to seek or obtain unless approved by a medical practitioner. Possession of khat for personal use is not an indictable offense in Canada. The maximum punishment for trafficking or possession with the intent of trafficking is ten years in prison.\n\nIn 2008, Canadian authorities reported that khat is the most common illegal drug being smuggled at airports.\n\nHowever, in 2012 the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a 2011 absolute discharge of a young woman who brought 34 kilograms of khat into Canada in 2009. According to the defence, the ruling recognises that there is no empirical evidence that khat is harmful. The courts in Quebec and Ontario continued to discharge the accused for bringing khat into Canada for the same reason (no evidence of harmfulness of khat) in 2014 and 2016.\n\nIn the United States, cathinone is a Schedule I drug, according to the US Controlled Substance Act. The 1993 DEA rule placing cathinone in Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning khat:\n\n\"Catha edulis\" (khat) is a stimulant narcotic that is similar to that of amphetamine and its congeners, not a drug as categorised by US FDA (United States Food & Drug Administration) and FDA import Alert #66-23 (published date 03/18/2011) states that \"Districts may detain, without physical examination, all entries of khat\", based on section 801(a) (3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act on the grounds that \"its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use.\"\n\nAs federal and local khat raids have often targeted immigrants from countries where khat is legal, issues of cultural misunderstanding have sometimes been raised.\n\nThe plant itself is specifically banned in Missouri:\nIn California, both the plant itself as well as cathinone, its active component, are illegal.\n\nIn Australia, the importation of khat is controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. It is illegal to import khat into Australia for personal use. Khat can only be imported for medical or scientific use.\n\nImporting khat without a permit is subject to fines or prosecution. In 2003, the total number of khat annual permits was 294 and the total number of individual khat permits was 202 however as of 1 December 2013, permits for the use of khat by individuals for recreational/cultural purposes are no longer issued. There are currently no plans by the Australian Government to amend the regulations to allow the importation of khat for personal use.\n\nKhat is listed as a Schedule 2 dangerous drug in Queensland, in the same category as cannabis. Legality in New South Wales is not clear.\n\nThe importation of Khat (Catha edulis) material (includes material that is fresh, dried, powdered, capsules or tablets) is prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Import) Regulations 1956 unless the person importing the material is the holder of both a license to import and a permit to import granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).\nBiosecurity Act 2015\n\nIn New Zealand, khat is listed as a Class C drug, in the same category as cannabis and codeine.\n\nIn South America, there is no legislation regarding khat; the active ingredients in the plant can be found in several weight control compounds sold in the continent.\n\nIn 2009, the University of Minnesota launched the Khat Research Program (KRP), a multidisciplinary research and training program focusing on the neurobehavioral and health effects of khat, led by Prof. Dr. Mustafa al'Absi. The program was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute for Drug Abuse of the United States. The inaugural event for the KRP was held in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, in December, 2009 in collaboration with the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) and its local affiliates.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11163970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11163970", "title": "List of New Testament uncials", "text": "List of New Testament uncials\n\nA New Testament uncial is a section of the New Testament in Greek or Latin majuscule letters, written on parchment or vellum. This style of writing is called \"Biblical Uncial\" or \"Biblical Majuscule\".\n\nNew Testament uncials are distinct from other ancient texts based on the following differences:\n\nIn 1751, New Testament theologian Johann Jakob Wettstein knew of only 23 uncial codices of the New Testament. By 1859, Constantin von Tischendorf had increased that number to 64 uncials, and in 1909 Caspar René Gregory enumerated 161 uncial codices. By 1963, Kurt Aland, in his \"Kurzgefasste Liste\", had enumerated 250, then in 1989, finally, 299 uncials.\n\nWettstein inaugurated the modern method of classification. He used capital Latin letters to identify the uncials. Codex Alexandrinus received the letter \"A\", Codex Vaticanus – \"B\", Codex Ephraemi – \"C\", Codex Bezae – \"D\", until he arrived at the last letter used by him, \"O\". Succeeding generations used this pattern, but newly discovered manuscripts soon exhausted the Latin alphabet. As a result, letters of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets began to be used. Tischendorf, for example, assigned the Codex Sinaiticus the Hebrew letter א. Uncial 047 received siglum ב, Uncial 048 received ב, Uncial 075 received ג, Codex Macedoniensis – ו, to name a few. When Greek and Hebrew letters ran out, Gregory assigned uncials numerals with an initial 0 (to distinguish them from the symbols of minuscule manuscripts). Codex Sinaiticus received the number 01, Alexandrinus – 02, Vaticanus – 03, Ephraemi – 04, etc. The last uncial manuscript known by Gregory received number 0161. Ernst von Dobschütz expanded the list of uncials through 0208 in 1933.\n\nHowever, the 322 currently catalogued does not provide a precise count of all the New Testament Greek uncials. Uncial 0168 has been lost and over thirty manuscripts are associated with a smaller set of designations. Sometimes one number also applies to two separate manuscripts, as with uncial 092a and 092b, 0121a and 0121b, and 0278a and 0278b. Some other numerical designations should be reallocated to other lists: 055 (commentary), 0100 (lectionary), 0129 (lectionary), 0152 (talisman), 0153 (ostracon), 0192 (lectionary), 0195 (lectionary), 0203 (lectionary). Uncial 0212 from the 3rd or 4th century is more properly a witness to the Diatessaron than to the New Testament itself. So, the number 322 is merely nominal; the actual figure should be somewhat lower. Conversely, minuscule 1143, known as \"Beratinus 2\", has some parts that were written in semi-uncial letters.\n\n<br>\n† Indicates the manuscript has damaged or missing pages.\n[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, is destroyed or presumed destroyed.\n\nOnly one uncial, Codex Sinaiticus has a complete text of the New Testament. Codex Alexandrinus has an almost complete text. It contains all books of the New Testament but lacks some leaves of Matthew (25), John (2), and Second Corinthians (3). Codex Vaticanus lacks the four last books, and the Epistle to the Hebrews is not complete. Codex Ephraemi has approximately 66 per cent of the New Testament. Uncials with designations higher than 046 typically have only one or two leaves.\n\nThe first 45 uncials have been assigned descriptive names as well as a single letter code called a \"siglum\", for usage in academic writing. Beginning with uncial 046 the assignment of \"sigla\" was dropped and only a few manuscripts thereafter received a descriptive name.\n\nBeginning with 046, the use of identifying \"sigla\" was dropped, and very few uncials were given identifying names.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39621634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39621634", "title": "Léonce Rosenberg", "text": "Léonce Rosenberg\n\nLéonce Rosenberg (12 September 1879 in Paris – 31 July 1947 in Neuilly-sur Seine) was an art historian, art collector, publisher and one of the most influential French art dealers of the 20th century. The son of an antique dealer Alexander Rosenberg and brother of the gallery owner Paul Rosenberg (21 rue de la Boétie, Paris), Léonce, a prominent gallery owner in Paris at the end of World War I, would become one of the world's major dealers of Modern art.\n\nLeaving the family-owned gallery in 1910 Léonce opened his own business called \"Haute Epoque\" at 19 rue de La Baume, Paris. As an antiquarian Rosenberg began buying works by Cubist artists. By 1914 his collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Auguste Herbin, and Juan Gris. After serving in World War I (1916-1917) he pursued his interests and represented these and other artists, and by the end of the war opened a new show space, .\n\nLéonce Rosenberg studied in London and Antwerp visiting galleries and museums in his free time. After returning to Paris he worked with his brother Paul in the family business. In 1906 Léonce and his brother inherited the family gallery on Avenue de l'Opéra which had been in existence for twenty years. His brother Paul was largely engaged in 19th- and early 20th-century art.\n\nLéonce Rosenberg was an early advocate of Cubism, and would remain so throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He discovered the works of avant-garde artists in 1911 through the Salon des Indépendants, the art dealer Wilhelm Uhde, and in 1912 at the gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler.\nAt the outset of World War I many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a German citizen Kahnweiler took refuge in Switzerland and ran out of funds. With his art collection the hand of the French government he could no longer support his artists. Following the advice of Max Jacob and André Level (known for his well informed art investments), Léonce Rosenberg began amassing his collection. Just before the outbreak of World War I Rosenberg purchased 15 Cubist works by Picasso for 12,000 FF. His collection would soon include 20 works by Picasso, 10 by Georges Braque, 5 by Juan Gris and 20 by Auguste Herbin.\n\nVery quickly and despite his lack of experience Rosenberg became the official dealer of the Cubists purchasing works, in addition to those he already owned, by artist such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Joseph Csaky, Henry Laurens, Georges Valmier and . Throughout World War I Rosenberg served as a moral and financial supporter of these artists. 'Without him' noted Max Jacob, 'a number of painters would be drivers or factory workers'.\n\nPicasso eventually switched over to his brother Paul Rosenberg's gallery, who would become his dealer Entre Deux Guerres.\n\nRosenberg volunteered for military service in 1915. He moved into a house at rue Marthe Édouard in Meudon near the military base, but also retained his Paris apartment at 22 rue Lavoisier and his Hôtel particulier 19 Rue de la Baume in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. During his periods of leave he continued to purchase Cubist works. From May, 1916, Rosenberg worked outside his unit as an English interpreter at the field headquarters of the Allied forces on the Somme front. During leave at the end of 1916 Rosenberg, through the intermediary of Juan Gris, went to Gino Severini's studio and bought a large painting of Woman Reading; possibly Severini's 1916 \"Femme lisant (Jeanne dans l’atelier; La lecture n. 1)\". The death of Umberto Boccioni during the month of August 1916 marked Severini's rupture from Futurism and his move closer to the Cubists.\n\nIn March 1917, the second line of defense cleared Rosenberg's unit moved to Le Havre. In July of the same year Rosenberg returned to his old unit, now stationed at an airport in Nanterre. Closer to Paris, Rosenberg decided to reopen his gallery.\n\nWith the support given by Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism reemerged as a central issue for artists after four years of war. Rosenberg found himself financially ruined but exhibited the works he owned at his newly opened Galerie de L'Effort Moderne (also known as \"Galerie Léonce Rosenberg\") at 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris. The gallery was open to all forms of Cubist and Abstract art. What followed would be a series of major one-man exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists.\n\nThe first solo exhibition was held in March 1918, featuring works by Auguste Herbin. In December of the same year, Rosenberg launched a series of Cubist exhibitions, beginning with Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive, despite claims by critics to the contrary, and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to art historian Christopher Green, \"this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its \"new collective form\" marked by \"intellectual rigor\". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction\".\n\nRosenberg also organized literary and musical events in his gallery.\n\nThe art collections of Kahnweiler and Uhde sequestered at the outset of World War I (which included works by Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, Juan Gris, Auguste Herbin, Marie Laurencin, Fernand Léger, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, Jean Puy and Henri Rousseau) were sold by the government in a series of auctions at the Hôtel Drouot in 1921. Rosenberg had himself appointed as 'expert' for the sales.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927, Rosenberg made his activities known through his \"Bulletin de l'Effort moderne\" (Éditions de l'effort moderne), a publication featuring writings and illustrations by contributors such as Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini.\n\nIn 1928 Rosenberg moved his personal collection to his apartment rue de Longchamp, Paris, and commissioned the artists he championed to realize decorative panels. Giorgio de Chirico painted large panels for his living room. After 1928 exhibitions became sporadic, featuring solo exhibitions by de Chirico, Metzinger, and Valmier.\n\nRosenberg commissioned Albert Gleizes (replacing Gino Severini) in 1929 to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence. They were installed in 1931.\n\nIn 1930 and 1932, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne presented two large exhibitions of works by Francis Picabia.\n\nA veritable center of activity and interest during the rise of modern art, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne closed permanently in 1941, as a result of anti-Semitic laws and by the threat of the Nazi occupation of France. Eventually, the Nazi authorities looted some of his collection. The gallery was not reopened following the war due primarily to Rosenberg’s death in July 1947.\n\n\nCrystal Cubism\n\n\n"}

According to Islam, there are two kinds of najis: the essential najis which cannot be cleaned and the unessential najis which become najis while in contact with another najis.\n\nContact with \"najis\" things brings a Muslim into a state of ritual impurity ( \"najāsa\", in opposition to ṭahārah, ritual purity). Ritual purification is then required before religious duties such as regular prayers are performed.\n\nAccording to the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, as systematised by Al-Nawawi in his book \"Minhadj\", the following things are \"najis\": wine and other spirituous drinks, dogs, swine, dead animals that were not ritually slaughtered, blood, excrements, and the milk of animals whose meat Muslims are not allowed to eat. Spirituous drinks are not impure according to the Hanafi school, while living swine and dogs are not impure according to the Malikis. There is a difference of opinion as to whether alcoholic drinks are \"najis\".\n\nTo the list of impure things enumerated by al-Nawawi, Shi’a jurists traditionally add dead bodies and non-believers.\n\nAdditionally, meat of any animal which is killed in a manner other than that prescribed by Islam is najis.\n\n\"Najis\" things cannot be purified, in contrast to things which are defiled only (\"mutanajis\"), with the exception of wine, which becomes pure when made into vinegar, and of hides, which are purified by tanning.\n\nIt is possible to purify a thing which has become \"najis\". These muṭahhirāt agents that can purify \"najis\" can be divided into three groups:\n\n“He (Allah) is the one who sends the winds as good news before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the cloud.\" (25:48)\nAccording to the shari'ah, water can be of two types: muṭlaq and muḍāf. Muṭlaq is pure water without putting it to a scientific test. The five forms of \"muṭlaq\" are the following: rain, well water, running or flowing water (river or stream), Kur water (lake, sea or ocean), and less than kur. Muḍāf is mixed water as in tea or kool aid. \n\n\n\nNot all of these agents can purify every \"najis\". However, among the agents water is the most universal purifying agent while the other agents are limited.\n\nThe notions of ritual impurity come mainly from the Qur'an and hadith. Swine and blood are declared forbidden food in the Qur'an.\n\n\n"}

But there is evidence of New Fire ceremonies having been celebrated in civilizations other and earlier than the Aztecs, for example at Xochicalco in the 6th century. According to Bernardino de Sahagún, the last New Fire ceremony was held in 1507; the tradition ended with the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1519–1521.\n\nThe fact that New Fire ceremonies had been celebrated before the rise of the Aztec empire suggests that the Aztecs had inherited the ceremony from earlier civilizations of central Mexico and that it was not an original Aztec invention. The Anales de Tlatelolco mention that the Aztecs upon achieving independence of the Tepanec state celebrated a New Fire ceremony that marked the beginning of the calendric count of the Aztecs. This suggests that the ceremony was also used as a dynastic foundation rite.\n\nThe Celebration of the New Fire ceremony is described by Tovar. During the last five days (called nemontemi) of the last year of the cycle, the preparations for the ceremony began. These preparations involved abstinence from work, fasting, ritual cleansing, ritual bloodletting, destruction of old household items and observance of silence. It was believed that during these days the world was in grave danger because of the instability inherent in the shift from one cycle to another. It was feared that female stellar deities, the Tzitzimime, would descend and devour the earth.\n\nAt sunset on the last day of the year, which it always happened during the birth of Huitzilopochtli, the day-sign \"1 Tecpatl\" of the year \"2 Acatl,\" a procession of priests from the fire cult of Huehueteotl walked from the ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan across the eastbound causeway towards a mountain called \"Huixachtlan\" on the eastern bank of Lake Texcoco close to Colhuacan. The summit of Huizachtlan was visible from most of the Basin of Mexico. On this extinct volcano was a temple platform. At this time all fires in the Aztec realm were put out and everyone looked toward the mountain's summit. When the constellation called by the Aztecs \"the fire drill\" (Orion's belt) rose above the horizon, a man was sacrificed on the top of Huizachtlan and a fire drill was placed on his chest. When the first sparks of fire sprung from the fire drill, the New Calendar Round was declared begun and a huge bonfire was lit. From this bonfire torches were carried by runners to every ward of the city where the temple hearths would be lit. The first fires to be lit in this way were those at the twin temple Templo Mayor where the Tlatoani would participate, and later the fires at the Calmecac of Huitzilopochtli and subsequently the lesser temples and Calmecacs and Telpochcallis and lastly private households.\n\nIt has been proposed that archaeological evidence of New Fire ceremonies can be found in the shape of dumps of pottery and households utensils discarded in the initial stage of the celebration. The idea was first proposed by George C. Vaillant in the 1930s but his model was criticized as theoretically unfounded and abandoned. In 2001 Elson and Smith rethought the proposal in light of the findings of several ceramic dumps that seemed to match the idea of what remains of New Fire ceremony would look like. They conclude that New Fire ceremonies were held throughout the Aztec sphere of influence and had a distinct importance at both the local level of each household and in the larger political level of the state religion.\n\n\n"}

Usually when an infant reaches four months of age or when a child becomes an adolescent, an Okuyi ritual is applied as well. Today, the Mekuyo rite is exercised by a range of ethnic peoples within the Bantu cluster. The coastal community known as Ndowe, also known as \"playeros\", is a primary example, as peoples across Equatorial Guinea frequently perform the ritual in public. Gabon has two chief ethnic groups that exercise the Okuyi rite including the Mpongwe and Galwa from Lambaréné, Gabon. The man in the custome is usually the leader of the group.\n\nThe history of the Mekuyo can be traced back to Gabon. The dance is believed to have originated from the rites of passages initiated by western and southern ethnic groups like the Mpongwe and from the Galwa region. It was in the mid-nineteenth century when the Benga people, who are both native to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, introduced the ethnic performance to the island of Corisco and Cabo San Juan. At the end of the century, the coastal group of the Kombe people had extended the routine to Mbini. By the beginning of the twentieth century, several clans in Bata such as the \"Punta Mbonda\" had embraced the Mekuyo tradition. Throughout the Mekuyo’s history there have been several famous Ukuyi performers. Some of the most famous are from Equatorial Guinea such as \"Alonga\" from Corisco and \"Boso bua Ndondjo\" from Mbini. Well known Okuyi dancers from the Litoral Province include \"Kungulu\", \"Ngadi\", \"Aduma\" and \"Ngüende a limba\" from Ekuku.\n\nThe typical Okuyi performer wears a large, loose costume that supposedly resembles the spirit of the clan members’ ancestors. The ancestors are illustrated by the dancers as tranquil and serene and suggest that they were the people who safeguarded, counselled, and educated them from the residence of the deceased. Okuyi costumes are made either from the raffia palm, a tree native to tropical African nations, or bamboo. In the process of manufacture, the underlying outfit is produced using the woven fabric hessian. The thick textile forms the suit for the performer. After that design is complete, the material is covered by frills made from raffia palm which are woven into the hessian fabric. Performers usually wear black socks made of cotton on their feet as well as on their hands. Every dancer carries through his presentation wearing a mask made of a soft local wood known in Ndowe as \"ikuka\" (\"Alstonia congensis\"), a species from the evergreen tree genus Alstonia. The man in the costume is usually the leader of the group.\n\nIn Gabon, the styles and colors generally remain the same throughout the country but in Equatorial Guinea, the types change depending on the location within the country. Hanging down from the mouth of the Okuyi is the skin of the servaline genet (\"Genetta servalina\"), a small forest cat. The skin has the role of protecting the Okuyi from bad spirits that threaten him. There is a relation with the Egyptian mythology of the feline type accompanying the journey of the soul of the dead, to the underworld. For the dead Okuyi who embodies the soul as well from the underworld simbolised by the genetta skin hanging from the mouth of the mask. The face masks on each performer is essential to identify the Okuyi. In Equatorial Guinea each mask differs from one another, however, in Gabon, the design has been kept constant since the nineteenth century. The design is basically a black chin and a black forehead with white covering the cheeks and upper face sides. The dark red eyes remain closed, as a sign that the person represented is dead. This contrasts with masks from Equatorial Guinea as the face masks range from geometrical forms to human faces. The majority of the masks have the eyes closed and very few have them open. Some masks that Mekuyo wear have a mirror attached on the forehead which also is used as a talisman. Mekuyo dancers also wear a cape known as an \"ecapa\" which is usually white and often features both the name of the Okuyi dancer, his birthplace and his birthdate.\n\nIn Equatorial Guinea, there are commonly three principal colors painted on the wooden mask: white, red and black. These three colors represent diverse aspects which are illustrated to the audience but are mainly targeted to the initiated person who is the centre of the rite of passage. The colors on the mask aim to link in cosmogony to the ritual as the Mekuyo tradition is related to cosmos which are the customary dwellings of the spirits. The black on the mask typically symbolises darkness and death. The red displays the fight a person must perform during life, the strength needed to do so, the blood involved and the birth. The white demonstrates life, semen and the ancestors which the mask is supposed to portray.\n\nThere are many types of Okuyi rituals exercised in several countries across Africa. In Equatorial Guinea, performances generally last approximately three hours, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. mostly on Sundays. Performances usually consist of the Ukuyi dancer dancing in short and fast episodes as he stomps his feet on the ground usually to a beat played by three drums and wooden sticks. At the same time, a female chorus sing in the background chanting greetings and welcomes to the Mekuyo. Usually the Okuyi holds palm leaves or tall \"ibito\" branches or spears which gives them balance. The \"malanga\" leaves known as \"poto\" are used as a medium to plant the \"ibito\". Palm branches are used to bless the members of the audience. The \"ibito\" is traditionally planted into the ground by the Mekuyo at the beginning of the ceremony in front of the chorus. The base of the \"ibito\" plant has a sack held by several \"poto\" leaves holding numerous barks from a variety of trees. This is supposed to provide security for the Mekuyo as well as for the members of the crowd.\n\nIn all performances, the Mekuyo are assisted by the \"Mboni\", which are a group of initiated young men who have the responsibility to care and assist the Mekuyo and encourage the dancing and singing. The \"Mboni\" also have the job to groom and carry the masks. The Okuyi’s identity is strictly secret and nobody in the audience is meant to know who is under the costume. The \"Mboni\" might become an Okuyi in the future. They are typically meant to be very agile and skilful dancers and musicians as well.\n\nOne of the most common types of rituals is for new mothers and their babies. When an infant reaches about four months of age, it is taken for a Mekuyo rite of passage where it enters another stage of his or her life. In the past, the Ukuyi used to take the baby from the mother and most of the time the baby didn't cry. As the baby was entering its new stage, a chorus chanted around the baby. Together they sang several songs, one of them being a tune about a panther taking the baby. However, in the present, the mother is permitted to hold the infant at all times in most of the rites. The actual ritual involves the mother and child being placed in the centre of the ring surrounded by the chorus and the audience, the mother holds the baby and sits on a chair. The Okuyi points at the baby with the \"malanga\" or sometimes a spear as a way to bless them. Then, water which has been previously placed in a bucket is sprinkled on the baby. The Okuyi dances around the baby and mother as they sit.\n\nThe Mekuyo are known for their intermittent dances. In funeral performances the primary mourner traditionally sits on a chair in the middle of an open area and surrounding him or her is an Okuyi dancing in his normal method similar to the new mother's rite \"djae\". Like during most of the dances, the Mekuyo uses the palm, fern leaves or skins to bless both the mourner and the members of the audience.\n\nThe songs featured in the Mekuyo presentations are normally in a polyrhythmic style. The instruments used are a certain type of drum known as Ngoma drums with the biggest kind being named the \"monduma\". Traditionally, these drums used to be buried in the trunk of various banana trees. It is this that caused the sound to be heard as a deeper pitch. This was accompanied by the \"mosomba\" drum or, as it was called by the Kombe people, the \"ikubi\". However, substitutes for drums are often used. One of the most common alternatives is a metal bucket filled with stones.\n\nChants that are sung with the instruments are sometimes done in the old Benga language, proving incomprehensible for the actual people who perform them and listen to them. Often however, the tunes are sung in the language of the people who chant them. The songs’ introductions are commenced by the males who give the first opening tones. Then the women follow. Women are the key voices of the chorus in Mekuyo dances as the Okuyi requires the female voice to dance appositely. The lyrics of the melodies the choir sings educate the listeners about everyday life possessions, experiences and traditional folklore. A common theme is reality of the Ndowe kinfolk or events that have happened to important people of the community in the past. The songs are an important way to communicate historical knowledge. This information is then passed to others through the singing and used as an expression to form a frame of the dances of the Mekuyo. In funerals, the Mekuyo music and dance is used to break the mourning period and bring hope to all the mourners for the future.\n\n"}

While never released as an official single, it is one of the best known songs among their early work. \"Opiate\" serves as the final track of the \"Opiate\" EP and contains the hidden track, \"The Gaping Lotus Experience.\"\n\nThe song's title and lyrics apparently elaborate on the Marxist concept that \"religion is the opium of the masses\". Keenan's lyrics liken religion to rape and abuse by a person or group of people to another person or group of people. The lyric \"deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow, what you need is someone strong to guide you\" supports this notion. Sometimes when played live, Keenan sings \"...what you need is someone strong to \"use\" you\".\n\n\"Opiate\" has held a regular position on Tool's concert setlist since 1992. In 1994, it was often played back-to-back with \"Flood,\" transitioning smoothly between songs and skipping the lengthy \"Flood\" intro. By 1996, \"Opiate\" would often serve as the penultimate song of concerts, preceding \"Ænema.\" Maynard James Keenan has dedicated the song to psychologist and author Timothy Leary on multiple occasions and to former Tool bassist Paul D'Amour on others, referring to him as \"Paul of Love.\"\n\nVarious musicians have collaborated with Tool in performing \"Opiate\" live. Examples include Layne Staley in 1993 and '94, Tricky in 2001, and Heitham Al-Sayed in 2006. Nu metal band Limp Bizkit has also been known to have covered the song live. Keenan has since criticized the band.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43970316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43970316", "title": "Pratiyogitvam", "text": "Pratiyogitvam\n\nPratiyogitvam, a Sanskrit term, means recognizing 'difference' by noting the 'otherness' in another thing; 'difference' means - 'the want of the total characteristic of one thing in another'. Differences are of three kinds – a) 'difference existing in oneself' (\"svajātiya-bheda\"), b) 'difference in species' (\"svagata-bheda\"), and c) 'difference of genus' (\"vijātiya-bheda\"). These differences do not exist in Brahman who is one without a second. The Upanishads negate these differences in Brahman who is self-revealing and can be experienced when all mentations cease, what is then experienced is not nothing, for there can be no knowledge of a thing that does not exist.\n\nAfter explaining that creation means the appearance of names and forms which cannot be parts of Brahman, for before creation they did not arise, and that one object differs from another on account of its name and form whereas Brahman is absolutely without name and form, with regard to 'non-existence', Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (Stanza II-25) tells us:\n\nIn which context, Swami Swahananda explains that to speak of 'difference' from a thing which does not exist conveys no meaning. The world is not really real so it cannot stand on the same footing. \"Bheda\" means 'difference', or 'not itself or the same but another'. \"Pratiyogitvam\", a technical term, means recognizing 'difference' by noting the 'otherness' in another thing.\n\n'Non-existence' is something that appears and is later negated or contradicted; the falsehood of an appearance (\"Mithyatva\") consists in the fact that its existence may be denied, in all the three temporal relations, in the locus or the entity where it is perceived. The illusory object is both, existent and non-existent; it appears as existent, but is yet not such an existent which remains un-contradicted in the past, present and future. \"Mithya\", in Advaita Vedanta,is not to be understood as illusion; \"mithya\" is that which is not unreal because it appears, but is not real since later it disappears; so too is it with Maya. Gaudapada tells us that the utility of the objects seen in the waking state is contradicted by the dream state; objects have to be regarded as \"mithya\" since they have a beginning and an end.\n\nThe word \"Pratiyogin\" (Sanskrit: ) means opposing, counteracting, impeding, related or corresponding to, being or forming a counterpart of anything, equally matched, an object dependent upon another, counter-entity; it also means uninterrupted succession.\n\nAccording to Madhvacharya the counter-correlate (\"pratiyogi\") in the case of absolute negation, which is limitless, is the absolutely non-existent itself; non-existence is also called the negation whose counter-correlate is a myth. Being the counter-correlate is not an attribute which requires or presupposes the actual existence of a referent like other predications of attributes like colour; to be the counter-correlate of a negation is merely being the referent of such knowledge as would enable the formation of the idea of negation.\n\nIt is the cognition of distinctness which gives rise to an expectation about a counter-positive i.e. to a counter-correlate.\n\nThus, 'being' is defined as that which at all times and in all places cannot be denied or which being different from non-being, is not a false imposition or as that which at some time or other is directly and rightly felt as existing. And, difference between genera are apprehended along with counter-correlates, which are remote in space and time. Perception of \"Svarupa\" ('one’s own form') and \"Bheda\" ('difference') is immediate upon an encounter with the object.\n\nIn the context of Brahma Sutras (IV.1) which refers to the 'inferred entity' (\"Pradhana\") of the \"Samkhya\"s, Shankara explains that the term, \"Avyakta\" (which is not manifest) can be applied equally to any other subtle and inscrutable thing, and does not conventionally mean any particular thing; the identity of a thing cannot be established merely from the similarity of the order of treatment unless the nature of the thing itself is recognized as identical. The Supreme Self is presented by Katha Upanishad (I.iii.10) as the master of the chariot, that is so because the experiencer can reasonably be superior to the objects of experience.\n\nKena Upanishad (I.5) prohibits meditation on Brahman because Brahman is beyond the range of speech and mind, and because the attribute-less Brahman cannot be an object of knowledge. Swami Swahananda in the context of 'leading' error being potent enough to give correct results states that meditation on or worship of Brahman can lead to liberation even though the form of Brahman worshipped is illusory. As long as the delusion of identifying the body with Brahman prevails, a man will not realise identity of the individual self with the Supreme self.\n"}
{"id": "234523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234523", "title": "Proselytism", "text": "Proselytism\n\nProselytism () is the act of attempting to convert people to another religion or opinion. The word \"proselytize\" is derived from the Greek language prefix (, \"toward\") and the verb (, \"to come\") in the form of (, \"newcomer\"). Historically in the Koine Greek Septuagint and New Testament, the word proselyte denoted a Gentile who was considering conversion to Judaism. Though the word proselytism originally referred to Early Christianity (and earlier Gentiles such as God-fearers), it now refers to the attempt of any religion or religious individuals to convert people to their beliefs, or any attempt to convert people to a different point of view, religious or not. Proselytism is illegal in some countries.\n\nIn the writings of the Bahá'í Faith, the endeavour to attract people to the religion is strongly emphasized. The process of attracting people to the religion is referred to as teaching. The term proselytism is given the connotation of aggressively teaching the religion to others - as such, it is prohibited.\n\nEvery Bahá'í has the obligation of teaching their religion, as it is seen as the path toward bringing peace and justice to the world. Some Bahá'ís move to other countries or cities where there are a small number of Bahá'ís to help spread the religion, and this is called pioneering. Some other Bahá'ís move from place to place in a process called travel teaching. When moving or travelling to other countries Bahá'ís are encouraged to integrate into their new society and apply Bahá'ís principles in living and working with their neighbours. In total, however, only a small minority of Bahá'ís are directly teaching their religion to others. Despite this, religion has grown \"at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region\" over the last century.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote that those who would be teaching his religion should emphasize the importance of ethics and wisdom, and he counselled Bahá'ís to be unrestrained and put their trust in God. At the same time he stated that Bahá'ís should exercise moderation, tact and wisdom and not be too aggressive in their teaching. In sharing their faith with others, Bahá'ís are cautioned to make sure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they have to say. In most countries becoming a Bahá'í is a simple matter of filling out a card stating a declaration of belief. This includes acknowledgement of Bahá'u'llah as the messenger of God for this age, awareness and acceptance of his teachings, and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws he established. It does not involve negating one's previous beliefs, due to the Bahá'í belief in progressive revelation.\n\nMany Christians consider it their obligation to follow what is often termed the Great Commission of Jesus, recorded in the final verses of the Gospel of Matthew: \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\" The Acts of the Apostles and other sources contain several accounts of early Christians following this directive by engaging in individual conversations and mass sermons to spread the Good News. Evangelical Christians often use the term \"witnessing\" to mean discussing one's faith with another person with the intent of proselytism.\n\nMost self-described Christian groups have organizations devoted to missionary work which in whole or in part includes proselytism of the non-religious and people of other faiths (including sometimes other variants of Christianity).\n\nSome Christians define \"proselytize\" more narrowly as the attempt to convert people from one Christian tradition to another; those who use the term in this way generally view the practice as illegitimate and in contrast to evangelism, which is converting non-Christians to Christianity. An Eastern Orthodox writer, Stephen Methodius Hayes, has written: \"If people talk about the need for evangelism, they meet with the response, 'the Orthodox church does not proselytize' as if evangelizing and proselytism were the same thing.\" However the boundary varies from group to group.\nFor instance the Moscow Patriarchate has repeatedly strongly condemned what it describes as Catholic proselytism of Orthodox Christians within Russia and has therefore opposed a Catholic construction project in an area of Russia where the Catholic community is small. The Catholic Church claims that it is supporting the existing Catholic community within Russia and is not proselytizing. In 1993 the Balamand declaration on proselytism was released between the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Churches.\n\nProselytisation is not alien to Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism although they are largely pluralistic.\n\nBuddhism does not have an accepted or strong proselytism tradition with the Buddha having taught his followers to respect other religions and the clergy. Emperor Ashoka, however, sent royal missionaries to various kingdoms and sent his son and daughter as missionaries to Sri Lanka following his conversion to Buddhism. Aggressive proselytizing is discouraged in the major Buddhist schools and Buddhists do not engage in the practice of proselytisation.\n\nSome adherents of Nichiren Buddhism proselytise in a process called Shakubuku.\n\nHinduism lacks a proselytism tradition. Classical Hinduism represents diversity of views and theology. Its followers are free to follow any theistic, non-theistic or other ideas it discusses. Followers can pick or change to any philosophy or belief he or she fancies and worship any personal god or goddess in a manner they deem fit. In the modern era, religious conversion from and to Hinduism has been a controversial subject. Some state the concept of missionary activity and proselytism is anathema to the precepts of Hinduism.\n\nWhile proselytism is not a part of the Hindu tradition, religious conversion to various traditions within Hinduism such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism has a long history.\n\nThe debate on proselytization and religious conversion between Christianity, Islam and Hinduism is more recent, and started in the 19th century. Religious leaders of some Hindu reform movements such as the Arya Samaj launched \"Shuddhi\" movement to proselytize and reconvert Muslims and Christians back to Hinduism, while those such as the Brahmo Samaj suggested Hinduism to be a non-missionary religion. All these sects of Hinduism have welcomed new members to their group, while other leaders of Hinduism's diverse schools have stated that given the intensive proselytization activities from missionary Islam and Christianity, this \"there is no such thing as proselytism in Hinduism\" view must be re-examined.\n\nOne group that takes in willing converts in Hinduism is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness also known as Hare Krishnas. Devotees of the Krishna Consciousness have no codified rituals of conversion, but promote recitation of the Hare Krishna mantra as a means to achieve a mature stage of love of God. ISKCON adherents view Krishna as the supreme deity that those of other faith traditions worship. A commonly accepted notion among Krisna Consciousness devotees is that ISKCON allows one to recognize the primacy of the supreme deity, Krishna, in the practices and traditions of other faiths. Krishna Consciousness promotes the concept of Sanatana-Dharma (Hinduism), the 'eternal law' that other faiths can uncover.\n\nMahavira (599–527 BC), the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, developed an early philosophy regarding relativism and subjectivism known as \"Anekantavada\". As a result of this acceptance of alternate religious practices, the phenomenon of proselytisation is largely absent in these religions but not unknown. Converts are welcome to the Jain faith.\n\nSikhism is not a proselytizing religion and proselytism is largely discouraged \"through force or inducement\" out of the belief that each person has a fundamental right to practice their religion freely.\n\nIn Islam, inviting people to the religion is a meritorious activity. The Qur'an states, \"\"There is no (permission) to force (anyone into following this) way of life. The truth stands clear from error. Whoever rejects falsehood and believes in Allah has grasped a firm hand-hold that will never break, for Allah hears and knows (all things). Al Baqarah\" ('The Cow', 2:256)\". Muslim scholars consider this passage to mean that force is not to be used to convert someone to Islam. Muslims consider inviting others to Islam to be the mission originally carried out by the Prophets of Allah and is now a collective duty of Muslims. In the Qur'an Allah states, \"\"Invite (others) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and reason with them in ways that are best. Your Lord knows best who is straying from His path and who is being guided (towards it). An Nahl\" ('The Bee', 16:125)\"\n\nUnlike in the Hellenistic era (Second Temple Judaism), in the modern era Judaism generally does not proselytize non-Jews. Instead, non-Jews are encouraged to follow Noahide Law, assuring a place in the world to come. In ancient times, these observant non-Jews could become \"geirim toshvim\", a term still sometimes used informally to refer to those who strive to follow these laws and who will join the Jewish people in the world to come. A non-Jew who follows Noahide law is considered to believe in Noahidism; for this end, there is some minor outreach by Orthodox Jewish organizations.\n\nGenerally, Jews expect any convert to Judaism to come through their own accord. A common source of converts are those who have married a Jewish person, though there are also many people who join for spiritual or other personal reasons; these people are called \"Jews by choice\". Rabbis will often discourage new members from joining, although they may provide guidance through seminars or personal meetings for those who are truly interested. Orthodox Judaism in theory neither encourages nor discourages conversion. Standards for conversion can be very challenging, but rabbis will acquiesce to persistent and sincere requests for conversion. Much emphasis is placed on gaining a Jewish identity.\n\nProselytization does occur among Jews, as they are an ethnoreligious group comprising a spectrum of beliefs that include forms of religious non-observance (such as atheism). Among the many groups that encourage nonobservant Jews to be observant include Aish HaTorah and Chabad.\n\nSects of some religions, such as the Druze and Zoroastrians, do not accept converts at all.\n\nProselytism is considered inappropriate, disrespectful, and offensive by some individuals. As such, it is not protected in certain environments open to the public or are owned privately: government buildings, public education (grade schools and college campuses), the workplace and private properties like ones' home or front yard. These environments, due to either their openness or privacy, are often where proselytism takes place and can come from a variety of sources depending on the environment (e.g., students or teachers in schools and colleges, coworkers or employers, office workers, family members, or neighbors in a community).\n\nSome countries such as Greece prohibited all proselytism until 1994 when Jehovah's Witnesses were legally recognized as a religion and allowed to preach. Some countries such as Morocco prohibit it except for Islam. Some restrict it in various ways such as prohibiting attempts to convert children or prohibit offering physical benefits to new converts.\n\nReligious groups also draw lines between what they are willing to do or not do to convert people. For instance the Catholic Church in \"Ad gentes\" states that \"The Church strictly forbids forcing anyone to embrace the Faith, or alluring or enticing people by worrisome wiles.\"\n\nThe World Council of Churches in \"The Challenge of Proselytism and the Calling to Common Witness\" states the following:\n\n19. Proselytism as described in this document stands in opposition to all ecumenical effort. It includes certain activities which often aim at having people change their church affiliation and which we believe must be avoided, such as the following:\n\n\n\n"}

He was widely considered to be the world's preeminent scholar of the Holocaust, and his three-volume, 1,273-page \"magnum opus\", \"The Destruction of the European Jews\", is regarded as a seminal study of the Nazi Final Solution.\n\nHilberg was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Jewish family from Poland and Romania.\n\nHilberg was very much a loner, pursuing solitary hobbies such as geography, music and train spotting. Though his parents attended synagogue on occasion, he personally found the irrationality of religion repellent and developed an allergy to it. He did however attend a Zionist school in Vienna, which inculcated the necessity of defending against, rather than surrendering to, the rising menace of Nazism. Following the March 1938 Anschluss, his family was evicted from their home at gunpoint and his father was arrested by the Nazis, but he was later released because of his service record as a combatant during World War I. One year later, on April 1, 1939, at age 13, Hilberg fled Austria with his family; after reaching France, they embarked on a ship bound for Cuba. Following a four-month stay in Cuba, his family arrived in the United States on September 1, 1939, the day the Second World War broke out in Europe. During the ensuing war in Europe, 26 members of Hilberg's family were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nThe Hilbergs settled in Brooklyn, New York, where Raul attended Abraham Lincoln High School and Brooklyn College. He intended to make a career in chemistry, but he found that it did not suit him, and he left his studies to work in a factory. Having reached draft age, he was then called up for military service. As early as 1942, Hilberg, after reading scattered reports of what would later become known as the Nazi genocide, went so far as to ring Stephen Wise and ask him what he planned to do with regard to \"the complete annihilation of European Jewry\". According to Hilberg, Wise hung up.\n\nHilberg served first in the 45th Infantry Division (United States) during World War II, but, given his native fluency and academic interests, he was soon attached to the \"War Documentation Department\", charged with examining archives throughout Europe. While quartered in the Braunes Haus, he stumbled upon Hitler's crated private library in Munich. This discovery prompted Hilberg's research into the Holocaust, a term which he personally disliked, though in later years he himself used it.\n\nAfter returning to civilian life, Hilberg chose to study political science, earning his B.A. at Brooklyn College in 1948. He was deeply impressed by the importance of elites and bureaucracies while attending Hans Rosenberg's lectures on the Prussian civil service. At one particular point in Rosenberg's course, Hilberg was taken aback by a remark his teacher dropped:\n\nThe most wicked atrocities perpetrated on a civilian population in modern times occurred during the Napoleonic occupation of Spain.\n\nThe young Hilberg interrupted the lecture to ask why the recent murder of 6 million Jews did not figure in Rosenberg's assessment. Rosenberg replied that it was a complicated matter, but that the lectures only dealt with history down to 1930, adding, \"History doesn't reach down into the present age.\" Hilberg was amazed by this highly educated, German-Jewish emigrant passing over the genocide of European Jews in order to expound on Napoleon and the occupation of Spain. The episode served to strengthen his interest in the subject.\n\nHilberg went on to first complete an M.A. (1950), and then a Ph.D (1955), at Columbia University, where he entered the graduate program in Public Law and Government. Meanwhile, in 1951, he obtained a temporary appointment to work on the \"War Documentation Project\" under the direction of Fritz T. Epstein.\n\nHilberg was undecided under whom he should carry out his doctoral research. Having attended a course on International Law, he was also attracted to the lectures of Salo Baron, the leading authority on Jewish historiography at the time, with particular expertise in the field of laws pertaining to the Jewish people. According to Hilberg, to attend Baron's lectures was to enjoy the rare opportunity of observing \"a walking library, a monument of incredible erudition\", active before his classroom of students. Baron asked Hilberg whether he was interested in working under him on the annihilation of Europe's Jewish population. Hilberg demurred on the grounds that his interest lay in the \"perpetrators,\" and thus he would not begin with the Jews who were their victims, but rather with what was done to them.\n\nHilberg decided to write the greater part of his Ph.D. under the supervision of Franz Neumann, the author of an influential wartime analysis of the German totalitarian state. Neumann was initially reluctant to take Hilberg on as his doctoral student. He had already read Hilberg's master's thesis, and found, as both a deeply patriotic German and a Jew, that certain themes sketched there were unbearably painful. In particular he had asked that the section on Jewish cooperation be removed, to no avail. Neumann nonetheless relented, warning his student, however, that such a dissertation was professionally imprudent and might well prove to be his academic funeral. Undeterred by the prospect, Hilberg pressed on without regard for the possible consequences. Neumann himself contacted Nuremberg prosecutor Telford Taylor directly, to facilitate Hilberg's access to the appropriate archives. After Neumann's death in a traffic accident in 1954, Hilberg completed his doctoral requirement under the supervision of Professor William T. R. Fox. His dissertation won him the university's prestigious Clark F. Ansley Award in 1955, which carried with it the right to have his thesis published by his alma mater. He taught the first college-level course in the United States dedicated to the Holocaust, when the subject was finally introduced into his university's curriculum in 1974.\n\nHilberg obtained his first academic position at the University of Vermont in Burlington, in 1955, and took up residence there in January 1956. Most of his teaching career was spent at that university, where he was a member of the Department of Political Science. He was appointed emeritus professor upon his retirement in 1991. In 2006, the university established the Raul Hilberg Distinguished Professorship of Holocaust Studies. Each year the University of Vermont's Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies hosts the Raul Hilberg Memorial Lecture, which is made possible through a generous gift from Jerold D. Jacobson, Esquire, of New York City, UVM Class of 1962.\n\nHilberg was appointed to the President's Commission on the Holocaust by Jimmy Carter in 1979. He later served for many years on its successor, the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which is the governing body for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Following his death, the Museum established the Raul Hilberg Fellowship, intended to support the development of new generations of Holocaust scholars. For his seminal and profound services to the historiography of the Holocaust, he was honored with Germany's Order of Merit, the highest recognition that can be paid to a non-German. In 2002, he was awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for \"Die Quellen des Holocaust\" (Sources of the Holocaust). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.\n\nHilberg had two children, David and Deborah, by his first wife, Christine Hemenway. After his divorce, in 1980 he married Gwendolyn Montgomery. Deborah moved to Israel when she was 18, assumed dual citizenship, and became a specialist teacher of children with learning disabilities. She has written memorably of her father's approach to rearing in an article composed on the occasion of the publication of the Hebrew translation of his masterpiece, in 2012.\n\nHilberg was not religious, and he considered himself an atheist. In his autobiographical reflections he stated, \"The fact is that I have had no God.\" In a 2001 interview that addressed the issue of Holocaust denial, he said, \"I am an atheist. But there is ultimately, if you don't want to surrender to nihilism entirely, the matter of a [historical] record.\" After his second wife's autonomous decision, 12 years into their marriage, to convert from Episcopalianism to Judaism, in 1993, Hilberg began quietly to attend services at Ohavi Zedek, a Conservative synagogue in Burlington. What he most esteemed, and identified with in his own tradition, was the ideal of the Jew as 'pariah'. As he put it in a 1965 essay, \"Jews are iconoclasts. They will not worship idols... The Jews are the conscience of the world. They are the father figures, stern, critical, and forbidding.\"\n\nHilberg was the only scholar interviewed for Claude Lanzmann's \"Shoah\", and according to Guy Austin he was \"a key influence on Lanzmann\" in depicting the logistics of the genocide. He was a strong supporter of Norman Finkelstein during the latter's controversial tenure battle, and of Finkelstein's book \"The Holocaust Industry\", which he endorsed \"with specific regard\" to Finkelstein's work showing that the money claimed to be owed by Swiss banks to Holocaust survivors was greatly exaggerated. Hilberg also made a posthumous appearance in the 2009 film, \"\".\n\nThough a non-smoker, Hilberg died following a recurrence of lung cancer on August 4, 2007, aged 81, in Williston, Vermont.\n\nHilberg is best known for his influential study of the Holocaust, \"The Destruction of the European Jews\". His approach assumed that the event of the Shoah was not \"unique\". He said in a late interview:'For me the Holocaust was a vast, single event, but I am never going to use the word \"unique\", because I recognize that when one starts breaking it into pieces, which is my trade, one finds completely recognizable, ordinary ingredients.'His final doctoral supervisor, Professor Fox, worried that the original study was far too long. Hilberg therefore suggested submitting a mere quarter of the research he had written up, and his proposal was accepted. His PhD dissertation was awarded the prestigious Clark F. Ansley prize, which entitled it to be published by Columbia University Press in a print run of 850 copies. However, Hilberg was firm in desiring that the whole work be published, not just the doctoral version. To obtain this, two opinions in favor of full publication were required. Yad Vashem as early as 1958, declined to participate in its projected publication, fearing that it would encounter \"hostile criticism\". The work was duly submitted to two additional academic authorities in the field, but both judgments were negative, viewing Hilberg's work as polemical: one rejected it as anti-German, the other as anti-Jewish.\n\nHilberg, unwilling to compromise, submitted the complete manuscript to several major publishing houses over the following six years, without luck. Princeton University Press turned down the manuscript, on Hannah Arendt's advice, after quickly vetting it in a mere two weeks. After successive rejections from five prominent publishers, it finally went to press in 1961 under a minor imprint, the Chicago-based publisher, Quadrangle Books. By good fortune, a wealthy patron, Frank Petschek, a German-Czech Jew whose family coal business had suffered from the Nazi Aryanization program, laid out $15,000, a substantial sum at the time, to cover the costs of a print run of 5,500 volumes, of which some 1,300 copies were set aside for distribution to libraries.\n\nResistance to Hilberg's work, the difficulties he encountered in finding a U.S. editor, and subsequent delays with the German edition, owed much to the Cold War atmosphere of the times. Norman Finkelstein observed,\n\nIt is hard now to remember that the Nazi holocaust was once a taboo subject. During the early years of the Cold War, mention of the Nazi holocaust was seen as undermining the critical U.S.-West German alliance. It was airing the dirty laundry of the barely de-Nazified West German elites and thereby playing into the hands of the Soviet Union, which didn't tire of remembering the crimes of the West German \"revanchists.\"\n\nThe German rights to the book were acquired by the German publishing firm, Droemer Knaur, in 1963. Droemer Knaur, however, after dithering over it for two years, decided against publication, due to the work's documentation of certain episodes of cooperation by Jewish authorities with the executors of the Holocaust — material which the editors said would only play into the hands of the antisemitic right wing in Germany. Hilberg dismissed this fear as \"nonsense\". Some two decades were to pass before it finally came out in a German edition in 1982, under the imprint of a Berlin publishing house. Hilberg, a lifelong Republican voter, seemed to be somewhat bemused by the prospect of being published under such an imprint, and asked its director, Ulf Wolter, what on earth his massive treatise on the Holocaust had in common with some of the firm's staple themes, socialism and women's rights. Wolter replied succinctly: \"Injustice!\" In a letter of July 14, 1982 Hilberg had written to Mr. Wolter/Olle & Wolter, \"Everything you said to me during this brief visit has impressed me very much and has given me a good feeling about our joint venture. I am glad that you are my publisher in Germany.\" He spoke about a \"second edition\" of his work, \"solid enough for the next century\".\n\n\"The Destruction of the European Jews\" provided, in Hannah Arendt's words, \"the first clear description of (the) incredibly complicated machinery of destruction\" set up under Nazism. For Hilberg there was deep irony in the judgment since Arendt, asked to give an opinion of his manuscript in 1959, had advised against publication. Her judgement influenced the rejection slip he received from Princeton University Press following its submission, thus effectively denying him the prestigious auspices of a mainstream academic publishing house.\n\nWith a terse lucidity that ranged, with unsparing meticulousness, over the huge archives of Nazism, Hilberg delineated the history of the mechanisms, political, legal, administrative and organizational, whereby the Holocaust was perpetrated, as it was seen through German eyes, often by the anonymous clerks whose unquestioning dedication to their duties was central to the efficacy of the industrial project of genocide. To that end, Hilberg refrained from laying emphasis on the suffering of Jews, the victims, or their lives in the concentration camps. The Nazi program entailed the destruction of all peoples whose existence was deemed incompatible with the world-historical destiny of a pure master race – and to accomplish this project, they had to develop techniques, muster resources, make bureaucratic decisions, organize fields and camps of extermination and recruit cadres capable of executing the \"Final Solution\". It was enough to chase down each intricate strand of communication over how to conduct the operation efficiently through the enormous archival papertrail to show how this took place. Thus his discourse probed the bureaucratic means for implementing genocide, in order to let the implicit horror of the process speak for itself. In this he differed radically from those who had focused heavily on final responsibilities, as for example in the case of predecessor Gerald Reitlinger's groundbreaking history of the subject. Because of this layered departmentalized structure of the bureaucracy overseeing the intricate policies of classifying, mustering and deporting victims, individual functionaries saw their roles as distinct from the actual 'perpetration' of the Holocaust. Thus,'(f)or these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a perpetrator.' Hilberg made it clear, however, that such functionaries were quite aware of their involvement in what was a process of destruction. Hilberg's minute documentation thus constructed a functional analysis of the machinery of genocide, while leaving unaddressed any questions of historical antisemitism, and possible structural elements in Germany's historical-social tradition which might have conduced to the unparalleled industrialization of the European Jewish Catastrophe by that country. Yehuda Bauer, a lifelong adversary and friend of Hilberg, who often clashed polemically with the man he considered 'without fault' over what Bauer saw as the latter's failure to deal with the complex dilemmas of Jews caught up in this machinery, recalls often prodding Hilberg on his exclusive focus on the \"how\" of the Holocaust rather than the \"why\". According to Bauer, Hilberg \"did not ask the big questions for fear that the answers would be too little\" or, as Hilberg himself says interviewed in Lanzmann's film, \"I have never begun by asking the big questions, because I was always afraid that I would come up with small answers.\"\n\nHilberg's empirical, descriptive approach to the Holocaust, though it exercised a not fully acknowledged but pervasive influence on the far better-known work of Hannah Arendt, \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\", in turn aroused considerable controversy, not least because of its details concerning the cooperation of Jewish councils in the actual procedures of evacuation to the camps.\n\nAt the time, most historians of the phenomenon subscribed to what would today be called the extreme intentionalist position, where sometime early in his career, Hitler developed a master plan for the genocide of the Jewish people and that everything that happened was the unfolding of the plan. This clashed with the lesson Hilberg had absorbed under Neumann, whose \"Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism\" (1942) described the Nazi regime as a virtually stateless political order characterised by chronic bureaucratic infighting and turf disputes. The task Hilberg set for himself was to analyse the way the overall policies of genocide were engineered within the otherwise conflictual politics of Nazi factions. It helped that the Americans classifying the huge amount of Nazi documents used, precisely, the categories his future mentor Neumann had employed in his \"Behemoth\" study.\n\nHilberg came to be considered as the foremost representative of what a later generation has called the functionalist school of Holocaust historiography, of which Christopher Browning, whose own life was changed by reading Hilberg's book, is a prominent member. The debate is that Intentionalists see \"the Holocaust as Hitler's determined and premeditated plan, which he implemented as the opportunity arose\", while functionalists see \"the Final Solution as an evolution that occurred when other plans proved untenable\". Intentionalists argue that the initiative for the Holocaust came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy.\n\nIt has often been observed that Hilberg's \"magnum opus\" begins with an intentionalist thesis but gradually shifts towards a functionalist position. At the time, this approach raised a few eyebrows but only later did it actually attract pointed academic discussion. A further move towards a functionalist interpretation occurred in the revised 1985 edition, in which Hitler is portrayed as a remote figure hardly involved in the machinery of destruction. The terms \"functionalist\" and \"intentionalist\" were coined in 1981 by Timothy Mason but the debate goes back to 1969 with the publication of Martin Broszat's \"The Hitler State\" in 1969 and Karl Schleunes's \"The Twisted Road to Auschwitz\" in 1970. Since most of the early functionalist historians were West German, it was often enough for intentionalist historians, especially for those outside Germany, to note that men such as Broszat and Hans Mommsen had spent their adolescence in the Hitler Youth and then to say that their work was an apologia for National Socialism. Hilberg was Jewish and an Austrian who had fled to the United States to escape the Nazis and had no Nazi sympathies, which helps to explain the vehemence of the attacks by intentionalist historians that greeted the revised edition of \"The Destruction of the European Jews\" in 1985. \n\nHilberg's understanding of the relationship between the leadership of the Third Reich and the implementers of the genocide evolved from an interpretation based on orders to the RSHA originating with Adolf Hitler and proclaimed by Hermann Göring, to a thesis consistent with Christopher Browning's \"The Origins of the Final Solution\", an account in which initiatives were undertaken by mid-level officials in response to general orders from senior ones. Such initiatives were broadened by mandates from senior officials and propagated by increasingly informal channels. The experience gained in fulfilling the initiatives fed an understanding in the bureaucracy that radical goals were attainable, progressively reducing the need for direction. As Hilberg put it in a late interview:\n\nIn earlier editions of \"Destruction\", in fact, Hilberg discussed an \"order\" given by Hitler to have Jews killed, while more recent editions do not refer to a direct command. Hilberg later commented that he \"made this change in the interest of precision about the evidence [...].\" Notwithstanding Hilberg's focus on bureaucratic momentum as an indispensable force behind the Holocaust, he maintained that extermination of Jews was one of Hitler's aims: \"The primary notion in Germany is that Hitler did it. As it happens, this is also my notion, but I'm not wedded to it\" (qtd. in Guttenplan, p. 303).\n\nThis contradicts the thesis advanced by Daniel Goldhagen that the ferocity of German anti-Semitism is sufficient as an explanation for the Holocaust; Hilberg noted that anti-Semitism was more virulent in Eastern Europe than in the Third Reich itself. Hilberg criticized Goldhagen's scholarship, which he called poor (\"his scholarly standard is at the level of 1946\") and he was even harsher concerning the lack of primary source or secondary literature competence at Harvard by those who oversaw the research for Goldhagen's book. Hilberg said, \"This is the only reason why Goldhagen could obtain a PhD in political science at Harvard. There was nobody on the faculty who could have checked his work.\" This remark has been echoed by Yehuda Bauer.\n\nWhat is most contentious about Hilberg's work, the controversial implications of which influenced the decision by Israeli authorities to deny him access to the Yad Vashem's archives, was his assessment that elements of Jewish society, such as the \"Judenräte\" (Jewish Councils), were complicit in the genocide. and that this was partly rooted in long-standing attitudes of European Jews, rather than attempts at survival or exploitation. In his own words:\n\nI had to examine the Jewish tradition of trusting God, princes, laws and contracts [...] Ultimately I had to ponder the Jewish calculation that the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit. It was precisely this Jewish strategy that dictated accommodation and precluded resistance.\n\nThis part of his work was criticized harshly by many Jews as impious, and a defamation of the dead. His master's thesis sponsor persuaded him to remove this idea from his thesis, though he was determined to restore it. Even his father, on reading his manuscript, was disconcerted.\n\nThe result of his approach, and the sharp criticism it aroused in certain quarters, was such, as he records in the same book, that:\n\nIt has taken me some time to absorb what I should always have known, that in my whole approach to the study of the destruction of the Jews I was pitting myself against the main current of Jewish thought [...] that in my research and writing I was pursuing not merely another direction but one which was the exact opposite of a signal that pulsated endlessly through the Jewish community [...] The philistines in my field are everywhere. I am surrounded by the commonplace, platitudes, and clichés.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Less than 1% are part of the Shafi`i (primarily Chechens) and Shi'a. There are a total of 2,300 mosques, all of them affiliated with the \"Spiritual Association of Muslims of Kazakhstan\", headed by a supreme mufti. The Eid al-Adha is recognized as a national holiday.\n\nLess than 25% of the population of Kazakhstan is Russian Orthodox, traditionally including ethnic Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. Other Christian groups include Catholics, Protestants (Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Pentecostals, Methodists, Mennonites and Seventh-day Adventists), Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. There are a total of 265 registered Orthodox churches, 93 Catholic churches, and 543 Protestant churches and prayer houses. Christmas, rendered in the Russian Orthodox manner according to the Julian calendar, is recognized as a national holiday in Kazakhstan.\n\nOther religious registered groups include Judaism, the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Buddhism, the Church of Scientology, Christian Science, and the Unification Church.\n\nThe country is multiethnic, with a long tradition of tolerance and secularism. Since independence, the number of mosques and churches has increased greatly. However, the population is sometimes wary of minority religious groups and groups that proselytize. There were several reports of citizens filing complaints with authorities after their family members became involved with such groups. Leaders of the four religious groups the government considers \"traditional\" – Islam, Russian Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Judaism – reported general acceptance and tolerance that other religious groups did not always enjoy.\n\nThe country has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups with varying religions. Intolerance to other societies has become an issue of the Kazakh culture. The foundation of an independent republic, following the disintegration of the USSR, has launched a great deal of changes in every aspect of people's lives. Religiosity of the population, as an essential part of any cultural identity, has undergone dynamic transformations as well.\n\nBaptist Churches are often raided. This is due to the church members gathering without registering themselves, a requirement of the country. Anyone who does not register risk being raided by the police. However not only those that violate the law are treated harshly. \n\nOn May 2, 2017, a court in the capital of Astana, Kazakhstan, sentenced a 61 year old husband and father of three sons, to a five-year prison sentence for performing peaceful Bible education work. Teymur Akhmedov, is a member of Jehovah's Witnesses. The court called his preaching and teaching efforts “inciting religious discord” and “advocating [religious] superiority.” In addition, the judge also imposed a three-year ban on Mr. Akhmedov’s participation in Bible education activities. Mr Akhmedo's medical issues were not considered, as he requires treatment for a bleeding tumor and has been denied the medical attention that he requires. \n\nAfter decades of suppressed culture, the people were feeling a great need to exhibit their ethnic identity – in part through religion. Quantitative research shows that for the first years after the establishment of the new laws, waiving any restrictions on religious beliefs and proclaiming full freedom of confessions, the country experienced a huge spike in religious activity of its citizens. Hundreds of mosques, synagogues, churches, and other religious structures were built in a matter of years. All represented religions benefited from increased number of members and facilities. Many confessions that were absent before independence made their way into the country, appealing to hundreds of people. The government supported this activity, and has done its best to provide equality among all religious organizations and their followers. In the late 1990s, however, a slight decline in religiosity occurred. The draft religion law being considered in June 2008 has raised international concern over whether there is an intention to meet general standards of freedom of religion and human rights.\n\nIslam is the most commonly practiced religion in Kazakhstan; it was introduced to the region during the 8th century by the Arabs. Traditionally ethnic Kazakhs are Sunni Muslims who mainly follow the Hanafi school. Kazakhs including other ethnic groups of Muslim background make up over 90 per cent of all Muslims. The southern region of the country has the highest concentration of self-identified practicing Muslims.\n\nChristianity in Kazakhstan is the second most practiced religion after Islam. Most Christian citizens are Russians, and to a lesser extent Ukrainians and Belarusians, who belong to the Russian Orthodox Church. According to a 2009 national census, approximately 26% of the population of Kazakhstan identifies as Christian. 1.5 percent of the population is German, most of whom follow Catholicism or Lutheranism. There are also many Presbyterians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, and Pentecostals. Methodists, Mennonites, and Mormons have also registered churches with the government. According to the 2009 census, there were 4,214,232 Christians in Kazakhstan. \"Kazakhstan is the strange core of traditionalist Catholicism,\" Catholic writer Ross Douthat stated in 2018.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan began during the policy of oppression of religion in the former Soviet Union. Before that time, Kazakhstan, as part of the Russian Empire, would have had indirect contact with the Bahá'í Faith as far back as 1847. Following the entrance of pioneers the community grew to be the largest religious community after Islam and Christianity, though only a few percent of the nation. By 1994 the National Spiritual Assembly of Kazakhstan was elected and the community has begun to multiply its efforts across various interests. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 6,000 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nKazakh Jews have a long history. There are approximately 12,000 to 30,000 Jews in Kazakhstan, less than 1% of the population. Most Kazakh Jews are Ashkenazi and speak Russian.\n\nHindus in Kazakhstan are mainly of the ISKCON sect and by Diaspora Hindus from India. The Indian community in Central Asia, which comprises Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, numbers only 2732 out of a total population of 55.5 million. It consists mainly of NRIs.\n\n\nTengrism is a Central Asian religion characterized by shamanism, animism, totemism, poly- and monotheism and ancestor worship. It was the prevailing religion of the Turks, Mongols, Hungarians, Xiongnu and Huns, and the religion of the five ancient Turkic states: Göktürk Khaganate, Western Turkic Khaganate, Great Bulgaria, Bulgarian Empire and Eastern Tourkia (Khazaria). In \"Irk Bitig\", Tengri is mentioned as \"Türük Tängrisi\" (God of Turks).\n\nTengrists view their existence as sustained by the eternal blue sky (Tengri), the fertile mother-earth spirit (Eje) and a ruler regarded as the holy spirit of the sky. Heaven, earth, spirits of nature and ancestors provide for every need and protect all humans. By living an upright, respectful life, a human will keep his world in balance and perfect his personal Wind Horse, or spirit. The Huns of the northern Caucasus reportedly believed in two gods: Tangri Han (or Tengri Khan), considered identical to the Persian Aspandiat and for whom horses were sacrificed, and Kuar (whose victims are struck by lightning). Tengrism is practised in Sakha, Buryatia, Tuva and Mongolia in parallel with Tibetan Buddhism and Burkhanism.\n\nKazakhstan has a very diverse and stable religious background. However, some reported occurrences of persecution against Hare Krishnas and Jehovah's Witnesses for proselytizing have raised concern in the international community. \n\nArticle 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan states that \"everyone has the right to a freedom of conscience.” On May 18, 2011, the President of Kazakhstan adopted a decree establishing the Agency for Religious Affairs. The mission of the Agency is to coordinate interaction between the government, religious groups and civil society in order to ensure religious freedom in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2003 Kazakhstan established Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions that aims to facilitate religious dialogue ensuring inter-religious tolerance and freedom in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe 2009 census yielded the following results of Kazakhstan's population by religion and ethnic group.\n"}

Thompson, Professor of Old Testament at the University of Copenhagen. Its US title is The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel.\n\nThe theme of \"The Bible in History\" is the need to treat the bible as literature rather than as history. Danny Yee cites a passage: \"The Bible's language is not an historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction.\" \n\nPart 1 deals with general historiographical issues, including the importance of understanding the types and purposes of different biblical stories, the dangers of treating myth and poetry as history, and the use of origin-myths as recurring motifs, concluding that the bible was intended to provide an ancient people with a common past, and thus was very different from our own tradition of critical history-writing. Part 2 is a history of ancient Palestine and the surrounding region from the earliest human settlement to the Hellenistic period drawing on the most recent archaeological and historical studies, and Part 3 concludes with a survey of the theological implications of the preceding study.\n\nThompson is a leading biblical minimalist, a group of like-minded scholars including Niels Peter Lemche, Philip R. Davies, and Keith W. Whitelam among others who say that the Hebrew bible cannot be treated as history, because it was not intended as history. The minimalist argument has been received with emotions bordering on outrage by other scholars, somewhat inaccurately known as \"maximalists\" most of them do not in fact subscribe to a view that would take all or even most of the bible as being historically accurate, but object strongly to the minimalist contention that it is completely or almost completely ahistorical. The debate has been frequently framed in political terms, with the minimalists accused of subverting the existence of the modern state of Israel and worse. \"The Bible in History\", Thompson's attempt to summarise the minimalist thesis and set it before a wider public, was the immediate cause for William G. Dever's rejoinder, \"What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?\", (2001), which then led into a long and frequently heated debate (in which Davies, rather than Thompson, championed the minimalist side) on the merits of the bible as history.\n\n"}
{"id": "9022760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9022760", "title": "Transvaluation of values", "text": "Transvaluation of values\n\nThe revaluation of all values or \"transvaluation\" is a concept from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nElaborating the concept in \"The Antichrist\", Nietzsche asserts that Christianity, not merely as a religion but also as the predominant moral system of the Western world, inverts nature, and is \"hostile to life\". As \"the religion of pity\", it elevates the weak over the strong, exalting that which is \"ill-constituted and weak\" at the expense of that which is full of life and vitality.\n\nNietzsche compares Christianity to Buddhism. He posits that Christianity is \"the struggle against sin\", whereas Buddhism is \"the struggle against suffering\"; to Nietzsche, Christianity limits and lowers humankind by assailing its natural and inevitable instincts as depraved (\"sin\"), whereas Buddhism advises one merely to eschew suffering. While Christianity is full of \"revengefulness\" and \"antipathy\" (e.g., the Last Judgment), Buddhism promotes \"benevolence, being kind, as health-promoting.\" Buddhism is also suggested to be the more \"honest\" of the two religions, for its being strictly \"phenomenalistic\", and because \"Christianity makes a thousand promises but \"keeps none\".\" Martyrdom, rather than being a moral high ground or position of strength, is indicative of an \"\"obtuseness\" to the question of truth.\"\n\nSimilarly, Nietzsche contrasts 19th-century European morality to that of pre-Christian Greek civilization. Because sex is, in Nietzsche's thought, a fundamental affirmation of life, for its being the very process by which human life is created, Christianity's elevation of chastity (including, for example, the story of Mary's virginal pregnancy) is counter to the natural instincts of humanity, and therefore a contradiction of \"natural values\".\n\nNietzsche's enthusiasm for what he called \"transvaluation\" stemmed from his contempt for Christianity and the entirety of the moral system that flowed from it: indeed, \"contempt of man\", as Nietzsche states near the end of \"The Antichrist\". Nietzsche perceived the moral framework of Christian civilization to be oppressive: \n\nTransvaluation would mean the exaltation of life rather than the exaltation of suffering, and an acceptance of every instinct or lust as organic and therefore valid, and so beyond the scope of moral condemnation. What one desires would be merely what one desires, rather than either sinful or pious. What one desires would be the product of stimuli rather than the product of \"will\".\n\n\"The Revaluation of All Values\" was also the working title of a series of four books Nietzsche was planning to write, only the first of which—\"The Antichrist\"—he ever completed. However, one of his schemas for \"The Will to Power\" used \"The Revaluation of All Values\" as a subtitle, and it was this scheme that his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche used to assemble his notes into the final book with that title.\n"}
