Along with Joseph Smith, Jr.'s 1843 revelation on plural marriage, the 1886 revelation is one of the primary documents used by Mormon fundamentalists to justify their continued practice of polygamy. The LDS Church, which issued manifestos in 1890 and 1904 to terminate the practice of plural marriage, does not accept the 1886 revelation as authentic. Others have questioned whether the revelation, if authentic, even refers to plural marriage or its continuance.\n\nIn 1911, John W. Taylor, Taylor's son and an apostle claimed that he had discovered the revelation among his father's papers after his death in 1887. Unfortunately, his was a copy written in his own hand. Photographs of the original document exist, but the document itself is not extant. Examinations of the photographs have suggested that the document is in John Taylor's handwriting. In 1912, Lorin C. Woolley, a Mormon fundamentalist leader, published a claim that five copies of the revelation had been made and entrusted to LDS Church apostle George Q. Cannon (and four other men who were not LDS Church officials) with the intent of preserving it for posterity. \n\nThe text of the revelation is as follows:\n"}

The son of Phinehas, grandson of Eli, and brother of Ichabod. On the death of his grandfather Eli he most likely succeeded to the office of high priest, and would have been succeeded by his son Ahijah (references to Ahitub as the father of Ahijah are in 1 Sam. 14:3; 22:9, 11, 12, 20 and 1 Chr 9:11). Ahijah (also spelled Ahiah), who is listed as his son in 1 Samuel 14:2-3, 18-19, may have been the same person as Ahimelech (1 Samuel 22:9-20), or he may have been another son of Ahitub (probably an elder son if this was the case).\n\n(2.) The father of Zadok (2 Sam. 8:15-17). This Ahitub was the son of Amariah, Amarias or Arophaeus, who was the son of Meraioth, Meraoith or Merahoth, who was the son of Zerahiah or Zaraias, who was the son of Uzzi, who was the son of Bukki, who was the son of Abishua, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron (1 Chronicles 6:3-8). There is a faint possibility that this Ahitub was made high priest by Saul after the extermination of the family of Ahimelech, but it is very unlikely as there are apparently no references supporting this. It is much more likely that Saul had no official high priest after this incident until the end of his reign (see Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews, Book VI, Chapter XII, Paragraph 7.\n\n(3.) A priestly descendant through the priestly line of the first Zadok. This Ahitub is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 6:11-12. To make matters a bit more confusing, this Ahitub also had a son (or probably grandson) by the name of Zadok. This Ahitub may have been high priest in the later time of the kings, but he also may not have been a high priest. He did become the ancestor of later high priests, which served during the fall of Jerusalem and post-exile.\n\n(4.) An ancestor of a person mentioned in Nehemiah 11:11.

The first know Bahá'í to enter the region was in 1951-52 at Beira when a British pioneer came through on the way to what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. The Mozambique Bahá'í community participated in successive stages of regional organization across southern Africa from 1956 through the election of its first Mozambique Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly by 1963 and on to its own National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1987. Since 1984 the Bahá'ís have begun to hold development projects. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated just over 2,800 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nIn a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to travel to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The publication was delayed until 1919 in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu.\n\nProbably the first Bahá'ís to enter the region were Eric and Terry Manton who landed in 1951-2 at Beira, a port of Mozambique, who came from Britain to be the first pioneers to what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.\n\nIn 1953 Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa.\n\nIn April 1956 the Bahá'í Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them. Its region included South Africa, Mauritius, Reunion Island, St Helena, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Madagascar, Mozambique, South-West Africa, Angola, Zululand and Swaziland.\n\nAnother known early pioneer was Charlotte Pinto who attended a national convention of the Bahá'ís of the United States on return from Mozambique in April 1957.\n\nThe Area Teaching Committee of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Mozambique held a conference on the progress of the religion chaired by Hastings Hojane in November 1958 and meetings continued through 1960.\n\nBy the end of 1963 a summary of the state of the world wide community mentions the state in Mozambique as:\n\n\nFollowing the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s. In 1964 the regional assembly of South and West Africa had some 3,600 Bahá'ís and 36 local assemblies. However none of the Bahá'ís from Mozambique were able to get passports to travel to Swaziland where the convention was held. Starting in 1967 the Bahá'í communities of several countries were re-organized away from the South and West Africa. From then Mozambique shared a regional national assembly with Swaziland and Lesotho which by then had about 2500 Bahá'ís and 23 Assemblies. At this inaugural convention Rudolfo Duna from Mozambique was able to attend the convention in Swaziland. A regional conference held at Maputo in 1969, was conducted by the Goals Committee of Mozambique, with people coming from Boane, Machava (see Estádio da Machava), and Matola. The 1969 members of the local assembly of Lourenço Marques, later named Maputo, were: Rafael Mafuana, Jose Rodrigues, Rudoljo Duna, Justino Moreira, Fernanda Moreira, Rosie Mary, Emilia Rodrigues, Angelica Duna and Hagar Langa. This regional national assembly continued into 1970 and in 1971 Lesotho formed its own national assembly.\n\nAt the April 1972 inaugural convention of regional assembly of Swaziland and Mozambique the first sizable delegation from Mozambique had been able to attend – six attended - and they announced that translations into Makhuwa language had been accomplished. The 1972 members of the Swaziland and Mozambique national assembly were Jacob Mdiuli, John Allen, Benjamin Dlamini, Charles Ducker, Charles Caprez, Valera Allen, Margaret Shongwe, Ruth Dlamini, Angelica Duna. Also in later 1972 the first Hand of the Cause of the Bahá'í Faith visited Mozambique. Rúhíyyih Khanum traveled through Mozambique as part of a tour of many African countries. However she was only able to spend one night there where she met with a few of the Portuguese Bahá'ís for an informal social evening in the lobby of the hotel she was staying at as there were restrictions on holding meetings. Following her trip, a Bahá'í in jail in Mozambique made some rings for members of the Universal House of Justice and Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum which reached her while she was at the dedication for the Bahá'í House of Worship in Panama. She offered the ring for sale to raise money for the next temple to be built. In response a Hawaiian was moved to offer a emerald he had acquired and set in a gold setting. That ring was delivered to help raise funds and arrived among the Persian Bahá'í community where it raised many thousands more. From the original ring through the end the rings raised over $100,000 for the Lotus Temple in India.\n\nIn 1973-4 Mozambique was among the national communities that responded to a survey on status of women in the community which was tabulated and summarized for the 1974 Statement to the 25th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nIn early 1976 Angola was added to the regional assembly with Mozambique and Swaziland. In 1976 a compilation of prayers in the Yao language, a language spoken in Mozambique and countries to the north, was published through the regional national assembly. From December 1976 refugees from the Mozambican Civil War who returned to Portugal also had contact with the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nIn 1977 Swaziland elected their own national assembly and Angola and Mozambique continued with a shared assembly. From 1978 to 1992 Angola and Mozambique shared a regional national assembly. In 1985 the Bahá'ís of Mozambique elected their first National Spiritual Assembly, witnessed by Continental Counselor Shidan Fat'he-Aazam.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1984 an agricultural project near Matola Rio with youth helping the community to cultivate the land around the Baha'i Center. In 1995 Bahá'ís gathered with others to form a \"Forum of Religions\", an organization for social and disaster relief.\n\nIn 2007 the Bahá'ís cooperated in an anti-malaria project with a broad group of religions.\nRegional conferences were called for by the Universal House of Justice 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. Just two weeks later twin conferences were held - one in South Africa and the other in Kenya. One regional conference was hosted by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Kenya in Nakuru in November 2008 and attracted over 1000 Bahá'ís - four of whom came from Mozambique.\n\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated just over 2,800 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n"}
{"id": "43777594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43777594", "title": "Baladi-rite prayer", "text": "Baladi-rite prayer\n\nThe Baladi-rite Prayer is the oldest known prayer-rite used by Yemenite Jews, transcribed in a \"tiklāl\" (\"siddur\", plural \"tikālil\") in Yemenite Jewish parlance.\n\nIt contains the prayers used by Israel for the entire year, as well as the format prescribed for the various blessings (benedictions) recited. Until the 16th century, all of Yemen's Jewry made use of this one rite. Older \"Baladi-rite\" prayer books were traditionally compiled in the Babylonian supralinear punctuation, although today, all have transformed and strictly make use of the Tiberian vocalization. The text, however, follows the traditional Yemenite punctuation of Hebrew words.\n\nThe Baladi-rite prayer book or Tiklāl remained in manuscript form until 1894, when the first printed edition (\"editio princeps\") was published in Jerusalem by the Yemenite Jewish community, which included the \"Etz Ḥayim\" commentary written by Rabbi Yiḥyah Salaḥ. Today, it is used primarily by the Baladi-rite congregations of Yemenite Jews in Israel and the Diaspora. Baladi is an Arabic word denoting \"of local use\" (i.e. Yemeni), as distinguished from the prayer-rite widely used in the north (i.e. Syria and the Land of Israel), which is called in Arabic \"Shāmī\" \"Levantine, Eastern\".\nThe \"Baladi-rite\" prayer differs in many aspects from the Sephardic rite prayer, or what was known locally as the \"Shāmī\"-rite prayer book, which by the 18th and 19th centuries was already widely used in Yemen, although only lately introduced into Yemen by Jewish travelers. Their predilection for books composed in the Land of Israel made them neglect their own hand-written manuscripts, though they were of a more exquisite and ancient origin.\n\nThe nineteenth century Jewish historiographer, Hayyim Hibshush, has given some insights into the conflict that arose in the Jewish community of Sana'a on account of the newer Sephardic prayer book being introduced there. Yiḥya, the son of one of the community's most respectable leaders, Shalom ben Aharon HaKohen al-Iraqi (known as \"al-'Usṭā\" - \"the artisan\"), whose father served under two Zaydi Imams between the years 1733–1761 as the surveyor general of public buildings, had tried to make the Sephardic prayer book the standard prayer-rite of all Jews in Yemen in the 18th century. This caused a schism in the Jewish community of Sana'a, with the more zealous choosing to remain faithful to their fathers' custom (i.e. the Baladi-rite) and to continue its perpetuation, since it was seen as embodying the original customs practised by Yemenite Jews. Out of a total of twenty-two synagogues in Sana'a, only three synagogues in the city chose to remain with the original Baladi-rite prayer, while the others adopted the Spanish-rite prayer with its innovations introduced by Isaac Luria. By the time of the Jewish community's demise, owing to mass immigration in the mid-20th century, most synagogues in Sana'a had already returned to praying in the Baladi-rite, albeit, in the vast majority of towns and villages across Yemen they clung to their adopted Sephardic-rite as found in the printed books of Venice, Thessaloniki, Amsterdam and, especially, the \"Tefillath Haḥodesh\" and \"Zekhor le-Avraham\" prayer books printed in Livorno.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ (1850–1931), a Chief Rabbi of Yemen, the original Yemenite version of the Amidah is the format that was prescribed by the Great Assembly (), who enacted the prayer in the fourth century BCE, with the one exception of the Benediction said against sectarians, which was enacted many years later. Yiḥyah Salaḥ (1713–1805) wrote an extensive commentary on the Baladi-rite Prayer Book in which he mostly upholds the old practices described therein (e.g. the practice of saying only one Mussaf-prayer during Rosh Hashanah, etc.), although he also compromises by introducing elements in the Yemenite prayer book taken from the books of the Kabbalists and the \"Shulchan Aruch\", which had already become popular in Yemen. He is often seen praising the old Yemenite customs and encouraging their upkeep:\n\nWhile the ancient format of the Amidah may have seen little changes since its enactment by the latter prophets, the history of the Yemenite \"Baladi-rite\" prayer book—as can be said about every Siddur—is a history of recensions and later interpolations, with the addition of elements taken from the Siddur of Rabbi Saadia Gaon and of Rabbi Amram Gaon, the printed Sephardic siddurs, as well as elements taken from liturgies found originally in the Land of Israel. Most of these changes began to make their way into the current Baladi-rite prayer book over a two-hundred year period, from the time of Rabbi Yiḥya Bashiri (d. 1661) who published his \"Tiklāl Bashiri\" in 1618 (a copy of which was made and published under the name \"Tiklāl Qadmonim\") to the time of Rabbi Yiḥya Saleh (d. 1805), the latter of whom incorporating in the \"Baladi-rite\" version elements taken from Kabbalah, as prescribed by Isaac Luria (Ari), as well as certain liturgical poems taken from the Sephardic prayer books. In the title page of one Yemenite Siddur completed in 1663 by the notable scribe and kabbalist, Rabbi Isaac b. Abraham Wannah, the copyist makes note of the fact that, aside from the regular customs of the people of Yemen, some of the entries in his Siddur have been culled \"from the customs of the people of Spain who have it as their practice to add in the prayers the \"Tikūn Ha-geshem\" and the \"Tikūn Ha-ṭal\" (special emendations made for rain and for dew so that they may not be withheld), as well as the \"Tikūnei Shabbat Malkah\" as is practised by the people of the Land of Israel,\" i.e., the Psalms readings beginning with לכו נרננה, etc., and the liturgy לכה דודי, followed by בר יוחאי, and יגדל אלהים חי. Originally, the practice was to begin the Sabbath prayer on the night of the Sabbath by reciting only “\"mizmor shir le'yom ha-shabbath\"” (Ps. 92). The first recorded mentioning of \"Tikūn Ha-ṭal\" (said before the \"Mussaf\"-prayer on the first day of Passover) in any extant Yemenite prayer book appeared only in 1583. Included in the \"Tikūnei Shabbat\" book were the special readings for the nights of \"Shavu'ot\" and \"Hoshanna Rabba\".\n\nThe texts of old Yemenite Siddurs copied by Rabbi Yihye Bashiri are an invaluable source for comparing the \"variae lectiones\" (Textual variations) of liturgy before the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud. For example, in all older Yemenite Siddurs copied by Bashiri is found the version גואל ישראל (\"He who redeems Israel\") in the second blessing after \"Qiryat Shema\" in the evening prayer and on the night of Passover, that is, in the present-progressive tense instead of in the past tense (גאל ישראל), although the requirement made by Rava in the Talmud calls for saying it in the past tense. Scholars point out that the Yemenite practice was the original custom in Yemen before Rava's interdict, the memorial of which also being brought down in the Jerusalem Talmud.\n\nAmong the later changes made to the text of the \"Baladi-rite\" prayer book is the wording \"Kether Yitenu\" (), etc., said during the \"Ḳeddushah\" (i.e. the third benediction in the prayer itself) at the time of the \"Mussaf\" prayer, as is the custom of Spain (Sepharad) with only minor variations. In spite of its wide acceptance in Yemen, among both Baladi and Shāmī congregations, Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ (d. 1932) did not accept this innovation, but rather ordained in his place of study to continue to say \"Naqdishakh\" () in all of the prayers, just as had been their accepted tradition from the Great Assembly. The Yemenite adaptation of saying \"Kether\" during the Mussaf—although not mentioned in the \"Order of Prayers\" prescribed by Maimonides—is largely due to the influence of Amram Gaon's \"Siddur\", which mentions the custom of the two Academies in Babylonia during the days of Natronai ben Hilai to say it during the third benediction of the 'Standing Prayer.' The practice of saying \"Kether\" during the \"Mussaf\" is also mentioned in the \"Zohar\" (\"Parashat Pinḥas\").\n\nNotable changes occurring in the Baladi-rite prayer book during the geonic period are the additions of \"Adon ha-ʿolamim\" (), which mark the opening words in the Baladi-rite Siddur before the Morning benediction, and the praise which appears further on and known as \"Barukh shʾamar\" (), which appears immediately following a short praise composed by Judah Halevi, \"Ha-mehulal le'olam\" (Heb. המהולל לעולם) and which is said before the recital of the selected Psalms (\"zemirot\"). These, among other innovations, have long since been an integral part of the Baladi-rite Siddur.\n\nIn subsequent generations, other additions have been added thereto, such as the \"Yotzer\" verses that are said on the Sabbath day (i.e. those verses which mention the creation, hence: \"yotzer\" = \"who createth\"); and the last blessing made in the recital of \"Ḳiryat Shĕma\" (i.e. the second blessing thereafter) on the Sabbath evening, since in the original prayer text there was no difference between Sabbaths and weekdays; Likewise, the modern practice is to chant the prosaic Song of the Sea (שירת הים) before one recites \"Yishtabaḥ\", although in the original \"Baladi-rite\" prayer the song came after \"Yishtabaḥ\", seeing that it is not one of the songs of David. In today's Baladi-ride Siddur, an interpolation of eighteen verses known as \"Rafa'eini Adonai we'erafei\" (Heb. רפאיני יי' וארפא) has been inserted between the prosaic Song of the Sea and \"Yishtabaḥ\", just as it appears in the \"Tiklāl Mashta\", compiled by Rabbi Shalom Shabazi in 1655, although the same verses do not appear in the \"Tiklāl Bashiri\" compiled in 1618. Another custom which has found its way into the Yemenite prayer book is the practice of rescinding all vows and oaths on the eve of Rosh Hashanah (Kol Nidre).\n\nMoreover, in the older handwritten Baladi-rite prayer books, in the first blessing following the \"Ḳiryat Shĕma\", or what is called in = \"emeth wayaṣiv\", the original Yemenite custom was to say only eight waws in the opening lines of the blessing, just as the blessing appears in Maimonides' \"Seder Ha-Tefillah\" (Order of Prayer), and not as it is now commonly practised to insert seven additional waws in the blessing for a total of fifteen. These changes, like the others, are directly related to the dissemination of Sephardic Siddurs in Yemen, and influenced, especially, by the writings of Rabbi David Abudirham.\n\nNo doubt the greatest changes to the Baladi-rite prayer book have come in wake of kabbalistic practices espoused by Isaac Luria, which have since been incorporated in the Yemenite Siddur. The proclamation \"Adonai melekh, Adonai malakh, Adonai yimlokh le'olam wa'ed\" said by some each day before \"Barukh shĕ'amar\" is from the teachings of Isaac Luria. The saying of \"Aleinu le'shebeaḥ\" (Heb. \"It is for us to praise the Lord of all things\", etc.) at the conclusion of the prayer, although originally said only during the Mussaf-prayer on Rosh Hashanah, is also an enactment made by Isaac Luria, Rabbi Moshe ben Machir and Meir ben Ezekiel ibn Gabbai.\n\nThe \"Shulchan Aruch\" has also left an indelible mark upon the Baladi-rite prayer in certain areas. Yiḥyah Salaḥ (1713–1805) mentions that the old-timers in Yemen were not accustomed to reciting \"Mizmor le'Todah\" (i.e. Psalm 100) in the \"Pesukei dezimra\" of the Morning Prayer (\"Shahrith\"), although it too soon became the norm in the Baladi-rite congregations, based on a teaching in the \"Shulchan Aruch\" (\"Orach Chaim\" § 51:9) and Rabbi Joseph Karo's specification that it be cited in the Morning Prayer. Yiḥyah Salaḥ agreed to insert it in his Baladi-rite prayer book, saying that it was deemed just and right to recite it, seeing that “there is in it a plethora of praise unto Him, the Blessed One.”\n\nYiḥyah Salaḥ also initiated the custom of saying \"Ṣidqathekha\", etc., in his own synagogue immediately following the Amidah of the Afternoon Prayer (Mincha) on Sabbath days, in accordance with an injunction in the \"Shulchan Aruch\" (\"Orach Chaim\" § 292:2), and which practice soon spread amongst other Baladi-rite congregations.\n\nThe \"Shulchan Aruch\", with Yiḥyah Salaḥ's endorsement of certain \"Halachic\" rulings, was also the cause for other Baladi-rite customs being cancelled altogether, such as the old Yemenite Jewish custom of saying a final blessing after eating the \"karpas\" (in Yemenite tradition, \"parsley\") on the night of Passover; and of saying a final blessing over the second cup of wine drunk on the night of Passover; and of making a distinction between the number of matzot that are to be taken up during the blessing when Passover falls on a Sabbath day, as opposed to when it falls on a regular day of the week; and the custom to drink a fifth cup of wine during the Passover Seder. Yiḥyah Salaḥ also changed the original Baladi-rite practice of gesticulating the lulav (the palm frond and its subsidiaries, \"viz\". the myrtle and willow branches in one's right hand, and the citron fruit in one's left), enacting that instead of the traditional manner of moving them forward, bringing them back, raising them up, and lowering them down, while in each movement he rattles the tip of the lulav three times, they would henceforth add another two cardinal directions, namely, to one's right and to one's left, as described in the \"Shulchan Arukh\" (\"Orach Chaim\" § 651:9). Not all changes in the siddur, however, were the result of Yiḥyah Salaḥ's own decision to force change in his community, but rather Yiḥyah Salaḥ chose to incorporate some of the Spanish rites and liturgies in the Baladi-rite prayer book since these same practices had already become popular in Yemen. One such practice was to begin the night of each \"Yom Tov\" (festival day) with the \"mizmor\" related to that particular holiday, although, originally, it was not a custom to do so, but only to begin the first night of each of the three Festival days by saying three \"mizmorim\" taken from Psalms 1, 2 and 150. The practice found its way into the Yemenite rite from the Spanish prayer books, whereas now the Yemenite custom incorporates both traditions.\n\nTo what extent Maimonides’ writings actually influenced the development of the Yemenite prayer ritual is disputed by scholars. Some suggest that since the Baladi-rite prayer is almost identical to the prayer format brought down by Maimonides (1138-1204) in his \"Mishneh Torah\" that it is merely a copy of Maimonides’ arrangement in prayer. This view, however, is rejected by Rabbi Yosef Qafih (1917–2000) and by Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf (1866–1940). According to Rabbi Yosef Qafih, the elders of Yemen preserved a tradition that the textual variant used by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah was copied down from the texts presented to him by the Jews of Yemen, knowing that they had preserved the ancient format of the prayers, with as few innovations as possible. Elsewhere, in the Preface to the Yemenite Baladi-rite prayer book, \"Siyaḥ Yerushalayim\", Rabbi Qafih writes that Maimonides searched for the most accurate prayer rite and found the Yemenite version to be the most accurate. According to Rabbi Avraham al-Naddaf, when the prayers established by Ezra and his court (the Men of the Great Assembly) reached Yemen, the Jews of Yemen accepted them and forsook those prayers that they had formerly been accustomed to from the time of the Temple. In subsequent generations, both, in the Land of Israel and in Babylonia, the rabbinic scholars of Israel made additional innovations by adding certain texts and liturgies to the prayer format established by Ezra, which too were accepted by the Jews of Yemen (such as \"Nishmath kol ḥai\", and the prosaic \"Song of the Sea\", established by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai). Later, penitential verse written by Rabbi Saadia Gaon, by Rabbi Yehudah Halevi and by Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra came to be incorporated in their prayer books. Eventually, when Maimonides came along and arranged the prayers in his \"Code of Jewish law\", the Jews of Yemen saw that his words were in agreement with what they had in their own prayer books, wherefore, they received him as a rabbi over them, although Maimonides had only written the format that he received from the Men of the Great Assembly, and that it happens to be the original version practised formerly by the Jews of Spain.\n\nRabbi Avraham al-Naddaf’s view is corroborated by an ancient Jewish source contemporaneous with Maimonides’ \"Mishneh Torah\" before his momentous work reached Yemen, in which Jewish scholars in Yemen had debated on how to arrange the second blessing after the Shema during the Evening Prayer. The source was copied down by Yiḥyah Salaḥ from the glosses of the Baladi-rite Prayer Book (\"Tiklāl\") written by Rabbi Yihye Bashiri (d. 1661), and who, in turn, copied it from the work of a Yemenite Jewish scholar, entitled \"Epistle: Garden of Flowers\" (), in which he wrote the following:\n\nBased on this testimony it is evident that the Talmud, along with Maimonides’ order of the prayer as transcribed in his Mishneh Torah, have been used together to establish the final textual form of the Baladi-rite prayer commonly used in Yemen. Prior to Maimonides, the general trend in Yemen was also to follow the \"halakhic\" rulings of the geonim, including their format used in the blessings. Rabbi Saʻīd ibn Daoud al-ʻAdeni, in a commentary which he wrote on Maimonides' \"Mishneh Torah\" (ca. 1420 – 1482), writes of the final blessing said over wine: \"What is found in the writings of most of the \"geonim\" is to conclude the blessing after drinking the fruit of the vine by saying, ['Blessed art Thou, O Lord], \"for the vine and the fruit of the vine\",' and thus is it found written in the majority of the prayer books in the cities throughout Yemen.\" However, today, in all the Baladi-rite prayer books, the custom after drinking wine is to conclude the blessing with the format that is brought down in Maimonides, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, \"for the land and for its fruits\"\", showing that Maimonides' impact over the development of the Yemenite Siddur has been vital.\n\nThe Baladi-rite prayer in its current textual form, at least in its uniqueness as a text that stands in a distinct category of its own and that does not fully conform with any other version, belongs without question to the Babylonian or eastern branch of the prayer ritual variants, a branch whose first clear formulation came through Rabbi Saadia Gaon and his Siddur. By simple comparison with other prayer-rites of other Jewish communities, the Yemenite version shows distinct signs of antiquity, in which, generally speaking, it is possible to say that it is the version least adulterated of all prayer versions practised in Israel today, including the original Ashkenazi version. In spite of a general trend to accommodate other well-known Jewish traditions (e.g. Sephardic, etc.), the Baladi-rite prayer book has still retained much of its traditional distinguishing features. Among them:\n\n\n\nOne of the more salient features of all the older Baladi-rite prayer books, as well as those compiled by Rabbi Yiḥya Bashiri, is the Aramaic \"Megillat Antiochus\" with Saadia Gaon's Arabic translation, the original Aramaic being written by the elders of the Schools of Shammai and Hillel.\nAccording to 16th–17th century Yemenite prayer books, many Yemenites, but not all, recited but only the first chapter of Avoth after the Shabbath Minchah prayer, doing so throughout the entire year. Beginning with the 17th century, external influence—just as with the Shami prayer text—brought about completely changed customs, with the prevalent custom today being to read the entire tractate throughout the Sabbaths between Passover and Shavuoth, a chapter each Shabbath as non-Yemenite Jews customarily do. Rabbi Yosef Shalom Koraḥ was quoted as pointing out that in the synagogues of Rabbi Yiḥye Qafih and Rabbi Yiḥye al-Abyadh, rather than apportioning the learning for the Sabbaths between Pesaḥ and Atzeret, they would learn the entire tractate with Maimonides' commentary during the two days of Shavuoth.\n\nThe old Yemenite siddurim did not mention anything unique about the night of \"Shavuoth\" compared to other holidays; the practice relating to the Tikkun came to Yemen only from approximately the second half of the eighteenth century. Furthermore, while in most of the synagogues in Yemen they would learn the \"Tikkūn\" printed in Machzorim and Sefardic Siddurim, in some they would learn the Sefer Hamitzvot compiled by Maimonides, while by Rabbi Yihya Qafih it was learnt in its original Arabic. Even among the Baladi-rite congregations in Sana'a who embraced Kabbalah, they received with some reservation the custom of the \"kabbalists\" to recite the \"Tikkūn\" all throughout the night, and would only recite the \"Tikkūn\" until about midnight, and then retire to their beds.\n\n\nThe 'Standing Prayer' known as the Eighteen Benedictions, or Amidah, as prescribed in the Yemenite \"Baladi-rite\" tradition, and which is recited three times a day during weekdays, is here shown (with an English translation): (Open window for text)\n\"Nishmath Kol Hai\" is recited on the Sabbath day, and dates back to the 1st century CE:\n\nAlthough the word \"Baladi\" is used to denote the traditional Yemenite Jewish prayer, the word is also used to designate the old Yemenite Jewish custom in many non-related issues treating on Jewish legal law (Halacha) and ritual practices, and which laws are mostly aligned with the teachings of Maimonides' \"Code of Jewish Law\", as opposed to the \"Shulchan Arukh\" of Rabbi Joseph Karo.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30766135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30766135", "title": "Bojjannakonda", "text": "Bojjannakonda\n\nBojjannakonda and Lingalakonda are two Buddhist rock-cut caves on adjacent hillocks, situated near a village called Sankaram, which is a few kilometres away from Anakapalle, Vishakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The sites are believed to date between 4th and 9th Century A.D, when the 3 phases of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana) flourished at Sankaram (Sangharam as it was called then) .\n\nSankaram, a small village, is situated about a mile to the east of Anakapalli in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. A short distance to the north of the village are two hills, the one on the east called Bojjannakonda and the other on the west called Lingalakonda, both of which are surrounded by paddy fields. The hills contain numerous monolithic stupas, rock-cut caves, chaityas and monasteries forming one of the most remarkable Buddhist establishments in Andhra Pradesh during the period from the 4th to the 9th Century CE. The name of the village Sankaram is evidently a corruption of Sangharam (Boudha-arama, i.e., vihara) as these Buddhist establishments are generally known.\n\nThis is the eastern hill. It is covered with a large group of monolithic stupas surrounding the rock-cut platforms of the Maha stupa\nThe dome of the stupa is found constructed of brick.\n\nIt was excavated under the aegis of Alexander Rim in 1906. Interesting aspect of this site is it feature all three phases of Buddhism i.e. Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana.\n\nGroups of rock-cut and brick stupas and small chaityas surround this stupa. In two of the brick stupas, stone relic caskets in the form of miniature stupas were found. There is also a stone [Linga being the name locally applied to the stupa]. An image of the Goddess Hariti is found at the foot of the hill as per the archaeological sources.\n\nOn this hill there are six rock-cut caves of which some have sculptured panels. One main cave has sixteen pillars, or which five are broken, and it enshrines a monolithic stupa in the centre. There is a pradakshina-patha around it. On the ceiling over the stupa is a carving of a chhatra, i.e., umbrella which was originally connected with the top of the stupa, the shaft being now lost. Above this cave, is an upper storey with the figures of Buddha. In all, on this hill [Bojjannakonda], there are six rock-cut caves of which some have sculptured panels. Most panels consists of a seated Buddha and attendants.\nThe western hill, known as Lingalakonda, is covered with a large number of rock-cut small stupas forming the shape of a ridge. Numerous antiquities were recovered during the excavations conducted by Mr. Alexander Rea in 1907-08 on both the hills.\n\nDuring Excavations From this area, as per the archaeological sources, pottery, seals, terracotta inscribed tablets, terracotta beads, and terracotta figures, one gold coin belonging to Samudra Gupta of the Gupta dynasty who ruled Magadha from 340 to 375 A.D, some copper coins belonging to the Eastern Chalukya king Vishnuvardhana surnamed Vishamasiddhi (633 A.D.) and only one lead coin were recovered. It has the impression of a horse and as such might belong to the later Satavahanas. It is on the evidence of these antiquities that it has been possible to date the Buddhist settlement here as lying between the 2nd and the 9th century A.D. For, among the earliest coins discovered at the site is that of Samudra Gupta of the 4th century AD.\n\nAs Buddhism began to spread, many centres of learning and viharas for the monks were set up in various regions. \nThey can also be seen at Thotlakonda, Bavikonda, Pavurallakonda around Visakhapatnam. \nThey all flourished around 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE, but then gradually faded out, probably due to the revival of Hinduism.\n\nBuddhist monks used to worship on the hill 2,000 years ago. It was originally known as Buddhuni konda (hill of the Buddha) but it came to be known as ‘Bojjannakonda' in course of time. Vaisakha Pournami is also celebrated on a large scale here at Bojjannakonda.\n\nThe Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage, (INTACH), has already appealed to the authorities to ensure better protection of Buddhist sites by taking up the declaration of Bavikonda, Thotlakonda, Pavurallakonda and Bojjannakonda as heritage sites by UNESCO. This will not only pave the way for steady flow of funds, but also generate employment opportunities for the locals.\n"}

{"id": "7272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7272", "title": "Christianity and homosexuality", "text": "Christianity and homosexuality\n\nWithin Christianity, there are a variety of views on sexual orientation and homosexuality. The many Christian denominations vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as sinful, through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality.\n\nHistorically, from the earliest days, Christians have taught that same-sex acts are contrary to Biblical teaching: Tertullian (155 – c. 240), Cyprian (c. 200 – 258), Ambrosiaster (300s), John Chrysostom (c. 349 – 407), Severian of Gabala 1:27 (before 380 – before 425). The teachings of various church groups through the past centuries is surveyed in an article on the history of Christianity and homosexuality.\n\nThis article focuses on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, covering how the extent to which the Bible mentions the subject, whether or not it is condemned, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics. Debate has arisen over the proper interpretation of the Levitical code; the story of Sodom and Gomorrah; and various Pauline passages, and whether these verses condemn same-sex sexual activities.\n\nThe Catholic Church views as sinful any sexual act not related to procreation by couple joined under the Sacrament of Matrimony. The Church states that \"homosexual tendencies\" are \"objectively disordered\", but does not consider the tendency itself to be sinful but rather a temptation toward sin. The Church, however, considers \"homosexual acts\" to be \"grave sins\", \"intrinsically disordered\", and \"contrary to the natural law\", and \"under no circumstances can they be approved\".\n\nIn January 2018 German bishop Franz-Josef Bode of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück said in an interview with German journalists that blessing of same-sex unions is possible in Roman Catholic churches in Germany. In February 2018, German Roman Catholic cardinal Reinhard Marx, chairman of the German Bishops' Conference, said in an interview with German journalists that blessing of same-sex unions is possible in Roman Catholic churches in Germany. In Austria blessing of same sex unions is allowed in two churches located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox churches, like the Catholic Church, condemns only homosexual acts.\n\nAll Orthodox Church jurisdictions, such as the Orthodox Church in America, have taken the approach of welcoming people with \"homosexual feelings and emotions,\" while encouraging them to work towards \"overcoming its harmful effects in their lives,\" and not allowing the sacraments to people who seek to justify homosexual activity.\n\nCertain other Christian denominations do not view monogamous same-sex relationships as sinful or immoral, and may bless such unions and consider them marriages. These include the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, all German Lutheran, reformed and united churches in EKD, all Swiss reformed churches, the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the United Protestant Church in Belgium, the United Protestant Church of France, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Iceland, the Church of Norway, and the Uniting Church in Australia. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland also allows prayer for same-sex couples. The Metropolitan Community Church was founded specifically to serve the Christian LGBT community. The Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals (GAAAP), traces its roots back to 1980, making it the oldest LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostal denomination in existence. Another such organization is the Affirming Pentecostal Church International, currently the largest affirming Pentecostal organization, with churches in the US, UK, Central and South America, Europe and Africa.\n\nLGBT-affirming denominations regard homosexuality as a natural occurrence. The United Church of Christ celebrates gay marriage, and some parts of the Anglican and Lutheran churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The United Church of Canada also allows same-sex marriage, and views sexual orientation as a gift from God. Within the Anglican communion, there are openly gay clergy, for example, Gene Robinson is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion, there are openly gay clergy, too, for example, bishop Eva Brunne is an openly lesbian Bishop in the Church of Sweden. Such religious groups and denominations interpretation of scripture and doctrine leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the United Church of Canada, that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that \"a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full member of the Church\"; and \"b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry.\" In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that \"human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation.\"\n\nIn addition, some Christian denominations such as the Moravian Church, believe that the Bible speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy on homosexuality and the ordination of homosexuals. In 2014, Moravian Church in Europe allowed blessings of same-sex unions.\n\nLiberal Quakers, those in membership of Britain Yearly Meeting and Friends General Conference in the US approve of same-sex marriage and union. Quakers were the first Christian group in the United Kingdom to advocate for equal marriage and Quakers in Britain formally recognised same-sex relationships in 1963. The United Methodist Church allowed in May 2018 LGBT clergy and same-sex marriages in their churches.\n\nChurches within Lutheranism hold stances on the issue ranging from labeling homosexual acts as sinful, to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the Lutheran Church of Australia, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations. However, the Church of Sweden conducts same-sex marriages, while the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships. The Ethiopian Mekane Yesus Lutheran Church, however, has taken a stand that marriage is inherently between a man and a woman, and has formally broken fellowship with the ELCA, a doctrinal stand that has cost the Ethiopian church ELCA financial support.\n\nSome mainline Protestant denominations, such as the African Methodist churches,the Reformed Church in America,and the Presbyterian Church in America have a conservative position on the subject.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church \"recognizes that every human being is valuable in the sight of God, and seeks to minister to all men and women [including homosexuals] in the spirit of Jesus,\" while maintaining that homosexual sex itself is forbidden in the Bible. \"Jesus affirmed the dignity of all human beings and reached out compassionately to persons and families suffering the consequences of sin. He offered caring ministry and words of solace to struggling people, while differentiating His love for sinners from His clear teaching about sinful practices.\"\n\nMost of the Anglican Communion does not approve of homosexual activity, with the exception of the Episcopal Church, the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada, which is facing a possible exclusion from international Anglican bodies over the issue. Conservative Quakers, those within Friends United Meeting and the Evangelical Friends International believe that sexual relations are condoned only in marriage, which they define to be between a man and a woman.\n\nThe positions of the evangelical churches are varied. They range from liberal to conservative, through moderate. \nSome evangelical churches in the United States have anti-gay activists who consider that homosexuality is at the root of many social problems. Some evangelical churches in Uganda strongly oppose homosexuality and homosexuals. They have campaigned for laws criminalizing homosexuality. \n\nSome evangelical pastors with antigay speeches have been outed.\n\nTed Haggard is the founder of megachurch Charismatic Christianity New Life Church in Colorado Springs, USA. Married with five children, Ted was an anti-gay activist and said he wanted to ban homosexuality from the church. In 2006, he was dismissed from his position as senior pastor after a prostitute claimed to have had sex with him for 3 years. After denying the relationship, the pastor admitted that the allegations were accurate.\n\nGeorge Alan Rekers is a Baptist pastor of the Southern Baptist Convention in the US and a psychologist. He was an anti-gay activist. In 2010, he was outed by his openly gay male escort. Rekers claimed to be attempting to convert the young men to Christianity and said that he hired him to carry his luggage.\n\nThere are some international evangelical denominations that are gay-friendly, such as the Alliance of Baptists and Affirming Pentecostal Church International.\n\nA 2014 survey reported that 43% of white evangelical American Christians between the ages of 18 and 33 supported same-sex marriage. Some evangelical churches accept homosexuality and celebrate gay weddings. Pastors have also been involved in changing the traditional position of their church. In 2014, the New Heart Community Church of La Mirada, a Baptist Church in the suburbs of Los Angeles was expelled from the Southern Baptist Convention for this purpose. In 2015, GracePointe Church in Franklin in the suburbs of Nashville made this decision. It lost over half of her weekly attendance (from 1,000 to 482). \n\nSome churches have a moderate position. Although they do not approve homosexual practices, they show sympathy and respect for homosexuals.\n\nReflecting this position, some pastors, for example, showed moderation during public statements. For example, Pastor Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church in Houston said in 2013 he found it unfortunate that several Christian ministers focus on the homosexuality by forgetting the other sins described in the Bible. He said that Jesus did not come to condemn people, but to save them. Other pastors also share this view. \n\nPastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church New York City said in 2014 that gays were numerous in their church and he prayed that Hillsong always welcoming.\n\nPastor Andy Stanley of North Point Community Church in Alpharetta, mentioned in 2015 that the church should be the safest place on the planet for students to talk about anything, including same-sex attraction.\n\nThere is also a movement of people who consider themselves \"gay Evangelicals\". Composed mainly of young people, the movement is positioned against liberals and conservatives. Recognizing themselves as gay or bisexual, these young people believe that their attraction to same-sex people, while present, does not allow them to have homosexual relationships. They say that their Christian conversion did not instantly change their sexual desires. They insist that the church should always reject homosexual practices, but that it should welcome gay people.\n\nThere are also believers gathered in Christian organizations of evangelical orientation, such as \"Your Other Brothers\" or \"Voice of the Voiceless\", who claim they have not been attracted to homosexuality since their new birth, without having recourse to a conversion therapy. They insist on the importance of welcoming and loving homosexuals, but believe that sexuality should be reserved for heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe French Evangelical Alliance, a member of the European Evangelical Alliance and the World Evangelical Alliance, adopted on 12 October 2002, through its National Council, a document entitled \"Foi, espérance et homosexualité\" (\"Faith, Hope and Homosexuality \"), in which homophobia, hatred and rejection of homosexuals are condemned, but which denies homosexual practices and full church membership of unrepentant homosexuals and those who approve of these practices. In 2015, the Conseil national des évangéliques de France (French National Council of Evangelicals) reaffirmed its position on the issue by opposing marriage of same-sex couples, while not rejecting homosexuals, but wanting to offer them more than a blessing; an accompaniment and a welcome. \n\nThe French evangelical pastor Philippe Auzenet, a chaplain of the association Oser en parler, regularly intervenes on the subject in the media. It promotes dialogue and respect, as well as sensitization in order to better understand homosexuals. He also said in 2012 that Jesus would go to a gay bar, because he was going to all people with love.\n\nPhilip Igbinijesu, a pastor of the Lagos Word Assembly, an Evangelical church, said in a message to his church that the Nigerian law on homosexuality (inciting denunciation) was hateful. He recalled that homosexuals are creatures of God and that they should be treated with respect.\n\nRestorationist churches, like Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventist, and the mainline Mormon Church (LDS) generally teach that homosexuals are 'broken' and can be 'fixed'. The LDS church known as the Community of Christ fully accepts LGBT persons, performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBT members. Within the Stone-Campbell aligned restorationist churches the views are divergent. The churches of Christ (A Capella) and the Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ mostly adhere to a very conservative ideology; socially, politically, and religiously and are generally not accepting of openly LGBT members and will not perform weddings for gay and lesbian couples. The Disciples of Christ, is fully accepting of LGBT persons, often performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBT members. The United Church of Christ is an officially \"open and affirming\" church. Other Restorationist churches such as The Brethren (see Mennonite) and Millerite churches, have taken mixed positions but are increasingly accepting with some of their congregations fully accepting LGBT persons in all aspects of religious and political life.\n\nMany American Evangelical and Fundamentalist Christians regard homosexual acts as sinful and think they should not be accepted by society. They tend to interpret biblical verses on homosexual acts to mean that the heterosexual family was created by God to be the bedrock of civilization and that same-sex relationships contradict God’s design for marriage and violate his will. Christians who oppose homosexual relationships sometimes contend that same-gender sexual activity is unnatural.\n\nChristian objections to homosexual behavior are based upon their interpretations of the Bible. Some Christians interpret the book of Leviticus as prohibiting homosexual sex. Some Biblical scholars interpret as indicating that homosexual activity led to the destruction of the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Other Biblical passages that some interpret as addressing the issue of homosexual behavior include , , , and .\nChristian author and counselor Joe Dallas says that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual acts uniformly prohibit that behavior. Christian organisations such as the former 'ex-gay' group Exodus International take the view that offers Christian believers \"freedom from homosexuality,\" although Exodus ceased activities in June 2013, issuing a statement which repudiated some of its aims and apologized for the harm their pursuit has caused to LGBT people.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states \"men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies ... must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.\" \"Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\" They oppose criminal penalties against homosexuality. The Catholic Church requires those who are attracted to people of the same (or opposite) sex to practice chastity, because it teaches that sexuality should only be practiced within marriage, which includes chaste sex as permanent, procreative, heterosexual, and monogamous. The Vatican distinguishes between \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" and the \"expression of a transitory problem\", in relation to ordination to the priesthood; saying in a 2005 document that homosexual tendencies \"must be clearly overcome at least three years before ordination to the diaconate.\" A 2011 report based on telephone surveys of American Catholics conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 56% believe that sexual relations between two people of the same sex are not sinful.\n\nConfessional Lutheran churches teach that it is sinful to have homosexual desires, even if they do not lead to homosexual activity. The Doctrinal statement issued by the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod states that making a distinction between homosexual orientation and the act of homosexuality is confusing:\nHowever, confessional Lutherans also warn against selective morality which harshly condemns homosexuality while treating other sins more lightly.\n\nIn opposing interpretations of the Bible that are supportive of homosexual relationships, conservative Christians have argued for the reliability of the Bible, and the meaning of texts related to homosexual acts, while often seeing what they call the diminishing of the authority of the Bible by many homosexual authors as being ideologically driven.\n\nAs an alternative to a school-sponsored Day of Silence opposing bullying of LGBT students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying \"As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect.\" Others created a Day of Dialogue to oppose what they believe is the silencing of Christian students who make public their opposition to homosexuality.\n\nOn August 29, 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \"Nashville Statement\". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief.\n\nIn the 20th century, theologians like Jürgen Moltmann, Hans Küng, John Robinson, Bishop David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, and Bishop Jack Spong challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as \"homosexuality.\" Clay Witt, a minister in the Metropolitan Community Church, explains how theologians and commentators like John Shelby Spong, George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding pagan faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: \"England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibitions in and suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'\".\n\nIn 1986 the Evangelical and Ecumenical Women’s Caucus (EEWC), then known as the Evangelical Women's Caucus International, passed a resolution stating: \"Whereas homosexual people are children of God, and because of the biblical mandate of Jesus Christ that we are all created equal in God's sight, and in recognition of the presence of the lesbian minority in EWCI, EWCI takes a firm stand in favor of civil rights protection for homosexual persons.\"\n\nSome Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBT orientation as currently understood. Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in Hebrew or Greek. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars. There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles. They consider some verses such as those they say support slavery or the inferior treatment of women as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible. They cite these issues when arguing for a change in theological views on sexual relationships to what they say is an earlier view. They differentiate among various sexual practices, treating rape, prostitution, or temple sex rituals as immoral and those within committed relationships as positive regardless of sexual orientation. They view certain verses, which they believe refer only to homosexual rape, as not relevant to consensual homosexual relationships.\n\nYale professor John Boswell has argued that a number of Early Christians entered into homosexual relationships, and that certain Biblical figures had homosexual relationships, such as Ruth and her mother-in-law Naomi, Daniel and the court official Ashpenaz, and David and King Saul's son Jonathan. Boswell has also argued that adelphopoiesis, a rite bonding two men, was akin to a religiously sanctioned same-sex union. Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite. His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a Platonic brotherly bond, not a homosexual union. He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century. Boswell's critics point out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality as a sin even if they do not prescribe a specific punishment, and that Boswell's arguments are based on sources which reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties, rather than a change in doctrine, from the 12th century onwards.\n\nDesmond Tutu, the former Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has described homophobia as a \"crime against humanity\" and \"every bit as unjust\" as apartheid: \"We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. ... We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities. We make them doubt that they too are children of God – and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy. We blame them for what they are.\"\n\nModern gay Christian leader Justin R. Cannon promotes what he calls \"Inclusive Orthodoxy\" (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: \"Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith.\" Cannon's ministry takes a unique and distinct approach from modern liberal Christians while still supporting homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says \"...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered.\"\n\nToday, many religious people are becoming more affirming of same-sex relationships, even in denominations with official stances against homosexuality. In the United States, people in denominations who are against same-sex relationships are liberalizing quickly, though not as quickly as those in more affirming groups. This social change is creating tension within many denominations, and even schisms and mass walk-outs among Mormons and other conservative groups.\n\nGeorge Barna, a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed. He characterized some of his leading conclusions from the data as follows:\"People who portray gay adults as godless, hedonistic, Christian bashers are not working with the facts. A substantial majority of gays cite their faith as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to Jesus Christ active in their life today. The data indicate that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians. Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God. Homosexuals appreciate their faith but they do not prioritize it, and they tend to consider faith to be individual and private rather than communal.\" The study of 20 faith-oriented attributes revealed significant differences between the United States heterosexual and homosexual populations sampled, homosexual respondents being less likely to be \"born again Christians\" than heterosexual respondents (27% compared to 47%), and the degree of commitment to their faith and families also differed. Other significant contrasts were seen in regards to \"liberal\" versus \"conservative\" social positions, as well as in one’s understanding of God, with 43% of homosexual participants sharing the \"orthodox, biblical\" understanding of God which 71% of heterosexual participants indicate they do. Respondents were not asked to describe themselves as \"born again\", but as is standard in Barna studies, this classification was defined according to basic standard criteria. Barna concluded, \"The data indicates that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians.\" And that \"Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God.\"\n\nCandace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of online magazine \"Whosoever\", responded to the findings:\n\nAll in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian religious belief. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old \"gays vs. God\" dichotomy that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians – they're just not as good as straight ones.\n\nShe argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his \"arrière pensée.\" The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad contradictions.\n\nOrganizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational Gay Christian Network has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as \"Side A\" and \"Side B\", respectively. According to founder Justin Lee, \"We're just trying to get people together who experience attraction to the same sex, however they have handled that, and who love Jesus and say, OK, you are welcome here, and then let's pray together and figure out where God wants us to take it.\"\n\nSome organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as Courage International and North Star. Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate same-sex attractions. Love Won Out and the now-defunct Exodus International are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as ex-gay organizations, though many no longer use the term. Alan Chambers, the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation, though the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays continues to use the term. In addition, individual Christians identifying as gay who want to subscribe to the conservative ethic are becoming more vocal themselves.\n\nGay Christian writer and actor Peterson Toscano argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a \"ruse.\" An organization he co-founded, Beyond Ex-Gay, supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.\n\nOther groups support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, IntegrityUSA represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the Episcopal Church, while United Methodists have the Reconciling Ministries Network and evangelical Christians have \"Evangelicals Concerned\". In 2014 the United Church of Christ filed a lawsuit challenging North Carolina’s ban on same-sex marriage, which is America’s first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans; the Alliance of Baptists joined the lawsuit later that year.\n\nIn Europe, lesbian and gay evangelical Christians have a European forum. Working within the worldwide Anglican Communion on a range of discrimination issues, including those of LGBT clergy and people in the church, is \"Inclusive Church\". The longest standing group for lesbian and gay Christians in the UK, founded in 1976, is the non-denominational Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement; specifically aimed to meet the needs of lesbian and gay evangelicals, there is the \"Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians\"; specifically working within the Church of England is \"Changing Attitude\", which also takes an international focus in working for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender affirmation within the Anglican Communion.\n\nSociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBT members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric. His research shows that those LGBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches \"kill the messenger\" by attacking the minister's knowledge about homosexuality, personal morality, focus on sin instead of forgiveness, and motivations for preaching against homosexuality.\n\n\n"}

Coe would popularize this notion through the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches. While it was initially understood as part of a liberal approach to theology, it has grown in currency among evangelicals and Roman Catholics.\n\nAn individual may come from a particular cultural worldview, such as Arabic or Asian culture, or be faced with particular sociopolitical issues. Hence, examples of contextualized theologies include Latin American liberation theology, Minjung theology, and African theology.\n\nThe systematic theologian Regunta Yesurathnam sees contextual theology as including \"all that is implied in indigenization or inculturation, but also seeks also to include the realities of contemporary, secularity, technology, and the struggle for human justice.\" The missiologist Stephen Bevans argues that there is no such thing as normative theology, that \"doing theology contextually is not an option\" since it is a human enterprise which is created within a particular human context.\n\nIn the field of Bible translation and interpretation, contextualization is the process of assigning meaning as a means of interpreting the environment within which a text or action is executed.\n\nContextualization is used in the study of Bible translations in relation to their relevant cultural settings.

However, since the early 1970s, the word's meaning has widened.

{"id": "13376770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13376770", "title": "Deadly Premonition", "text": "Deadly Premonition\n\nDeadly Premonition is a survival horror video game developed by Access Games for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, the story follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which bears similarities to a series of murders across the country. \"Deadly Premonition\" was originally released in 2010 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; the Xbox 360 version was published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe. Marvelous Entertainment released the PlayStation 3 version exclusively in Japan. A director's cut edition for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was released worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013.\n\n\"Deadly Premonition\" is a reboot of Access Games' earlier video game \"Rainy Woods\". In production since 2004, \"Rainy Woods\" was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technical issues. Upon its release, \"Deadly Premonition\" received wildly varying critical reviews, eventually holding the Guinness World Record for the most critically polarizing survival horror game. It has since garnered a cult following and has been cited as an example of games as art.\n\n\"Deadly Premonition\" is a survival horror game set in an open world environment and played from an over-the shoulder third-person perspective. The game's objective is to guide the player character, FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, as he investigates the identity of the Raincoat Killer, who is responsible for a murder in the rural town of Greenvale. York receives in-game money for numerous actions—both for finishing levels and for minor events, such as shaving or changing suits; he can also be fined for poor performance, such as wearing dirty clothes. Additionally, he requires food and sleep at regular intervals, as indicated by the gauges measuring his hunger and need for sleep. If his gauge for sleepiness reaches zero, he will become hungry more quickly; if his gauge for hunger depletes, he will begin to lose health. Sleeping restores his health and tiredness, while food and items to ward off sleepiness, such as coffee, can be purchased from stores in Greenvale.\n\nYork may explore Greenvale on foot, by car, or by using a special item obtained by completing a sidequest. Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time to make use of their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they go about their business. It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.\n\n\"Deadly Premonition\" contains several combat sequences, in which York encounters supernatural enemies while trapped in the Other World. York may battle them using melee weapons or firearms, or may choose to evade them by holding his breath. Melee weapons will eventually break with continued use, and York's pulse increases whenever he runs or holds his breath. Periodically, York encounters the Raincoat Killer, which will activate either a quick time event, a chase sequence, or a hiding event necessary to escape the murderer. During the Other World sequences, York's primary objective is to investigate crimes that took place there in the recent past. He collects photos of evidence to use to \"profile\" the scene and reconstruct events that took place with his deductive skills. Furthermore, the Other World regularly affects the entire town, excepting the interior of buildings, from midnight to six in the morning.\n\n\"Deadly Premonition\" is set in a fictional universe, in which good and evil are spread by the messengers influenced by the Forest and Red Tree respectively. Contrasting pairs play a role in the game, such as \"good and evil, reality and abnormality, earthly life and eternal life, day and night, criminals and victims, the forest and the red tree, and twins and dual personalities.\" Throughout the game, the protagonist, Francis York Morgan (Jeff Kramer), periodically visits two supernatural rooms: the White Room and the Red Room. The White Room represents a normal subconscious, while the Red Room represents one influenced by evil.\n\nFrancis York Morgan investigates the murder of 18-year-old Anna Graham (Melissa Hutchison) in the rural town of Greenvale, Washington, in the United States. He takes on the case due to the manner of the killing: a ritualistic murder of a young woman where red seeds have been found on or near the body, similar to a series of other murders across the United States. York generates considerable friction with his dismissive attitude toward the locals, bizarre demeanor, and tendency to interrupt conversations to deliver asides to an unseen person he refers to as \"Zach\". He is assisted by the town's sheriff George Woodman (Casey Robertson), who is scarred by a past of childhood abuse; the deputy sheriff Emily Wyatt (Rebecca Wink), who moved to the town from Seattle during her high-school years; and Thomas MacLaine (Christopher Sullivan), George's meek assistant who excels at cooking. Additionally, York finds himself regularly ambushed and attacked by the Raincoat Killer, who, according to the folklore of the town, kills only when it rains.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Anna's close friend Becky Ames (Amy Provenzano) and Diane (Christiane Crawford), Becky's elder sister and art gallery owner, are murdered in a similar fashion, with a mark placed nearby that York believes to be a peace symbol upside-down. He learns that the red seeds originate from Greenvale and that there are two Raincoat Killers. The original one, who inspired the folklore, went on a killing spree after the United States military released gas made from the red seeds into the town in 1956, causing the residents to temporarily experience an uncontrollable, murderous rage. The second, the New Raincoat Killer, hopes to gain immortality by consuming the red seeds and murdering four people.\n\nYork suspects Thomas' involvement in the crimes and is subsequently kidnapped by him. York realizes his romantic feelings for Emily, who searches for him with Forrest Kaysen (Doug Boyd), a traveling tree salesman. During a confrontation with her, Thomas—who belongs to a secret club built by George, together with his younger sister Carol (Amy Rubinate)—falls on a hook, dying in the process. York reveals that he believes the copycat raincoat killer is George. Emily and York find the final victim, Carol, dying; Carol then forces Emily to ingest some of the red seeds out of jealousy that George only loves her. York then leaves Emily in Kaysen's care. He confronts George (who confesses to being the murderer and has gained shape-shifting powers as the result of eating the red seeds) and kills him.\n\nAfterward, York realizes that, while George was the Greenvale killer, he could not have been responsible for the other similar murders nationwide and was likely just a pawn. He eventually discovers that Kaysen is responsible, and that the symbol seen close to all the victims was a tree. York finds that Kaysen has planted a tree inside Emily's stomach, and the sight causes him to recover his repressed memories: as a child, Zach witnessed his mother (Rebecca Wink) dying with a tree sprouting from her body, with his father (David Rosenthal) and Kaysen in the room. His father was unable to kill her out of mercy, leading to a more agonising death for her, and then he killed himself. Unable to cope with the trauma, Zach psychologically switched places with his newly created other personality, York. Though unable to save Emily, Zach kills Kaysen, a supernatural entity from the Red World and messenger of the Red Tree, and leaves the town with optimism for his future. In the closing scene, York, Emily, Thomas, and all of the Greenvale murder victims are seen happily existing in the alternate reality.\n\n\"Deadly Premonition\" originates from \"Rainy Woods\", a game that Access Games began work on in 2004. \"Rainy Woods\" debuted as a multi-platform title for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 game consoles during the Tokyo Game Show 2007, during which several video game journalists noted that the title shared strong similarities with the American supernatural television series \"Twin Peaks\". It featured the \"young and very cynical\" FBI Special Agent David Young Henning as its protagonist. \"Rainy Woods\" was cancelled soon after its debut, as, according to Suehiro, \"with the differences in memory allocation, lighting, and various other hardware differences between the platforms, there were a lot of large technological difficulties that prevented us from really getting started.\"\n\nIn 2008, Access Games began work on \"Deadly Premonition\", which was intended to be a reboot of \"Rainy Woods\", although the project faced cancellation four times. The budget for the overall project, according to Suehiro, was \"[n]ot very much.\" Suehiro created a new protagonist, Francis York Morgan, with help from his friends in the United States, and he and Kenji Gota, an independent film director, created York's dialogue with his split personality, Zach. As Gota and Suehiro are good friends and often have conversations about film, Suehiro tried to bring that atmosphere to the dialogue. Additionally, they wrote the main plotline, while Suehiro wrote eighty percent of the sidequests and all of York's conversations with the nonplayer characters. The character Zach was intended to involve the player more in the game; according to Suehiro, \"Agent York arrives in Greenvale to solve a murder case. But, the player lives this scene from his living room in front of the TV. To fill this gap, I needed something to create the illusion, without turning the character into an avatar, that the user was the main character.\"\n\nA central focus of the gameplay is freedom for the player, as Suehiro had wanted to create a game that the player could progress at his or her own speed. He had planned to incorporate two more mini-games involving chess and perfume, and had considered having the player character's weight and hair length fluctuate. Additionally, the combat sections of \"Deadly Premonition\" were added last in development, after a publisher worried that the game would not sell well in the West without it. Aspects of the game were initially more violent as well, as a way to express the fear of death; for example, the second victim was intended to be disembowelled while still living. However, the scenes were later toned down, as Suehiro felt that they were \"too extreme\".\n\nSuehiro's guiding concepts for the game's setting focused on \"'real time,' 'real scale,' and 'real life.'\" The developers traveled to the United States and noted the width measurements of the various billboards, railroad crossings, and roads to create a sense of realism for the town; the angles of the sun and weather patterns were also calculated. To add to that sense of realism, every street in Greenvale is named, and an hourly wage was decided on for a local diner. Additionally, the daily schedules of the non-player characters were created from their detailed background profiles.\n\nAreas of difficulties in the game's development were memory allocation, various lighting and shadow aspects, and their use of the physics engine PhysX. According to Wataru Nishide, the lead level artist, and J's Kataoka, the lead programmer, \"\"Deadly Premonition\" was our first stab at next-generation development, so we began the project astounded by the vast amount of RAM available--much more than any previous consumer hardware had offered. Astonishment gave rise to overconfidence, and eventually to the worst-case scenario: our data management became sloppy.\" The team found a balance between the practicalities of the available memory with the desired aesthetic of the outdoor sections of the game, which initially contained too many objects. The developers also had difficulties with balancing the game's lighting, desired aesthetics of the game's shadows and the processing rate. Furthermore, their use of PhysX proved to have mixed results; the developers enjoyed the \"dynamic expression\" that it gave the game's world, but had problems with the inability to \"cheat\" the \"brutally honest\" simulation and the resulting toll on the frame rate and processing. Initially, the team \"had everything that could possibly be displayed with a physics engine running through PhysX--hair, clothing, even fishing rods\", which they had to cut back to preserve the frame rate.\nTo help the composers understand the aesthetic of \"Deadly Premonition\", the developers hummed ideas for songs, let them see concept designs, and played music that matched a certain feeling that they wished to convey. \"Life is Beautiful\", which uses whistling to evoke a calm walk in the countryside, was easily composed, along with \"York and Zach\", which appears during York's monologues. \"Miss Stilletto Heels\", the second theme of the game, and \"Red Tree\", a song meant to symbolize madness, proved more difficult to create, particularly its improvisation section. The sound effects were outsourced to another company, as Access Games lacked a department to deal with the sound. More than six thousand lines of dialogue were recorded over two weeks at WebTone Studio in San Jose, California, three thousand of which were lines for York's voice actor, Jeff Kramer.\n\n\"Deadly Premonition\" was published for the Xbox 360 by Ignition Entertainment in North America, priced within the budget range, on February 23, 2010; by Marvelous Entertainment in Japan on March 11, 2010; and by Rising Star Games in Europe on October 29, 2010. In Japan, the game was also simultaneously released for the PlayStation 3. Additionally, Rising Star decided to forgo an Australian release, as a result of what it cited as \"classification concerns\".\n\nThe director's cut of \"Deadly Premonition\" was developed by ToyBox Inc. In 2013, Rising Star published it in for the PlayStation 3 in Europe and North America on April 30, and in Australia on May 16. The same year, Rising Star published it for Microsoft Windows on October 29, and its non-configurable resolution for the PC edition was fixed by a fan-made patch. On March 13, 2015, \"Deadly Premonition: Red Seeds Profile: Complete Edition\", a Japanese version of the director's cut, was released for the PlayStation 3. In 2015, NIS America announced a limited collector's edition for the PlayStation 3 on November 24; it includes a hardcover artbook, soundtrack CD, a 54-card deck inspired by the game, and a voucher for the downloadable content.\n\nThe director's cut has updated controls, stereoscopic 3D, updated HD visuals, PlayStation Move support, downloadable content including various pre-order bonuses, and additional scenarios written by Suehiro. It adds a frame story of an elderly Zach narrating the plot of \"Deadly Premonition\" to his granddaughter, Michelle Louise Morgan. The extended ending shows the elderly Zach entering the alternate reality, where he is warmly greeted by the inhabitants. York reassures him that he was there every step of the way and tells him about a new case involving an outbreak of illness in New Orleans. After asking his opinion on the case, York tells him \"it's time to wake up\", and Louise can be heard off-screen informing her mother that he has disappeared and wondering where he could have gone to.\n\nAn interactive guide, \"Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut: The Official Visual Companion\" was released by Rising Star Games exclusively for iPad in October 2013. It includes three interactive maps, concept sketches, the soundtrack, Suehiro's notebook from the development of the game, and other interactive elements, such as puzzles.\n\nIn North America, \"Deadly Premonition\" led sales of Xbox 360 games on Amazon.com for the week of April 9, 2010, temporarily overtaking higher-profile releases such as \"\", \"\", \"Mass Effect 2\", and \"Left 4 Dead 2\". 50,000 copies of \"Deadly Premonition\" were sold in North America during the first three months after its debut. According to an interview with Suehiro in February 2013, the original release of the game had not been commercially successful. The \"Director's Cut\" version on PC later sold over 258,000 units through Steam, as of January 2017.\n\nThe original version of \"Deadly Premonition\" for Xbox 360 received a weighted average score of 68/100 from aggregator Metacritic, indicating \"mixed or average\" reception. It is a critically polarizing game, with scores ranging from as low as 2 out of 10 from IGN US (later 7.5 out of 10 from IGN UK) to as high as 10 out of 10 from Destructoid. In the 2012 \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition\", \"Deadly Premonition\" holds the record as the \"Most Critically Polarizing Survival Horror Game\".\n\nThe plot was positively received as \"quirky\" and \"bizarre and entertaining\". A reviewer for \"Edge\" wrote: \"The beauty of Deadly Premonition is that it's a straightforward whodunnit viewed through the cracked prism of an unreliable narrator, conjuring an atmosphere of suspicion and confusion throughout.\" According to \"Destructoid\"s Jim Sterling, after the prologue, \"Deadly Premonition\" \"becomes a ludicrous pantomime of pop culture references, shamelessly contrived humor, and the kind of dialog that leaves you both scratching your head and laughing your face off.\" The characters were positively received by reviewers as memorable, endearing, \"fascinating\", and \"charming\". Tom Hoggins of \"The Telegraph\" remarked that the characters served as \"cartoon interpretations of small-town Americana\" with distinct personalities. According to IGN UK, the interaction with characters and uncovering the details of their fictional lives helped \"to fashion a genuine, albeit silly, emotional core - and its payoff resonates long after the credits have rolled as a result.\" Matt Keil of G4TV described York as \"an oddly enMdearing character considering his arrogant behavior early on\", with his love of films, video games, and music being a highlight. Eurogamer summed him up as \"a grade-A fruit-loop with a side of narcissism, and one of the most interesting gaming protagonists for years.\" Reviewers also saw similarities in \"Deadly Premonition\"s characters with those of \"Twin Peaks\".\n\nThe gameplay received a range of critical reaction, from competently done for a budget title to horribly executed. The gameplay of \"Deadly Premonition\" drew comparisons to that of \"Shenmue\" the \"Clock Tower\" series, and its combat was compared to that of \"Resident Evil 4\". According to 1UP's Frank Cifaldi, \"Deadly Premonition\"s combination of similar gameplay to \"Shenmue\", \"The Last Express\", \"Resident Evil 4\", and the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, proved to be \"a 'jack of all trades, master of none' scenario.\" Erik Brudvig of IGN US wrote: \"The \"Twin Peaks\" meets \"Resident Evil\" with a dash of \"Grand Theft Auto\" formula sounds pretty great, but it was well beyond the capabilities of this development team.\" The controls were criticized as detracting from the game's appeal. The combat sections received mixed reactions. IGN UK's Matt Wales wrote that while the combat was \"simplistic\", the atmosphere and profiling worked nicely. According to Eurogamer's Chris Shilling, the sudden appearances of the Raincoat Killer made the sections frightening and the profiling made for some unsettling yet \"relatively restrained\" moments of horror, despite the \"over-long and frequently clumsy\" combat sequences. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described the supernatural enemies as not particularly aggressive and boss battles as taking too long.\n\nFurther criticism was directed at the game's music and visual quality. The graphics were frequently remarked upon as \"terrible\" and low quality. IGN's Erik Brudvig wrote that \"[t]he graphics make this title look like a bad PS2 game.\" PALGN's Bev Chen, in contrast, felt that the quality of the graphics \"heap another helping of bizarre charm on the game.\" Similarly, the game's soundtrack received criticism as sometimes thematically inappropriate, with serious scenes often containing a light-hearted jazz track; conversely, some critics found the soundtrack memorable and enjoyable, though repetitive in its selection. \n\nNevertheless, the game has received a significant cult following. This cult success was attributed to how the game's \"wildly mixed critical reception and headline-making strangeness got people talking\" by Will Herring of \"GamePro\". Citing the game as an example of \"video games as art\", David Jenkins of the \"Metro\" praised it for its \"emotional range, from traditional survival horror scares to farcical comedy\". G4TV named it one of the \"Top 10 Games of 2010... So Far\" in June 2010. The game has received over a dozen other awards from various publications, including \"Best Cult Game\" from Gamasutra, Game of the Year from Game Critics, \"Most Surprisingly Good Game\" from GameSpot, and \"Best Worst Game\" from GamesRadar.\n\nThe director's cut for the PlayStation 3 received a weighted average of 70/100 from Metacritic, also indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" \"If you're already a fan, this Director's Cut can be considered the definitive version of the game; it alleviates the worst flaws of the original but preserves most of the others for posterity - just as you'd want it, really,\" wrote Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot remarked that, while \"a mess by any objective standard\" and not \"a dramatic overhaul,\" the game \"is absolutely divine all the same, making up its own rules for what it means to be a good game as it goes along.\" Conversely, the \"Official PlayStation Magazine\"s concluded that the retail price was too high to justify recommending the director's cut with all its flaws. Critics praised the new controls as an improvement.\n\nSpeaking in an interview concerning his Xbox One-exclusive game \"\", Suehiro said that while working on the game, he was also working on the director's cut of \"Deadly Premonition\" and a sequel. In a 2015 interview, Suehiro said that he was still considering a sequel, but that he had no idea what form it would take, who he would be collaborating with or how it would be presented.\n"}
{"id": "3284186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3284186", "title": "Françoise Mouly", "text": "Françoise Mouly\n\nFrançoise Mouly (; born 24 October 1955) is a Paris-born New York-based designer, editor, and publisher. She is best known as co-founder, co-editor, and publisher of the comics and graphics magazine \"Raw\" (1980–1991), as the publisher of Raw Books and Toon Books, and since 1993 as the art editor of \"The New Yorker\". Mouly is married to cartoonist Art Spiegelman, and is the mother of writer Nadja Spiegelman.\n\nAs editor and publisher, Mouly has had considerable influence on the rise in production values in the English-language comics world since the early 1980s. She has played a role in providing outlets to new and foreign cartoonists, and in promoting comics as a serious artform and as an educational tool. The French government decorated Mouly as a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in 2001, and as Knight of the Legion of Honour in 2011.\n\nMouly was born in 1955 in Paris, France, the second of three daughters to Josée and Roger Mouly. She grew up in the well-to-do 17th arrondissement of Paris. Her father was a plastic surgeon who in 1951 developed with Charles Dufourmentel the Dufourmentel-Mouly method of breast reduction. The French government made him a Knight of the Legion of Honour.\n\nFrom a young age Mouly had a love of reading, including novels, illustrated fairytale collections, comics magazines such as \"Pilote\", and comics albums such as \"Tintin\". She excelled as a student, and her parents planned to have her study medicine and follow her father into plastic surgery. She spent vacation time assisting and observing her father at work. She was troubled with the ethics of plastic surgery, though, which she said \"exploits insecurity to such a high degree\".\n\nAt thirteen, Mouly witnessed the May 1968 events in France. The events led to Mouly's mother and sisters fleeing Paris. Her father stayed to be available to his patients, and Mouly stayed as his assistant. She developed sympathies with the anarchists, and read the weekly radical \"Hara-Kiri Hebdo\". She brought her radical leftist politics with her when her parents sent her in 1970 to the Lycée Jeanne D'Arc in central France, where she has said she was expelled \"twenty-four or twenty-five times because was trying to drag everyone to demonstrations\".\n\nMouly's father was disappointed when, upon Mouly's return to Paris, she chose to forgo medicine to study architecture at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. She lived with a boyfriend in the Latin Quarter and traveled widely in Europe, took a two-and-a-half-month van trip with friends in 1972 that reached Afghanistan, and made a solo trip to Algeria in 1974 to study the vernacular architecture, during which she was robbed of her passport and money.\n\nMouly grew disenchanted with the lack of creative freedom a career in architecture would present her. Her family life had grown stressful, and her parents divorced in 1974. The same year, she broke off her studies and cleaned in a hotel to save money towards traveling to New York.\n\nWith no concrete plans, Mouly arrived in New York September 2, 1974, with $200 in the midst of a severe economic downturn. She familiarized herself into the New York avant-garde art and film worlds, and had a part in Richard Foreman's 1975 play \"Pandering to the Masses\". She settled into a loft in SoHo in 1975, and did odd jobs including selling cigarettes and magazines in Grand Central Station and assembling models for a Japanese architectural company, while struggling to improve her English.\n\nWhile looking for comics from which to practice reading English, she came across \"Arcade\", an magazine from San Francisco co-published by New Yorker Art Spiegelman. Avant-garde filmmaker friend Ken Jacobs introduced Mouly and Spiegelman, when Spiegelman was visiting, but they did not immediately develop a mutual interest. Spiegelman moved permanently back to New York later in the year. Occasionally the two ran across each other. After reading Spiegelman's 1973 strip \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\", about his mother's suicide, Mouly felt the urge to contact him. An eight-hour phone call led to a deepening of their relationship. Spiegelman followed her to France when she had to return to fulfill obligations in her architecture course. After returning to the United States, when Mouly ran into visa problems in 1977, the couple solved them by getting married—first at City Hall, and then again after Mouly converted to Judaism to please Spiegelman's father. Beginning in 1978 Mouly and Spiegelman made yearly trips to Europe to explore the comics scene, and brought back European comics to show to their circle of friends.\n\nMouly became immersed in Spiegelman's personal theories of comics, and helped him prepare the lecture \"Language of the Comics\" delivered at the Collective for Living Cinema. She assisted in the putting together the lavish collection of Spiegelman's experimental strips \"Breakdowns\". The printer botched the printing of the book—30% of the print run was unusable. The remaining copies had poor distribution and sales. The experience motivated Mouly to gain control over the printing process, and to find a way to get such marginal material to sympathetic readers. She took courses in offset printing in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and bought an Addressograph-Multigraph Multilith printing press for her loft.\n\nIn 1978, she founded Raw Books and Graphics, a name settled on in part because of its small-operation feel, and part because it was reminiscent of \"Mad\" magazine. Mouly worked from an aesthetic inspired in part by the Russian Constructivists, who brought a design sense to everyday objects. Raw Books began by publishing postcards and prints by artists such as underground cartoonist Bill Griffith and Dutch cartoonist Joost Swarte. More ambitious projects included art objects such as the Zippy-Scope, a cardboard device with to watch a comic strip rolled up on a film spool, featuring Griffth's character Zippy the Pinhead. Some projects were more commercial, such as the annual \"Streets of SoHo Map and Guide\", whose advertising revenue financed much of Raw Books.\n\nHaving in this way honed her publishing skills, Mouly's ambition turned to magazine publication. Spiegelman was at first reluctant, jaded from his experience at \"Arcade\", but agreed on New Year's Eve 1979 to co-edit. The magazine was to provide an outlet for the kinds of comics that had difficulty finding a publisher in the US, in particular younger cartoonists who fit neither the superhero nor the underground mold, and European cartoonists who did not fit the sex-and-sci-fi appetites of \"Heavy Metal\" fans.\n\nIn the midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in the American comics industry, the lavishly-printed, first issue of \"Raw\" appeared in July 1980. Its production values resulted in a $3.50 cover price, several times the going prices for comics, either mainstream or underground. Among the comics it contained was the only strip Mouly herself was to produce, \"Industry News and Review No. 6\", an autobiographical strip in which she contemplates her late-1970s anxieties and thoughts of suicide. Other strips in the eclectic anthology included an example of the early 20th-century newspaper strip \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" by Winsor McCay, and an excerpt from \"Manhattan\" by contemporary French cartoonist Jacques Tardi. To comics academic Jeet Heer, \"Raw\" was \"a singular mixture of visual diversity and thematic unity\". Each issue contained a broad variety of styles linked by a common theme, be it urban despair, suicide, or a vision of America through foreign eyes. The best-known work to run in \"Raw\" was a serialization of Spiegelman's graphic novel \"Maus\", which ran as an insert for the duration of the magazine from the December 1980 second issue.\n\nMouly's approach was hands-on, and she gave great attention to every step of the printing process. The physicality of \"Raw\" was evident in each issue: tipped-in plates, bubblegum cards, and torn covers were part of the aesthetic of the magazine, accomplished by hand by Mouly, Spiegelman, and friends at gatherings after the printing of a new issue. Mouly was also hands-on when dealing with contributors, suggesting ideas and changes—an approach anathema to the editor-adverse underground spirit, but artists welcomed her input as in the end she did not interfere with their autonomy.\n\n\"Raw\" had a strong critical reception, and also sold surprisingly well. It was not without its critics, who charged it with being highbrow and elitist, or claimed it to be a one-man Spiegelman show. Pioneer underground cartoonist Robert Crumb responded in 1981 with the magazine \"Weirdo\", intended to remain free of editorial intrusion and stay true to comics' lowbrow roots.\n\nRaw Books published ten \"One Shot\" books throughout the 1980s by cartoonists such as Gary Panter, Sue Coe, and Jerry Moriarty. Mouly brought a similar production sensibility to these books to what she brought to \"Raw\": the cover to Panter's \"Jimbo\" was corrugated cardboard pasted with stickers of the book's main character. By the end of the decade, Pantheon Books had begun co-publishing Raw Books' output, and Penguin Books had picked up publishing of \"Raw\" itself. The three issues of the second volume of \"Raw\" came in a smaller, longer format with a changed emphasis on narrative rather than graphics.\n\nMouly divided her time between publishing and parenthood following the birth of daughter Nadja in 1987. Researching books for Sue Coe motivated her to take up science courses at Hunter College, perhaps toward a neuroscience degree. She abandoned this plan in 1991 when she gave birth to son Dashiell. In 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of \"Raw\", which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor was it something they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when \"Raw\" first saw the light of day.\n\nTina Brown became the editor of \"The New Yorker\" magazine in 1992, and was intent on changing it from the stolid, conservative image left it by William Shawn's long editorship. Her cover choices provoked controversy—in particular, one by Spiegelman for the 1993 Valentine's Day issue of a Hasidic man kissing an African-American woman. Writer Lawrence Weschler recommended Brown consider Mouly for the art editor position; Mouly and Brown met the following March. Mouly had reservations about the magazine's reputation for staidness and Brown's politics, but was taken with Brown on a personal level, whom she described as \"charismatic, quick-witted, full of energy\". Mouly proposed the magazine return to its roots by having artists as featured contributors, an increase in the visuals in the magazine, such as photographs and more illustrations, and covers in the topical style they had had under the magazine's founder Harold Ross. Brown accepted. Mouly brought a large number of cartoonists and artists to the periodical's interiors, including \"Raw\" contributors such as Coe, Crumb, Lorenzo Mattotti, and Chris Ware. The magazine's circulation doubled during Mouly's time there. In 2012 Mouly and daughter Nadja edited a collection of rejected \"New Yorker\" covers called \"Blown Covers\", made up of cover sketches and covers that were deemed too risqué for the magazine.\n\nFrom their SoHo loft ten blocks away, on September 11, 2001, Mouly and Spiegelman witnessed the first plane of the terrorist attacks crash into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Four blocks from the towers, daughter Nadja attended Stuyvesant High School. After collecting her, and son Dashiell from the United Nations International School further away, they returned home to telephone messages urging Mouly to get to the \"New Yorker\" offices to get to work on a 9-11-themed cover. Mouly put together a cover in two black inks of different density—a black cover overlaid with a black silhouette of the two towers. Mouly gave credit for the cover to Spiegelman, who had suggested the silhouette to Mouly's idea of an all-black cover.\n\nAfter becoming parents, Mouly and Spiegelman realized how difficult it was at the end of the 20th century to find comics in English appropriate for children. In 2000 Mouly responded with the Raw Junior imprint, beginning with the anthology series \"Little Lit\", with a roster of cartoonists from \"Raw\", as well as children's book artists and writers such as Maurice Sendak, Lemony Snicket, and Barbara McClintock. Mouly researched the role comics could play in promoting literacy in young children, and encouraged publishers to publish comics for children. Disappointed by publishers' lack of response, from 2008 she self-published a line of easy readers called Toon Books, by artists such as Spiegelman, Renée French, and Rutu Modan, and promotes the books to teachers and librarians for their educational value. The imprint provides support materials for teachers tied into the Common Core State Standards Initiative. In 2014 Toon Books launched an imprint called Toon Graphics aimed at readers eight and up.\n\nMouly has had a deep impact on the publishing practices of the comics world, though her name is not well known due to the behind-the-scenes nature of her work and the prominence of her Pulitzer Prize-winning husband. To Jeet Heer, sexism has also played a role in minimizing the acknowledgement she receives. In 2013, Drawn and Quarterly associate publisher Peggy Burns called Mouly \"one of the most influential people in comics for 30 years\". In 2011, the French government recognized Mouly in 2011 as a Knight of the Legion of Honour, as her father had been, and the Society of Illustrators bestowed on her the Richard Gangel Art Director Award. At the ninth Carle Honors Awards in 2014 the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art granted Mouly the Bridge award for promoting children's literature. Comics critic and historian Jeet Heer published a biographer of Mouly in 2013 titled \"In Love with Art: Françoise Mouly's Adventures in Comics with Art Spiegelman\". Mouly's daughter Nadja interviewed her and her Mouly's mother Josée for the memoir \"I'm Supposed to Protect You from All This\". In 2015, Mouly was the recipient of Smithsonian Magazine's American Ingenuity Award for Education.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "739908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=739908", "title": "Gandhari (character)", "text": "Gandhari (character)\n\nGandhari () is a prominent character in the Hindu epic the \"Mahabharata\". She was a princess of Gandhara and the wife of Dhritrashtra, the blind king of Hastinapura, and the mother of a hundred sons, the Kauravas.\n\nAs a pativratha (devoted wife) without parallel, Gandhari is regarded as an epitome of virtue, and is among the most respected moral forces in the epic. She was not only married to a blind man, but at the time of her wedding, she resolved to spend the remainder of her life as a blind woman herself, in order to share the debility and pain of her husband. For the rest of her life, she kept a cloth tied to her eyes and thus deprived herself of the power of sight. At certain critical junctures, she gave advice to her husband which was impeccable from a moral standpoint; she never wavered in her adherence to dharma (righteousness), even to a very bitter end. She was fated to witness the death of all her hundred sons within the space of 18 days, during the Great War between them and their cousins; she also curses the lord Krishna when she was full of sorrow on the death of her 100 children that his vansh (Clan) would also be destroyed in the same manner as that of her. She then retired with her husband to spend her last days in a forest hermitage.\n\nAs a maiden, Gandhari was noted for her piety and virtuous nature. Gandhari is regarded as an incarnation of Mati, the goddess of wisdom. She was born on earth as the daughter of Subala, king of Gandhara and was named 'Gandhari' by her father in honour of his land. She is also referred to in various places in the epic as \"Gandhara-raja-duhita\" (daughter of the Gandhara king), \"Saubaleyi, Saubali, Subalaja, Subala-putri\" and \"Subalatmaja\" (all meaning 'daughter of Subala'). She was younger to her brother Shakuni.\n\nGandhari's marriage was arranged to Dhritarashtra, the eldest prince of the Kuru kingdom, a region in Delhi and Haryana region. The \"Mahabharata\" depicted her as a beautiful and virtuous woman and a very dedicated wife. Their marriage was arranged by Bhishma. When she found out that her would-be husband was born blind, she decided to blindfold herself in order to be like her husband. What went through the young girl's mind when she found out that she was to marry a blind man is not depicted in the epic. Popular narration said that the act of blindfolding herself was a sign of dedication and love. On the contrary, Irawati Karve and many modern scholars debated that the act of blindfolding was an act of protest against Bhishma, as he intimidated her father into giving away her hand in marriage to the blind prince of Hastinapur. \n\nSome folklore and many modern versions of the Mahabharata depict her marriage as a major reason for the story's central conflict. Her brother, Shakuni, was enraged that Hastinapur, already having humiliated Gandhar in a war of conquest where all of Shakuni's brothers were killed, would offer for his prized sister a blind man. Shakuni swore to destroy the Kuru dynasty and played an instrumental role in fueling the flames of conflict between the cousins.\n\nVeda Vyasa is impressed with Gandhari's devotion to her husband and gives her a boon to have 100 hundred sons. She gets pregnant but carries the child for an unusually long period. Later, when she hears that Kunti (queen of king Pandu, younger brother of Dhritharashtra) has given birth to the eldest of the Pandavas, she pounds on her stomach in frustration and helplessness only to result in birth to a grey mass and not her sons. Veda Vyasa divides this into 100 parts and stores them in earthen pots to incubate. First to be born among these is Duryodhana, followed by 98 brothers and one sister, Dushala.\n\nIn a popular retelling, it is said that Gandhari birthed 100 'children' - 99 sons, among who Duryodhana was the oldest and Dushala being the only girl. The 101st boy was not Gandhari's, but of a maid with who Dhritarashtra had coitus out of frustration on Gandhari as she was 'delaying' the birth of his sons. He was named Yuyutsu and grew up alongside his Kaurava brothers.\n\nDuring the birth of her first son Duryodhana, many ill omen occur, worrying Vyasa, Bhishma and Vidura. They foresee that this child might cause great destruction to their kingdom, and advise to either release him onto the waters of river Ganga or kill him. But Dhritarashtra and Gandhari reject the idea.\n\nSome folk fore narrate that Gandhari made a single exception to her blindfolded state, when she removed her blindfold to see her eldest son Duryodhana. She poured all her power into her son's body in one glance, rendering Duryodhana's entire body, except his loins, as strong as thunderbolt. Krishna foiled Gandhari's plan by asking Duryodhana to cover up his privates before meeting his mother. On their decisive encounter on the eighteenth day of the Kurukshetra battle, Bhima smashed Duryodhana's thighs, a move both literally and figuratively below the belt. This story is not mentioned in the original version of the \"Mahabharata\" which was written by Veda Vyasa. As per Vyasa's \"Mahabharata\", Duryodhana, while fighting against Bhima, displayed his superior mace skills, due to which Bhima could not defeat him and had to break rules to kill him.\n\nAll of Gandhari's sons were killed in the war against their cousins, the Pandavas, at Kurukshetra, specifically at the hands of Bhima. Upon hearing the news, it is said that through a small gap in the blindfold, her gaze fell on Yudhishthira's toe. His clean toe was charred black due to her wrath and power. When she heard the news of the death of all the sons of Pandavas (Upapandavas), she embraced the Pandavas and consoled them for their losses. Later her wrath turned to Krishna for allowing all this destruction to happen. She cursed that he, his city and all his subjects would be destroyed. Krishna accept the curse. Her curse took its course 36 years after the great war when Yadu dynasty perished after a fight broke out between Yadavas at a festival. Lord Krishna ascended to his heavenly abode after living for 126 years. The golden city of Dwarka drowned exactly seven days after his disappearance. Gandhari along with her husband Dhritarashtra, brother-in-law Vidura and sister-in-law Kunti, left Hastinapur about 15 years after the war to seek penance. She is said to have died in the Himalayas in a forest fire along with Vidura and Kunti and attained moksha.\n\nThe \"Mahabharata\" attributes high moral standards to Gandhari, although her sons are portrayed as villains. She repeatedly exhorted her sons to follow dharma and make peace with the Pandavas. Gandhari fostered a big-little sister relationship with Kunti. Famously, when Duryodhana would ask for her blessing of victory during the Kurukshetra war, Gandhari would only say \"may victory find the side of righteousness\". Gandhari's major flaw was her love for her sons, especially her first born, Duryodhana, which often blinded her to his flaws.\n\nIn Hebbya village, Nanjangud, Mysore, India there is a temple called Gāndhārī temple dedicated to her.This temple honours her devotion and loyalty as she epitomized the goodness of a mother and a loving wife. The foundation stone of the temple was laid on June 19, 2008. It was expected to cost Rs 2.5 crore (INR 25 million). \nRabindranath Tagore wrote a Bengali poetic play about her, named \"Gandharir Abedon\" (Bangla: গান্ধারীর আবেদন, Translation:Supplication of Gandhari). The play portray Gandhari, her husband Dhritarashtra and their son Duryodhana as central character.\n\n"}
{"id": "2766492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2766492", "title": "Gangaji", "text": "Gangaji\n\nGangaji ( ; born Texas, 1942) is an American born spiritual teacher and author. She lives in Ashland, Oregon, with her husband, fellow spiritual teacher Eli Jaxon-Bear.\n\nGangaji was born Merle Antoinette Roberson (Toni) in Texas on June 11, 1942, and grew up in Mississippi. After graduating from the University of Mississippi she and her young family moved to San Francisco. After a divorce she sought to change her life via political activism and spiritual practice. She took buddhist Bodhisattva vows, practiced Zen and Vipassana meditation, helped in a Tibetan-style meditation center, and began a career as an acupuncturist in the San Francisco Bay area.\nUnfulfilled by her seemingly successful life, in 1989 she and Eli Jaxon-Bear moved to Hawaii.\n\nAt this time she met Andrew Cohen, a spiritual teacher and student of Sri H.W.L. Poonja, also known as Papaji. Impressed by Cohen’s \"enormous confidence\", she returned to California to sit with him for two months. In the meantime, Eli, who had become her second husband, met Papaji in India. Struck by the letters she received from Eli, Gangaji herself traveled to Lucknow, India to meet Papaji in 1990. In her autobiography \"Just Like You\" she wrote, \"The extraordinary event in this life was that I met Papaji. Until then I looked everywhere for the transcendental or the extraordinary, but after meeting Papaji I began to find the extraordinary in every moment.\" Papaji gave her the name Gangaji, and asked her to share what she had directly realized with others.\n\nGangaji currently writes and tours as a teacher. She holds that the truth of who you are is already free and at peace, which can be realized simply by ending one’s search.\n\"I invite people to just stop and be still. And in that you discover who you are, because once you discover who you are, you can stop fragmenting into pieces. I know that in any one day there are moments where there is nothing going on, but we link up what is happening from thought to thought without any space. We overlook the spaciousness that it is all happening in.\"\nGangaji uses a personal form of inquiry to aid in the realization of 'direct experience':\n\n\"I use inquiry as a way of getting the mind to turn inward to the silence. It could be the question, \"Who am I?\" Or it could be \"What am I avoiding in this moment?\" Or, \"Where is silence?\" \"What is needed in this moment, right in this very moment, what is needed for true peace?\" \"What is needed if this was my last moment on earth?\" Rather than sending the mind outward to gather information or experiences, it is really sending the mind inward to question our basic assumption of who we think we are.\"\nIn facing strong emotions such as fear and anger, or in dealing with traumas which keep people locked in personal misery and unable to experience freedom, Gangaji teaches \"direct experience,\" or meeting whatever emotion is present. For example, she says, \"Fear is about survival. When you drop under that and experience the fear without trying to change it, just letting it be, then it becomes still. When you open your heart to fear, rather than trying to fight it or deny it or even overcome it, then you find it is just energy.\" \n\nSince 1993 Gangaji’s work has been supported by The Gangaji Foundation, a non-profit headquartered in Ashland, Oregon. Its mission statement states: \"The Gangaji Foundation serves the truth of universal consciousness, and the potential for the individual and collective recognition of peace inherent in the core of all being. It is the purpose of the Gangaji Foundation to forthrightly and respectfully present the teaching and transmission of Gangaji.\n\nThe Gangaji Foundation produces events, publishes books and videos, hosts a website and runs several outreach programs including a prison program.\n\nIn October 2005, Gangaji's husband, Eli Jaxon-Bear, admitted to Gangaji that he had a three-year affair with an adult female student and executive director of his organization, the Leela Foundation. After a brief separation, Gangaji and her husband reconciled their marriage in December 2005. At the student’s request, the information about the affair was not made public at that time. In January 2006, Gangaji and her husband merged their foundations, continuing to teach together and separately.\n\nIn October 2006, Jaxon-Bear disclosed his extramarital relationship to the Gangaji Foundation's board of directors and staff. Barbara Denempont, executive director of the Gangaji Foundation, explained the situation in an open letter approved by the board. \"What was initially seen as a matter between two adults is now recognized to be a betrayal of the teacher/student relationship and an abuse of power.\" She added: \n\"The repercussions of this betrayal are reverberating in ways that were never imagined, but are very painful. The deepest truths do not excuse or justify our failures and betrayals as human beings. Gratefully though, without minimizing or spiritualizing the damage done, love remains and sustains all. It is only in love that we can truly meet the pain that comes with being human. Ever more so, we can commit ourselves to the compassion that love provides and to tell the truth more clearly and honestly to others and ourselves.\"\nFor a time Jaxon-Bear stopped teaching. Both he and the Gangaji Foundation held open meetings with the stated purpose to heal whatever wounds may have been experienced in their spiritual community. In addition Gangaji, and eventually she and her husband, held retreats on the subjects of disillusionment, betrayal, and relationship.\n\nIn 2007 Jaxon-Bear was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a severe form of blood cancer. After undergoing extensive treatment he made a partial recovery. In January 2008, he reestablished the Leela Foundation and resumed teaching on his own and with Gangaji.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are spread over the states of Madhya Pradesh, eastern Maharashtra (Vidarbha), Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa.\n\nThe Gond are also known as the \"Raj Gond\". The term was widely used in 1950s, but has now become almost obsolete, probably because of the political eclipse of the Gond Rajas. The Gondi language is closely related to the Telugu, belonging to the Dravidian family of languages. The 2011 Census of India recorded about 2.98 million Gondi speakers.\n\nAccording to the 1971 census, their population was 5.01 million. By the 1991 census, this had increased to 9.3 million and by the 2001 census the figure was nearly 11 million. For the past few decades they have been witnesses to the Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in the central part of India. Gondi people, at the behest of the Chhattisgarh government, formed the Salwa Judum, an armed militant group to fight the Naxalite insurgency.\n\nScholars believe that Gonds ruled in Gondwana, now in eastern Madhya Pradesh and western Odisha, between the 13th and 19th centuries AD. Muslim writers described a rise of Gond state after the 14th century.\n\nGonds ruled in four kingdoms (Garha-Mandla, Deogarh, Chanda, and Kherla) in central India between the 16th and 18th centuries. They built number of forts, palaces, temples, tanks and lakes during the rule of the Gonds dynasty. The Gondwana kingdom survived until the late 16th century. They also gained control over the Malwa after the decline of the Mughals followed by the Marathas in 1690. The Maratha power swept into Gondland in the 1740s. The Marathas overthrew the Gond Rajas (princes) and seized most of their territory, while Some Gond zamindaris (estates) survived until recently.\n\nThe ancient Gonds were familiar with many astronomical concepts, having their own local terms for the Sun, Moon, constellations and Milky Way, with much of their knowledge forming the basis for their time-keeping and calendrical activities. Not only the Gonds, but also the Banjaras and Kolams are known to have possessed astronomical knowledge.\n\nTheir typical reaction to death has been described as one of anger because they believe it is caused by magical demons. Their religion was based on worship of clan and village deities, as well as ancestor worship and totems.\n\nMany Gonds worship Ravana, whom they consider to be the tenth \"dharmaguru\" of their people and the ancestor-king of one of their four lineages. They also worship Kupar Lingo as their supreme deity and their ancestor before Ravana. On Dussehra, the Gondi inhabitants of Paraswadi carry an image of Ravana riding an elephant in a procession to worship him, and protest the burning of Ravana's effigies.

{"id": "1046630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1046630", "title": "Great King", "text": "Great King\n\nGreat King and the equivalent in many languages is a semantic title for historical titles of monarchs, suggesting an elevated status among the host of Kings and Princes. This title is most usually associated with the shahanshah (Shah of shahs, i.e. king of kings, indeed translated in Greek \"Basileus tōn basileōn\", later adopted by the Byzantine emperors) of Persia under the Achaemenid dynasty whose vast empire in Asia lasted for 200 years up to the year 330 BC, and later adopted by successors of the Achaemenid empire whose monarchial names were also succeeded by \"the Great\". In comparison, High King was used by ancient rulers in Britain, Scotland and Ireland, as well as Greece.\n\nIn the 2nd Millennium BCE Near East, there was a tradition of reciprocally using such addresses between powers as a way of diplomatically recognizing each other as an equal. Only the kings of countries who were not subject to any other king and powerful enough to draw the respect from their adversaries were allowed to use the title of Great King. Those were the kings of Egypt, Yamhad, Hatti, Babylonia, Mitanni (until its demise in the 14th century), Assyria (only after the demise of Mitanni), and for a brief time Myceneans. Great Kings referred to each other as brothers and often established close relationships by means of marriages and frequent gift exchange. Letters exchanged between these rulers, several of which has been recovered especially in Amarna and Hittite archives, provide details of this diplomacy.\n\nThe case of Maharaja (\"Great Raja\", great King and Prince, in Sanskrit and Hindi) on the Indian subcontinent, originally reserved for the regional hegemon such as the Gupta, is a striking example how such a lofty style of this or an alternative model can get caught in a cycle of devalution by \"title inflation\" as ever more, mostly less powerful, rulers adopt the style. This is often followed by the emergence of one or more new, more exclusive and prestigious styles, as in this case \"Maharajadhiraja\" (\"Great King of Kings\"). The Turkic-Mongol title Khan also came to be 'augmented' to tiles like Chagan or Hakan, meaning 'Khan of khans', i.e. equivalent to king of kings.\n\nThe aforementioned Indian style \"Maharajadhiraja\" is also an example of an alternative semantic title for similar 'higher' royal styles such as King of Kings. Alternatively, a more idiomatic style may develop into an equally prestigious tradition of titles, because of the shining example of the original – thus various styles of Emperors trace back to the Roman \"Imperator\" (strictly speaking a republican military honorific), the family surname Caesar (turned into an imperial title since Diocletian's Tetrarchy).\n\nAs the conventional use of \"King\" and its equivalents to render various other monarchical styles illustrates, there are many roughly equivalent styles, each of which may spawn a \"Great \"X\"\" variant, either unique or becoming a rank in a corresponding tradition; in this context \"Grand\" is equivalent to \"Great\" and sometimes interchangeable if convention does not firmly prescribe one of the two. Examples include Grand duke and German \"Grosswojwod\".\n\n\n"}

Schwarz was Jewish and was forced to leave Austria in 1938 when the Nazis took over and he went into exile in Britain.\n\nSchwarz was born in Vienna to Jewish parents. His mother died when he was 12 years old, two years before he entered art school in Vienna. With the Anschluss, in 1938, Schwarz was forced to abandon his studies. Shortly, afterwards he left Austria aboard a Kindertransport and made his way to England. His father, a bank clerk, failed to escape Vienna and later died in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nArriving in England, the young Schwarz worked as a labourer for a year at Bournville before he was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien. When he was released from internment in 1941, Schwarz enrolled at the Birmingham College of Art and studied there until 1943. Schwarz then spent two years working in a commercial art studio before, when the Second World War ended, establishing himself as a freelance commercial illustrator. He completed several murals for public buildings and also some work for the 1951 Festival of Britain. For almost twenty years Schwarz worked for several high-profile clients, including Shell, the Post Office and BOAC, until in 1964 he decided to concentrate full-time on his painting and sculpture. In 1966 Schwarz and his family moved to Somerset, from Hampstead, where he expanded the range of his work, painting more landscapes, undertaking more sculptures and using watercolours for the first time.\nFrom 1970 until his death, Schwarz lived and worked in Greenwich and produced some of his finest work at his studio there. In 1984 the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Schwarz to produce a group portrait of several trade union leaders. The resulting picture of Joe Gormley, Sid Weighell and Tom Jackson in Trafalgar Square with pigeons flying around them is possibly his best known work. Other notable portraits by Schwarz from this period include depictions of Janet Suzman, Nikolaus Pevsner and the poet Ivor Cutler. From Greenwich, Schwarz painted several urban landscapes often featuring the streets in his immediate vicinity but also Canary Wharf and the Isle of Dogs. Schwarz wrote several books on artistic techniques and, with his wife Lena, a book on the Halesowen district of the West Midlands.\n\nIn 1981, Schwarz won the Hunting Art Prize for a watercolour painting. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he held a number of well-received exhibitions at commercial galleries. These included a series at the Thackeray Gallery and individual shows at the Compton Gallery in 1983, the Ben Uri Gallery in 1985, the Woodlands Art Gallery in 1991, the Sternberg Centre in 1992 and the New Academy Gallery in both 1995 and 2001. The auction house Bonhams sold the contents of his studio in 2004.\n\n\nSchwarz was a member or affiliated with the following organisations:\n"}
{"id": "684758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=684758", "title": "Holy of Holies", "text": "Holy of Holies\n\nThe Holy of Holies (Tiberian Hebrew: \"Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm\") is a term in the Hebrew Bible which refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle where God's presence appeared. The Ark according to Hebrew Scripture contained the Ten Commandments, which were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. It is thought to be located under the Dome of the Rock. No archaeological evidence confirms the location.\n\nThe area was defined by four pillars which held up the veil of the covering under which the Ark of the Covenant was held above the floor. King Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept during the First Temple.\n\nThe construction \"Holy of Holies\" is a literal translation of a Hebrew idiom which is intended to express a superlative. Examples of similar constructions are \"servant of servants\" (Gen 9:25), \"Sabbath of sabbaths\" (Ex 31:15), \"God of gods\" (Deut 10:17), \"Vanity of vanities\" (Eccl 1:2), \"Song of songs\" (Song of Songs 1:1), \"king of kings\" (Ezra 7:12), etc.\n\nIn the Authorized King James Version, \"Holy of Holies\" is always translated as \"Most Holy Place\". This is in keeping with the intention of the Hebrew idiom to express the utmost degree of holiness. The King James Version of the Bible has been in existence for over four hundred years. For most of that time, it was a primary reference in much of the English speaking world for information about Judaism. Thus, the name \"Most Holy Place\" was used to refer to the \"Holy of Holies\" in many English documents.\n\nA related term is the \"debir\" () transliterated in the Septuagint (the Greek translation as \"dabir\" (), which either means the back (i.e. western) part of the Sanctuary, or derives from the verb stem D-V-R, \"to speak\", justifying the translation in the Latin Vulgate as \"oraculum\", from which the traditional English translation \"oracle\" (KJV, 1611) derives.\n\nThe Holy of Holies was covered by a veil, and no one was allowed to enter except the High Priest, and even he could only enter once a year on Yom Kippur (the day of atonement), to offer the blood of sacrifice and incense before the mercy seat. The Bible reports that in the wilderness, on the day that the tabernacle was first raised up, the cloud of the Lord covered the tabernacle (). There are other times that this was recorded, and instructions were given that the Lord would appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat (\"kapporet\"), and at that time the priests should not enter into the tabernacle (Leviticus 16:2). According to the Hebrew Bible, the Holy of Holies contained the Ark of the Covenant with representation of Cherubim. Upon completion of the dedication of the Tabernacle, the Voice of God spoke to Moses \"from between the Cherubim\" ().\n\nThe area could be entered only by the High Priest on Yom Kippur after sanctifying himself.\n\nThe Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in Judaism, is the inner sanctuary within the Tabernacle and Temple in Jerusalem when Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple were standing. The Holy of Holies was located in the westernmost end of the Temple building, being a perfect cube: 20 cubits by 20 cubits by 20 cubits. The inside was in total darkness and contained the Ark of the Covenant, gilded inside and out, in which was placed the Tablets of the Covenant. According to Hebrews 9:4 in the New Testament, Aaron's rod and a pot of manna were also in the ark. The Ark was covered with a lid made of pure gold, known as the \"mercy seat\" () which was covered by the beaten gold cherubim wings. Creating the space for the Divine Presence.\n\nWhen the Temple was rebuilt after the Babylonian captivity, the Ark was no longer present in the Holy of Holies; instead, a portion of the floor was raised slightly to indicate the place where it had stood. Josephus records that Pompey profaned the Temple by insisting on entering the Holy of Holies in 63 BCE.\n\nThe Holy of Holies was entered once a year by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement, to sprinkle the blood of sacrificial animals (a bull offered as atonement for the Priest and his household, and a goat offered as atonement for the people) and offer incense upon the Ark of the Covenant and the mercy seat which sat on top of the ark in the First Temple (the Second Temple had no ark and the blood was sprinkled where the Ark would have been and the incense was left on the Foundation Stone). The animal was sacrificed on the Brazen Altar and the blood was carried into the most holy place. The golden censers were also found in the Most Holy Place.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, in order that God may dwell among the Israelites, God gave Moses instructions for erecting a sanctuary. The directions provide for:\n\nThe Magdala stone is thought to be a representation of the Holy of Holies carved before the destruction of the Temple in the year 70.\n\nTraditional Judaism regards the location where the inner sanctuary was originally located, on the Temple Mount in Mount Moriah, as retaining some or all of its original sanctity for use in a future Third Temple. The exact location of the Kodesh Hakodashim is a subject of dispute.\n\nTraditional Judaism regards the Holy of Holies as the place where the presence of God dwells. The Talmud gives detailed descriptions of Temple architecture and layout. According to the Babylonian Talmud Tractate Yoma, the Kodesh Hakodashim is located in the center North-South but significantly to the West from an East–West perspective, with all the major courtyards and functional areas lying to its east.\n\nThe Talmud supplies additional details, and describes the ritual performed by the High Priest. During the ritual, the High Priest would pronounce the Tetragrammaton, the only point according to traditional Judaism that it was pronounced out loud. According to Jewish tradition, the people prostrated themselves fully on the ground when it was said. According to the Talmud, the High Priest's face upon exit from the Holy of Holies was radiant.\n\nWhile under normal circumstances, access to the Holy of Holies was restricted to the High Priest and only on Yom Kippur, the Talmud suggests that repair crews were allowed inside as needed but were lowered from the upper portion of the room via enclosures so that they only saw the area they were to work on.\n\nJudaism regards the Torah ark, a place in a synagogue where the Torah scrolls are kept, as a miniature Holy of Holies.\n\nAt present it is conjectured that it is located under the Dome of the Rock which stands on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, though the exact location of the Most Holy Place is not known with absolute certainty. Most Orthodox Jews today completely avoid climbing up to Temple Mount, to prevent them from accidentally stepping on the \"Most Holy Place\" or any sanctified areas. A few Orthodox Jewish authorities, following the opinion of the medieval scholar Maimonides, permit Jews to visit parts of the Temple Mount known not to be anywhere near any of the sanctified areas. Orthodox Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount, who come especially from those groups associated with the Temple Institute and its efforts to rebuild a Temple, seek to conform to the minimal requirements for coming near the Temple, such as immersing in a mikvah (\"collection of water\"), not coming during or following menstruation or immediately following a seminal emission, not showing their back towards its presumed location, and other strictures.\n\nTo avoid religious conflict, Jewish visitors caught praying or bringing ritual objects are usually expelled from the area by police.\n\nAccording to the ancient apocryphal \"Lives of the Prophets\", after the death of Zechariah Ben Jehoiada, the priests of the Temple could no more, as before, see the apparitions of the angels of the Lord, nor could make divinations with the Ephod, nor give responses from the \"Debir\".\n\nThe Greek New Testament retains the pre-Christian Septuagint phrase \"Holy of the Holies\" \"hágion \"(sg n)\" tōn hagíōn\" () without the definite article as \"Holies of Holies\" \"hágia \"(pl n)\" hagíōn\" () in Hebrews 9:3. In the Vulgate, these are rendered as \"sanctum sanctorum\" and \"sancta sanctorum\", respectively. The Greek language was the common language upon Hellenization of much of the Middle East after the death of Alexander the Great, and the division of his empire among four generals. The Jews of the Diaspora spoke it. The Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome was a faithful translation for Christian Rome.\n\nCertain branches of Christianity, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church continue to have a tradition of a Holy of Holies which they regard as a most sacred site. The ciborium, a permanent canopy over the altar in some churches, once surrounded by curtains at points in the liturgy, symbolizes the Holy of Holies. Some Christian churches, particularly the Catholic Church, consider the Church tabernacle, or its location (often at the rear of the sanctuary), as their symbolic equivalent of the Holy of Holies, due to the storage of consecrated host in that vessel.\n\nThe Greek phrase refers to the Tabernacle or Temple. The name in Greek for the sanctuary of a church is (\"Hieron Vema\", see Bema#Christianity), in Russian it is called Святой Алтарь (\"Svyatoy Altar\" - literally: \"Holy Altar\"), and in Romanian it is called \"Sfântul Altar\".\n\nA cognate term in Ge'ez is found in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church: \"Qidduse Qiddusan\", referring to the innermost sanctuary of an Orthodox Christian church, where the tabot is kept and only clergy may enter. This is also called the \"Bete Mekdes. Every Ethiopian Orthodox Church has one, and it is covered with a Curtain. There are Three ways to enter (most of the time) and those three doors are also a way to reveal the Holy Trinity. In the middle there is always an Altar where the Church's Tabot is kept. There can be as many altars as the number of Tabots.\"\n\nThe Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Nasrani or Syrian Christians) from Kerala, South India still follow much Jewish Christian tradition. In Nasrani tradition the Holy of Holies is kept veiled for much of the time. The red veil covers the inner altar or the main altar. It is unveiled only during the central part of the main Nasrani ritual. The main ritual of the Saint Thomas Christians is the Qurbana (derived from the Syriac word \"Qurobo\" meaning \"sacrifice\").\n\nThe Latin Vulgate Bible translates \"Qṓḏeš HaqQŏḏāšîm\" as Sanctum sanctorum (Ex 26:34). Reproducing in Latin the Hebrew construction, the expression is used as a superlative of the neuter adjective \"sanctum\", to mean \"a thing most holy\". It is used by Roman Catholics to refer to holy objects beyond the Holy of Holies, and is specifically often used as an alternative name for a tabernacle, due to the object being a storage chamber for consecrated host and thus where the presence of God is most represented.\n\nThe Vulgate also refers to the Holy of Holies with the plural form \"Sancta sanctorum\" (2 Chr 5:7), arguably a synecdoche referring to the holy objects hosted there. This form is also used more broadly in Catholic tradition with reference to sanctuaries other than the Temple in Jerusalem. A notable example is for the Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum, a chapel in the complex of St John Lateran in Rome.\n\nThe Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) contains a Holy of Holies wherein the church's president—acting as the Presiding High Priest—enters to fulfill the relationship between the High Priest of Israel and God in accordance with the LDS interpretation of the Book of Exodus () and Mormon religious texts.\n\n"}

In religions, such idealizations similarly exist with for instance quite detailed accounts on what the general age range of entrants of jannah (heaven) will be.\nAccording to various hadiths that age for men is 33 and for women its 18 with the presupposition that these ages augment the best of human attributes and further stipulations that these ages do not change and remain constant since the biological process of ageing becomes obsolete. Evaluations of a more critical nature tend to focus upon the fairness of prolonged periods of education for young people whereby in some subjects they only reap the rewards of their labour when they are middle aged, and thereby spend their prior younger years through various sacrificing stages. In reflections on adventurous sex, there are at times indications of a specific age targeted due to a perception that this particular age range has the most feasible pragmatism as an audience whether for physiological or practical purposes.\n\n"}
{"id": "184504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184504", "title": "Jacob Frank", "text": "Jacob Frank\n\nJacob Joseph Frank (, , born Jakub Lejbowicz; 1726 – December 10, 1791) was an 18th-century Jewish religious leader born in Poland who claimed to be the reincarnation of the self-proclaimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and also of the biblical patriarch Jacob. The Jewish authorities in Poland excommunicated Frank and his followers due to his heretical doctrines that included deification of himself as a part of a trinity and other controversial concepts such as neo-Carpocratian \"purification through transgression\". in which he intentionally violated moral and religious norms.\n\nFrank arguably created a new religion, now referred to as Frankism, which incorporated some aspects of Christianity into Judaism. The development of Frankism was one of the consequences of the messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi, the religious mysticism that followed violent persecution and socioeconomic upheavals among the Jews of Poland and Ruthenia.\n\nThere were numerous secret societies of Sabbateans (followers of Sabbatai Zevi) in Eastern Poland (now Ukraine), particularly in Podolia and Galicia at the end of the seventeenth century.\n\nIn expectation of the great Messianic revolution, the members of these societies violated Jewish laws and custom. The mystical cult of the Sabbateans is believed to have included both asceticism and sensuality: some did penance for their sins, subjected themselves to self-inflicted pain, and \"mourned for Zion\"; others disregarded the strict rules of modesty required by Judaism, and at times were accused of being licentious. The Polish rabbis attempted to ban the \"Sabbatean heresy\" at the assembly at Lviv (Lwów) in 1722, but could not fully succeed, as it was widely popular among the nascent Jewish middle class.\n\nJacob Frank is believed to have been born as Jakub Lejbowicz to a Polish-Jewish family in Korołówka, in Podolia of Eastern Poland (now in Ukraine), in about 1726. His father was a Sabbatean, and moved to Czernowitz, in the Carpathian region of Bukovina in 1730, where the Sabbatean influence at the time was strong. While still a schoolboy Frank began to reject the Talmud, and afterward often referred to himself as \"a plain\" or \"untutored man.\"\n\nAs a traveling merchant in textile and precious stones he often visited Ottoman territories, where he earned the nickname \"Frank\", a name generally given in the East to Europeans, and lived in the centers of contemporary Sabbateanism: Salonica and Smyrna.\n\nIn the early 1750s, Frank became intimate with the leaders of the Sabbateans. Two followers of Sabbatian leader Osman Baba (d. 1720) were witnesses at his wedding in 1752. In 1755 he reappeared in Podolia, gathered a group of local adherents, and began to preach the \"revelations\" which were communicated to him by the Dönmeh in Salonica. One of these gatherings in Landskron ended in a scandal, and the rabbis' attention was drawn to the new teachings. Frank was forced to leave Podolia, while his followers were hounded and denounced to the local authorities by the rabbis (1756). At the rabbinical court held in the village of Satanów (today Sataniv in Ukraine) the Sabbateans were accused of having broken fundamental Jewish laws of morality and modesty.\n\nConsequent to these disclosures the congress of rabbis in Brody proclaimed a universal \"Cherem\" (excommunication) against all \"impenitent heretics\", and made it obligatory upon every pious Jew to seek them out and expose them. The Sabbateans informed Mikołaj Dembowski, the Catholic Bishop of Kamieniec Podolski, Poland, that they rejected the Talmud and recognized only the sacred book of Kabbalah, the Zohar, which did not contradict the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. They stated that they regarded the Messiah-Deliverer as one of the embodiments of the three divinities.\n\nThe bishop took Frank and his followers (the \"Anti-Talmudists\", or \"Zoharistic Jews\") under his protection and in 1757 arranged a religious disputation between them and the rabbis of the traditionalist community. The Anti-Talmudists presented their theses, which began the intense dispute. The bishop sided in favor of the Frankists and also ordered the burning of all copies of the Talmud in Poland. 10,000 volumes were destroyed, which was a tremendous loss for the Jewish libraries of that era.\n\nAfter the death of the bishop, the Sabbateans were subjected to severe persecution by the rabbis, although they succeeded in obtaining an edict from Augustus III of Poland guaranteeing them safety.\n\nAt this critical moment Jacob Frank came to Iwania, proclaimed himself as a direct successor to Sabbatai Zevi and Osman Baba, and assured his adherents that he had received revelations from Heaven. These revelations called for the conversion of Frank and his followers to the Christian religion, which was to be a visible transition stage to the future \"das\" or religion to be revealed by Frank. In 1759 negotiations looking toward the conversion of the Frankists to Roman Catholicism were being actively carried on with the higher representatives of the Polish Church; at the same time the Frankists tried to secure another discussion with the rabbis. The Polish primate Łubieński and the papal nuncio Nicholas Serra were suspicious of the aspirations of the Frankists, but at the insistence of the administrator of the bishopric of Lemberg, the canon Mikulski, the discussion was arranged. It was held in Lwów, and was presided over by Mikulski. Protestant missionaries also tried to detour the Frankists to Protestantism, and a handful did in fact join the Moravian church.\n\nAt the discussion in 1759, the rabbis energetically repulsed their opponents. After the discussion the Frankists were requested to demonstrate in practice their adherence to Christianity; Jacob Frank, who had then arrived in Lwów, encouraged his followers to take the decisive step. The baptism of the Frankists was celebrated with great solemnity in the churches of Lwów, with members of the Polish szlachta (nobility) acting as god-parents. The neophytes adopted the names of their godfathers and godmothers, and ultimately joined their ranks. Frank himself was baptized in Lwów (September 17, 1759) and again in Warsaw the next day, with Augustus III as his godfather. Frank's baptismal name was \"Joseph\" (\"Józef\"). In the course of one year more than 500 individuals were converted to Christianity at Lwów, and nearly a thousand in the following year. By 1790, 26,000 Jews were recorded baptised in Poland.\n\nHowever, the Frankists continued to be viewed with suspicion due to their strange doctrines. Frank was arrested in Warsaw on February 6, 1760 and delivered to the Church's tribunal on the charge of heresy. He was convicted of teaching heresy, and imprisoned in the monastery of Częstochowa.\n\nFrank's imprisonment lasted thirteen years, yet it only increased his influence with the sect by surrounding him with the aura of martyrdom. Many Frankists established themselves near Częstochowa, and kept up constant communication with their \"holy master\". Frank inspired his followers through mystical speeches and epistles, in which he stated that salvation could be gained only by first adopting the \"religion of Edom\" and later adopting a future religion which Frank called \"das\" (\"knowledge\"). After the first partition of Poland, Frank was released by the Russian general Bibikov, who had occupied Częstochowa, in August 1772. Frank lived in the Moravian town of Brno until 1786, surrounded by a retinue of adherents and pilgrims who came from Poland. His daughter Eve began to play an important role in the sect at this time. Frank kept a force of armed men at his \"court\". The future czar Paul I of Russia visited him.\n\nAccompanied by his daughter, Frank repeatedly traveled to Vienna, and succeeded in gaining the favor of the court. Maria Theresa regarded him as a disseminator of Christianity among the Jews, and it is even said that Joseph II was favorably inclined to the young Eve Frank. Ultimately Frank was deemed unmanageable and he was obliged to leave Austria. He moved with his daughter and his retinue to Offenbach, in Germany, where he assumed the title of \"Baron of Offenbach,\" and lived as a wealthy nobleman, receiving financial support from his Polish and Moravian followers, who made frequent pilgrimages to Offenbach. On the death of Frank in 1791, Eve became the \"holy mistress\" and leader of the sect. Her fortunes dwindled in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, and she died in Offenbach in 1816.\n\nSome Frankists were active during the French Revolution, such as Moses Dobruška, a son of Frank's Sabbatian cousin in Offenbach Shendl Dobruska. Many of the Frankists saw Napoleon Bonaparte as a potential Messiah. The Frankists scattered in Poland and Bohemia eventually intermarried into the gentry and middle class. Maria Szymanowska, a piano virtuoso, came from a Frankist family. Wanda Grabowska, the mother of Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, also descended from Frankists.\n\nIn 1883, a Russian magazine \"Русская старина\" (\"Russian Old Times\") issued memoirs of an influential official of the Russian Ministry of the Interior, the privy councillor and staunch anti-Semite O. A. Phzetslavsky. He promulgated the allegations that the mothers of \"three of the greatest men of Poland\" (Frédéric Chopin, Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki) were converted Jews from the Frankist sect. Similar assertions were put forth by Mieses and Balaban.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

British TV appearances included three episodes (1956–1958) of the ITV series \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", and as a panelist on the BBC's \"Juke Box Jury\".\nAsher appeared in Roger Corman's \"The Masque of the Red Death\" (1964) with Vincent Price, in \"Alfie\" opposite Michael Caine in 1966, and in Jerzy Skolimowski's \"Deep End\" (1970) with John Moulder Brown.\n\nOn television, she guest-starred in an episode of the British television comedy series \"The Goodies\"; \"The Stone Tape\"; \"Wicked Women\"; \"Rumpole of the Bailey\"; as Celia Ryder in the 1981 Granada Television adaptation of \"Brideshead Revisited\"; \"A Voyage Round My Father\" opposite Laurence Olivier; \"The Mistress\" (1985–87); and as Faith Ashley in \"Wish Me Luck\" (three seasons from 1987–89).\n\nIn 1994, she portrayed the \"Doctor Who\" companion Susan Foreman in a BBC Radio 4 comedy drama \"Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman?\" Another notable radio broadcast was in \"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" in 2002, in the episode \"The Peculiar Persecution of Mr John Vincent Harden\".\n\nIn 2003, she appeared in the revived ITV soap, \"Crossroads\" where she played the hotel's owner, Angel Samson. After the soap was axed, Asher apologised to \"Crossroads\" fans for the way the 2003 series went.\n\nIn 2004, she starred in \"Festen\" at the Arts Theatre. In 2005, she starred in \"The World's Biggest Diamond\", by Gregory Motton, at the Royal Court Theatre. In 2006, Asher starred in the Richard Fell adaptation of the 1960s science fiction series \"A for Andromeda\", which aired on the British digital television station BBC Four. In 2007, she portrayed the widow Sandra in the Frank Oz film \"Death at a Funeral\". The same year Asher appeared in the BBC medical drama, \"Holby City\" as Lady Byrne. In October 2007, she played Andrea Yates in \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", in the episode \"Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?\" Asher co-starred in the 2008 ITV drama series \"The Palace\", filmed in Lithuania; she played Queen Charlotte, mother of King Richard IV.\n\nIn August 2008, Asher appeared in the reality TV talent show-themed television series, \"Maestro\", on BBC Two with other showbusiness personalities. From 2009 to 2010, she played Sally in the BBC One comedy series \"The Old Guys\". In 2011 she played Margaret Harker in \"Waterloo Road\".\n\nIn October 2009, she appeared as Delia in Peter Hall's revival of Alan Ayckbourn's \"Bedroom Farce\" at the Rose Theatre, Kingston and in her first pantomime, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" at Richmond Theatre in December 2009, receiving enthusiastic reviews for both. In 2011 she returned to the Rose, Kingston as Lady Bracknell in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\n\nIn 2012, she appeared in \"Charley's Aunt\" at the Menier Chocolate Factory. In the summer of 2013, she played Lady Catherine de Bourgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park. In 2014, she starred in the stage adaptation of Penelope Lively's \"Moon Tiger\" at the Theatre Royal Bath and on tour. In 2016, Asher took on the role of Miss Havisham in Michael Eaton's adaptation of Great Expectations. She took on the role of Madame Baurel in the 2017 London stage production of \"An American in Paris (musical)\".\n\nAsher has written three best-selling novels: \"The Longing, The Question\", and \"Losing It\", and published more than a dozen lifestyle, costuming, and cake decorating books. Asher owns a company that makes party cakes and sugar crafts for special occasions. She also has her own brand of kitchenware that is being sold in Poundland shops in the UK and also in Dealz in Ireland.\n\nShe is a shareholder in \"Private Eye\", president of Arthritis Care, and a patron of Scoliosis Association (UK).\n\nShe is also president of the National Autistic Society, in which she takes an active role. She was a speaker at the 2006 launch of the National Autistic Society's \"Make School Make Sense\" campaign and is president of Parkinson's UK. In March 2010, Asher became vice president to Autistica, a UK charity raising funds for autism research. Asher is also a patron of TRACKS Autism, an early years nursery setting for children on the autistic spectrum and The Daisy Garland, a national registered charity supporting children with drug resistant epilepsy.\n\nOn 18 April 1963, the 17-year-old Asher interviewed the Beatles at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England and began a five-year relationship with Paul McCartney. In December 1963, McCartney took up residence at Asher's family Wimpole Street town house and stayed there until the couple moved into McCartney's own home located in St John's Wood in 1966. McCartney wrote several Beatles songs inspired by her, including \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\", \"I'm Looking Through You\", \"We Can Work It Out\", and \"Here, There and Everywhere\". McCartney and Asher announced on Christmas Day 1967 that they were engaged to marry, and in February and March 1968, Asher accompanied the Beatles and their respective partners to Rishikesh to attend an advanced Transcendental Meditation training session with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In mid-1968, Asher returned to London from an acting assignment in Bristol earlier than expected and discovered McCartney in bed with Francie Schwartz. A fan who frequently loitered around Paul's Cavendish Avenue home claims to have witnessed the incident, saying, \"... Paul brought this American girl home ... [and a little while later] ... another car turned into Cavendish Avenue—it was Jane. She'd come back ... earlier than she was supposed to. Jane went into the house. A bit later on, she came storming out again and drove away.\" Shortly after, Margaret Asher drove to Cavendish Avenue to collect her daughter's things.\n\nOn 20 July 1968, Asher announced publicly to the BBC that her engagement to McCartney had been called off, an announcement that shocked many people, including McCartney himself. At the time of Asher's announcement, McCartney was at his father's home with Schwartz by his side. Though Schwartz confirmed that Asher did see them in bed together, she claims that she was not the sole reason for the breakup, and that the couple were on the verge of separating prior to Asher walking in. Authors Hunter Davies and Barry Miles, state that the relationship always had several problems, one of them being that McCartney wanted Asher to give up her acting career after they married, which Asher refused to do. Another prevalent problem in the relationship was McCartney's drug use and frequent womanising. After returning to London from a five-month acting tour of the United States in May 1967, Asher found McCartney to be completely different, confiding in Davies that McCartney had \"changed so much. He was on LSD, which I hadn't shared. I was jealous of all the spiritual experiences he'd had with John. There were fifteen people dropping in all day long. The house had changed and was full of stuff I didn't know about.\"\n\nAsher attended the 1970 London premiere of the Beatles' last movie \"Let it Be\" along with John Lennon's former wife Cynthia, though none of the former Beatles was in attendance. In 1971, she met the illustrator Gerald Scarfe. Their daughter, Katie, was born in 1974. They married in 1981, and they had two more children, sons Alexander (born 1981) and Rory (born 1983).\n\nAsher dislikes discussing or being asked about her relationship with McCartney; as she stated in 2004: \"I've been happily married for 30-something years. It's insulting.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He was a son of the engraver Jacob Simon, under whom he learned his trade. When not quite fifteen years of age he was appointed engraver to Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine. In 1775 he removed to Paris, where he became engraver to the Duke of Orleans in Chartres, with a yearly salary of 200 thaler. He soon became engraver to King Louis XVI, which position he held until 1792.\n\nAt the beginning of French Revolutionary Wars, Simon commanded a company under General Charles François Dumouriez. The battles of Anderlecht and Boucar, in both of which he was wounded, won him the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Returning to Paris, as a follower of Dumouriez he was accused of treason when the latter went over to the enemy, but he succeeded in proving himself innocent. He next went to Spain, where he became engraver to the court, but was soon recalled to Paris as teacher of engraving at the Institute for Deaf-Mutes. After being banished for a short period, he was recalled and became engraver to the empress Josephine. In 1813 he rejoined the army, and served as colonel of a regiment of lancers in the first corps of the francs-éclaireurs of the department of the Seine. Discharged on half-pay in 1814, he took no prominent part in the campaign of 1815, and in 1816 he went to Brussels, where he passed the rest of his life.\n\nSimon was an excellent engraver; he executed engravings on precious stones, some of which were mistaken for real antiques and were sold to the Empress of Russia. He likewise etched on copper, and his portraits of noted men of the Netherlands especially deserve mention. He also published \"L'Armorial général de l'Empire\", of which only volumes 1 and 2 appeared, under the patronage of the empress Josephine. Among his pupils were Dubois, Paul, Verger, Lalondre, and his own son Simon.\n\n"}
{"id": "44582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44582", "title": "John of the Cross", "text": "John of the Cross\n\nJohn of the Cross (; 1542 – 14 December 1591) was a major figure of the Counter-Reformation, a Spanish mystic, a Roman Catholic saint, a Carmelite friar and a priest, who was born at Fontiveros, Old Castile.\n\nJohn of the Cross is known for his writings. Both his poetry and his studies on the growth of the soul are considered the summit of mystical Spanish literature and one of the peaks of all Spanish literature. He was canonized as a saint in 1726 by Pope Benedict XIII. He is one of the thirty-six Doctors of the Church.\n\nHe was born Juan de Yepes y Álvarez into a converso family (descendents of Jewish converts to Christianity) in Fontiveros, near Ávila, a town of around 2,000 people. His father, Gonzalo, was an accountant to richer relatives who were silk merchants. However, when in 1529 he married John's mother, Catalina, who was an orphan of a lower class, Gonzalo was rejected by his family and forced to work with his wife as a weaver. John's father died in 1545, while John was still only around three years old. Two years later, John's older brother Luis died, probably as a result of insufficient nourishment caused by the penury to which John's family had been reduced. After this, John's mother Catalina took John and his surviving brother Francisco, and moved first in 1548 to Arévalo, and then in 1551 to Medina del Campo, where she was able to find work weaving.\n\nIn Medina, John entered a school for around 160 poor children, usually orphans, receiving a basic education, mainly in Christian doctrine, as well as some food, clothing and lodging. While studying there, he was chosen to serve as acolyte at a nearby monastery of Augustinian nuns. Growing up, John worked at a hospital and studied the humanities at a Jesuit school from 1559 to 1563; the Society of Jesus was a new organization at the time, having been founded only a few years earlier by the Spaniard St. Ignatius of Loyola. In 1563 he entered the Carmelite Order, adopting the name John of St. Matthias.\n\nThe following year (1564) he professed his religious vows as a Carmelite and travelled to Salamanca, where he studied theology and philosophy at the prestigious University there (at the time one of the four biggest in Europe, alongside Paris, Oxford and Bologna) and at the Colegio de San Andrés. Some modern writers claim that this stay would influence all his later writings, as Fray Luis de León taught biblical studies (Exegesis, Hebrew and Aramaic) at the University: León was one of the foremost experts in Biblical Studies then and had written an important and controversial translation of the Song of Songs into Spanish. (Translation of the Bible into the vernacular was not allowed then in Spain, because of the possibility of mistranslation from Latin to Spanish which could create confusion.)\n\nJohn was ordained a priest in 1567, and then indicated his intent to join the strict Carthusian Order, which appealed to him because of its encouragement of solitary and silent contemplation. A journey from Salamanca to Medina del Campo, probably in September 1567, changed this. In Medina he met the charismatic Carmelite nun Teresa of Jesus (or Ávila). She was in Medina to found the second of her convents for women. She immediately talked to him about her reformation projects for the Order: she was seeking to restore the purity of the Carmelite Order by restarting observance of its \"Primitive Rule\" of 1209, observance of which had been relaxed by Pope Eugene IV in 1432.\n\nUnder this Rule, much of the day and night was to be spent in the recitation of the choir offices, study and devotional reading, the celebration of Mass and times of solitude. For the friars, time was to be spent evangelizing the population around the monastery. Total abstinence from meat and lengthy fasting was to be observed from the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14) until Easter. There were to be long periods of silence, especially between Compline and Prime. Coarser, shorter habits, more simple than those worn since 1432, were to be worn. They were to follow the injunction against the wearing of shoes (also mitigated in 1432). It was from this last observance that the followers of Teresa among the Carmelites were becoming known as \"discalced\", i.e., barefoot, differentiating themselves from the non-reformed friars and nuns.\n\nTeresa asked John to delay his entry into the Carthusians and to follow her. Having spent a final year studying in Salamanca, in August 1568 John traveled with Teresa from Medina to Valladolid, where Teresa intended to found another monastery of nuns. Having spent some time with Teresa in Valladolid, learning more about this new form of Carmelite life, in October 1568, accompanied by Friar Antonio de Jesús de Heredia, John left Valladolid to found a new monastery for friars, the first for men following Teresa's principles. They were given the use of a derelict house at Duruelo (midway between Ávila and Salamanca), which had been donated to Teresa. On 28 November 1568, the monastery was established, and on that same day John changed his name to \"John of the Cross\".\n\nSoon after, in June 1570, the friars found the house at Duruelo too small, and so moved to the nearby town of Mancera de Abajo. After moving on from this community, John set up a new community at Pastrana (October 1570), and a community at Alcalá de Henares, which was to be a house of studies for the academic training of the friars. In 1572 he arrived in Ávila, at the invitation of Teresa, who had been appointed prioress of the Monastery of the Incarnation there in 1571. John became the spiritual director and confessor for Teresa and the other 130 nuns there, as well as for a wide range of laypeople in the city. In 1574, John accompanied Teresa in the foundation of a new monastery in Segovia, returning to Ávila after staying there a week. Beyond this, though, John seems to have remained in Ávila between 1572 and 1577.\n\nAt some point between 1574 and 1577, while praying in the Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila in a loft overlooking the sanctuary, John had a vision of the crucified Christ, which led him to create his famous drawing of Christ \"from above\". In 1641, this drawing was placed in a small monstrance and kept in Ávila. This drawing inspired the artist Salvador Dalí's 1951 work \"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\".\n\nThe years 1575–77, however, saw a great increase in the tensions among the Spanish Carmelite friars over the reforms of Teresa and John. Since 1566 the reforms had been overseen by Canonical Visitors from the Dominican Order, with one appointed to Castile and a second to Andalusia. These Visitors had substantial powers: they could move the members of religious communities from house to house and even province to province. They could assist religious superiors in their office, and could depute other superiors from either the Dominicans or Carmelites. In Castile, the Visitor was Pedro Fernández, who prudently balanced the interests of the Discalced Carmelites against those of the friars and nuns who did not desire reform.\n\nIn Andalusia to the south, however, where the Visitor was Francisco Vargas, tensions rose due to his clear preference for the Discalced friars. Vargas asked them to make foundations in various cities, in explicit contradiction of orders from the Carmelite Prior General against their expansion in Andalusia. As a result, a General Chapter of the Carmelite Order was convened at Piacenza in Italy in May 1576, out of concern that events in Spain were getting out of hand, which concluded by ordering the total suppression of the Discalced houses.\n\nThis measure was not immediately enforced. King Philip II of Spain was supportive of some of Teresa's reforms, and so was not immediately willing to grant the necessary permission to enforce this ordinance. The Discalced friars also found support from the papal nuncio to King Philip II, , Bishop of Padua, who still had ultimate power as nuncio to visit and reform religious Orders. When asked by the Discalced friars to intervene, Ormaneto replaced Vargas as Visitor of the Carmelites in Andalusia (where the troubles had begun) with Jerónimo Gracián, a priest from the University of Alcalá, who was in fact a Discalced Carmelite friar himself. The nuncio's protection helped John avoid problems for a time. In January 1576, John was arrested in Medina del Campo by some Carmelite friars. However, through the nuncio's intervention, John was soon released. When Ormaneto died on 18 June 1577, however, John was left without protection, and the friars opposing his reforms gained the upper hand.\n\nOn the night of 2 December 1577, a group of Carmelites opposed to reform broke into John's dwelling in Ávila and took him prisoner. John had received an order from some of his superiors, opposed to reform, ordering him to leave Ávila and return to his original house, but John had refused on the basis that his reform work had been approved by the Spanish nuncio, a higher authority than these superiors. The Carmelites therefore took John captive. John was taken from Ávila to the Carmelite monastery in Toledo, at that time the Order's most important monastery in Castile, where perhaps 40 friars lived. John was brought before a court of friars, accused of disobeying the ordinances of Piacenza. Despite John's argument that he had not disobeyed the ordinances, he received a punishment of imprisonment. He was jailed in the monastery, where he was kept under a brutal regimen that included public lashing before the community at least weekly, and severe isolation in a tiny stifling cell measuring ten feet by six feet, barely large enough for his body. Except when rarely permitted an oil lamp, he had to stand on a bench to read his breviary by the light through the hole into the adjoining room. He had no change of clothing and a penitential diet of water, bread and scraps of salt fish. During this imprisonment, he composed a great part of his most famous poem \"Spiritual Canticle\", as well as a few shorter poems. The paper was passed to him by the friar who guarded his cell. He managed to escape nine months later, on 15 August 1578, through a small window in a room adjoining his cell. (He had managed to pry the cell door off its hinges earlier that day.)\n\nAfter being nursed back to health, first with Teresa's nuns in Toledo, and then during six weeks at the Hospital of Santa Cruz, John continued with reform. In October 1578 he joined a meeting at Almodóvar del Campo of the supporters of reform, increasingly known as the Discalced Carmelites. There, in part as a result of the opposition faced from other Carmelites in recent years, they decided to demand from the Pope their formal separation from the rest of the Carmelite Order.\n\nAt this meeting John was appointed superior of El Calvario, an isolated monastery of around thirty friars in the mountains about 6 miles away from Beas in Andalusia. During this time he befriended the nun Ana de Jesús, superior of the Discalced nuns at Beas, through his visits every Saturday to the town. While at El Calvario he composed his first version of his commentary on his poem, \"The Spiritual Canticle\", perhaps at the request of the nuns in Beas.\n\nIn 1579 he moved to Baeza, a town of around 50,000 people, to serve as rector of a new college, the Colegio de San Basilio, to support the studies of Discalced friars in Andalusia. This opened on 13 June 1579. He remained in post there until 1582, spending much of his time as a spiritual director for the friars and townspeople.\n\n1580 was an important year in the resolution of the disputes within the Carmelites. On 22 June, Pope Gregory XIII signed a decree, titled \"Pia Consideratione\", which authorised a separation between the Calced and Discalced Carmelites. The Dominican friar Juan Velázquez de las Cuevas was appointed to carry out the decisions. At the first General Chapter of the Discalced Carmelites, in Alcalá de Henares on 3 March 1581, John of the Cross was elected one of the \"Definitors\" of the community, and wrote a set of constitutions for them. By the time of the Provincial Chapter at Alcalá in 1581, there were 22 houses, some 300 friars and 200 nuns in the Discalced Carmelites.\n\nIn November 1581, John was sent by Teresa to help Ana de Jesús in founding a convent in Granada. Arriving in January 1582, she set up a monastery of nuns, while John stayed in the friars' monastery of Los Mártires, beside the Alhambra, becoming its prior in March 1582. While here, he learned of the death of Teresa in October of that year.\n\nIn February 1585, John travelled to Málaga and established a monastery of Discalced nuns there. In May 1585, at the General Chapter of the Discalced Carmelites in Lisbon, John was elected Provincial Vicar of Andalusia, a post which required him to travel frequently, making annual visitations of the houses of friars and nuns in Andalusia. During this time he founded seven new monasteries in the region, and is estimated to have travelled around 25,000 km.\n\nIn June 1588, he was elected third Councillor to the Vicar General for the Discalced Carmelites, Father Nicolas Doria. To fulfill this role, he had to return to Segovia in Castile, where in this capacity he was also prior of the monastery. After disagreeing in 1590–1 with some of Doria's remodeling of the leadership of the Discalced Carmelite Order, though, John was removed from his post in Segovia, and sent by Doria in June 1591 to an isolated monastery in Andalusia called La Peñuela. There he fell ill, and traveled to the monastery at Úbeda for treatment. His condition worsened, however, and he died there on 14 December 1591, of erysipelas.\n\nThe morning after John’s death huge numbers of the townspeople of Úbeda entered the monastery to view his body; in the crush, many were able to take home parts of his habit. He was initially buried at Úbeda, but, at the request of the monastery in Segovia, his body was secretly moved there in 1593. The people of Úbeda, however, unhappy at this change, sent a representative to petition the pope to move the body back to its original resting place. Pope Clement VIII, impressed by the petition, issued a Brief on 15 October 1596 ordering the return of the body to Úbeda. Eventually, in a compromise, the superiors of the Discalced Carmelites decided that the monastery at Úbeda would receive one leg and one arm of the corpse from Segovia (the monastery at Úbeda had already kept one leg in 1593, and the other arm had been removed as the corpse passed through Madrid in 1593, to form a relic there). A hand and a leg remain visible in a reliquary at the Oratory of San Juan de la Cruz in Úbeda, a monastery built in 1627 though connected to the original Discalced monastery in the town founded in 1587.\n\nThe head and torso were retained by the monastery at Segovia. There, they were venerated until 1647, when on orders from Rome designed to prevent the veneration of remains without official approval, the remains were buried in the ground. In the 1930s they were disinterred, and now sit in a side chapel in a marble case above a special altar built in that decade.\n\nProceedings to beatify John began with the gathering of information on his life between 1614 and 1616, although he was only beatified in 1675 by Pope Clement X, and was canonized by Benedict XIII in 1726. When his feast day was added to the General Roman Calendar in 1738, it was assigned to 24 November, since his date of death was impeded by the then-existing octave of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. This obstacle was removed in 1955 and in 1969 Pope Paul VI moved it to the \"dies natalis\" (birthday to heaven) of the saint, 14 December. The Church of England commemorates him as a \"Teacher of the Faith\" on the same date. In 1926, he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius XI after the definitive consultation of Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange O.P., professor of philosophy and theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\" in Rome.\n\n Saint John of the Cross is considered one of the foremost poets in the Spanish language. Although his complete poems add up to fewer than 2500 verses, two of them—the \"Spiritual Canticle\" and the \"Dark Night of the Soul\"—are widely considered masterpieces of Spanish poetry, both for their formal stylistic point of view and their rich symbolism and imagery. His theological works often consist of commentaries on these poems. All the works were written between 1578 and his death in 1591, meaning there is great consistency in the views presented in them.\n\nThe \"Spiritual Canticle\" is an eclogue in which the bride (representing the soul) searches for the bridegroom (representing Jesus Christ), and is anxious at having lost him; both are filled with joy upon reuniting. It can be seen as a free-form Spanish version of the Song of Songs at a time when translations of the Bible into the vernacular were forbidden. The first 31 stanzas of the poem were composed in 1578 while John was imprisoned in Toledo. It was read after his escape by the nuns at Beas, who made copies of these stanzas. Over the following years, John added some extra stanzas. Today, two versions exist: one with 39 stanzas and one with 40, although with some of the stanzas ordered differently. The first redaction of the commentary on the poem was written in 1584, at the request of Madre Ana de Jesús, when she was prioress of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Granada. A second redaction, which contains more detail, was written in 1585–6.\n\nThe \"Dark Night\" (from which the spiritual term takes its name) narrates the journey of the soul from its bodily home to union with God. It happens during the night, which represents the hardships and difficulties met in detachment from the world and reaching the light of the union with the Creator. There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas. The main idea of the poem can be seen as the painful experience that people endure as they seek to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God. The poem of this title was likely written in 1578 or 1579. In 1584-5, John wrote a commentary on the first two stanzas and first line of the third stanza of the poem.\n\nThe \"Ascent of Mount Carmel\" is a more systematic study of the ascetical endeavour of a soul looking for perfect union, God and the mystical events happening along the way. Although it begins as a commentary on the poem \"The Dark Night\", it rapidly drops this format, having commented on the first two stanzas of the poem, and becomes a treatise. It was composed sometime between 1581 and 1585.\n\nA four-stanza work, \"Living Flame of Love\", describes a greater intimacy, as the soul responds to God's love. It was written in a first redaction at Granada between 1585-6, apparently in two weeks, and in a mostly identical second redaction at La Peñuela in 1591.\n\nThese, together with his \"Dichos de Luz y Amor\" (or \"Sayings of Light and Love\") and Saint Teresa's writings, are the most important mystical works in Spanish, and have deeply influenced later spiritual writers all around the world. Among these are T. S. Eliot, Thérèse de Lisieux, Edith Stein (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) and Thomas Merton. John has also influenced philosophers (Jacques Maritain), theologians (Hans Urs von Balthasar), pacifists (Dorothy Day, Daniel Berrigan and Philip Berrigan) and artists (Salvador Dalí). Pope John Paul II wrote his theological dissertation on the mystical theology of Saint John of the Cross.\n\nHis writings were first published in 1618 by Diego de Salablanca. The numerical divisions in the work, still used by modern editions of the text, were introduced by Salablanca (they were not in John's original writings) in order to help make the work more manageable for the reader. This edition does not contain the \"Spiritual Canticle\" however, and also omits or adapts certain passages, perhaps for fear of falling foul of the Inquisition.\n\nThe \"Spiritual Canticle\" was first included in the 1630 edition, produced by Fray Jeronimo de San José, at Madrid. This edition was largely followed by later editors, although editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gradually included a few more poems and letters.\n\nThe first French edition was published in Paris in 1622, and the first Castilian edition in 1627 in Brussels.\n\nWorking out the main influences on John’s thought has been an ongoing debate.\n\nJohn was clearly influenced by the Bible. Scriptural images are common in both his poems and prose—in total, there are 1,583 explicit and 115 implicit quotations from the Bible in his works. The influence of the Song of Songs on the \"Spiritual Canticle\" has often been noted, both in terms of the structure of the poem, with its dialogue between two lovers, the account of their difficulties in meeting each other and the \"offstage chorus\" that comments on this action, and also in terms of the imagery of pomegranates, wine cellar, turtle dove and lilies, for example, which echoes that of the \"Song of Songs\".\n\nIn addition, John shows at occasional points the influence of the Divine Office. This demonstrates how John, steeped in the language and rituals of the Church, drew at times on the phrases and language here.\n\nIn order to gain a better understanding of the intellectual influences to which John was exposed in his formative years (and so to isolate what shaped his unusual theology), many scholars have tried to reconstruct John's likely course of studies while he was at Salamanca between 1563 and 1567, living at the Carmelite College of San Andrès and studying at the University of Salamanca. It has been widely acknowledged in the 20th century to be most likely that John would have received teaching both from the College of San Andres and from Salamanca University.\n\nIf taught at the College of San Andrès, John would have been exposed to the teachings of both Michael of Bologna and John Baconthorpe, with the Spanish Carmelites of the day concentrating more on Baconthorpe's thought. There are, however, no clear signs of the influence of either writer in John's works. Perhaps no more can be said of the influence of Baconthorpe than that, given that he was a \"subtle and eclectic scholar who did not hesitate to disagree with Aquinas on many important issues\", it might be \"that acquaintance with his works may have helped John to avoid any slavish adherence to Thomistic doctrines\".\n\nIn the University itself, there is widely acknowledged to have existed a range of intellectual positions. Academic positions in John's time included Chairs of St. Thomas, Chairs of Scotus and Durandus. Typically, it is assumed that John would have been educated here in the thought of Thomas Aquinas, explaining the influence of Thomas on much of the scholastic framework of his writings.\n\nHowever, the belief that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of Salamanca has been criticised. He argues, firstly, that it is unclear whether there were in fact lectures in arts and theology at the College of San Andrès before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of Salamanca shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andrès, and that what therefore happened at San Andrès (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an official form — making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely. More controversially, Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca. The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in Salamanca.\n\nAnother claim frequently made about John's time in Salamanca, by scholars trying to explain the origins of John's mystical thought, is that it was here he was exposed in detail to mystical thought. In the first biography of John, published in 1628, it is claimed, on the basis of information from John's fellow students, that he in 1567 made a special study of mystical writers, in particular of Pseudo-Dionysius and Saint Gregory the Great. Much weight has been put on this evidence by later writers. However, others have doubted the veracity of this anecdote, even though they do not dispute that John may have studied mystical theology in this period.\n\nThere is little consensus from John's early years on his potential influences. Although a list of theologians about whom John may have been taught can be drawn up, the evidence is not sufficient to make firm judgements on who may have influenced him.\n\nIt has rarely been disputed that the overall structure of John’s mystical theology, and his language of the union of the soul with God, is influenced by the pseudo-Dionysian tradition. However, it has not been clear whether John might have had direct access to the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, or whether this influence may have been mediated through various later authors.\n\nThe main conduit of Dionysian spirituality into ascetic-mystical literature on contemplative prayer in sixteenth-century prayer (such as that by John of the Cross and Teresa of Ávila appears to have been through the \"recogido\" tradition of Francisco de Osuna, Bernardino de Laredo and others. Osuna’s focus on recogimiento (recollecting or gathering of the senses) as a means of prayer, bears similarity to John’s discussion of prayer, and may have been an influence. In terms of Spanish writing, it is notable that although the second half of the sixteenth century produced many great mystics, mysticism was not common in Spain before that.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that John may have been influenced by the writings of other medieval mystics, though there is debate about the exact thought which may have influenced him, and about how he might have been exposed to their ideas.\n\nThe possibility of influence by the so-called \"Rhineland mystics\" such as Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, Henry Suso and John of Ruysbroeck has also been mooted by many authors. Others have seen Tauler alone as most influential. Alongside the Rhineland mystics, others have argued for the influence of the Victorines and Bonaventure. Most recently, Peter Tyler has argued that John adopts a style of writing, a \"performative discourse\", which works on both the reader's affect and intellect, in a tradition following a lineage from Pseudo-Dionysius, the Victorines, Jean Gerson and through intermediaries such as Francisco de Osuna.\n\nIt is unclear, though, how John might have had access to the works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only translated into Latin in the second half of the sixteenth century. This means that copies would hardly have been easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.\n\nHowever, a strong argument can also be made for contemporary Spanish literary influences on John. This case was first made in detail by Dámaso Alonso, who believed that as well as drawing from scripture, John was transforming non-religious, profane themes, derived from popular songs (\"romanceros\") into religious poetry; Alonso argued that John was particularly influenced by the works of the Spanish Renaissance poets Garcilaso de la Vega and Boscán. Certainly, John does appear to have used Garcilaso's verse forms in his own poetry, in particular in the \"Spiritual Canticle\", \"Dark Night\", and \"Living Flame of Love\". Alongside the various biblical images noted above, for example, exist in John's poems many new Renaissance symbols of pastoral love, prominent in the poetry of Garcilaso and Boscán, such as sirens, nightingales, nymphs, doves and shepherds. Moreover, in the Prologue to the \"Living Flame\", John states that \"the composition of these lyric lines is like those that in Boscán are given a religious meaning\". Kavanaugh (1991) also points out that these lines are in fact not by Boscán, but by Garcilaso, although the confusion was common at the time, as the works of the two poets had been published together.\n\nOthers, though, have questioned the evidence for precisely how John might have been influenced by Boscán and Garcilaso. Dámaso Alonso argued that John must have read the newly published 1575 edition of the poets in Ávila, shortly before his imprisonment in Toledo, and that this must have been the key influence which rekindled in John memories of his own reading of Garcilaso as a young student of the Jesuits in Medina del Campo. However, Peter Thompson disputes this, arguing it is not definite John would have been familiar with Garcilaso from an early age, and even so the influence has been overemphasised by other commentators.\n\nA controversial theory of the origins of John’s mystical imagery is that he was influenced by Islamic sources. This was first proposed in detail by Miguel Asín Palacios and has been most recently put forward by the Puerto Rican scholar Luce López-Baralt. Arguing that John was influenced by Islamic sources on the peninsula, she traces Islamic antecedents of the images of the \"dark night\", the \"solitary bird\" of the \"Spiritual Canticle\", wine and mystical intoxication (the \"Spiritual Canticle\"), lamps of fire (the \"Living Flame\") and so on.\n\nPeter Tyler, though, puts forward a number of coherent objections to this line of enquiry. Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources in other parts of the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources. Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources. Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between Islamic culture and Christian culture in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain. Rather, Tyler concludes, there \"are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest we should look for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources\". As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.\n\nJean Baruzi argued that the Spanish mystics created their decisive symbols independently of the historical conditions of the time. This theory, however, has not been widely pursued.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to recent scholarship based on a rare series of bronze coins and artifacts found in the region, the caves and their adjacent valley probably comprised a sovereign kingdom in Gandhara which maintained at least partial independence for almost 500 years, from c. 4th century AD to the 9th century AD. For most of its history, it was ruled by White Hun (or Hephthalite) governors or princes.\n\n\"Smast\" is a mistranscription of the Pashto word for 'cave,' which is actually \"smats\" ().\n\nAs for \"Kashmir\", the Gazetteer of the Peshawar district 1897-1898 describes that “the name [Kashmir Smast] may be derived from the fact that the gorge here is fairly and picturesquely wooded, and this may have suggested Kashmir.” Another explanation is that according to legend, the network caves was so vast that it stretched from Gandhara to the kingdom of Kashmir.\n\nA number of the cells had wooden architectural interiors, carved with elaborate Hindu and Buddhist iconography. Examples of these panels can be found in the British Museum in London. Remarkably, excavations at the Kashmir Smast site have not only brought forth artifacts of extreme historical importance but have also uncovered one of the most well organized town planning systems in ancient Gandhara.\n\nSir Alexander Cunningham in “The Ancient Geography of India” and in the “Archaeological Survey Reports” outlined the principal ancient sites in Gandhara, which at that time was part of the Yusufzai subdivision. Among the sites covered is the Kashmir Smast.\n\nThe Kashmir Smast sites are described by Cunningham as cave temples situated near the summit of the Sakri ridge of Pajja, and approached from the village in Babozai in the tappah Baezai, it can easily be approached from village Pirsai. Cunningham associated the Kashmir Smast with the cave of Prince Sudana in Mount Dantalok, described by the contemporary Chinese traveler Xuanzang.\n\nA detailed discussion of the site in the Gazetteer of the Peshawar district 1897-1898 states the following:\n\nIt goes on to describe the layout of the caves:\n\nWhat is being described here is an enclosed and fortified complex comprising a city and temples built into natural caves. The presence of walls and a water system serving the area would indicate a certain level of economic independence exerted in the region.\n\nThe most recent research, conducted by a World know archaeologist and historian Prof. Meritorious Dr. M. Nasim Khan, has shown that apart form Taxila, Kashmir Smast was another important centre of eduction and is regarded as the earliest seat of Hindu learning (M. Nasim Khan 2018).\nGiven the fact that exact find data is not available for the coins of the Kashmir Smast, and that numerous symbols, legends, and images on the coins have come to light which have never before been encountered in 150 years of Hunnic numismatic study, the attribution and dating of these specimens becomes an arduous task. In the varieties of coins found in the Kashmir Smast, it becomes apparent that during the period of the Kidara, the Alxon, the Nazek, the Turk Shahis, and the Hindu Shahis, a minor kingdom based in this region maintained some level of autonomy from the greater Hunnic hordes which ruled Gandhara. This is evidenced by the use of hithertofore unrecorded images, stylistic peculiarities, and tamghas (royal symbols).\n\nThe bronze coins found in cave and its adjacent valley can be divided into seven groups:\n\n1) Kushano-Sassanian. The hoard includes numerous Kushano-Sassanian bronzes of the dumpy fabric, including mostly known varieties in addition to unpublished fractionals, and a number of anonymous Hunnic imitations minted in the dumpy Kushano-Sassanian fabric.\n\n2) Kidara. Kidarite coins in the hoard comprise the majority of unpublished specimens. The obverse of some varieties closely resemble, or are crudely rendered versions of, known Kidarite drachms. The busts portrayed on these coins are depicted wearing headdresses associated with particular Kidara princes, often in turn borrowed from contemporary Sassanian / Kushano-Sassanian monarchs. This group also includes thin AE units featuring bearded busts occasionally with Brahmi legends. As they are notably different from other recorded Kushano-Sassanian bronzes, they may be attributed to Kidarite governors or princes under Kushano-Sassanian or Sassanian sovereignty.\n\n3) Alxon (or Alchon) Huns. The hoard includes a number of coins which are stylistically similar to the Alxon Hunnic series. Some feature the royal Hunnic tamgha, or royal symbol, most often associated with the first of the Alxon Hunnic kings in Gandhara, Khingila and his immediate successors.\n\n4) Nezak. Common published Nazek bronzes abound in the hoard. In addition to these, a number of unpublished varieties with stylistic similarities to Nezak bronzes have also been discovered, notably featuring a trident tamgha.\n\n5) Turk Shahi. These include small AE units imitating larger silver Turk Shahi drachms. They are either anepigraphic or feature Bactrian Greek legends.\n\n6) The Shahi Kings of Kabul and Gandhara. This category includes coins stylistically similar to the coins of Samanta Deva and Spalapati Deva, characterized by linear stylized anthropomorphic or zoomorphic representations.\n\n7) Anonymous coins which can not be stylistically attributed to any particular Hunnic period or clan.\n\n8) Bronze imitations of Bactrian drachms of Menander I and other dynasts.\n\nScholars contend that the bronze currency found in the region were issued by local semi-independent governors, or Tegins, in the Kashmir Smast valley, paying allegiance to the greater Hunnic Tegins of Gandhara and Bactria. The feudal and tribal nature of the ancient Central Asian' states allowed for substantial independence to be exercised by local governors.\n\nIt is worth noting that all the new varieties found in this area are small bronze pieces, varying in weight between 0.5 and 1.1 g. (referred to as the Kashmir Smast standard). They are occasionally small versions of more common drachms circulating in the region, or feature entirely new portraits / images with some or no resemblance to commonly circulating coins of the period.\n\nGiven the fact that these pieces have not been found elsewhere in Hunnic domains, we can infer that they were not considered acceptable currency outside of the Kashmir Smast region. However, imitating the coins of the contemporary rulers of Gandhara, and employing certain of their dynastic symbols and portraits, alongside a totally new set of portraits, names / titles, and symbols, may indicate that while they were issued independently for use in the local kingdom, the local rulers must have paid homage to and acknowledged their Hunnic overlords. The fact that they were allowed to use some of their own tamghas and titles and that the greater chiefs gave them the privilege of minting their own currency strengthens this argument. The minting of coins was a prerogative of the rulers, and carried with it a certain degree of governing authority. Numismatically speaking, this can be likened to the period of Hephthalite and Turk Shahi sovereignty over Sogdiana, during which civic bronze coinage circulated alongside of silver drachms referencing a Hunnic or Turkic overlord (the Bukharkhoda). The fact that such independent issues continued throughout five separate dynasties, until the Hindu Shahi period, means that to a degree this principality maintained its status for perhaps as long as three to four hundred years.\n\nH.A.

The event forms an important part of Sikh history. In political significance, it comes next only to Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 1919. The saga constitutes the core of the Gurdwara Reform Movement started by the Sikhs in early twentieth century.\n\nThe Sikh faith was founded by Guru Nanak in fifteenth century and his divine torch was carried on by nine gurus who had followed in succession. The concepts of Sangat, Pangat, Dharamshala (Gurdwara) and Kirtan took firm roots during this period and became important constituents of Sikhism. in Gurdwaras had played crucial roles in the religious and social affairs of the early Sikhs. Later, they assumed wider dimensions by transforming into religio-political organisation. The \"peaceful\" and \"non-political\" budding Sikh brotherhood was transformed into a proud and fiercely martial nation through the baptismic process of Amrit-pan. After a long and continuous resistance of several decades against the tyrannies of Mughal rule, the brave Sikhs finally emerged victorious and succeeded in carving out 12 Khalsa principalities in Punjab which soon led to the creation of a unified Khalsa kingdom with Ranjit Singh at the helms. Maharaja Ranjit Singh reconstructed the Gurdwaras earlier destroyed by the Moghuls and also raised many new ones at the sacred places connected with the Sikh Gurus. For the sustenance of the Mahants, Maharaja Ranjit Singh had attached handsome landed properties with many of these Gurdwaras. The earlier Mahants were devoted Sikhs and true missionaries who did a lot for the spread of Sikhism. As the times rolled by, the Gurdwara incomes swelled enormously and the enormous money corrupted and degenerated the later-time Mahants into loose lived individuals. They started treating the Gurdwara properties as if they were their personal fiefs. This changed the things for Sikh Panth.\n\nGurdwara Nankana Sahib was managed by Mahant Narayan Das, a Punjabi Brahmin in the early 20th century. This Gurdwara had a huge property of over 19000 acres (77 km²) of highly fertile land attached to it which yielded enormous income per year.\n\nDance girls were allegedly brought to the Gurdwara and dances were held and obscene songs were sung within the holy premises. In 1917, he is said to have arranged a dance-show by a prostitute near the holy Gurdawara. In 1918, a retired A.A.C. officer paid visit to the Gurdwara with his 13-year-old daughter to offer prayers to the Guru. As the Rehraas was being read in the Gurdwara, the mahant was allegedly raping the minor girl in another room within the Gurdwara premises. When the father lodged a complaint with the mahant to take action against the rapist, Mahant is said to have ignored his request. In the same year, six young female devotees from Jaranwal village (modern Faisalabad, Pakistan) visited the Gurdawara on Puranmashi (full moon) to pay their offerings at Gurdwara and they too were similarly raped by the mahant in that gurdwara.\n\nAll this went on before the very eyes of the Sikhs which had sent shock waves across Punjab. The issue was effectively raised in \"The Akali\" (Punjabi), published from Lahore by Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri (q.v.), father of the Akali movement and Shiromani Akali Dal. Lyallpuri belonged to Bohoru village close to Nankana Sahib and he personally preached against the supposed debauchery of the Mahant in the nearby villages and also continued to organize the Sikhs for a movement to bring reforms into the Gurdwaras.\n\nIn October 1920, a congregation was held at Dharowal in Sheikhupura (modern day Pakistan) for reform in Gurdwara Nankana Sahib. The supposed actions committed within Gurdwara by Mahant were revealed to the Sangat. On January 24, Shiromani Committee held a general meeting and took decision to hold a Dewan in Nankana Sahib on March 4, 5 and 6 and advise Mahant to mend his ways.\n\nAccording to some, the Mahant was a shrewd politician who publicly impressed that he was anxious to settle the issues with the Panth. On February 14, Mahant held a meeting with his associates to chalk out a plan to kill the opposing Sikh leaders on March 5 at Nankana Sahib. Mahant recruited 400 mercenaries, including Pashtuns paid at twenty Indian rupees per month to oppose the Sikhs. With government's help, Mahant also collected guns, pistols and other arms and ammunition. He also arranged and stored fourteen tins of paraffin and further strengthened the Gurdwara gate and carved out shooting galleries.\n\nMahant Narayan Das had the backing from the Mahants of other Gurdwaras in Punjab. The Bedi Jagirdars who had received Jagirs from the English Government by virtue of their past connections with Guru Nanak also supported the Mahant. Sardar Sunder Singh Majithia also maintained double standards. But Maharaja of Patiala flatly refused to back Mahant and offered him a healthy advice not to rebel against the Panth. He further advised the Mahant to create a committee of prominent Sikhs and hand over the Gurdwara charge to them. But Mahant ignored the advice of Patiala Royal house.\n\nThe Shiromani Committee extended invitation to Mahant for talks at Gurdwara \"Khara Sauda\" to resolve the issue but he did not show up at the given time. Then he offered to hold talks with the Sikh leaders in Sheikhupura on February 15, 1921, but again he failed to show up. Third time he promised to meet the Shiromani Committee leaders at the residence of Sardar Amar Singh \"Lyall Gazette\" on February 16, but once again he failed to turn up.\n\nThe Shiromani Committee decided of its own to meet the Mahant on 3 March 1921 to advise him to hand over the charge to the committee. But the Committee got the information from its own intelligence that Mahant was planning to invite the Sikh leaders at Nanakana Sahib and have them killed from hired gundas. This greatly angered Kartar Singh Jhabber and others. A meeting of the Sikh leaders was called at Gurdwara Khara Sauda on 16, 1921 to chalk out the future course of action. It was decided that Sangat would go in \"Jathas\" (squads) and take charge of the Gurdwara. Sikh leaders learnt that Mahant was going to Lahore on 20 February 1921. Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabbar and Bhai Lachaman Singh Dharowali decided to take their jathas to Nanakana Sahib on 20 February.\n\nOn the evening of February 19, 1921, Bhai Lachaman Singh Dharowali reached Nizam Deva Singhwala with his jatha of 8 Singhs (6 males and two females). At Nizam Deva Singh wala, Jathedar Tehal Singh (Kamboj Sikh) had already arranged a Jatha of about 150 Singhs, majority of them belonging to the Kamboj community. All these Singhs came from nearby Kamboj villages of Nizampur Moola Singh wala, Nizampur Chelewala, Dalla Chand Singh, Bohoru, Thothian and Nizam Deva Singh wala etc, all falling in District Sheikhupura (now Pakistan).\n\nThe combined Jatha took a Hukamnama and started for the Gurdwara at about 10 PM on that night so as to reach there by early morning at \"Amrit vela\" (nectral hours). On the way 50 more Sikhs joined the \"Shaheedi Jatha\" and total number swelled to about 200.\nAt Chanderkot Jhal, Jathedar Lachhman Singh decided to wait for Kartar Singh Jhabber and his Jatha. They waited for a while in vain and finally Jathedar Dharowali decided to cancel the plan for further march to Nankana Sahib. But at this very moment, Jathedar Tehal Singh came forward and addressed the Shaheedi Jatha not to vacillate even for a moment from forward march since \"the prayers having already been said and the action plan having already been decided with Guru's word, it is now imperative for now to move forward\". Advising further that \"all the members shall keep cool even under extreme provocations\". From here-onwards, Jathedar Tehal Singh took over the supreme command of the Shaheedi Jatha and resumed the march to Nankana. By almost at \"Amritvela\", the Shaheedi Jatha reached the Railway-crossing near Nankana Sahib. Some of the Jatha members raced towards Darshani Deori to take possession of the Gurdawara, but at this very moment, Chaudhury Paul Singh Lyallpuri showed up \"with the latest decision of Shiromani Committee advising to postpone the action for taking possession of the Gurdwara\". Having conveyed the information, Bhai Paul Singh grabbed Jathedar Lachhman Singh from his waist behind and persuaded him not to proceed further. Once again, Jathedar Tehal Singh took the initiative and shaking Chaudhury Paul Singh forcefully off from the person of Jathedar Lachhman Singh, he once more challenged the Shaheedi Jatha to get ready for the sublime action. He once again spoke: \"\" Khalsa ji, the time is not to stop now, but to act. We have come here to achieve martyrdom under Guru's word. This is very un-Sikh-like to backout from one's commitment at the last moment\" \" Saying this, Tehal Singh walked with the Jatha towards the Gurdwara. Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but Tehal Singh stuck to his Ardās.\n\nEnthused by the speech of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha followed him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered \"Darshni Deohri\" of the Gurdwara and shut the main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the \"Prakash Asthan\", others sat on the platform and the \"Baran dari\". Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the \"Jaikaras\" (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that the game was over but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal weapons to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned to flame. By the time the police and local Sikhs came on the scene, all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery at its worst form.\n\nThe news spread and Sikhs from all parts of Punjab started their march towards Nankana Sahib. Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabber reached next day with 2200 Singhs armed with shastras (arms). Fearing more trouble, Mr King, Commissioner Lahore, handed over the keys of Nankana Sahib to Shiromani Committee and arrested Mahant Narayan Das and his Pashtun mercenaries and charged them with murder, but only Das and some of the mercenaries were sentenced to death.\n\nA total of 86 Sikhs officially died. According to Giani Partap Singh, out of a total figure of 86 Sikh Shaheeds of Nankana saka, the Kamboj community alone shared 31.\n\nMahatma Gandhi visited Nankana Sahib on March 3, 1921. Addressing the gathering, Mahatma said: \"I have come to share your anguish and grief. It is interesting indeed to note that the Sikhs in this drama remained peaceful and non-violent from the start to the end. This (role of the Sikhs) has greatly added to the glory and prestige of India \"...\" \"All indications point to the fact that the cruel and barbaric action is the second edition of Jallianwala Bagh massacre; rather more evil and more invidious than even Jallianwala\" \". Gandhi further spoke: \" \"the action of these dimensions could not be perpetrated by Mahant alone. The government officers are also involved in this heinous crime. Where had the authorities gone when the Mahant was making preparations for murderous plans?\" \"\n\nThe supreme sacrifices made by these Sikhs Shaheeds have been acknowledged by the grateful nation. From that day onwards, the Sikh nation remembers these brave Sikhs in their daily ardas (prayer). Every year on 21 February at this Shaheedi Asthan, Guru Granth Sahib's Swaroop with Bullet marks is brought to Deewan (assembly) from 2pm to 4pm for darshan of the Sikh Sangat.\n\n\n"}

Jacobs (1898–1977) was the first and only commander of the Jewish Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nBorn in England to a Methodist family, he grew up in Hong Kong. He was a founder-member of the first Boy Scout Troop to be formed in the city. He later served with the Hong Kong Defence Force before moving in the early 1920s to Shanghai, where he was employed by the British-American Tobacco Company. In Shanghai he met a young Russian-Jewish girl, Dora Bogomolsky, whom he married after converting to Judaism.\n\nJacobs took over the 5th Shanghai (Jewish) Boy Scout Troop as Scoutmaster in 1923. Under his leadership, the troop flourished and was successfully competitive with the other Scout troops in Shanghai. In the summer of 1932, a group of young Jews in Shanghai, some of them former Scouts as well as members of the Shanghai branch of Betar, met at an obscure address on Bubbling Well Road to consider the possibility of forming a Jewish unit in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nIn September 1932, following hostilities with the Japanese, a Jewish platoon became a respected unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. It was commanded by Captain Noel S. Jacobs. The chaplain of the Jewish Company was Reverend Mendel Brown, who was the spiritual leader of the Sephardic community in Shanghai. The platoon expanded on 23 May 1933 to become the all-Jewish Hebrew Company under Jacob’s command. The majority of its members were Russian Jews. The Jewish Company wore on the uniform collar metal Magen David ornaments with the letters \"SVC\" superimposed. One of their undeclared aims was to acquire military experience for eventual participation in the fight for Jewish independence in Palestine.\n\nWhen the fighting in the Chinese section of Shanghai in 1937 threatened to spill over into the Settlement, the foreign units took up their assigned defensive positions, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was mobilized on 17 August, as was the Jewish Company, for a period of three months, taking up predesignated stations. For thus period of active service, 85 members of the Company were awarded the Municipal Council's Emergency medal.\n\nMajor Jacobs were interned until the end of the war. His wife and three daughters had earlier been evacuated to the United States. In 1949, Jacobs left China to return to England to continue working for the British-American Tobacco Company. He retired in 1956 and he and his family finally settled down in New Milton, England. In 1967, his former Scouts and members of the Jewish Company who had emigrated to Israel sponsored a trip to Israel for Noel and Dora Jacobs. Reportedly, it was an extremely emotional and happy reunion. He died in England in 1977 at the age of 79; his wife a few years later.\n\nTo honor their former Scoutmaster and Commander of the Jewish Company, volunteers and friends the world over sponsored a memorial forest in Mod-in, Israel, in his name. A stone marker was unveiled on 18 May 1980 in the presence of a group of these admirers, who had 3,500 trees planted to commemorate the life of Noel Jacobs.\n"}
{"id": "2451312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2451312", "title": "Padmanabhaswamy Temple", "text": "Padmanabhaswamy Temple\n\nPadmanabhaswamy Temple is located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the indigenous Kerala style and the Tamil style (kovil) of architecture associated with the temples located in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century Gopuram. While the \"Moolasthanam\" of the temple is the Ananthapuram Temple in Kumbala in Kasargod District, architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple located in Thiruvattar, Kanyakumari District.\n\nThe principal deity Vishnu is enshrined in the \"Anantha Shayanam\" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the serpent Adisheshan. Sree Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma is the trustee of the temple. In line with the Temple Entry Proclamation, only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code. The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to \"The City of Lord Ananta\", referring to the deity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple...\n\nSeveral extant Hindu Texts like the Brahma Purana, Matsya Purana, Varaha Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Vayu Purana, Bhagavata Purana and the Mahabharata mention this shrine. The Temple has been referred to in the (only recorded) Sangam Period of literature between 500 B.C and 300 A.D several times. Many conventional historians and scholars are of the opinion that one of the names that the Temple had - \"The Golden Temple\" - literally was in cognizance of the fact that the Temple was already unimaginably wealthy by that point. Many extant pieces of Sangam Tamil literature and poetry, and even the later works of Ninth Century Tamil poet-saints like Nammalwar, refer to the Temple and even the city as having walls of pure gold. At some places, both the Temple and the entire city are often eulogized even as being made of gold, and the Temple as Heaven.\n\nThe temple is one of the 108 principal Divya Desams (\"Holy Abodes\") in Vaishnavism, and is glorified in the \"Divya Prabandha\". The \"Divya Prabandha\" glorifies this shrine as being among the 13 Divya Desam in Malai Nadu (corresponding to present-day Kerala and some adjoining areas). The 8th century Tamil poet Alvar Nammalvar sang the glories of Padmanabha. The Ananthapuram Temple in Kasargod is believed to be the 'Moolasthanam' of the Temple.\n\nThe sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar, who resided near Ananthapuram Temple in Kasargod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his \"darshan\" or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy, who disappeared. After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of Arabian Sea, he heard a \"pulaya\" lady threatening her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake Anantha). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvallom, navel at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts – thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed. Koopakkara Potti was made the Tantri of the Temple. The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur Naduvil Madhom.\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with matrilineal customs, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the Ettuveetil Pillamar (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore. The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 ME (1731 AD). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of Travancore to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as \"Padmanabha Dasa\". Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\nIn the \"sanctum sanctorum\", Padmanabha reclines on the serpent \"Anantha \" or \"Adi Sesha\". The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation. The Lord's right hand is placed over a Shiva lingam. Sridevi-Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity and Bhudevi the Goddess of Earth, two consorts of Vishnu are by his side. Brahma emerges on a lotus, which emanates from the navel of the Lord. The deity is made from 12,008 saligramams. These saligrams are from the banks of the Gandaki River in Nepal, and to commemorate this certain rituals used to be performed at the Pashupatinath Temple. The deity of Padmanabha is covered with, \"Katusarkara yogam\", a special ayurvedic mix, which forms a plaster that keeps the deity clean. The daily worship is with flowers and for the abhishekam, special deities are used.\nThe platforms in front of the vimanam and where the deity rests are both carved out of a single massive stone and hence called \"Ottakkal-mandapam\". On the orders of Marthanda Varma (1706–58), the Ottakkal-mandapam was cut out of a rock at Thirumala, about north of the temple. It measured in area by thick and was placed in front of the deity in the month of Edavom 906 M.E. (1731 CE). At the same time, Marthanda Varma also brought 12,000 shaligrams, aniconic representations of Vishnu, from the Gandaki River, north of Benares (now known as Varanasi) to the temple. These were used in the reconsecration of the Padmanabha.\nIn order to perform darshan and puja, one has to ascend to the mandapam. The Deity is visible through three doors – the visage of the reclining Lord and Siva Linga underneath the hand is seen through the first door; Sridevi and Bhrigu Muni in Katusarkara, Brahma seated on a lotus emanating from the Lord's navel, hence the name, \"Padmanabha\", gold abhisheka moorthies of Lord Padmanabha, Sridevi and Bhudevi, and silver utsava moorthi of Padmanabha through the second door; the Lord's feet, and Bhudevi and Markandeya Muni in Katusarkara through the third door. The idols of two goddesses holding chamaram, Garuda, Narada, Tumburu, the divine forms of the six weapons of Lord Vishnu, Surya, Chandra, Saptarshi (Seven Sages), Madhu, and Kaitabha are also there in the Sanctum. Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the \"Ottakkal Mandapam\". It is traditionally held that anybody who prostrates on the mandapam has surrendered all that he possesses to the Deity. Since the ruler has already done that, he is permitted to prostrate on this mandapam.\n\nInside the Temple, there are two other important shrines, Thekkedom and Thiruvambadi, for the Deities, Ugra Narasimha and Krishna Swami respectively. Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of Arjuna. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On Ekadasi days the Lord is dressed and decorated as Mohini. There are also shrines for Rama accompanied by Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), Vyasa, Ganapati, Sasta, and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple). Grand idols of Garuda and Hanuman stand with folded hands in the Valiya balikkal area. The thevara idols of Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma and Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma are housed in the south east part of the Temple.\n\nThe foundation of the present gopuram was laid in 1566. The temple has a , 7-tier gopuram made in the Pandyan style. The temple stands by the side of a tank, named \"Padma Theertham\" (meaning the lotus spring). The temple has a corridor with 365 and one-quarter sculptured granite-stone pillars with elaborate carvings which stands out to be an ultimate testimonial for the Vishwakarma sthapathis in sculpting this architectural masterpiece. This corridor extends from the eastern side into the sanctum sanctorum. An flagstaff stands in front of the main entry from the \"prakaram\"(closed precincts of a temple). The ground floor under the gopuram (main entrance in the eastern side) is known as the 'Nataka Sala' where the famous temple art Kathakali was staged in the night during the ten-day \"uthsavam\" (festival) conducted twice a year, during the Malayalam months of Meenam and Thulam.\n\nThere are many festivals related to this temple. The major festivals are bi-annual. The \"Alpashy\" festival which is in October/November and the \"Panguni\" festival which is in Tamil month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the \"Aarat\" (holy bath) procession to the Shankumugham Beach. The word \"Aarat\" refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the \"Aarat\" procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed pujas. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the \"Navaratri\" festival. The idols of Saraswati Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai (Parasakti who appeared before Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of Anasuya) and Kumara Swami (Murugan) are brought to the \"Kuthira malika\" palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is \"laksha deepam\", which means hundred thousand (or one lakh) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three vedas is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next \"laksha deepam\" is slated in January 2020.\n\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from any one of the monasteries founded by the disciples of Adi Sankara in Thrissur do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami.\nOf these monasteries, Naduvil Madhom is the most important as Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar, the founder of this Temple, belonged to this monastery. Initially, Koopakkara Potties were the Tantries of the Temple. Later, Tantram was transferred to Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River. They are appointed by the Pushpanjali Swamiyar.\n\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the Ettara Yogam (King's Council of Eight) with the assistance of Ettuveetil Pillamar (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha. Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the Naduvil Madhom were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the Maharaja of Travancore. Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as \"Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi\" (Maharaja of Travancore) and \"Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi\" (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma, grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\nA pertinent event in the long recorded history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known. A major portion of those records (numbering around 30 lakhs of documents) from the Mathikalam, had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867, at the time of the formation of the latter. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-Tamil and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of the 30 lakh documents – three thousand bundles of records pertaining to the temple - each bundle consisting of over a thousand cadjan records – segregated under 70 \"heads\" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the Travancore Royal family. However, for the present, the Supreme Court of India has divested the Travancore Royal Family from leading the management of the temple. T P Sundararajan's litigations changed the way the world looked at the Temple.\n\nIn June 2011, the Supreme Court directed the authorities from the archaeology department and the fire services, to open the secret chambers of the temple for inspection of the items kept inside. The temple has six hitherto known vaults (Kallaras), labeled as A to F, for book keeping purpose by the Court (Since, however, an Amicus Curie Report by Justice Gopal Subramaniam, in April 2014, has reportedly found two more further subterranean vaults that have been named G and H). While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key. A detailed inventory of the temple assets, consisting of gold, jewels, and other valuables is yet to be made.\n\nWhile vault B remains unopened, vaults A, C, D, E and F were opened along with some of their antechambers. Among the reported findings, are a three-and-a-half feet tall solid pure golden idol of Mahavishnu, studded with hundreds of diamonds and rubies and other precious stones. Also found were an 18-foot-long pure gold chain, a gold sheaf weighing , a golden veil, 1200 'Sarappalli' gold coin-chains that are encrusted with precious stones, and several sacks filled with golden artifacts, necklaces, diadems, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, gemstones, and objects made of other precious metals. Ceremonial attire for adorning the deity in the form of 16-part gold anki weighing almost , gold coconut shells studded with rubies and emeralds, and several 18th century Napoleonic era coins were found amongst many other objects. In early 2012, an expert committee had been appointed to investigate these objects, which include lakhs of golden coins of the Roman Empire, that were found in Kottayam, in Kannur District. According to Vinod Rai, the former Comptroller-and-Auditor-General(CAG) of India, who had audited some of the Temple records from 1990, in August 2014, in the already opened vault A, there is an hoard of gold coins dating to around 200 B.C, each coin priced at over . Also found was a pure Golden Throne, studded with hundreds of diamonds and other fully precious stones, meant for the 18-foot-long Deity. According to varying reports, at least three, if not more, solid gold crowns have been found, studded with diamonds and other precious stones. Some other media reports also mention hundreds of pure gold chairs, thousands of gold pots and jars, among the articles recovered from Vault A and its antechambers.\n\nThis revelation has solidified the status of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple as the wealthiest place of worship in the world. It is conservatively estimated that the value of the monumental items is close to 1.2 lakh crore or . If the antique and cultural value were taken into account these assets could be worth ten times the current market price.\n\nThese estimates were on the basis of the revelations since July 2011, when five vaults were opened, with the at least one remaining vault (B), which is the largest, still closed. One of the oldest existing estimates regarding Vault B, which can be considered to be at least as reliable as any other made since the discovery of the hidden treasure (or assets) of the Temple in 2011, was by the Travancore Royal Family itself in the 1880s (when an older existing estimate was updated). According to it, the gold and precious stones contained in Vault B, which is by far the largest and the only vault (of the reported six) that is unopened so far, since the discovery of the treasure, were worth . Considering the subsequent inflation of the rupee, and the increase in the prices of gold and precious metals and precious stones since in general, the treasure in the unopened vault B alone, would be worth at least in present-day terms, without the cultural value being factored in. As a reference, the entire GDP (revenues in all forms) of the Mughal Empire at its very zenith under Aurangzeb (in 1690), was a comparatively meagre US$90 billion in modern-day terms. In fact, at its richest, the Mughal \"treasury\" (in Akbar's and Jahangir's and Shah Jahan's periods) consisted of seven tonnes of gold, along with eighty pounds of uncut diamonds, a hundred pounds each of rubies and emeralds and six hundred pounds of pearls. Also, in contrast, the wealthiest Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII, was worth a relatively minuscule (all his conceivable assets combined) in the 1940s, while his entire treasure of jewels, would be worth between US$150 Million and US$500 million variously in today's terms. The hitherto-uncovered treasure itself is worth millions of times that of the British crown jewels. Even with only the five smaller of the reported eight vaults being opened (the larger three vaults and all their ante-chambers still remaining closed), the treasure found so far, is considered to be by far the largest collection of items of gold and fully precious stones in the recorded history of the world.\n\nThe valuables are believed to have been accumulated in the temple over several thousand years, having been donated to the Deity (and subsequently stored there), by various Dynasties like the Cheras, the Pandyas, the Travancore Royal Family, the Kolathiris, the Pallavas, the Cholas and many other Kings in the recorded history of both South India and beyond, and from the rulers and traders of Mesopotamia, Jerusalem, Greece, Rome, and later, the various colonial powers from Europe, and other countries as well. Some people have suggested that a part of the stored riches reached the Travancore kings in the later years in the form of tax as well as conquered wealth of other South Indian kingdoms. Most scholars however believe that this was accumulated over thousands of years, given the mention of the Deity and the Temple in several extant Hindu Texts, the Sangam Tamil literature (500 BC to 300 AD wherein it was referred to as the \"Golden Temple\" on account of its then unimaginable wealth), and the treasures consist of countless artifacts dating back to the Chera, Pandya and Greek and Roman epochs. The ancient late-Tamil-Sangam epic Silappatikaram (c 100 AD to 300 AD at the latest) speaks of the then Chera King Cenkuttuvan receiving gifts of gold and precious stones from a certain 'Golden Temple' (Arituyil-Amardon) which is believed to be the Pasmanabhaswamy Temple. Gold had been panned from rivers as well as mined in Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, Wayanad, Mallappuram, Palakkad and Kollam districts for thousands of years. The Malabar region (as a part of the \"Tamilakam\" region of recorded history) had several centers of trade and commerce since the Sumerian Period ranging from Vizhinjam in the South to Mangalore in the North. Also, at times like the invasion by Tipu Sultan, the other then related royal families (of the Travancore Royal Family) in Kerala and the extreme Southern region (like the Kolathiris), took refuge in Thiruvananthapuram, and stored their temple-wealth for safekeeping in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Also, much of the treasures housed in the much larger and as-yet-unopened vaults, as well as in the much smaller cellars that have been opened, date back to long before the institution of the so-called Travancore Kingdom, e.g. the hoard of gold coins from 200 B.C that was mentioned by Vinod Rai. Noted archaeologist and historian R. Nagaswamy has also stated that several records exist in Kerala, of offerings made to the Deity, from several parts of Kerala. Lastly, it has to be remembered that in the Travancore Kingdom, a distinction was always made between the Government (State) Treasury (Karuvelam), the Royal Family Treasury (Chellam), and the Temple Treasury (Thiruvara Bhandaram or Sri Bhandaram). During the reign of Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, hundreds of temples that were mismanaged in the Kerala region, were brought under the Government. The excess ornaments in these temples were also transferred to the Vaults of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Instead the funds of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple were utilised for the daily upkeep of these temples.\n\nOn 4 July 2011 the seven-member expert team tasked with taking stock of the temple assets decided to postpone opening of Chamber 'B'. This chamber is sealed with an iron door with the image of a cobra on it and it has not been opened, due to the belief opening it would result in much misfortune. The royal family said that many legends were attached to the temple and that chamber B has a model of a snake on the main door and opening it could be a bad omen. The seven-member team will consult with some more experts on 8 July 2011 and then they may take the final decision on opening of chamber 'B'. An Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in the Temple to discern the will of the Lord revealed that any attempts to open Chamber 'B' would cause Divine displeasure and that the holy articles in the other chambers were defiled in the inventorying process. The original petitioner whose court action led to the inventory taking, T.P. Sundarajan, died in July 2011, adding credence to those who believe in the folklore around the temple. Prior to this now-famous incident in July 2011, one of the several vaults in the Temple which was not any of the Vaults B (untouched after the 1880s) or G or H (both rediscovered supposedly by the Amicus Curie only in mid-2014), was opened in 1931. This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe economic depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewelry encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds. Besides these, were four more chests of old coins (not of gold), and they were carried back to the Palace and State Treasuries for counting from.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana says that Lord Balarama visited Phalgunam (more commonly known as Thiruvananthapuram), took bath in Panchapsaras (Padmateertham) and made a gift of ten thousand cows to holy men. Though the sannidhyam of Lord Padmanabha has always been present in the holy land of Thiruvananthapuram making it a pilgrim spot even during the time of Balarama, the present-day Temple for the Lord came up later. The southwest part of the Chuttambalam was constructed at the holy spot where Lord Balarama is believed to have donated cows to holy men. This portion came to be known as Mahabharatakonam and covered the ground underneath which both Kallara B and Kallara A were situated.\n\nAccording to a popular legend, many Devas and Sages devoted to Lord Balarama visited Him on the banks of Padmateertham. They requested Him that they may be permitted to reside there worshipping the Lord. Balarama granted them their wish. It is believed that these Devas and Sages reside in Kallara B worshipping the Lord. Naga Devathas devoted to the Lord also dwell in this Kallara. Kanjirottu Yakshi, whose enchanting and ferocious forms are painted on the south-west part of the main Sanctum, resides in this Kallara worshipping Lord Narasimha. Holy objects like Sreechakram were installed beneath this Kallara to enhance the potency of the Principal Deity. Lord Ugra Narasimha of Thekkedom is said to be the Protector of Kallara B. There is a serpent's image on Kallara B indicating danger to anyone who opens it. A four-day Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in August 2011 declared Kallara B as \"forbidden zone\".\n\nIn 2011, the antechamber to Kallara B was opened by the Observers appointed by the Supreme Court of India. But the Observers could not open Kallara B. However, Gopal Subramanium in his report submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2014, recommended its opening after conducting another Devaprasnam. The two Pushpanjali Swamiyars are the highest spiritual dignitaries of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Naduvil Madhom sent letters to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee and the Executive Officer on February 8, 2016 expressing his strong opposition to the opening of Kallara B. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Munchira Madhom led a Ratha Yathra from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in May 2018 campaigning against opening the sacred Kallara. Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, the supreme spiritual leader of Kerala Brahmins, while addressing a meeting held in connection with the Ratha Yathra also demanded that faith should not be trampled upon by opening Kallara B.\n\nAccording to folklore, Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, Pallichal Pillai and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Kallara B was opened after the 1880s. An article by Emily Gilchrist, a visiting Englishwoman in the 1933, recalls in her book 'Travancore: A Guide Book for the Visitor' (Oxford University Press, 1933) about an unsuccessful attempt to open one Kallara in 1908: \"About 25 years ago, when the State needed additional money, it was thought expedient to open these chests and use the wealth they contained.\" \"A group of people\" got together and attempted to enter the vaults with torches. When they found the vaults \"infested with cobras\" they \"fled for their lives.\n\nAccording to a report by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India Vinod Rai, Kallara B has been opened a number of times in recent decades: twice in 1991 and five times in 2002. Once Vinod Rai's report was out, Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi clarified that Mr Rai was referring to the antechamber to Kallara B, which was opened even in 2011 by the Supreme Court-appointed observers.\n\nThe Kerala High Court ruled in 2011 that the state government should take over the control of the temple and its assets, but the Travancore royal family appealed to the Supreme Court. An independent report was commissioned, and was completed in November 2012, finding no evidence that the royal family were expropriating the treasures.\n\nAs of end-April 2016, vaults B, G, and H along with their several ante-chambers were yet to be opened; while inventorying of the items in vaults C, D, E, and F were completed (in August 2012) and formal inventorying of vault A had commenced. Several hundred pots and other items made of gold, that are used for daily rituals or intermittently for ceremonies in the Temple, were not inventoried as the Temple-priests expressed strong objections. Over 1.02 lakh 'articles' had been retrieved from Vault A and its ante-chambers, till that point, though only a small part of them had been inventoried then. An 'article' could be either an individual item, or collections of several items, examples of the latter being a cache of 1,95,000 'Rassappanams' (Gold coins) weighing 800 kg and sets of Navaratnas (collections of nine different kinds of diamonds). There are over 60,000 fully precious stones, set as parts of larger pieces of gold jewelery, amongst those items inventoried as of March 2013. The results of the inventory are not to be released until the completion of the whole process by order of the Supreme Court of India.\n\nIn April 2014, Amicus Curiae advocate Gopal Subramaniam filed a 577-page report to the Supreme court of India alleging malpractices in the administration of the temple. According to him, the authorities failed to perform their ethical duties by opening many bank accounts, trusts and also not filing Income Tax returns for the past ten years. He alleged that Vault B was opened despite a previous ruling of the Supreme court prohibiting the same.\n\nThe report states, \"The large amount of gold and silver, the discovery of which was a shock to the Amicus Curiae, is a singular instance of mismanagement. The presence of a gold plating machine is also yet another unexplained circumstance. This discovery raises a doubt of the organized extraction by persons belonging to the highest echelons. There appears to be resistance on the part of the entire State apparatus in effectively addressing the said issues. The lack of adequate investigation by the police is a telling sign that although Thiruvananthapuram is a city in the State of Kerala, parallelism based on monarchic rule appears to predominate the social psyche.\" The Supreme court bench comprising justice R. M. Lodha and justice A. K. Patnaik ordered a change in administration by forming a 5-member committee and appointing Vinod Rai as auditor. The committee will include Thiruvananthapuram District judge K. P. Indira, Thantri and Nambi of the temple and two members to be decided in consultation with the Government of Kerala. Additionally, IAS officer and former administrator of the temple, K. N. Satish was appointed as executive officer. The Government of Kerala agreed to comply with the Supreme court order. Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma remains the trustee of the temple and still does the ritual duties as the titular Maharaja of Travancore, but has no responsibility regarding the temple management after the interim ruling by the Supreme Court The report also found the existence of two more vaults that were never even made mention of or hitherto spoken about.\n\nThe report named them Vault 'G' and Vault 'H'. Like Vault 'B' and all its antechambers, both these vaults and their antechambers were yet to have been opened, as of May 2014. The report also mentions that Mr. Subramanian found several large trunks filled with artifacts made of precious metals and precious stones outside of the eight vaults and their antechambers.\n\nThe CBI and the Intelligence Bureau have red-flagged the appointment of Gopal Subramaniam as a Judge in the Supreme Court. The IB cites Mr Subramaniam's report on Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as one of the instances where he relied heavily on his spiritual instincts rather than rational logic and hard facts. In his second report on Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Mr Subramaniam himself reveals,\"It was his morning ritual of [shutting] his mind and seeking guidance, which resulted in discoveries in this direction.\"\n\nThe Amicus Curiae has also been accused of conducting poojas in the Temple in violation of its customs. He performed poojas at the Thevarappura in the Temple and in front of the Vedavyasa Shrine. Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a Sri Yantra can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25824", "title": "Religion and mythology", "text": "Religion and mythology\n\nMythology is the main component of Religion. It refers to systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the supernatural or sacred. Religion is the broader term, besides mythological system, it includes ritual. A given mythology is almost always associated with a certain religion such as Greek mythology with Ancient Greek religion. Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a legend or folktale. \n\nThere is a complex relationship between recital of myths and enactment of rituals.\n\nThe relationship between religion and myth depends on what definition of \"myth\" one uses. By Robert Graves's definition, a religion's traditional stories are \"myths\" if and only if one does not belong to the religion in question. By Segal's definition, all religious stories are myths—but simply because nearly all stories are myths. By the folklorists' definition, all myths are religious (or \"sacred\") stories, but not all religious stories are myths: religious stories that involve the creation of the world (e.g., the stories in the Book of Genesis) are myths; however, some religious stories that don't explain how things came to be in their present form (e.g., hagiographies of famous saints) are not myths. Generally, mythology is the main component of religion alongside ritual. For example, in the early modern period, distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of witch trials. \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\" provides the following summary and examples:Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers—narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics—and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems. […] It is difficult to believe that the Buddha was conceived in a dream by a white elephant, so we call that story a myth as well. But, of course, stories such as the parting of the Sea of Reeds for the fleeing Hebrews, Muhammad’s Night Journey, and the dead Jesus rising from the tomb are just as clearly irrational narratives to which a Hindu or a Buddhist might understandably apply the word “myth.” All of these stories are definable as myths because they contain events that contradict both our intellectual and physical experience of reality.\n\nMost definitions of \"myth\" limit myths to stories. Thus, non-narrative elements of religion, such as ritual, are not myths.\nThe term theology for the first time appears in the writings of the Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. Initially, theology and mythology were synonymous. With time, both terms gained distinctive qualities:\n\nIn the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of “believers” to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation—in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination.\n\nAccording to Hege, both primitive and modern theology is inescapably constrained by its mythical backbone:\n\nHermeneutically, theologians must recognize that mythical thought permeates the biblical texts. Dogmatically, theologians must be aware of the mythological elements of theology and of how extensively theology relies on mythical forms and functions, especially in light of our awareness of the ubiquity of myth.\n\"Religion\" is a belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or divine, and the moral codes, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief, although some scholars, such as Durkheim, would argue that the supernatural and the divine are not aspects of all religions. Religious beliefs and practices may include the following: a deity or higher being, eschatology, practices of worship, practices of ethics and politics. Some religions do not include all these features. For instance, belief in a deity is not essential to Buddhism.\n\nThe term \"mythology\" usually refers either to a system of myths or to the study of myths. However, the word \"myth\" itself has multiple (and some contradictory) definitions:\n\nIn regards to the study of culture and religion, these are some of the definitions scholars have used:\n\n\nGiven any of the above definitions of \"myth\", the myths of many religions, both ancient and modern, share common elements. Widespread similarities between religious mythologies include the following:\n\nThe similarities between cultures and time periods can be useful, but it is usually not easy to combine beliefs and histories from different groups. Simplification of cultures and time periods by eliminating detailed data remain vulnerable or flimsy in this area of research.\n\nThough there are similarities among most religious mythologies, there are also contrasts. Many mythologies focus on explanations of the universe, natural phenomena, or other themes of human existence, often ascribing agency to one or more deities or other supernatural forces. However, some religions have very few of this kind of story of cosmic explanation. For instance, the Buddhist parable of the arrow warns against such speculations as \"[Is] the world eternal or not eternal? [Is] the soul different from the body? [Does] the enlightened exist after death or not?\", viewing them as irrelevant to the goal of escaping suffering.\n\nIn academia, the term \"myth\" often refers to stories whose culture regards them as true (as opposed to fictitious). Thus, many scholars will call a body of stories \"mythology\", leaving open the question of whether the stories are true or false. For example, in \"Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism\", English professor Howard Schwartz writes, \"the definition of 'mythology' offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not\".\n\nSince the beginning of modern philosophy and science in the 16th century, many Western intellectuals have seen myth as outdated. In fact, some argued that the Christian religion would be better off without mythology, or even that Christianity would be better off without religion:\n[J. A. T.] Robinson argued in favor of \"the detaching of the Christian doctrine of God from any necessary dependence on a 'supernaturalistic' worldview\". He understood this as a prophetic aspect of the Church's ministry to the world. [...] At this time atheism was regarded as the Christian Gospel that should be preached to the world. J. J. Altizer, for example, maintained [this] boldly by stating, \"Throughout its history Christian theology has been thwarted from reaching its intrinsic goal by its bondage to a transcendent, a sovereign, and an impassive God\". [...] [Dietrich] Bonhoffer called persistently for \"Religionless Christianity\".\nIn the 20th century, many scholars have resisted this trend, defending myth from modern criticism. Mircea Eliade, a professor of the history of religions, declared that myth did not hold religion back, that myth was an essential foundation of religion, and that eliminating myth would eliminate a piece of the human psyche. Eliade approached myth sympathetically at a time when religious thinkers were trying to purge religion of its mythological elements:\nEliade wrote about \"sky and sky gods\" when Christian theology was shaken at its very foundations by the \"death of God\" theology. He spoke of \"God up there\" when theologians such as J. A. T. Robinson were busy with erasing the mythical language of [a] three-storied universe that underlies the early Christian thought and experience.\nSimilarly, Joseph Campbell believed that people could not understand their individual lives without mythology to aid them. By recalling the significance of old myths, he encouraged awareness of them. In responding to the interview question \"How would you define mythology?\", Joseph Campbell answered:\nMy favorite definition of mythology: other people's religion. My favorite definition of religion: misunderstanding of mythology.\n\nMost religions contain a body of traditional sacred stories that are believed to express profound truth. Some religious organizations and practitioners believe that some or all of their traditional stories are not only sacred and \"true\" but also historically accurate and divinely revealed and that calling such stories \"myths\" disrespects their special status. Other religious organizations and practitioners have no problem with categorizing their sacred stories as myths.\n\nSome religious believers take offense when what they consider to be historical aspects of their faith are labeled as \"myth\". Such believers distinguish between religious fables or myths, on one hand, and those sacred narratives which are described by their tradition as being history or revelation, on the other. For instance, Catholic priest Father John A. Hardon insists that \"Christianity is not mythology. What we believe in is not religious fantasies, no matter how pious.\" Evangelical Christian theologian Carl F. H. Henry insisted that \"Judeo-Christian revelation has nothing in common with the category of myth\".\n\nEspecially within Christianity, objection to the word \"myth\" rests on a historical basis. By the time of Christ, the Greco-Roman world had started to use the term \"myth\" (Greek \"muthos\") to mean \"fable, fiction, lie\"; as a result, the early Christian theologians used \"myth\" in this sense. Thus, the derogatory meaning of the word \"myth\" is the traditional Christian meaning, and the expression \"Christian mythology\", as used in academic discourse, may offend Christians for this reason.\n\nIn addition, this early Christian use of the term \"myth\" passed into popular usage. Thus, when essential sacred mysteries and teachings are described as \"myth\", in modern English, the word often still implies that it is \"idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood\". This description could be taken as a direct attack on religious belief, quite contrary to the meaning ostensibly intended by the academic use of the term. Further, in academic writing, though \"myth\" usually means a fundamental worldview story, even there it is occasionally ambiguous or clearly denotes \"falsehood\", as in the \"Christ myth theory\". The original term \"mythos\" (which has no pejorative connotation in English) may be a better word to distinguish the positive definition from the negative.\n\nModern day clergy and practitioners within some religious movements have no problem classifying the religion's sacred stories as \"myths\". They see the sacred texts as indeed containing religious truths, divinely inspired but delivered in the language of mankind. Some examples follow.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's love of myths and devout Catholic faith came together in his assertion that mythology is the divine echo of \"the Truth\". Tolkien wrote that myths held \"fundamental things\". He expressed these beliefs in his poem \"Mythopoeia\" circa 1931, which describes myth-making as an act of \"sub-creation\" within God's primary creation. The poem in part says creation is \"myth-woven and elf-patterned\":\n\nTolkien's opinion was adopted by another Christian writer, C. S. Lewis, in their conversations: \"Tolkien explained to Lewis that the story of Christ was the true myth at the very heart of history and at the very root of reality.\" C. S. Lewis freely called the Christ story a \"true myth\", and he believed that even pagan myths express spiritual truths. In his opinion, the difference between the Christ story and pagan myths is that the Christ story is historically as well as spiritually true. Lewis writes,\nThe story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths: i. e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call real things.\n\nAnother Christian writer, the Catholic priest Father Andrew Greeley, freely applies the term \"myth\" to Christianity. In his book \"Myths of Religion\", he defends this terminology:\nMany Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith.\n\nAt a \"Consultation on the Relationship Between the Wesleyan Tradition\nand the Natural Sciences\" in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 19, 1991, Dennis Bratcher presented a discussion of the adaptation of Near Eastern mythical thought by the Israelites. Bratcher argued that the Old Testament absorbed Near Eastern pagan mythology (although he drew a sharp distinction between the literally-interpreted myths of the Near Eastern pagans and the \"mythopoetic\" use of imagery from pagan myths by the Hebrews). During this presentation, he gave the following disclaimer:\nthe term \"myth\" as used here does not mean \"false\" or \"fiction.\" Even in my old and yellowed Webster's, \"fiction\" is the \"third\" meaning of the word. In its primary and more technical meaning \"myth\" refers to a story or group of stories that serve to explain how a particular society views their world.\n\nSome Jewish scholars, including Dov Noy, a professor of folklore at Hebrew University and founder of the Israel Folktale Archives, and Howard Schwartz, Jewish anthologist and English professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, have discussed traditional Jewish stories as \"mythology\".\n\nSchwarz authored the book \"Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism\". It consists of myths and belief statements excerpted from—and, in some cases, synthesized from a number of excerpts from—both Biblical and non-Biblical Jewish texts. According to Schwartz, the Jewish people continue to elaborate on, and compose additions to, their traditional mythology. In the book's introduction, Schwartz states that the word \"myth\", as used in the book, \"is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular usage\".\n\nNeopagans frequently refer to their sacred stories as \"myths\".

{"id": "910909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=910909", "title": "Russian Mennonite", "text": "Russian Mennonite\n\nThe Russian Mennonites (German: \"Russlandmennoniten\" occasionally Ukrainian Mennonites) are a group of Mennonites who are descendants of Dutch Anabaptists who settled for about 250 years in West Prussia and established colonies in the south west of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) beginning in 1789. Since the late 19th century, many of them have come to countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. The rest were forcibly relocated, so that very few of their descendants now live at the location of the original colonies. Russian Mennonites are traditionally multilingual with Plautdietsch (Mennonite Low German) as their first language and lingua franca. The term \"Russian Mennonite\" refers to the country where they resided before their immigration to the Americas and not to their ethnic heritage. In 2014 there are several hundred thousand Russian Mennonites: about 200,000 in Germany, 100,000 in Mexico, 70,000 in Bolivia, 40,000 in Paraguay, 10,000 in Belize and tens of thousands in Canada and the US and a few thousand in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.\n\nIn the early-to-mid 16th century, Mennonites began to flee to the Vistula delta region in order to avoid persecution in the Low Countries, especially Friesland and Flanders, seeking religious freedom and exemption from military service. They gradually replaced their Dutch and Frisian languages with the Plautdietsch dialect spoken in the area, blending into it elements of their native tongues. Today Plautdietsch is the distinct Mennonite language which developed over a period of 300 years in the Vistula delta region and south Russia. The Mennonites of Dutch origin were joined by Mennonites from other parts of Europe, including the German-speaking parts of what is now Switzerland. Some Poles also became Mennonites and were assimilated into the Vistula delta Mennonites.\n\nIn 1772, most of the West-Prussian Mennonites' land in the Vistula area became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in the first of the Partitions of Poland. Frederick William II of Prussia ascended the throne in 1786 and imposed heavy fees on the Mennonites in exchange for continued military exemption.\n\nCatherine the Great of Russia issued a manifesto in 1763 inviting all Europeans to come and settle various pieces of land within New Russia, especially in the Volga River region. For a variety of reasons, Germans responded to this in large numbers. Mennonites from the Vistula delta region of Prussia later sent delegates to negotiate an extension of this manifesto and, in 1789, Crown Prince Paul signed a new agreement with them. The Mennonite migration to Russia from Prussia was led by Jacob Hoeppner and Johann Bartsch. Their settlement territory was northwest of the Sea of Azov, and had just been acquired from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War, 1768–1774. Many of the Mennonites in Prussia accepted this invitation, establishing Chortitza on the Dnieper River as their first colony in 1789. A second larger colony, Molotschna, was founded in 1803.\n\nMennonites lived alongside Nogais—semi-nomadic pastoralists—in the Molochna region of southern Ukraine starting from 1803, when Mennonites first arrived, until 1860, when the Nogai Tatars departed. Mennonites provided agricultural jobs to Nogais and rented pasture from them. Nogai raids on Mennonite herds were a constant problem in the first two decades of settlement.\n\nTwo Mennonite settlements on the Vistula near Warsaw, Deutsch-Kazun and Deutsch-Wymysle, came under Russian control when the border was readjusted at the Congress of Vienna. Some of these families emigrated to the Molotschna settlement after it was established. Deutsch-Michalin near Machnovka was founded in 1787. Many families from this settlement moved to nearby Volhynia in 1802. Swiss Mennonites of Amish descent from Galicia settled near Dubno, Volhynia province in 1815. Other Galician Mennonites lived near Lviv.\n\nWhen the Prussian government eliminated exemption from military service on religious grounds, the remaining Mennonites were eager to emigrate to Russia. They were offered land along the Volga River in Samara and exemption from military service for twenty years, after which they could pay a special exemption tax. Two settlements, Trakt and Alt-Samara (to distinguish it from Neu Samara Colony), were founded in 1853 and 1861 respectively.\n\nBy 1870 about 9000 individuals had immigrated to Russia, mostly to the Chortitza and Molotschna settlements which, with population increase, numbered about 45,000. Forty daughter colonies were established by 1914, occupying nearly , with a total population of 100,000.\n\nThe colonists formed villages of fifteen to thirty families, each with 70 ha (175 acres) of land. The settlements retained some communal land and a common granary for use by the poor in lean years. Income from communal property provided funding for large projects, such as forming daughter colonies for the growing population. Insurance was also organized separately and outside of the control of the Russian government.\n\nInitially the settlers raised cattle, sheep and general crops to provide for their household. The barren steppes were much drier than their Vistula delta homeland and it took years to work out the proper dry-land farming practices. They grew mulberries for the silk industry, produced honey, flax and tobacco, and marketed fruits and vegetables for city markets. By the 1830s wheat became the dominant crop.\n\nExpanding population and the associated pressure for more farmland became a problem by 1860. The terms of the settlement agreement prevented farms from being divided; they were required to pass intact from one generation to the next. Since agriculture was the main economic activity, an expanding class of discontented, landless poor arose. Their problems tended to be ignored by the village assembly, which consisted of voting landowners. By the early 1860s the problem became so acute that the landless organized a party that petitioned the Russian government for relief. A combination of factors relieved their plight. The Russian government permitted farms to be divided in half or quarters and ordered release of the village's communal land. The colonies themselves purchased land and formed daughter colonies on the eastern frontier extending into Siberia and Turkestan. These new colonies included Bergtal, Neu Samara Colony and the Mennonite settlements of Altai.\n\nAs wheat farming expanded, the demand for mills and farm equipment grew. The first large foundry was established in Chortitza in 1860 and other firms followed. By 1911 the eight largest Mennonite-owned factories produced 6% of the total Russian output (over 3 million rubles), shipped machinery to all parts of the empire and employed 1744 workers. The annual output of \"Lepp and Wallman\" of Schönwiese was 50,000 mowers, 3000 threshing machines, thousands of gangplows in addition to other farm equipment. Flour and feed mills were originally wind-powered, a skill transplanted from Prussia. These were eventually replaced with motor- and steam-driven mills. Milling and its supporting industries grew to dominate the industrial economy of the colonies and nearby communities.\n\nMennonite colonies were self-governing with little intervention from the Russian authorities. The village, the basic unit of government, was headed by an elected magistrate who oversaw village affairs. Each village controlled its own school, roads and cared for the poor. Male landowners decided local matters at village assemblies.\n\nVillages were grouped into districts. All of the Chortitza villages formed one district; Molotschna was divided into two districts: Halbstadt and Gnadenfeld. A district superintendent headed a regional bureau that could administer corporal punishment and handle other matters affecting the villages in common. Insurance and fire protection were handled at the regional level, as well as dealing with delinquents and other social problems. The Mennonite colonies functioned as a democratic state, enjoying freedoms beyond those of ordinary Russian peasants.\n\nIn addition to village schools, the Mennonite colonies established their own hospitals, a mental hospital and a school for the deaf. They cared for orphans and elderly and provided an insurance program. By being largely self-sufficient in these local matters, they were able to minimize their burden on and contact with the Russian government.\n\nMennonites stayed out of Russian politics and social movements that preceded the Russian revolution. After the Russian Revolution of 1905 they did exercise their right to vote. Most aligned themselves with the Octobrist Party because of its guarantee of religious freedoms and freedom of the press for minority groups. Hermann Bergmann was an Octobrist member of the Third and Fourth State Dumas; Peter Schröder, a Constitutional Democratic party member from Crimea, was a member of the fourth Duma.\n\nAt a time when compulsory education was unknown in Europe, the Mennonite colonies formed an elementary school in each village. Students learned practical skills such as reading and writing German and arithmetic. Religion was included as was singing in many schools. The teacher was typically a craftsperson or herder, untrained in teaching, who fit class time around his occupation.\n\nIn 1820 the Molotschna colony started a secondary school at Ohrloff, bringing a trained teacher from Prussia. The Central School was started in Chortitza in 1842. Over three thousand pupils attended the Central School with up to 8% of the colonists receiving a secondary education. A school of commerce was started in Halbstadt employing a faculty with full graduate education. Those who wanted to pursue post-secondary education attended universities in Switzerland, Germany as well as Russia.\n\nTypically each village or group of villages organized an independent congregation. Cultural and traditional differences between Frisian, Flemish and West Prussian Mennonites were also reflected in those of their churches. They all agreed on fundamental Mennonite beliefs such as believer's baptism, nonresistance and avoidance of oaths. Pastors of Flemish congregations read sermons from a book while seated at a table. Frisian pastors stood while delivering the sermon.\n\nPastors were untrained and chosen from within the congregation. Unpaid pastors were selected from among the wealthier members—large landowners, sometimes teachers—allowing them to make a living while serving the congregation. The combined effect of respect for their position and material wealth gave them substantial influence over the community. The religious and secular leadership within a village often colluded against the poorer members.\n\nChurch discipline was exercised in the form of excommunication against those committing gross sins. The most conservative congregations practiced \"avoidance\", which entailed cutting all business and social ties with an unrepentant member. Because being part of a Mennonite congregation was required to enjoy the special benefits the Russian government provided to colonists, excommunication had broader implications. This was softened by the various internal factions, which allowed a person banned from one congregation to join another.\n\nKlaas Reimer and a group of eighteen followers broke from the main group and formed the Kleine Gemeinde. Reimer's main complaint was that Mennonite leaders were straying from their traditional nonresistant stance when they turned lawbreakers over to the government for punishment while at the same time church leaders were lax in enforcing spiritual discipline. In 1860 a portion of this group moved to Crimea, adopted baptism by immersion and became known as the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren.\n\nPietistic influences, introduced earlier among the West Prussian Mennonites, were transplanted to the Molotschna colony. The pastor of a neighboring congregation, Eduard Wüst, reinforced this pietism. Wüst was a revivalist who stressed repentance and Christ as a personal savior, influencing Catholics, Lutherans and Mennonites in the area. He associated with many Mennonite leaders, including Leonhard Sudermann.\n\nIn 1859, Joseph Höttmann, a former associate of Wüst met with a group of Mennonites to discuss problems within the main Mennonite body. Their discussion centered on participating in closed communion with church members who were unholy or not converted and baptism of adults by immersion.\n\nThe Mennonite Brethren Church formally broke with the main church on January 6, 1860 when this growing group of dissenters presented a document to the elders of the Molotschna Mennonite Churches which indicated \"that the total Mennonite brotherhood has decayed to the extent that we can no more be part of it\" and fear the \"approach of an unavoidable judgment of God.\" The Mennonite Brethren movement spread throughout the Mennonite colonies and produced many distinguished leaders, particularly in Molotschna. By breaking religious and cultural patterns that had become a hindrance to Mennonite society, the contribution of the Mennonite Brethren allowed all Mennonites groups to pursue a more wholesome Christian life.\n\nThe main body of Mennonites continued to be congregational in organization until 1882 when the \"General Conference of Mennonite Congregations in Russia\" was formed. Cooperation among Mennonite congregations throughout the empire became necessary for dealing with common interests such as publishing a hymnal, adopting a confession of faith, preserving the German language, education and running the forestry service, an alternative to military service. The conference adopted the motto \"Unity in essentials, tolerance in non-essentials, moderation in all things\".\n\nThe Russianization program of Stolypin required the conference to publish its proceedings in Russian, certify all delegates with the imperial government and allow a government representative to attend all sessions. The conference found itself devoting more time to dealing with changing government policies and protecting the special privileges of Mennonites. An important task was to convince the government that Mennonitism was an established religion and not a \"sect\", a label applied to small religious groups who were regularly mistreated within the Russian empire.\n\nAs nationalism grew in central Europe, the Russian government could no longer justify the special status of its German colonists. In 1870 they announced a Russification plan that would end all special privileges by 1880. Mennonites were particularly alarmed at the possibility of losing their exemption from military service and their right for schools to use the German language, which they believed was necessary to maintain their cultural and religious life.\n\nDelegates were sent to Petersburg in 1871 to meet with the czar and appeal for relief on religious grounds. They met with high officials, but failed to present the czar with their petition. A similar attempt the next year was also unsuccessful, but were assured by the Tsar's brother Grand Duke Konstantin that the new law would provide a way to address the concerns of the Mennonites in the form of noncombatant military service.\n\nThe most conscientious Mennonites could not accept any form of service that supported making war, prompting their community leaders to seek immigration options. In 1873 a delegation of twelve explored North America, seeking large tracts of fertile farmland. This group consisted of Leonhard Sudermann and Jacob Buller of the Alexanderwohl congregation representing the Molotschna settlement; Tobias Unruh from Volhynia settlements; Andreas Schrag of the Swiss Volhynia congregations; Heinrich Wiebe, Jacob Peters and Cornelius Buhr from the Bergthal Colony; William Ewert from West Prussia; Cornelius Toews and David Klassen of the \"Kleine Gemeinde\" and Paul and Lorenz Tschetter representing the Hutterites. This group returned with positive reports of good land available in Manitoba, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.\n\nThe more conservative groups—those from \"Kleine Gemeinde\", Bergthal and Chortitza—chose Canada, which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia and a large tract of land to reestablish colonies in Manitoba. The more liberal groups—those from Molotschna—and the Hutterites chose the United States. Entire communities such as Alexanderwohl and Bergtal prepared to move as a unit as well as many individual families from among the other Mennonite villages. They sold their property, often at reduced prices and worked through the red tape and high fees of procuring passports.\n\nRealizing that 40,000 of Russia's most industrious farmers were preparing to leave for North America, the Russian government sent Eduard Totleben to the colonies in May 1874. Meeting with community leaders, he exaggerated the difficulties that would be encountered in North America and offered an alternative national service that would not be connected in any way to the military. His intervention convinced the more liberal Mennonites to stay.\n\nBetween 1874 and 1880, of the approximately 45,000 Mennonites in South Russia, ten thousand departed for the United States and eight thousand for Manitoba. The settlement of Mennonites, primarily in the central United States, where available cropland had similarity to that in the Crimean Peninsula, coincided with the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Others looked east, and in one of the strangest chapters of Mennonite history, Claas Epp, Jr., Abraham Peters and other leaders led hundreds of Mennonites to Central Asia in the 1880s, where they expected Christ's imminent return. They settled in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and in the Khanate of Khiva. For those who remained in Russia, the military service question was resolved by 1880 with a substitute four-year forestry service program for men of military age.\n\nDuring the period of the 'Great War', the Mennonites in Russia were well advanced socially and economically. Many large agricultural estates and business entities were controlled by Mennonite interests. They had a reputation for outstanding efficiency and quality and were noted across Russia for their agricultural and organizational abilities. The precedent of non-resistant national service had been established years before and the Mennonites therefore had a system to handle military service requests at the outbreak of war. During World War I, 5000 Mennonite men served in both forestry and hospital units and transported wounded from the battlefield to Moscow and Ekaterinoslav hospitals. The Mennonite congregations were responsible for funding these forms of alternative service, as well as supporting the men's families during their absence, a burden of 3.5 million rubles annually. During this time there was a progressive breakdown in the autonomy of the Mennonite colonies and social and financial pressure began to take their effect on the Mennonite people and their institutions. Property and possessions began to be confiscated for the war effort and certain industrial complexes turned to military production (some voluntary). Much of the Mennonite hope at that time was based on the preservation of the existing Russian Provisional Government. However, as the war progressed, the social tide turned against the existing power structure and Russia began a march toward structural discord.\n\nThe chaos that followed the collapse of the Russian Provisional Government was devastating to much of Ukraine, including the Mennonite colonies. The Red and White armies moved through the region, confiscating food and livestock. Nestor Makhno's anarchist army generally targeted Mennonites because they were thought of as \"Kulaks\" and an entity generally more advanced and wealthy than the surrounding Ukrainian peasants. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the period of revolution. It is also rumored that Makhno himself had served on a Mennonite estate in childhood and harbored negative feelings based on treatment he received while employed there. Hundreds of Mennonites were murdered, robbed, imprisoned and raped during this period, and villages including (and around) Chortitza, Zagradovka and Nikolaipol were damaged and destroyed. Many more lives were lost to typhus, cholera and sexually transmitted diseases, spread by the armies warring throughout the colonies.\n\nBased on the tragedy unfolding around them, some of the avowed pacifist Mennonites turned to self-defense and established militia units (Selbstschutz) to ward off raiding forces with the help of the German Army. While generally regarded as a failure of spiritual commitment by many within the community (currently and at the time), the forces initially achieved some military success in defending Mennonite colonies and families while the communities tried to escape and/or relocate. Ultimately the self-defence militia was overwhelmed once Makhno's anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army early in 1919. While the resistance certainly helped defend Mennonite communities against initial attacks, it may also have served to inflame some of the atrocities that followed. After this period, many Mennonites were dispossessed and ultimately their remaining properties and possessions were nationalized (collectivization) by the Soviet authorities.\n\nMennonites of Molotschna sent a commission to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions of war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form Mennonite Central Committee in an effort to coordinate aid.\n\nThe new organization planned to provide aid to Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in Istanbul. The Istanbul group, mainly Goshen College graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing Russian Civil War. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt in the Molotschna settlement just as General Wrangel of the White Army was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while Clayton Kratz, who remained in Halbstadt as it was overrun by the Red Army, was never heard from again.\n\nA year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine (see Russian famine of 1921). Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty Fordson tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. The cost of this relief effort was $1.2 million.\n\nAs conditions improved, Mennonites turned their attention from survival to emigration. Though the New Economic Policy appeared to be less radical than previous Soviet reforms, thousands of Mennonites saw no future under the communists. After years of negotiation with foreign governments and Moscow, arrangements were made for emigration to Canada, Paraguay and Argentina. Because Canada had not recognized the Soviet government, Moscow would not deal with them directly. Emigrants bound for Canada were processed through Riga. Those who could not pass the medical exam—usually because of trachoma—were allowed to stay in Germany and Southampton in England until they were healthy. By 1930, twenty-one thousand Mennonites had arrived in Canada, most on credit provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nA group of Mennonites from western Siberia who subsequently settled along the Amur in unrealized hopes of better living conditions, escaped over the frozen river to Harbin, China. A few hundred were allowed entry into California and Washington. The majority remained as refugees until the Nansen International Office for Refugees of the League of Nations intervened and arranged resettlement in Paraguay and Brazil in 1932.\n\nThose that remained in their home villages were subject to exile to Siberia and other remote regions east of the Urals. From 1929 to 1940, one in eight men were removed, usually under the pretext of political accusations, to labor camps from which few ever returned or were heard from again.\n\nWith the onset of economic and agricultural reforms, large estates and the communal land of the Mennonite colonies were confiscated. The next step was to reduce the model farms by 60% and then another 50% percent—an insufficient size to support a family. The confiscated land was given to peasants from outside the Mennonite communities, often communist party members. These new villagers soon controlled the local government, further confiscating land and rights from the Mennonite majority by labeling landowners and leaders kulaks and sending them into exile. The government taxed the remaining landowners so heavily that they could not possibly produce enough to meet the obligation and their land was confiscated as payment. As collectivization proceeded, there was some hope that Mennonites could run their own collective farms, but with the introduction of Stalin's first five-year plan there was no hope that such a scheme would be allowed.\n\nStarting in 1918 religious freedoms were restricted. Churches and congregations had to be registered with the government. Ministers were disenfranchised and lost their rights as citizens. Ministers could not be teachers, which was the livelihood of many Mennonite pastors. They and their family members could not join cooperatives or craft guilds. Because of these restrictions, ministers had a strong incentive to emigrate, and few were willing to replace them. Congregations could no longer do charitable work of any kind, which destroyed the well developed social institutions with the Mennonite colonies. Villages lost control of their schools; all religious content was prohibited. Sunday was abolished as a holiday.\n\nDuring World War I the Russians had permitted Mennonites to serve in non-combat capacities in the military. This practice was not continued.\n\nFollowing the Russian withdrawal from World War I, the Russian Civil War ensued, with an ultimate Red victory. The Russian Mennonites, many of whom were also known as being part of the one million or so Volga Germans living in their own established communities, were approached by the Soviet authorities and issued new standards and expectations. Education was to be controlled according to these new directives by the State, and families were eventually to be separated, with children sent to various live-in schools, while parents were to be assigned according to State needs.\n\nThese directives were described by a Volga German teacher, Henry Wieler, who attended these State meetings and related the events in his detailed Journal, Tagabook, which today is partially translated but available in the published book, The Quiet in the Land, by Henry Wieler.\n\nIn 1937 and 1938 the NKVD carried out ethnically motivated purges of German descendants and German language speakers, including Mennonites. As Stalin fomented cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church in World War II, Mennonites and Protestants were seen as more dangerous. During the Holodomor in Ukraine, there was active persecution of German-speaking people as a potential threat to the state, and a ban on organized religion. The hostilities of World War I had increased tensions with ethnic Ukrainians, and Mennonites with family members living abroad were targeted during the Great Purge. Having suffered persecution by the Stalinist regime, many Mennonites came to identify with Adolf Hitler, who opposed Stalin, and subscribed to conspiracy theories blaming the Jews for Communist crimes. As pacifists within an increasingly military regime under Stalin and then (after invasion of Ukraine and parts of Russia by Hitler) the Nazis, and as \"Volga Germans\" whose abuse Hitler had used as pretense to invade, Mennonites were subject to special pressure to join military units. Mennonites played a central role in exploiting slave labor at Stutthof concentration camp, and some, recruited into SS units, served as guards at concentration camps or perpetrated massacres.\n\nOther Mennonites were conscripted by force into German units as support and shock troops and some participated in exterminating or deporting families. Most history of this period is anecdotal and based on family memoirs and letters from the Gulags. Peter Letkemann of University of Winnipeg characterizes the casualties and abuses of this period as \"victims of terror and repression in the Soviet Union during the 40-year period from 1917-1956.\" This would overlap somewhat with the \"Siberian Germans\" deported to that region who have lost touch entirely with the Mennonite mainstream worldwide.\n\nAfter 1870 about 18,000 Russian Mennonites, fearing conscription into military service and state influence on their education systems, emigrated to the Plains States of the US and the Western Provinces of Canada. The more liberal went in general to the US where the majority over a period of several decades assimilated more or less into the mainstream society.\nRussian Mennonites settled much of South Central Kansas, which owes its reputation as a wheat-producing state in large measure to its early Mennonite settlers. Winter wheat was introduced to Kansas in 1873. The following year the Mennonites, who had experience with dry land farming in Russia, quickly took advantage of its characteristics, resulting in rapid expansion of the milling industry in the state. It is planted in the fall and harvested in June and July of the following summer, and is therefore ideally suited to cold winters and the hot, dry Kansas summers. Kansas remains a top producer of wheat in America to this day.\n\nThe more conservative Old Colony and Bergthal Mennonites went to Canada which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia (no conscription into military service and German language private schools) and a large tract of land divided into two \"Reserves\". The Mennonites settled mostly in Manitoba in areas east and west of the Red River, called East Reserve and West Reserve. \n\nThey brought with them many of their institutions and practices, especially their traditional settling pattern which meant that they settled in vast exclusively Mennonite areas where they formed villages with German names such as Blumenort, Steinbach and Grünthal.\n\nThe more conservative faction of the Manitoba Mennonites decided to leave Canada after the World War I and moved to Mexico mostly in the years 1922-1927 and to Paraguay in 1927. The main reason for that was compulsory attendance of public schools and anti-German sentiments because of the war. Some latercomer went to Mexico in 1948. After the more conservative fraction had left for Mexico, most the remaining Mennonites quickly assimilated into the mainstream society. \n\nDescendants of Manitoba Mennonites today form the majority of Conservative Mennonites in Latin America, counting more than 200,000. Because many of these Mennonites from Canada still hold Canadian passports, there was and still is a steady flow back to Canada fed by the high birth rates of conservative Mennonites. These emigrants strengthen the Russian Mennonite element in the Canadian Mennonite churches.\n\nWith the Russian Mennonites came separate denominations previously unseen in North America, such as the Mennonite Brethren.\n\nA second wave of Russian Mennonites came out of Russia after the bloody strife following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and a third wave in the aftermath of World War I. These people, having lost everything they had known, found their way to settlements in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia and Ontario and in many regions of the United States. Some joined with previous Mennonite groups, while others formed their own.\n\nThe emigration from Canada to Mexico and Paraguay in the 1920s was a reaction to the introduction of universal, secular compulsory education in 1917 requiring the use of the English language, which the more conservative Mennonites saw as a threat to the religious basis of their community.\n\nThe first colony in a Latin American country was established by Mennonites from Canada between 1922 and 1925 in Mexico in the state of Chihuahua near the city of Cuauhtémoc. The next country was Paraguay, where Menno Colony was formed 1927 by Mennonites from Canada, whereas Fernheim and Friesland Colonies were formed in the 1930s by Mennonites from the Soviet Union who were fleeing starvation (Holodomor), persecution of religion and Collectivization under Stalin. Neuland and Volendam Colonies were founded 1947 by Mennonites who fled the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. All other Mennonite colonies in Latin America were formed by Mennonites who settled in North America since 1870, partly via Mexico and Belize.\n\nBeginning in 1954 conservative Mennonites settled in East-Bolivia, in the Santa Cruz Department. Bolivia soon became the refuge for Mennonites who wanted to flee the influences of modern society. In 2006 there were 41 Mennonite colonies in Bolivia. Old Colony Mennonites went from Mexico to Belize in 1959 and to Argentina in 1986.\n\n\nA distinguished writer and historian about the Russian Mennonites in Latin America, especially in Paraguay, is Peter P. Klassen.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a descendant of Hasan ibn Ali through his father and a descendant of Husain ibn Ali through his mother. It is said that he met the twelfth Shiite imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi (869-present), who according to Shiites is living in occultation.\nHe is known for his library and his numerous works which are still available in their original form and help us learn about the interests of Muslim scholars at the end of the Abbasid era.\n\nIbn Tawus was born on 15 Muharram 589 (21 January 1193) in Hilla and was named Tawus (peacock). One of his forefathers was a handsome man with ugly legs so his progeny too inherited the title from him. During his first 14 years of his life he was brought up and taught under many teachers including his father and grandfather. Later on he married Zahra Khatoon the daughter of the Shia Vazir of Nâsir bin Zaidi and settled in Baghdad. Ibn Tawus apparently had good relations with the Caliphs of his time like Muntansir, however he refused to be involved in any political affairs. There is not exact information about his family and number of his children. His children were known by the name of their mother. It is said that he had returned to Hilla in 641 and had gone to Najaf in 645 and then to Karbala in 649 and to Samarra in 652 and on reaching Baghdad he stayed there until Mongols captured the city.\n\nWhen Hulagu Khan conquered Baghdad, he asked the Scholars of the city : \"Who is better, a tyrant Muslim ruler or a Kafir(infidel) judicious ruler?\" None gave a response to this question but Ibn Tawus who said: \"A Kâfir judicious is better.\" And the other scholars followed him in this reply. A reply that saved the life of many people in the city. Afterwards Hulagu Khan let Ibn Tawus to return to Hilla. However, Hulagu Khan gave the leadership of Alawites and then some cities like Baghdad to him which Ibn Tawus was reluctant to accept. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi advised him to save his life by accepting it and he did so.\n\nIbn Tawus inherited a big library and he himself wrote numerous books on different topics from theology and ethics to jurisprudence and astronomy some of which have been translated into Persian, Urdu and English.

In the sociology of religion, the most widely used classification is the church-sect typology. The typology states that churches, ecclesia, denominations and sects form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are break-away groups from more mainstream religions and tend to be in tension with society.\n\nCults and new religious movements fall outside this continuum and in contrast to aforementioned groups often have a novel teaching. They have been classified on their attitude towards society and the level of involvement of their adherents.\n\nThis church-sect typology has its origins in the work of Max Weber. The basic premise is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of \"sects\" to the equilibrium maintaining \"churches\". Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn.\n\nMany labels are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably. Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics.\n\nThese differing religions are often classified by sociologists as \"ideal types\". Ideal types are \"pure\" examples of the categories. Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually holds as their \"ideal type\" categorisation will vary. Nevertheless, the categorisation scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions.\n\nJohnstone provides the following seven characteristics of churches:\n\nThe classical example of a \"church\" by this definition is the Catholic Church, especially in the past, such as the State church of the Roman Empire. Today, the Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of religious pluralism, or competition among religions. This is especially true of Catholicism in the United States. The change from a \"church\" to a \"denomination\" is still under way in many Latin American countries where the majority of citizens remain Catholics.\n\nIslam is a church in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, where there is no separation of church and state. The Basic Law of Saudi Arabia states: \"[The Constitution of Saudi Arabia is] God's Book [the Qur'an] and the Sunnah of His Prophet [Muhammad]\". These nations are ruled under an official interpretation of religious law (\"Salafi\" in the case of Saudi Arabia), and the religious law predominates the legal system. Saudi Arabia, however, lacks Johnstone's criteria for an ordained clergy and a strictly hierarchical structure, although it has the \"ulema\". In the Shi'a denominations, there is a professional clergy led by a Grand Ayatollah.\n\nA slight modification of the \"church\" type is that of \"ecclesia\". Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body. The state churches of some European nations would fit this type.\n\nThe \"denomination\" lies between the church and the sect on the continuum. Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society. A denomination is one religion among many. When churches or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations:\n\nMost of the major Christian bodies formed post-reformation are denominations by this definition (e.g., Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Seventh-day Adventists).\n\nSociologically, a \"sect\" is defined as a newly formed religious group that formed to protest elements of its parent religion (generally a denomination). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they often decry liberal trends in denominational development and advocate a return to so-called \"true\" religion.\n\nLeaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio-economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not yet entirely understood. Most scholars believe that when sect formation involves social class distinctions, they reflect an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status. An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth).\n\nAfter their formation, sects can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination. If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve. If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior. The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects. The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an \"institutionalized sect\" can result. Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development. They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics. Examples include: Hutterites, Iglesia ni Cristo, and the Amish.\n\nMost of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of Lutheranism and Anglicanism). Examples include: Methodists, Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists.\n\nAn example of an institutionalized sect that did not become a denomination are the Mennonites. \n\nThe concept of \"cult\" has lagged behind in the refinement of the terms that are used in analyzing the other forms of religious origination. Bruce Campbell discusses Troeltsch's concept in defining cults as non-traditional religious groups that are based on belief in a divine element within the individual. He gives three ideal types of cults:\n\n\nHe also gives six groups in the applications of analysis: Theosophy, Wisdom of the Soul, Spiritualism, New Thought, Scientology, and Transcendental Meditation.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, there have been a number of works that help in clarifying what is involved in cults. There are several scholars of this subject, such as Joseph Campbell and Bruce Campbell, who have noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a divine element in the individual. It is either Soul, Self, or True Self. Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized. There is a major theme in many of the recent works that show the relationship between cults and mysticism. Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention. One is mystical and the other is instrumental. This can divide the cults into being either occults or metaphysical assemblies.\n\nOn the basis that Campbell proposes about cults, they are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual. Other than the two main types, there is also a third type. This is service-oriented. Campbell states that \"the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders.\" \n\nBy sociological typology, \"cults\" are, like sects, new religious groups. But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group, though this is by no means always the case. The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they are not advocating a return to \"pure\" religion but rather the embracing of something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scriptures or new prophecy). Cults are also much more likely to be led by charismatic leaders than are other religious groups and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult.\n\nCults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies synthesized from many sources. Cults tend to emphasize the individual and individual peace.\n\nCults, like sects, can develop into denominations. As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations. Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics. But given their closer semblance to denominations than to the \"cult\" type, it is more accurate to describe them as denominations. Some denominations in the US that began as cults include Christian Science and the Nation of Islam.\n\nFinally, there is a push in the social scientific study of religion to begin referring to \"cults\" as \"New Religious Movements\" (NRMs). This is the result of the often pejorative and derogatory meanings attached to the word \"cult\" in popular language.\n\nReligious scholar John A. Saliba notes the many attempts to draw a classification or typology of cults and/or sects, but concludes that the divergences that exist in these groups' practices, doctrines, and goals do not lend themselves to a simple classification that has universal approval. He argues that the influx of Eastern religious systems, including Taoism, Confucianism and Shintoism, which do not fit within the traditional distinctions between church, sect, denomination and cult, have compounded typological difficulties.\n\nLorne L. Dawson examines the history and future of the church-sect typology in a 2008 article, opining that the typology survives as a useful tool.\n\nThe sociologist Roy Wallis (1945–1990) introduced differing definitions of sects and cults. He argued that a cult is characterized by \"epistemological individualism\" by which he means that \"the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member.\" According to Wallis, cults are generally described as \"oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant, non-exclusive\", making \"few demands on members\", without possessing a \"clear distinction between members and non-members\", having \"a rapid turnover of membership\", and are transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the \"cultic milieu.\" Wallis contrasts a cult with a sect in that he asserts that sects are characterized by \"epistemological authoritarianism\": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, \"sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation, such as collective salvation, and their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'.\"\n\nIn 1975, the sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge distinguish three types of cults, classified on the basis of the levels of organizational and client (or adherent) involvement:\n\nThe sociologist Paul Schnabel has argued that the Church of Scientology originated from an \"audience cult\" (the readership of Hubbard's book \"\" and the \"Astounding Science Fiction\" article which had preceded it) into a \"client cult\" (Dianetics) then into a cult movement (the Church of Scientology).\n\nThe sociologist Roy Wallis introduced a classification system of new religious movements based on movements' views on and relationships with the world at large.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4022596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4022596", "title": "Territorial abbey", "text": "Territorial abbey\n\nA territorial abbey (or territorial abbacy) is a particular church of the Catholic Church comprising defined territory which is not part of a diocese but surrounds an abbey or monastery whose abbot or superior functions as ordinary for all Catholics and parishes in the territory. Such an abbot is called a territorial abbot or abbot \"nullius diœceseos (abbreviated abbot \"nullius and Latin for \"abbot of no diocese\"). A territorial abbot thus differs from an ordinary abbot, who exercises authority only within the monastery's walls or to monks or canons who have taken their vows there. A territorial abbot is equivalent to a bishop in Catholic canon law.\n\nWhile most belong to the Latin Church, and usually to the Benedictine or Cistercian Orders, there are Eastern Catholic territorial abbeys — most notably the Italo-Greek Abbey of Grottaferrata.\n\nThe practice arose in part because abbeys served the spiritual needs of Catholics who lived near the monastery, especially in mission territories. The monastery's own chapel was a space of public worship for the laity who had settled nearby, and the monks could also serve as parish clergy in churches near the monastery. The abbot of the monastery, although having received only the priesthood in the sacrament of Holy Orders, was invested with the same administrative authority under canon law as a diocesan bishop for a given territory around the abbey. Thus, with the exception of conferring ordination on priests, the territorial abbot could do almost everything a diocesan bishop would for those under his care, including incardinate (that is, enroll under his jurisdiction) even non-monastic priests and deacons for service in parishes. The territorial abbot, like other abbots and archabbots, had the right to use an episcopal coat of arms and to wear the mitre, the crosier, the ring, and the pectoral cross; if the abbot had been ordained to the episcopacy (very rare), he had the power to ordain his religious who were candidates to the transitional and permanent diaconate and to the priesthood, though they usually had to attend a seminary house of formation located outside the abbot's territory. \n\nThough territorial (like other) abbots are elected by the monks of their abbey, a territorial abbot can only receive the abbatial blessing and be installed under mandate from the pope, just as a bishop cannot be ordained and installed as ordinary of a diocese without such a mandate.\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, more emphasis has been placed on the unique nature of the episcopacy and on the traditional organization of the church into dioceses under bishops. As such, abbeys \"nullius\" have been phased out in favor of the erection of new dioceses or the absorption of the territory into an existing diocese. A few ancient abbeys nullius still exist in Europe, and one in Korea.\n\nThere are eleven remaining territorial abbeys, as listed by the Vatican in the \"Annuario Pontificio\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following abbeys were previously territorial abbeys that were subsequently united with neighbouring dioceses:\n\n\n\nHistorically there have been more, such as :\n\n\n\n\n passim\n"}

{"id": "52398287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52398287", "title": "Tiwah", "text": "Tiwah\n\nTiwah is the Festival of the Dead of the Ngaju people of Central Kalimantan. It is basically a secondary mortuary rituals, where the bones of the deceased are taken from the cemeteries, purified and finally placed in an ossuary. The feast celebrates the final entry of the deceased into paradise where they would meet the ancestors.\n\nThe Ngaju practiced a syncretic religion known as the Kaharingan. To conform with the principle of the Indonesian state ideology of \"One Supreme God\" (\"Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa\"), in 1980 the Kaharingan faithful of the Ngaju people agreed to establish themselves under the Hindu-Kaharingan faith to be recognized as an official religion of Indonesia.\n\nThe Ngaju people regard human as comprising the physical body, animated by a 'soul' or 'spirit' known as the \"hambaruan\". Death means that the \"hambaruan\" leaves the body permanently and ceases to exist. The physical body is then replaced by something called \"liau\", which can be described as the 'spirit' of the corpse. \"Liau\" is divided into three parts: the \"liau\" of the bones, the \"liau\" of the flesh and blood, and the \"liau\" of the \"spirit of the intellect\". The bone \"liau\" is deemed to have been derived from the deceased's father, associated with the upperworld and the upperworld's male deity. The flesh and blood \"liau\" is derived from the deceased's mother, and is associated with the underworld and the underworld's female deity. These first two \"liau\"s remain with the corpse, and until the tiwah is enacted, they remain in the underworld. The third \"spirit of the intellect\" \"liau\" remain in a place in the third heaven. This \"liau\" however is a potential threat as they can roam the human world, and so this \"liau\" must be dealth with. At a ritual called \"tantulak liau\" (\"expelling the dead soul\"), Ngaju priests (\"basir\") would call upon one of the upperworld spirits (\"sangiang\") to escort this \"liau\" to a heavenly village in the third heaven. This \"liau\" must remain there until the tiwah.\n\nThe feast of Tiwah concerns with the reunion of the three \"liau\"s on earth for the last time before being escorted away to \"Lewa Liau\", the paradise. Tiwah feast is a large and lengthy feast consisting of many ceremonies, each with specific aims. One ceremony invites the various upperworld spirits to join in the celebrations, while other ensures that the living are kept safe during this potentially dangerous period. Each ceremonies requires sacrifice of livestock and so large numbers of livestock such as buffaloes and pigs are sacrificed during Tiwah. The animals are tied to a sapundu sacrificial pole, killed, its blood is used to purify multiple objects used during the tiwah. Offering is given to the dead and to the spirits invited to the ceremony. They take the essence of the offerings, while the human guests at the \"tiwah\" consume the physical part of the offering. Separate ceremonies are held to bring the bones from the cemetery, the bones are carried back to the village to be cleaned and anointed with oil and gold dust by their closest kin e.g. their children or their grandchildren; the anointed bones are then carefully wrapped in cloth and returned to the \"sandung\" where they will remain until the end of the tiwah. The \"sandung\" or bone houses are large house-like structures built to house the bones. Another ceremony bring the \"liau\" back from the third heaven where it has been residing.\n\nThe main event of the Tiwah takes place at a ceremony where the reunited \"liau\" is escorted by the \"sangiang\" psychopomp named Rawing Tempun Telun, to Lewu Liau. During this ceremony, which lasts all night, a medium called a \"tukang hanteran\" or \"mahanteran\" (\"adept at escorting (the dead)\") allows the \"sangiang\" Rawing Tempun Telun to possess him. The \"mahanteran\" would sit above the gong and dress up like the Rawing Tempun Telun, wearing a certain headdress, feathers of a hornbill, shell tunic and boars teeth belt, and holding a mandau (heirloom sword). The words of the \"mahanteran\" during this period are considered those of the \"sangiang\". The \"mahanteran\" would recite the entire creation myth of the Ngaju throughout the night. As the story commenced, it is deemed that in the spirit world, the \"liau\" would make their way to paradise in spirit boats, traveling along the rivers of the upperworld until they arrive at Lewu Liau in the seventh heaven. Lewu Liau is reached as the recitation of the creation myth finishes.\n\nThe recital of the creation myth is believed to restore order to the chaos caused by the death of a person. Ngaju people believes that death creates disorder and destruction of the cosmos, which must be continually recreated if life is to continue. By allowing the \"sangiang\" to possess the \"tukang hanteran\" and recite the creation myth, the cosmos is being restored.\n\nThe feast of Tiwah is most important ceremony of the Ngaju people, even more important than the primary funeral which is performed right after the death. Tiwah festival is essential for the soul's journey to reach the highest level in heaven. Tiwah is held after several months or years after the burial. Tiwah feast is a big, complex, costly, and long lasting event. One event costs anywhere between USD$6,000 to $180,000; and may last from three days to forty days, depending on the amount of souls are being sent off to the afterlife. It is common that several families hold a tiwah together so they can spread the cost of sacrificed animals. At one time, more than two hundred souls brought to a higher level in one ceremony. The council registers and coordinates all tiwah event before asking the police for a permit. Normally there are two to ten tiwah festivals in one years.\n\nTiwah is a festive event. There is active participation at Tiwah ceremony by Christian and some Muslim members of the community. Since Islam and the religion of Kaharingan are fundamentally irreconcilable as social ideologies, this has led to a great number of people practicing double or even multiple loyalties. An elder Dayak quotes that \"Religion (\"agama\") honors God; our traditional beliefs (\"kepercayaan\") honor our ancestors\". Tiwah is quite regular in main towns of Kalimantan, such as in Palangkaraya. Food stalls and open-air market shops are set during the Tiwah. Gambling boards are also frequent during the Tiwah.\n\n\n"}

Hence, Theosophy and Theosophists have existed ever since the first glimmering of nascent thought made man seek instinctively for the means of expressing his own independent opinions.\"\nBoth Alexander Senkevich and Tim Rudbøg stated that, to fully define Theosophy, Blavatsky proposes to consider it \"under all its aspects.\" Both Santucci and Rudbøg have quoted in the article:\n\"The interior world has not been hidden from all by impenetrable darkness. By that higher intuition acquired by \"Theosophia\"—or God-knowledge, which carries the mind from the world of form into that of formless spirit, man has been sometimes enabled in every age and every country to perceive things in the interior or invisible world.\"\n\nSantucci wrote that among the Theosophical ancestors, mentioned further by the article author, were the Hindu ascetics, the Neoplatonists, the Rosicrucians or Fire-philosophers, and other mystics. According to Blavatsky, they were all involved in \"the search after man's diviner 'self',\" which accompanied the theurgy she described. Santucci stated that, according to Iamblichus, theurgy is, as Blavatsky points in hers article, \"the art of applying the divine powers of man to the subordination of the blind forces of nature.\" This \"search\" was often viewed \"as individual communion with a personal God\", and although this was not true, it was the aim of every mystic at all times.\n\nSenkevich wrote that the article author quotes Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S., a spiritualist who, as she writes, \"with brave candour\" claimed:\n\"It is 'spirit' that alone feels, and perceives, and thinks—that acquires knowledge, and reasons and aspires... there not unfrequently occur individuals so constituted that the spirit can perceive independently of the corporeal organs of sense, or can perhaps, wholly or partially, quit the body for a time and return to it again... the spirit... communicates with spirit easier than with matter.\"\n\nSantucci stated that Theosophy or \"Divine Wisdom\", according to Blavatsky, is the Highest Truth about God, the universe and man, \"It is a Truth that in its pure form is primordial, in that it existed from the dawn of Humanity; esoteric, since only those few individuals capable of understanding such knowledge are allowed to receive it; and universal, because all great minds throughout the world enunciated the same Wisdom.\" Rudbøg wrote that this article is the first example in which Blavatsky's \"concept of a 'Wisdom-Religion' is directly correlated with 'Theosophy'.\" He quoted: \"Theosophy is, then, the archaic \"Wisdom-Religion,\" the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization.\" Both Tim Rudbøg and Julia Shabanova have cited Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy as the Wisdom-Religion:\n\"This 'Wisdom' all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian Budha, the Babylonian Nebo, the Thoth of Memphis, the Hermes of Greece; in the appellations, also, of some goddesses—Metis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic \"Sophia,\" and finally the Vedas, from the word 'to know'.\"\n\nJames Santucci wrote that Theosophy, according to Blavatsky, \"refers to a nexus of teachings associated with the Supreme, the macrocosmos (the universe or Nature), and microcosmos (humanity).\" He noted that in hers article she first presents the statement on \"a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and \"Unknowable\"\" which was the \"central idea of the Eclectic Theosophy.\"\n\nProfessor Julia Shabanova wrote that an idea of Theosophy was not alien to German idealism, with which were traditionally associated rationalism and even panlogism; this is about \"that Theosophy which\", as Blavatsky argues, \"prompted such men as Hegel, Fichte and Spinoza to take up the labors of the old Grecian philosophers and speculate upon the One Substance—the Deity, the \"Divine All\" proceeding from the Divine Wisdom—incomprehensible, unknown and \"unnamed\"—by any ancient or modern religious philosophy.\" Having mentioned these manifestations of Theosophy, the article author declares:\n\"Every Theosophist, then, holding to a theory of the Deity 'which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis,' may accept any of the above definitions or belong to any of these religions, and yet remain strictly within the boundaries of Theosophy. For the latter is belief in the Deity as the All, the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing \"It,\" or, as some prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is \"blasphemy\".\"\n\nShabanova wrote that Blavatsky points to the Theosophical method of the consciousness developing, quoting \"superb,\" in hers opinion, essay on \"The Oversoul\" by Ralph Emerson, \"I, the imperfect, adore my own perfect.\" She refers Plotinus, who counted that the secret gnosis, or the knowledge of Theosophy, has \"three degrees—opinion, science, and illumination.\" Blavatsky continues the cite: \"The means or instrument of the first is sense, or perception; of the second, dialectics; of the third, intuition. To the last, reason is subordinate; it is \"absolute knowledge,\" founded on the identification of the mind with the object known.\" She then writes, \"Theosophy is the exact science of psychology, so to say; it stands in relation to natural, uncultivated mediumship, as the knowledge of a Tyndall stands to that of a school-boy in physics.\"\n\nBoth the explicit ideological opponents of Blavatsky's doctrine and the Western esotericism scholars who claim for objectivity are equally interested in separating modern Theosophy from the classical one. For example, according to Nikolai Berdyaev, \"contemporary 'theosophical' movements\" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and \"have made us forget\" the existence of a genuine \"Christian theosophy\". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a \"mixture\" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.\n\nIn professor Antoine Faivre's opinion, that what Blavatsky called \"Theosophy\" was in fact only her own doctrine. René Guénon believed that \"theosophism\" is a \"confused mixture\" of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Jewish Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and occultism. A religious philosopher Sergius Bulgakov stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a \"vulgar pseudoscientific mythology.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They consisted largely of a following of youths, unemployed migrants, and those who felt that mainstream Muslim teachers were not doing enough for their communities.\n\nAs Maitatsine's support increased in the 1970s, so did the number of confrontations between Yan Tatsine and the police. By December 1980, continued Yan Tatsine attacks on other religious figures and police forced the Nigerian army to become involved. Subsequent armed clashes led to the deaths of around 5,000 people, including Maitatsine himself. Maitatsine died shortly after sustaining injuries in the clashes either from his wounds or from a heart attack.\n\nDespite Mohammed Marwa's death, Yan Tatsine riots continued into the early 1980s. In October 1982 riots erupted in Bulumkuttu, near Maidaguri and in Kaduna, to where many Yan Tatsine adherents had moved after 1980. Over 3,000 people died. Some survivors of these altercations moved to Yola, and in early 1984 more violent uprisings occurred in that city. In this round of rioting, Musa Makaniki, a close disciple of Maitatsine, emerged as a leader and Marwa's successor. Ultimately more than 1,000 people died in Yola and roughly half of the city's 60,000 inhabitants were left homeless. Makaniki fled to his hometown of Gombe, where more Yan Tatsine riots occurred in April 1985. A final riot occurred in Funtua, Kaduna state in 1987. After the deaths of several hundred people Makaniki retreated to Cameroon, where he remained until 2004 when he was arrested in Nigeria, where he was sentenced in 2006, but later released. Another leader of Yan Tatsine, Malam Badamasi, was killed in 2009.\n\nThe group were Quranists, seemingly rejecting the hadith and the sunnah and regarded the reading of any other book but the Koran as paganism.
