{"id": "322642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322642", "title": "Bill Hayden", "text": "Bill Hayden\n\nWilliam George Hayden (born 23 January 1933) is a former Australian politician who served as the 21st Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1989 to 1996. He had earlier been leader of the Labor Party from 1977 to 1983, as well as serving as a cabinet minister in the Whitlam and Hawke Governments.\n\nHayden was born in Brisbane, Queensland. He attended Brisbane State High School and then joined the Queensland Police, working as a police officer for eight years while studying economics part-time at the University of Queensland. Hayden was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1961 federal election, aged 28. When Gough Whitlam led the Labor Party to victory in 1972, he was made Minister for Social Security. He replaced Jim Cairns as Treasurer in 1975, but served for only five months before the government was dismissed.\n\nIn early 1977, Hayden challenged Whitlam for the party leadership and was defeated by just two votes. He succeeded Whitlam as Leader of the Opposition at the end of the year, following Labor's defeat at the 1977 election. Hayden led the party to the 1980 election, recording a substantial swing but falling well short of victory. He was replaced by Bob Hawke just a few weeks before the 1983 election, after months of speculation. Hayden served as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade from 1983 to 1988, then left parliament to assume the governor-generalship. He held that position for seven years, with only Lord Gowrie having served for longer.\n\nBorn in Brisbane, Bill Hayden was the son of George Hayden, an Irish-American sailor originally from Oakland, California, and already 52 years old at the time of Bill's birth. His paternal grandparents were from County Cork, Ireland and significant parts of his approach to social issues and politics throughout his public life reflected this background and non-denominational education at Brisbane State High School.\n\nA keen sportsman, he played rugby and rowed, and served in the Australian Military Force, and Navy as well as the Queensland Public Service and Police Force (the latter, from 1953-61). He continued his education privately, completing an economics degree (on a part-time basis) at the University of Queensland. Prior to the 1970s, he was a self-described democratic socialist.\n\nDuring the late 1950s he became active in the Labor Party. In the 1961 federal election he surprised almost everyone, including himself, by winning the House of Representatives seat of Oxley, located in southwest Brisbane. He ousted Don Cameron, the Minister for Health in the Menzies Liberal government, on a nine-point swing. Hayden's win was part of a 15-seat swing to Labor that nearly brought down the Menzies government.\n\nOvercoming initial resistance to his membership of the Labor party (due to a perception within the party of his father's views as too radical) he was admitted and was soon popularly elected as one of the then youngest members of the federal parliament (only 28 years old at the time he entered it), Hayden proved to be a diligent, well-spoken parliamentarian. In 1969, he became a member of the Opposition front bench. When Labor won the 1972 election under Gough Whitlam, Hayden was appointed Minister for Social Security, and in that capacity, among other efforts to promoting reform, introduced the single mothers pension and Medibank, Australia's first system of universal health insurance. On 6 June 1975, he succeeded Jim Cairns as Treasurer, a position he held until the Whitlam government was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, on 11 November 1975. Labor suffered its worst-ever defeat in the election held a month later, and Hayden was left as the only Labor MP from Queensland.\n\nWhen Labor lost the 1977 election in yet another landslide, Whitlam retired as leader and Hayden was elected to succeed him. Aged 44, he was the youngest person to be elected leader of the Labor Party since Chris Watson in 1901. His political views had become more moderate, and he advocated economic policies which encompassed the private sector and the American alliance. Several opinion polls during early 1980 showed the ALP under Hayden neck-and-neck with, or actually ahead of, Fraser's administration.\n\nAt the 1980 election. Labor finished a mere 0.8 percent behind Fraser's government on the two-party vote, having gained a nationwide swing of over four percent. Yet, due to the geographically uneven nature of the swing (strong in Victoria and, to a lesser degree, Western Australia and New South Wales, but comparatively weak everywhere else), Labor fell 12 seats short of toppling the Coalition. Hayden did, however, manage to slash Fraser's majority, from 48 seats to 21. He not only regained most of what Labor had lost in the previous two elections, but put the party within striking distance of winning the next election.\n\nBy 1982 it was evident that Fraser was manoeuvring to call an early election. But the main threat to Hayden came less from Fraser than from elements in Hayden's own party. Bob Hawke, a former union leader who had been elected to Parliament two years earlier, began mobilising his supporters to challenge Hayden's leadership. On 16 July 1982 Hayden narrowly defeated a challenge by Hawke in a party ballot but Hawke continued to plot against Hayden.\n\nIn December Labor surprised many pundits by its failure to win the vital Flinders by-election in Victoria, further raising doubts about Hayden's ability to lead the ALP to power. On 3 February 1983, in a meeting in Brisbane, various leading Labor figures, including Paul Keating and Senator John Button, told him that he must resign. He reluctantly accepted their advice. Hawke was then elected leader, unopposed. Later that morning, unaware of the events in Brisbane, Fraser in Canberra called a snap election for 5 March.\n\nFraser had been well aware of the infighting within Labor and wanted to call an election before the party could replace Hayden with Hawke. It was only a few hours before the writs were issued that Fraser learned of Hayden's resignation. At a press conference that afternoon Hayden, still chagrined, said that \"a drover's dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is\". Hayden's quip about a \"drover's dog\" became part of Australian political history. Hayden himself referred to it good-humouredly many years when he said, \"There are so many things I did in my political life that I am very proud of. ... But the one thing I am remembered for is damn well saying 'A drover's dog could win the next election'. It seems to have settled into political idiom. The only person who didn't like it was Bob Hawke.\"\n\nLabor won the 1983 election handily, and Hayden became Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In that post, he advocated closer integration between Australia and its Asian neighbours. In a 1983 interview, he stated: \"Australia is changing. We're an anomaly as a European country in this part of the world. There's already a large and growing Asian population in Australia and it is inevitable in my view that Australia will become a Eurasian country over the next century or two. Australian Asians and Europeans will marry another and a new race will emerge: I happen to think that's desirable.\" \"Asiaweek\", 19 August 1983.\n\nAs Foreign Minister Hayden had oversight of the Australian foreign aid program. He pursued efforts to engage Vietnam and Cambodia despite vehement opposition from allied nations and key stakeholders. In 1983 Hayden announced a review of the Australian foreign aid program (known as the \"Jackson Review\" after the chair, Sir Gordon Jackson) which reported in March 1984. The main recommendations of the report, which were directed at improving the professional quality of the Australian aid program, were accepted by the Government. During the next few years, in various speeches Hayden set out the foreign aid priorities of the government.\n\nAfter winning the 1987 election, Hawke offered Hayden the post of Governor-General as a consolation for replacing him earlier as Labor Leader in 1983 and thus denying him the chance to become Prime Minister. The Queen's appointment of Hayden as Governor-General to succeed Sir Ninian Stephen was announced in mid-1988. In the following months, Hayden resigned from Parliament and severed his political connections with the Labor Party. He took up the post of Governor-General in early 1989 and served during the period of transition from the Hawke Government to the Keating Government in December 1991. The usual term of for a Governor-General was five years but, by agreement between the government and Hayden, his term was extended for an additional two years to early 1996.\n\nUpon his appointment as Governor-General, he became, \"ex officio\", Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Australia. He had previously said he would never accept any honours.\n\nThe Governor-General is normally the Chief Scout of Australia. Hayden declined the office on the grounds of his atheism, which was incompatible with the Scout Promise. Instead, he served as the \"National Patron\" of the Scout Association during his time in office.\n\nBy the late 1990s Hayden joined the board of \"Quadrant\". In the debate preceding the 1999 republic referendum, he rejected the specific proposal and sided with the monarchists, stating he only supported direct election of a president.\n\nSince retirement from the position of Governor-General, Hayden has continued to contribute to public policy discussion in Australia. While on the board of \"Quadrant\", he took time to lend personal support to the publication and wrote a tribute to its editor P.P. McGuinness on his death in 2008. He has also continued to write opinion and comment pieces for other magazines and newspapers in Australia about current social, economic and political issues including foreign affairs.\n\nIn September 2018, Hayden was baptised as a Roman Catholic at St Mary's Church, Ipswich. He told \"The Catholic Leader\" that \"there’s been a gnawing pain in my heart and soul about what is the meaning of life\". The baptismal ceremony was attended by a gathering of family, friends, and former colleagues. Hayden's siblings, Patricia Oxenham, John Hayden, and Joan Moseman, along with other members of family, were present for the event.\n\nBy virtue of being Governor-General, he was the Chancellor of the Order of Australia and its Principal Companion (AC).\n\nHe received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Queensland in 1990 for his distinguished contributions to Australian life. Other awards included admission to the Order of St John Australia and also the Gwanghwa Medal of the Korean Order of Diplomatic Merit.\n\nIn 1996 he was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. In 2007 at the 45th State Conference of the Queensland Branch of the Australian Labor Party, Hayden was made a Life Member of the party.\n\nIn September 2017, in delivering the second Hayden Oration at the University of Southern Queensland in Ipswich, former Australian prime minister Paul Keating spoke at length of Hayden's contribution to the Labor Party. Keating spoke, in particular, of the reform period during the Hawke Labor Government in the 1980s in Australia. He noted that the foundations for the reforms had been set down before the Labor Party won office in 1983 during the period when Hayden was Leader of the Opposition and was working to prepare the Party for government. \"Those great reforms\", Keating said, \"began with the frameworks Bill Hayden brought to the front bench, the day he became Leader of the Labor Party.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10586400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10586400", "title": "Christian universalism", "text": "Christian universalism\n\nChristian universalism is a school of Christian theology focused around the doctrine of universal reconciliation – the view that all human beings will ultimately be \"saved\" and restored to a right relationship with God.\n\nThe term \"Christian universalism\" was used in the 1820s by Russell Streeter of the \"Christian Intelligencer\" of Portland – a descendant of Adams Streeter who had founded one of the first Universalist Churches on September 14, 1785. Christian universalists believe this was the most common interpretation of Christianity in Early Christianity, prior to the 6th century. Christians from a diversity of denominations and traditions believe in the tenets of Christian universalism, such as the reality of an afterlife without the possibility of eternal punishment in hell.\n\nAs a formal Christian denomination, Christian universalism originated in the late 18th century with the Universalist Church of America. There is currently no single denomination uniting Christian universalists, but a few denominations teach some of the principles of Christian universalism or are open to them. In 2007, the Christian Universalist Association was founded to serve as an ecumenical umbrella organization for churches, ministries, and individuals who believe in Christian universalism.\n\nUnitarian Universalism historically grew out of Christian universalism but is not an exclusively Christian denomination. It formed from a 1961 merger of two historically Christian denominations, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association, both based in the United States.\n\nIn his \"Plain Guide to Universalism\", the universalist Thomas Wiltmore wrote, \"The sentiment by which Universalists are distinguished, is this: that at last every individual of the human race shall become holy and happy. This does not comprise the whole of their faith, but, merely that feature of it which is peculiar to them and by which they are distinguished from the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe remaining central beliefs of Christian universalism are compatible with Christianity in general:\n\nIn 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the Universalist Church of America, adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, belief in Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, that sinful actions have consequence, and universal reconciliation.\n\nThe inclusion of theosis as a sixth point is found in the statement of faith adopted in 2007 by the Christian Universalist Association. In the context of Christian universalism, theosis— which can be translated as divinization or the process of being made more God-like—means to be made more Christ-like, or that all souls will ultimately be reconciled and conformed to the image of the glorified resurrected Christ.\n\nChristian Universalists disagree on whether or not Hell exists. However, they do agree that if it does, the punishment there is corrective and remedial, and does not last forever.\n\nPurgatorial Universalism was the belief of some of the early church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa. It asserts that the unsaved will undergo hell, but that hell is remedial (neither everlasting nor purely retributive) according to key scriptures and that after purification or conversion all will enter Heaven.\n\nFourth-century Christian theologian and Bishop Diodorus of Tarsus wrote: \"For the wicked there are punishments, not perpetual, however, lest the immortality prepared for them should be a disadvantage, but they are to be purified for a brief period according to the amount of malice in their works. They shall therefore suffer punishment for a short space, but immortal blessedness having no end awaits them…the penalties to be inflicted for their many and grave sins are very far surpassed by the magnitude of the mercy to be shown to them.\"\n\nChristian Universalists assert that the doctrine of eternal Hell was not a part of Christ's teachings nor even the early church, and that it was added in.\nThe first clear mention of endless misery is to be found in a work from 155-165 CE by Tatian. Other early references to a Hell of infinite duration come from Latin church father Tertullian in the late 2nd and 3rd century. According to Theologian Edward Beecher in the first four centuries there were six main theological schools and only one of them advocated the idea of eternal Hell.\n\nChristian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion- an epoch of time), as giving rise to the idea of eternal Hell. Dr. Ken Vincent writes \"When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, 'aion' became 'aeternam' which means 'eternal.\" He also states that the first written record of the idea of an eternal Hell comes from Tertullian, who wrote in Latin.\n\nThe second major source of the idea of Hell as eternal was the 4th-century theologian Augustine. According to author Steve Gregg, it was Tertullian's writings, plus Augustine's views and writings on eternal Hell which \"overwhelmed\" the other views of a temporary Hell. First Augustine's views of Hell were accepted in the early Latin Church, out of which rose the Roman Catholic church. Up until The Reformation Augustine's view of Hell as eternal was not questioned.\n\nAbout the word aion as having connotations of \"eternal\" or \"temporal\", the 19th century theologian Marvin Vincent wrote:\n\nAion, transliterated aeon, is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. Aristotle (peri ouranou, i. 9,15) says: \"The period which includes the whole time of one's life is called the aeon of each one.\" Hence it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life (aion) is said to leave him or to consume away (Iliad v. 685; Odyssey v. 160). It is not, however, limited to human life; it signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age before Christ; the period of the millennium; the mythological period before the beginnings of history...<br>\n\nThe adjective aionios in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on the other hand, aidios, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited to a given point of time in Jude 6. Aionios means enduring through or pertaining to a period of time. Both the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods...<br>\n\nWords which are habitually applied to things temporal or material cannot carry in themselves the sense of endlessness. Even when applied to God, we are not forced to render aionios everlasting. Of course the life of God is endless; but the question is whether, in describing God as aionios, it was intended to describe the duration of his being, or whether some different and larger idea was not contemplated.\n\nAuthor Thomas Talbott states that if one believes in the idea of eternal Hell or that some souls will be destroyed, one must either let go of the idea that it is God's wish and desires to save all beings, or accept the idea that God wants to, but will not \"successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter.\"\n\nAuthor David Burnfield defends the postmortem view, that God continues to evangelize to people even after they die (1 Chron 16:34; Isa 9:2; Matt 12:32; Rom 8:35-39; Eph 4:8-9; 1 Pet 3:18-20; 4:6) The main problem with the traditional view – and one that has never been satisfactorily addressed – is how can one “accept Christ” if they have never heard of Christ, or were unable to understand the message (i.e. too young, mentally handicapped, etc.).\n\nAccording to the \"New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge\" (1912), over the first five hundred years of Christian history there are records of at least six theological schools: Four of these schools were Universalist (one each in Alexandria, Antioch, Caesarea, and Edessa–Nisibis), one taught conditional immortality (in Ephesus), and the last taught eternal hell (in Carthage or Rome).\n\nThe Universalist Church of America, originally called the Universalist General Convention, emerged in the late 18th century from a mixture of Anabaptists, Moravians, liberal Quakers, and people influenced by Pietist movements such as Methodism. Americans from these religious backgrounds gradually created a new denominational tradition of Christian Universalism during the 19th century. The Universalist Church of America grew to be the sixth largest denomination in the United States at its peak.\n\nJohn Murray, who is called the \"Father of American Universalism,\" was a disciple of the Welshman James Relly and promoted Relly's Universalist form of Methodism in America. He was a central figure in the founding of the Universalist Church of America in 1793. He served as pastor of the Universalist Society of Boston and wrote many hymns.\n\nAnother important figure in early American Christian Universalism was George de Benneville, a French Huguenot preacher and physician who was imprisoned for advocating Universalism and later emigrated to Pennsylvania where he continued preaching on the subject. De Benneville was noted for his friendly and respectful relationship with Native Americans and his pluralistic and multicultural view of spiritual truth which was well ahead of his time. One of his most significant accomplishments was helping to produce the Sauer Bible, the first German language Bible printed in America. In this Bible version, passages teaching universal reconciliation were marked in boldface.\n\nOther significant early modern Christian Universalist leaders include Elhanan Winchester, a Baptist preacher who wrote several books promoting the universal salvation of all souls after a period in purgatory, who founded the first Universalist church in Philadelphia, and founded a church that ministered to African American slaves in South Carolina; Hosea Ballou, a Universalist preacher and writer in New England; and Hannah Whitall Smith, a writer and evangelist from a Quaker background who was active in the Holiness movement as well as the women's suffrage and temperance movements.\n\nA separate branch of Christian Universalism that arose in the early 20th century was the Primitive Baptist Universalists, also called \"No-Hellers.\" They were a group of Baptists in the central and southern Appalachian Mountain region of the United States that taught universal reconciliation and, like Hosea Ballou, embraced the \"Ultra-Universalist\" position that there is no literal hell beyond earth.\n\nThe Unity School of Christianity, founded in 1889 by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, has taught some Universalist beliefs such as God's total goodness, the divine nature of human beings, and the rejection of the traditional Christian belief that God condemns people to hell.\n\nThe Universalist Church of America gradually declined in the early to mid 20th century and merged with the American Unitarian Association in 1961, creating the modern-day Unitarian Universalist Association, which does not officially subscribe to exclusively Christian theology. Christian Universalism largely passed into obscurity for the next few decades with the end of the Universalist Church as a separate denomination. However, the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship remains as an organization for Christians from the Unitarian Universalist tradition and liberal Christians interested in Unitarianism and Universalism.\n\nSome Christians from a Pentecostal background who were involved in the Latter Rain Movement of the 1940s and 1950s came to believe in the ideas of Christian Universalism on their own, separately from the Universalist Church tradition. They emphasized the teachings of universal reconciliation and theosis. These ideas were spread primarily through newsletters and traveling evangelists from the 1950s to 1980s, and were not typically identified by the term \"Universalism.\" The only significant organization representing these beliefs that emerged within the Charismatic tradition was the Home Missions Church, a loosely organized network of ministers and house churches founded in 1944.\n\nThere are three general types of Christian Universalism today – Evangelical Universalism, Charismatic Universalism, and Liberal Christian Universalism – which by themselves or in combination with one another describe the vast majority of currently existing and identifiable versions of Christian Universalist belief and practice.\n\nThe type of Christian Universalism that departs the least from orthodox or traditional Christian doctrine is Evangelical (Christian) Universalism, also called Biblical or Trinitarian Universalism. Evangelical Universalists hold to conservative positions on most theological or doctrinal issues except for the doctrine of hell, in which case they assert universal reconciliation instead of eternal torment. They tend to emphasize the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ for the sins of all humanity as the basis for their Universalism.\n\nIn 2006 a mainstream evangelical writer, revealed as Robin Parry in 2009, under the pseudonym of \"Gregory MacDonald\" (taken from the names, Gregory of Nyssa and George MacDonald) released a book \"The Evangelical Universalist\". In 2008 this inspired the creation of a forum, featuring \"Gregory MacDonald\" and Thomas Talbott, to discuss Evangelical Universalism and related topics. Evangelical Universalists derive a large part of their beliefs from Evangelicalism and Reformed theology. Many of them come from an Evangelical Christian background, but they may or may not identify with this movement and seek to remain with it.\n\nSome Evangelical Universalists avoid using the word \"Universalism\" to describe their beliefs, perhaps because of the negative connotations of this word among conservative Christians. Alternative terms that are in use among Evangelical Universalists include the \"Larger Hope\" or \"Blessed Hope\" and the \"Victorious Gospel.\"\n\nSome Christians with a background in the Charismatic movement or Pentecostalism have developed a version of Universalism which could be called Charismatic (Christian) Universalism. Charismatic Universalists usually do not call their theology \"Universalism\" but commonly refer to their specific beliefs by the terms \"Reconciliation\" (shorthand for universal reconciliation, the doctrine of apocatastasis) and \"Sonship\" (shorthand for \"Manifest Sonship\" which is a variant of the doctrine of theosis). The term \"Feast of Tabernacles\" is used by some Charismatic Universalists as a term for their post-Pentecostal spiritual tradition, reflecting a symbolic interpretation of this Jewish festival as an entrance into a fuller knowledge and relationship with God and understanding of God's plan for humanity.\n\nCharismatic Universalism is marked by its emphasis on theosis; the idea that the return of Christ is a body of perfected human beings who are the \"Manifested Sons of God\" instead of a literal return of the person of Jesus; the idea that these Sons will reign on the earth and transform all other human beings from sin to perfection during an age that is coming soon (a version of millennialism); and the absolute sovereignty of God, the nonexistence or severe limitation of human free will, and the inevitable triumph of God's plan of universal reconciliation. Some see similarities to the teachings of Jacob Arminius, a Dutch theologian who tried to modify John Calvin's teachings about predestination.\n\nMany Charismatic Universalists meet in house churches or do not belong to a church at all. Most of the evidence of Universalism existing as a school of thought within the Charismatic movement is found in a large number of internet-based ministries that are informally networked with one another.\n\nLiberal Christian Universalists include some members of mainline Protestant denominations, some people influenced by the New Age and New Thought movements, some people in the emerging church movement, some Unitarian Universalists who continue to follow Jesus as their primary spiritual teacher, and some Christians from other religious backgrounds who may or may not attend church.\n\nLiberal Christian Universalism emphasizes the all-inclusive love of God and tends to be more open to finding truth and value in non-Christian spiritual traditions compared to the attitude of other forms of Christian Universalism, while remaining generally Christ-centered. In contrast to Evangelical Universalism, Liberal Christian Universalism views the Bible as an imperfect human document containing divine revelations, is not necessarily Trinitarian, and often downplays or rejects blood atonement theology in its view of the crucifixion of Jesus. Some Liberal Christian Universalists believe in mystical philosophies such as panentheism and process theology, Gnostic or New Age ideas such as the preexistence and reincarnation of the soul, and New Thought ideas such as the law of attraction.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship is an organization for Liberal Christian Universalists, especially those who belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association. The Liberal Catholic Church, the Catholic Universalist Church and the Unity Church are liberal Christian denominations which teach some Universalist beliefs.\n\nFormer Pentecostal Bishop Carlton Pearson's \"Gospel of Inclusion\" appears to be a hybrid between Charismatic and Liberal Christian Universalism. He is now a minister in the United Church of Christ, a liberal Christian denomination, but continues to believe in some ideas and practices of Pentecostal or Charismatic forms of Christianity. Pearson has also incorporated some New Age and New Thought teachings into his message. Brian McLaren is a Christian leader in the emerging church movement who is sympathetic to the idea of Universalism but does not embrace it.\n\nA number of ministers and evangelists connected with Restoration Nation conferences are Universalists who draw from both the Evangelical and Charismatic traditions. One notable example is Robert Rutherford, a minister from Georgia (USA) who was a finalist on The Learning Channel's 2006 reality TV series \"The Messengers.\" Another example is Dick King, an independent Charismatic Baptist pastor in North Little Rock, Arkansas, whose church left the Southern Baptist Convention in 2004.\n\nThe Heavenly Faith denomination, which is a Restorationist sect that blends Eastern Orthodoxy, Methodism, and Charismaticism, openly embraces Universalism, even going so far as to say that all Creation, including those individuations of it which are currently enemies of the Church, will eventually be saved. However, it maintains a traditional eschatology.\n\nThe Christian Universalist Association is putting forth a message which seeks common ground among all major contemporary types of Christian Universalism.\n\nThe conversion of Bishop Carlton Pearson to a form of Universalism and his subsequent excommunication by the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops in 2004 caused Christian Universalism to gain increased media attention because of Pearson's popularity and celebrity status.\n\nIn 2007, Eric Stetson and Kalen Fristad gathered a group of thirteen ministers and evangelists from several denominations to found the Christian Universalist Association, an interdenominational organization for churches, ministries, and individuals who believe in Christian Universalism.\nAbout the current state of Christian Universalism, they state: \n\"Many Christian philosophers, theologians, writers, and scholars are coming to believe in a Universalist interpretation of Christianity. A rapidly growing number of books are being published on the subject of Christian Universalism. Hundreds of Christian Universalist websites have exploded across the internet over the past few years, run by people with a wide variety of religious backgrounds and viewpoints. It appears that Universalism is beginning to develop into one of the most significant ecumenical movements among Christians of our time.\"\n\nThere are many religious issues on which Christian Universalists disagree with each other, depending on their theological background and denominational tradition. Some examples include:\n\n\n\n"}

The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.\n\nThe \"Dabistan-e Madahib\" is best known for its chapter on the Dīn-i Ilāhī, the syncretic religion propounded by the Mughal emperor Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar (\"Akbar the Great\") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the \"Ibādat Khāna\" discussions that led up to this.\n\nThis work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the \"Asiatic Researches\", xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by David Shea and Anthony Troyer under the title, \"The Dabistan or School of Manners\" (1843) in three volumes from London. \n\nThe critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was \"of the philosophic sect of Sufis\", but the 1993 edition of the \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\" suggests that the author was most likely a Zoroastrian. The present Persian edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of Azar Kayvan, Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.\n\nThe author describes that he spent time in Patna, Kashmir, Lahore, Surat and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.\n\nAccording to \"The Jew in the Lotus\" by Rodger Kamenetz, a \"Dabistan\" was commissioned by a Mughal mystic prince, Dara Shikoh. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, Sarmad Kashani, and his Hindu disciple from Sindh. Walter Fischel notes: An English version of the \"Dabistan\" by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.\n\nAlthough the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a Persian. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:\n\nHe personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the Jains he writes:\n\nHe observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:\n\nHe describes the disputations in Akbar's Ibadat Khana in detail, as if he had been there:\n\nHe describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:\n\nThe text is divided into twelve ta‘lims (chapters):\n\nChapter II includes one of the earliest historical account of the Sikhs.\n\n"}

Today the Order has establishments in over 80 countries.\n\nA few Brothers settled in Jersey at the time of the French Revolution and remained in the Island for several years. Then, from 1866 to 1896, a school of up to 300 pupils run by the Brothers' flourished in St. Thomas's Parish. The Brothers left the Island in 1896, but were invited to return in 1917 to found another school.\n\nThe school was established at Berry House next to St. Thomas's Church in St. Helier and was initially known as St. Aloysius College. Within a year the main site of the school was moved to a property known as \"The Beeches\" on Wellington Hill in the parish of St. Saviour. It was at this point that the name De La Salle College was first given to the school.\n\nUnder the direction of Brother Edward, the first and longest-serving Headmaster (33 years), the school grew significantly in numbers. On opening day, 1 October 1917, there were just a dozen pupils. By the start of the following year the number had increased to 57 and reached 100 by 1921. In 1933 enrollment topped the 200 mark and a school holiday was given to mark the occasion.\n\nThe transfer of the school from the French Province in Quimper to the Province of London in 1948 marked a distinct change in the fortunes of the school. By 1949 no fewer than 470 pupils were attending the school. New buildings were planned and erected in the mid-1950s. Many past pupils testify to the tremendous spirit in the school even at times when it lacked buildings and facilities. Without this spirit it is difficult to appreciate how the school could have survived.\n\nTwo significant factors have helped ensure that the school has a bright future well into the next century. The first was the introduction of the Covenant Scheme. Begun in the mid-1960s, it led initially to the opening of the swimming pool and gymnasium and then to a period of rapid expansion. The 6th Form Block, Science Building, C.D.T. workshops, Art Rooms and the Computer Room were completed in quick succession. Secondly, in 1976, the States of Jersey agreed to provide the school with generous financial assistance in the form of a capitation grant for running costs.\n\nThe 6th Form Block, Science Labs and I.T. facilities, Art Rooms, C.D.T. workshops and Drawing office, a new Infant School, six new classrooms for secondary and a new Junior School were all completed thanks to the help provided through the Covenant Scheme.\n\nA “new age” began in the late 1990s when negotiations began with the States of Jersey for capital funding and the building of 8 new classrooms and a library and resources area began in January 2003.\n\nThough there is no longer a Brothers’ Community in Jersey, the school retains close links with the Brothers who are Trustees of the College.\n\n\"Lasallian Voices\" is the termly publication of De La Salle College, Jersey. Students can send in stories, poems and other work to be published in the next edition. The most-recent edition was published in the Summer of 2010. However, only the first and second editions have been published online.\n\n\n\n\n"}

From March 7, 2006 until November 6, 2007 he was member of the city council of Leidschendam-Voorburg on behalf of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA). From that date until 2010 he continued to be a member of the city council as independent member 'fraction Jami'. In 2007 he was one of the two founders of the former Central Committee for Ex-Muslims.\n\nJami was born on April 20, 1985 in Mashhad, Iran and was raised there. His father is a doctor. His mother converted, later in her life, to Christianity. As son of a doctor, Jami enjoyed substantial privileges in Iran. In an interview, Jami stated: \"My grandparents were Muslim, but my father was non-religious.\" Yet in a different interview, he described his father as Muslim. Political engagement by Jami's father forced the family to leave the country. Together with his parents and his older sister, the then nine-year-old Jami arrived in the Netherlands in 1994, later obtaining Dutch nationality.\n\nJami studied Management Science for one and a half year in the Netherlands and joined the Labour party as member in 2003. He was elected to the city council of Leidschendam-Voorburg in the local elections of March 2006.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Jami started reading the Qur'an and Hadith, after which he decided he didn't identify with either. Jami criticized Islamic prophet Muhammad, describing him as a \"criminal\". Together with Loubna Berrada (founder of the Advisory Committee for Integration, part of the right-wing Liberal party), Jami founded the Central Committee for Ex-Muslims in 2007. The organisation, supported by Afshin Ellian, aims to support apostates of Islam. Berrada left the committee shortly after it was founded because she felt Jami challenged Islam itself too much, saying: \"I don't wish to confront Islam itself. I only want to spread the message that Muslims should be allowed to leave Islam behind without being threatened\".\n\nOn 4 August 2007, Jami was attacked in his hometown Voorburg by three men. The attack is widely believed to be linked to his activities for the committee. The national anti-terrorism coordinator's office, the public prosecution department and the police decided during a meeting on 6 August that \"additional measures\" were necessary for the protection of Jami who has subsequently received extra security.\n\nIn September 2007, he penned an op-ed together with PVV politician Geert Wilders for the Dutch daily Volkskrant, likening the threat of Islam to the rise of Adolf Hitler's National Socialism in the 1930s. It was a response to National Antiterrorism Coordinator Tjibbe Joustra's remarks in \"Algemeen Dagblad\", who criticized the tone used by some people in the discussion about Islam.\n\nOn October 4, 2007, Jami announced that he was working on a film project due to be released in February 2008 which he felt could be comparable in terms of controversy to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. On 31 March 2008 he cancelled this project after being urged to do so by Dutch Minister of Justice Ernst Hirsch Ballin and threats from Iran.\n\nHowever, after months of deliberation, Jami again decided to release the film. The short film was released on 9 December 2008. The announcement was followed by calls from European Islamic organizations for boycott of Dutch products. Dutch Premier Jan Peter Balkenende issued an apology for Jami's film.\n\nAfter expressing strong opinions against Islam, strong criticism of the PvdA, and comparing the Islamic Prophet Muhammad with Adolf Hitler, he was asked to give up his council membership as part of the PvdA. By refusing to resign and continuing as an independent member, he lost his membership of PvdA.\n\nJami was allegedly cited in the writings of Anders Behring Breivik.\n\nCo-founder Berrada quit the committee in June 2007 because she felt Jami acts too aggressively towards the entire religion of Islam, stating: \"I don't wish to confront Islam itself. I only want to spread the message that Muslims should be allowed to leave Islam behind without being threatened\".\n\n\n"}

The story focuses on Eurydice's choice to return to earth with Orpheus or to stay in the underworld with her father (a character created by Ruhl). Ruhl made several changes to the original myth's story-line. The most noticeable of these changes was that in the myth Orpheus succumbs to his desires and looks back at Eurydice, while in Ruhl's version Eurydice calls out to Orpheus (causing him to look back) perhaps in part because of her fear of reentering the world of the living and perhaps as a result of her desire to remain in the land of the dead with her father. Ruhl's script has been explicitly written so as to be a playground for the designer of the sets.\n\nThe play had its world premiere at Madison Repertory Theatre, Madison, Wisconsin, on September 2003. The play next was produced at Berkeley Repertory Theatre, California, in October to November 14, 2004. Directed by Les Waters, Associate Artistic Director, the cast featured Maria Dizzia as Eurydice and Daniel Talbott as Orpheus. It next was presented at Yale Repertory Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut, in September 2006 to October 14, directed by Les Waters, with Maria Dizzia (Eurydice) and Joseph Parks (Orpheus).\n\nThe play opened Off-Broadway at Second Stage Theatre, running from June 18 to August 26, 2007. Directed by Les Waters, the cast featured Maria Dizzia as Eurydice, Joseph Parks as Orpheus, and Charles Shaw Robinson as Eurydice's Father. The play received several award nominations, including the 2008 Drama League Award, Distinguished Production of a Play and the 2008 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Set Design of a Play, (Scott Bradley). Charles Isherwood, reviewing for \"The New York Times\", called it a \"weird and wonderful new play.\"\n\nThe play has been produced by hundreds of high schools and universities.\n\nIt has been staged at : Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, March–April 2008; the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, May 2008 (with original live music by Toby Twining;) ACT Theatre in Seattle, September–October 2008; in Theatre Ink's 2010-2011 season; by the Custom Made Theatre Co. in San Francisco in 2013; and at the Douglas Morrisson Theatre,\nHayward, California in May/June 2013. It is currently showing at American Players Theatre (Spring Green, Wisconsin) under the direction of Tyne Rafaeli. The show was produced in October 2016 at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho. The production was directed by Shea King.\n\nThe play was presented in London at the Young Vic Theatre in May 2010, after a tour starting in Plymouth at the Drum Theatre on February 25, 2010 and finally playing at the Young Vic's Maria Studio, starting in previews April 29. The play was directed by Bijan Sheibani with the cast that featured Osi Okerafor and Ony Uhiara.\n\nThe play consists of three movements, divided into numerous scenes: 7 in the first movement, 20 in the second movement, and 3 in the third movement.\n\nThe play begins with Eurydice and Orpheus, two young lovers, who are about to get married. In the Underworld, Eurydice's dead father has managed to preserve his memory and his ability to read and write, and tries to send her letters. During the wedding, Eurydice goes outside to get a drink of water and she meets a man (the \"Nasty Interesting Man\") who tells her he has a letter from her father. Eurydice decides to go to his apartment to retrieve the letter, but as she leaves his apartment after resisting the man's attempts to seduce her, she trips and falls to her death on the stairs.\n\nAt the beginning of the second movement, there is no set change, but \"the movement to the underworld is marked by the entrance of stones\": Little Stone, Big Stone, and Loud Stone, who serve as a chorus.\n\nEurydice enters the Underworld through an elevator, inside which it is raining. Upon arrival, she meets her father, who tries to reteach Eurydice about her past since she has lost her memory after being dipped in the river Lethe. The Stones try unsuccessfully to stop them, because the dead are not allowed to remember their past or speak in human language. Rooms are also not allowed in the Underworld, but Eurydice's father creates one for her out of pieces of string. He gradually re-teaches her human language and her past. While the father is away at work, the Lord of the Underworld enters as a child riding a tricycle and attempts to seduce Eurydice, but fails.\n\nMeanwhile, in the land of the living, Orpheus writes a letter to Eurydice, which her father delivers and reads to her. Orpheus also sends her a copy of the \"Complete Works of Shakespeare\" by attaching it to a piece of string, and Eurydice's father reads to her from \"King Lear\". Orpheus sends another letter, and then resolves to go to the Underworld himself to find her.\n\nIn the third movement, Orpheus arrives at the gates of the Underworld, singing a song so powerful it makes the Stones weep. The Lord of the Underworld tells him that he may take Eurydice back, but only if he does not turn around to look at her. Eurydice is then faced with the decision to either stay with her father or go back with her husband. At her father's insistence, she follows Orpheus. But as she catches up to him, she calls out his name, and he turns to look at her, causing her to die a second death. Meanwhile, her father has decided that he wants to forget everything, and dips himself in the river again. When Eurydice returns, her father is lying silent on the ground, having lost all of his language and memory forever.\n\nAs Eurydice mourns her father, the Lord of the Underworld returns, having grown from a child to superhuman height. He orders her to be his bride. Eurydice pens a letter to Orpheus and his next wife, then immerses herself in the river and lies down in forgetfulness. Finally, Orpheus too enters from the elevator, having truly died this time. He finds Eurydice's letter to him, but because he has been dipped in the river, he cannot read it.\n\n"}

Consequently, the human faculty of moral judgment based on the \"beneficial\" versus the \"harmful\" is in dysfunction. People who accept the holy lie do not evaluate the fairness of a thing by what Nietzsche calls \"The natural notion\".

Originally based in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the organization has been noted for its controversial\nwall of shame where it publicizing the names of people it considers suspected abusers by posting their names and alleged activities on the organization's website. The organization ceased day-to-day operations in 2014. JCW restarted daily operations several months later, restructuring with a new board of directors as well as an advisory board. Jewish Community Watch focuses on abuse prevention through education and awareness as well as locating individuals thought to have abused children and warning the local community of their presence. The organization's founders are two residents of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Meyer Seewald, and his brother Schneur Seewald.\n\nThe founder of JCW, Meyer Seewald, is a Crown Heights resident who, along with his brother Schneur Seewald, started the Jewish Community Watch in Crown Heights to investigate and exposes orthodox Jewish community members suspected of child sexual abuse (CSA).\n\nMeyer Seewald was born in Crown Heights to Tzvi and Fayge Seewald, who became religious and belong to the Chabad-Lubavitch community in Crown Heights.\n\nSeewald first became involved in anti-abuse work after two of his friends confided in him that they were abused by a local man who had organized youth programs in the community. Seewald later published his own recollections of being victimized at an overnight summer camp by his counselor.\n\nIn December 2015 Seewald became engaged to Raizel Kahn from Florida.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles Hynes, presented an award of excellence to Seewald for; \"tireless service and dedication to the community,\" in exposing Jewish Sexual Predators.\n\nSharon Otterman and Ray Rivera, in the New York Times stated that Jewish Community watch is one amongst several blogs and web sites publishing photos of people accused as molesters. They state that although this is a risky move legally - the sources believe it is justified by the need to warn the community, particularly given that the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has a policy of not publicizing arrests or indictments in such cases.\n\nThe Tablet Magazine Noted that Seewald claims to have a database of 225 suspected offenders. JCW’s Wall of Shame posted 36 people accused of abuse. 21 of the 36 have been arrested and charged. According to Seewald, a person is added when the board has determined there is sufficient evidence. When a victim is unwilling—or unable due to the statute of limitations—to press charges; Seewald conducts his own investigation; selectively exposing alleged abusers on his Wall of Shame.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Jewish Journal\" discussed the wall of shame similar to the tablet and reported that JCW says that its review process includes \"personal interviews with multiple alleged victims and what appears to be a thorough investigation process\" and that \"JCW will only post a suspect if its board unanimously agrees that the person is a child predator\". It concludes that \"neither Seewald nor JCW has ever been sued for libel or defamation regarding its publicizing of accused abusers\".\n\nThe Tablet points out that while Seewald says that molesters are more afraid of the Wall of Shame, than going to jail, - his \"Wall of Shame has also proved to be deeply problematic, used irresponsibly, and it can easily undermine the organization's objectives and destroy an innocent person’s life.\" Ben Hirsch, a co-founder of Survivors for Justice, an organization that advocates and educates on issues of child safety, says that Seewald is on a dangerous track. Noting that by setting up a separate registry and justice system [from law enforcement agencies], it perpetuates the same message of the rabbis that \"we can deal with this issue in-house\". The message must instead be that the only way to deal with child sex abuse, is to report it directly to the police.\n\nThe Tablet notes a case where the wall of shame posted a special-education teacher who was accused of abuse by an autistic boy he tutored. After being arrested and charged by the Brooklyn District Attorney, the investigation was dropped when the child retracted his claim. The teacher wrote that Seewald confronted him at his house “rather aggressively,” and demanded he confess to molesting the child. This individual was placed on the Wall of Shame, in an effort to warn the community of the potential harm. When the case was dismissed, JCW removed the teacher from the Wall. The exposure, he says, destroyed his career and social standing. He wrote that “In people’s eyes I was no longer a Jew, let alone a human being, ... I was regarded as a monster, an out-of-control, filthy, dangerous beast; capable of snatching little children and sexually abusing them.” Soon after, Seewald removed his name and picture from the blog, citing that there was insufficient evidence against him. The teacher said that because forgiveness is in his nature, he removed his article criticizing JCW and replaced it with one praising Seewald’s work, blaming the student who falsely accused him rather than JCW. The tablet concluded that JCW’s credibility never fully recovered from the debacle. The Teacher wrote about his case which was published on local blogs.\n\nJCW officially responded to this case in a letter to the teacher \"Daniel G.\". JCW commented that; \"[individuals] who have been arrested and charged with crimes relating to child sexual abuse [will be exposed]. When an individual is charged, the charges and arrest are available on the public record and the community should be notified... Considering Jewish Community Watch was not involved with the investigation, he was immediately removed from the site and a further update was published regarding the dropped charges.\n\nJCW initiated project E.M.E.S. to warn counselors against abusing campers. \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" noted that because only two camps signed up for the program, Seewald created a video warning all camp staff members that his organization would not tolerate abuse. The video received 16,000 hits in three days.\n\nThe JCW has organized a number of public events dedicated toward addressing the issues of sexual abuse in the Orthodox Jewish community. At one event in Crown Heights, speakers included community rabbis, activists, therapists, former victims, and Brooklyn's District Attorney. Hundreds attended an event in Los Angeles, California. from which the videohad a viral impact, and was reported on by several news agencies. To date, JCW has had public events in multiple cities around the world, including: Jerusalem, Efrat, Beit Shemesh (Israel), Miami, Boca Raton, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Monsey, Toronto (CA) and others. Its efforts have brought awareness worldwide to CSA.\n\nA comedian and local Chabad celebrity Mendy Pellin, published a letter supporting JCW. Mendy stated that \"Where many of our community leaders have shied away from addressing this issue head-on, Meyer has devoted himself to doing the dirty work that needs to be done to keep our children safe.\"\n\nOther endorsements include Rabbi Blau (Rabbi of Yeshiva University), Asher Lipner (a child sexual psychiatrist), Benny Forer (orthodox Jewish Deputy District Attorney) and others.\n\nMembers of the Chabad community, posting on local news blogs, have criticized the JCW website for not providing enough information on how investigations are performed, and for not detailing the evidence behind accusations of wrongdoing. The site has also been criticized for posting incriminatory information prior to individuals being arrested or charged, and accused of later refusing to change or remove information alleged by some members of the community to be false. Other than the one claim above, no proof has ever been written or submitted demonstrating JCW has posted anyone wrongfully.\n\n\n"}

Peter died in 1942 while flying for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.\n\nHe was educated at the local primary school in Street, Somerset, then was taught by a friend of the family at home, and later at a Quaker school. When he was 11 he went to Elmhurst Grammar School in Street, and when his father was promoted to head postmaster in Ely in 1945, Polkinghorne was transferred to The Perse School, Cambridge. Following National Service in the Royal Army Educational Corps from 1948 to 1949, he read Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1952 as Senior Wrangler, then earned his PhD in physics in 1955, supervised by Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in the group led by Paul Dirac.\n\nHe joined the Christian Union of UCCF while at Cambridge and met his future wife, Ruth Martin, another member of the Union and also a mathematics student. They married on 26 March 1955, and at the end of that year sailed from Liverpool to New York. Polkinghorne accepted a postdoctoral Harkness Fellowship with the California Institute of Technology, where he worked with Murray Gell-Mann. Toward the end of the fellowship he was offered a position as lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, which he took up in 1956.\n\nAfter two years in Scotland, he returned to teach at Cambridge in 1958. He was promoted to reader in 1965, and in 1968 was offered a professorship in mathematical physics, a position he held until 1979, his students including Brian Josephson and Martin Rees. For 25 years, he worked on theories about elementary particles, played a role in the discovery of the quark, and researched the analytic and high-energy properties of Feynman integrals and the foundations of S-Matrix theory. While employed by Cambridge, he also spent time at Princeton, Berkeley, Stanford, and at CERN in Geneva. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974.\n\nPolkinghorne decided to train for the priesthood in 1977. He said in an interview that he felt he had done his bit for science after 25 years, and that his best mathematical work was probably behind him; Christianity had always been central to his life, so ordination offered an attractive second career. He resigned his chair in 1979 to study at Westcott House, Cambridge, an Anglican theological college, becoming an ordained priest on 6 June 1982 (Trinity Sunday). The ceremony was held at Trinity College, Cambridge and presided over by Bishop John A. T. Robinson. He worked for five years as a curate in south Bristol, then as vicar in Blean, Kent, before returning to Cambridge in 1986 as dean of chapel at Trinity Hall. He became the president of Queens' College that year, a position he held until his retirement in 1996. He served as canon theologian of Liverpool Cathedral from 1994 to 2005.\n\nIn 1997 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), although as an ordained priest in the Church of England, he is not styled as \"Sir John Polkinghorne\". He is an Honorary Fellow of St Chad's College, Durham and awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Durham in 1998; and in 2002 was awarded the Templeton Prize for his contributions to research at the interface between science and religion. He spoke on \"The Universe as Creation\" at the Trotter Prize ceremony in 2003.\n\nHe has been a member of the BMA Medical Ethics Committee, the General Synod of the Church of England, the Doctrine Commission, and the Human Genetics Commission. He served as chairman of the governors of The Perse School from 1972 to 1981. He is a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge and was for 10 years a canon theologian of Liverpool Cathedral. He is a founding member of the Society of Ordained Scientists and also of the International Society for Science and Religion, of which he was the first president. He was selected to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures in 1993–1994, which he later published as \"The Faith of a Physicist\".\n\nIn 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Hong Kong Baptist University as part of their 50-year celebrations. This included giving a public lecture on \"The Dialogue between Science and Religion and Its Significance for the Academy\" and an \"East–West Dialogue\" with Yang Chen-ning, a nobel laureate in physics. He is a member of staff of the Psychology and Religion Research Group at Cambridge University. He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge.\n\nPolkinghorne said in an interview that he believes his move from science to religion has given him binocular vision, though he understands that it has aroused the kind of suspicion \"that might follow the claim to be a vegetarian butcher.\" He describes his position as critical realism and believes that science and religion address aspects of the same reality. It is a consistent theme of his work that when he \"turned his collar around\" he did not stop seeking truth. He believes the philosopher of science who has most helpfully struck the balance between the \"critical\" and \"realism\" aspects of this is Michael Polanyi. He argues that there are five points of comparison between the ways in which science and theology pursue truth: moments of enforced radical revision, a period of unresolved confusion, new synthesis and understanding, continued wrestling with unresolved problems, deeper implications.\n\nBecause scientific experiments try to eliminate extraneous influences, he believes they are atypical of what goes on in nature. He suggests that the mechanistic explanations of the world that have continued from Laplace to Richard Dawkins should be replaced by an understanding that most of nature is cloud-like rather than clock-like. He regards the mind, soul and body as different aspects of the same underlying reality—\"dual aspect monism\"—writing that \"there is only one stuff in the world (not two—the material and the mental) but it can occur in two contrasting states (material and mental phases, a physicist might say) which explain our perception of the difference between mind and matter.\" He believes that standard physical causation cannot adequately describe the manifold ways in which things and people interact, and uses the phrase \"active information\" to describe how, when several outcomes are possible, there may be higher levels of causation that choose which one occurs.\n\nSometimes Christianity seems to him to be just too good to be true, but when this sort of doubt arises he says to himself, \"All right then, deny it,\" and writes that he knows this is something he could never do.\n\nPolkinghorne considers that \"the question of the existence of God is the single most important question we face about the nature of reality\" and quotes with approval Anthony Kenny: \"After all, if there is no God, then God is incalculably the greatest single creation of the human imagination.\" He addresses the questions of \"Does the concept of God make sense? If so, do we have reason for believing in such a thing?\" He is \"cautious about our powers to assess coherence,\" pointing out that in 1900 a \"competent ... undergraduate could have demonstrated the 'incoherence'\" of quantum ideas. He suggests that \"the nearest analogy in the physical world [to God] would be ... the Quantum Vacuum.\"\n\nHe suggests that God is the ultimate answer to Leibniz's great question \"why is there something rather than nothing?\" The atheist's \"plain assertion of the world's existence\" is a \"grossly impoverished view of reality ... [arguing that] theism explains more than a reductionist atheism can ever address.\" He is very doubtful of St Anselm's Ontological Argument. Referring to Gödel's incompleteness theory, he said: \"If we cannot prove the consistency of arithmetic it seems a bit much to hope that God's existence is easier to deal with,\" concluding that God is \"ontologically necessary, but not logically necessary.\" He \"does not assert that God's existence can be demonstrated in a logically coercive way (any more than God's non-existence can) but that theism makes more sense of the world, and of human experience, than does atheism.\" He cites in particular:\n\n\nPolkinghorne regards the problem of evil as the most serious intellectual objection to the existence of God. He believes that \"The well-known free will defence in relation to moral evil asserts that a world with a possibility of sinful people is better than one with perfectly programmed machines. The tale of human evil is such that one cannot make that assertion without a quiver, but I believe that it is true nevertheless. I have added to it the free-process defence, that a world allowed to make itself is better than a puppet theatre with a Cosmic Tyrant. I think that these two defences are opposite sides of the same coin, that our nature is inextricably linked with that of the physical world which has given us birth.\"\n\nPolkinghorne accepts evolution. Following the resignation of Michael Reiss, the director of education at the Royal Society—who had controversially argued that school pupils who believed in creationism should be used by science teachers to start discussions, rather than be rejected \"per se\"—Polkinghorne argued in \"The Times\" that there is a distinction between believing in the mind and purpose of a divine creator, and what he calls creationism \"in that curious North American sense,\" with a literal interpretation of Genesis 1 and the belief that evolution is wrong, a position he rejects.\n\nNancy Frankenberry, Professor of Religion at Dartmouth College, has described Polkinghorne as the finest British theologian/scientist of our time, citing his work on the possible relationship between chaos theory and natural theology. Owen Gingerich, an astronomer and former Harvard professor, has called him a leading voice on the relationship between science and religion.\n\nThe British philosopher Simon Blackburn has criticized Polkinghorne for using primitive thinking and rhetorical devices instead of engaging in philosophy. When Polkinghorne argues that the minute adjustments of cosmological constants for life points towards an explanation beyond the scientific realm, Blackburn argues that this relies on a natural preference for explanation in terms of agency. Blackburn writes that he finished Polkinghorne's books in \"despair at humanity's capacity for self-deception.\" Against this, Freeman J. Dyson called Polkinghorne's arguments on theology and natural science \"polished and logically coherent.\" The novelist Simon Ings, writing in the \"New Scientist\", said Polkinghorne's argument for the proposition that God is real is cogent and his evidence elegant.\n\nRichard Dawkins, formerly Professor for Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, writes that the same three names of British scientists who are also sincerely religious crop up with the \"likable familiarity of senior partners in a firm of Dickensian lawyers\": Arthur Peacocke, Russell Stannard, and John Polkinghorne, all of whom have either won the Templeton Prize or are on its board of trustees. Dawkins writes that he is not so much bewildered by their belief in a cosmic lawgiver, but by their beliefs in the minutiae of Christianity, such as the resurrection and forgiveness of sins, and that such scientists, in Britain and in the U.S., are the subject of bemused bafflement among their peers. Polkinghorne responded that \"debating with Dawkins is hopeless, because there's no give and take. He doesn't give you an inch. He just says no when you say yes\" and writes in \"Questions of Truth\" that he hopes Dawkins will be a bit less baffled once he reads it.\n\nA.C. Grayling criticized the Royal Society for allowing its premises to be used in connection with the launch of \"Questions of Truth\", describing it as a scandal, and suggesting that Polkinghorne had exploited his fellowship there to publicize a \"weak, casuistical and tendentious pamphlet.\" After implying that the book's publisher, Westminster John Knox, was a self-publisher, Grayling went on to write that Polkinghorne and others were eager to see the credibility accorded to scientific research extended to religious perspectives through association.\n\nIn contrast to Grayling, science historian Edward B. Davis praises \"Questions of Truth\", saying the book provides \"the kind of technical information...that scientifically trained readers will appreciate—yet they can be read profitably by anyone interested in science and Christianity.\" Davis concludes, \"It hasn't been easy to steer a middle course between fundamentalism and modernism, particularly on issues involving science. Polkinghorne has done that very successfully for a generation, and for this he ought to be both appreciated and emulated.\"\n\nPolkinghorne has written 34 books, translated into 18 languages; 26 concern science and religion, often for a popular audience.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is offered to all visitors to the Darbar Sahib in a Gurdwara. It is regarded as a treat for attendees of gurmat seminars. As it has a very high sugar and oil content, visitors may ask the Sewadar for a small portion. As a sign of humility and respect, visitors accept the Karah sitting, with hands raised and cupped. The offering and receiving of this food is a vital part of hospitality protocols. It has the same amount of whole-wheat flour, clarified butter and sugar, to emphasize the equality of men and women. The Sewadar serves it out of the same bowl to everyone in equal portions. The Karah is a sacred food; if it is not accepted, it may be interpreted by some Sikhs as an insult. Karah is also taken at the initiation ceremony of Amrit Sanchar at the very end where it is shared out equally among all. It is a symbol showing that everyone is equal.\n\nThe Gurdwara is the place where Sikhs go to worship. Gurdwaras can be any size or shape, but one thing they always have is a kitchen, or langar.

{"id": "1993856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993856", "title": "Ketu (mythology)", "text": "Ketu (mythology)\n\nKetu (Sanskrit: केतु, IAST: ) () is the descending (i.e 'south') lunar node in Vedic, or Hindu astrology. According to some accounts in Hindu mythology, Ketu belongs to Jaimini Gotra, whereas Rahu is from Paiteenasa gotra and hence both are totally different entities with distinct characteristics but are two parts of a common body. Ketu is generally referred to as a \"shadow\" planet. It is believed to have a tremendous impact on human lives and also the whole creation. In some special circumstances it helps someone achieve the zenith of fame. Ketu is often depicted with a gem or star on his head signifying a mystery light. \n\nAs per Vedic astrology Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other orbitally (as well as in the birth charts). This coincides with the precessional orbit of moon or the ~18 year rotational cycle of the lunar ascending and descending nodes on the earth’s ecliptic plane. Ketu rules the Scorpio zodiac sign together with Mangala\n\nAstronomically, Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes. The fact that eclipses occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points gives rise to the understanding of swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the snake. \n\nOften Ketu is misunderstood as Uranus during Sanskrit to English translation, however, Uranus isn’t visible to the naked eye and its discovery is attributed to the use of high resolution telescopes in modern astronomy.\n\nIn Hindu astrology Ketu represents karmic collections both good and bad, spirituality and supernatural influences. Ketu signifies the spiritual process of the refinement of materialization to spirit and is considered both malefic and benefic, as it causes sorrow and loss, and yet at the same time turns the individual to God. In other words, it causes material loss in order to force a more spiritual outlook in the person. Ketu is a \"karaka\" or indicator of intelligence, wisdom, non-attachment, fantasy, penetrating insight, derangement, and psychic abilities. Ketu is believed to bring prosperity to the devotee's family, removes the effects of snakebite and illness arising out of poisons. He grants good health, wealth and cattle to his devotees. Ketu is the lord of three nakshatras or lunar mansions: Ashvini, Magha and Mula.\n\nKetu is considered responsible for \"moksha\", \"sannyasa\", self-realization, \"gnana\", a wavering nature, restlessness, the endocrine system and slender physique.\n\nThe people who come under the influence of Ketu can achieve great heights, most of them spiritual.\n\nRahu, being a karmic planet would show the necessity and urge to work on a specific area of life where there had been ignorance in the past life. To balance the apparent dissatisfaction one has to go that extra mile to provide a satisfactory settlement in the present lifetime. \n\nRuler of Ketu: According to the most popular astrology text Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, (BPHS) Ketu is related to Matsya.\n\nExaltation and Debilitation: This has been a debatable point in astrology, as per BPHS Ketu is exalted in the sign of Scorpio and debilitated in Taurus, however, many astrologers have disputed this and most modern astrologers now seem to agree that Ketu is exalted in Sagittarius and debilitated in Gemini . This stands to logic as Ketu is a torso and a prominent part of Sagittarius is big horse torso attached to a male upper body. \n\nNegative Significations: While Ketu is considered malefic and has been mostly associated with negative things. Most people consider it a difficult planet as it brings lot of troubles on the material plane. It often brings a sense of detachment, losses, mindlessness, wandering, and confusion in one’s life. \n\nPositive Significations: There is a much deeper side to Ketu and it has been called the most spiritual of all planets. Ketu has been considered the planet of enlightenment and liberation. As the one who has “lost his head (worldly senses)” Being a personification of renunciation (torso without a head who needs nothing). Ketu the ascetic that wants to go beyond the mundane life and achieve the final liberation.\n\n \n"}

Originally, a \"Christmas carol\" referred to a piece of vocal music in carol form whose lyrics centre on the theme of Christmas or the Christmas season.\n\nMany traditional Christmas carols focus on the Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus, while others celebrate the Twelve Days of Christmas that range from 25 December to 5 January. As a result, many Christmas Carols can be related to St Stephen's Day (26 December), St John's Day (27 December), Feast of Holy Innocents (28 December), St Sylvester's Day (31 December), and the Epiphany. Examples of this are \"We Three Kings\" (an Epiphany song), and \"Good King Wenceslas\" (a carol for St. Stephen's Day). Nonetheless, some Christmas Carols, both religious and secular, now regarded as Christmas songs have become associated with the Christmas season even though the lyrics may not specifically refer to Christmas – for example, \"Deck the Halls\" (a pagan Yuletide drinking song) and \"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" (an Advent chant). Other Christmas songs focus on more secular Christmas themes, such as winter scenes, family gatherings, and Santa Claus (\"Jingle Bells\", \"O Christmas Tree, Home for the Holidays\", \"Jolly Old St. Nicholas\", etc.).\n\nThe English titles are taken from the \"Hymns of Universal Praise\" and the \"Chinese New Hymnal\".\n\nThe list is based primarily on carols and hymns mentioned in the Song Book for the Danish Folk High School.\n\nWhere possible, a carol title is linked to its (Danish) Wikipedia entry, where the carol can be heard. Otherwise, a carol title has been linked to its entry at the Danish Hymn Book Online.\n\nCarolling, i.e. dancing around, is practised - probably unintentionally - in Danish Christmas tradition, when a Christmas party join hands forming a chain around the family Christmas tree and walk, dance or run around the Christmas tree depending on the Christmas carol or song sung.\n\nSee also: (List of Ukrainian carols on the Ukrainian Wikipedia)\n\n"}

At its height, the empire spanned from Turkey and Rhodes in the west to Pakistan in the east, and also included territory in contemporary Caucasus, Yemen, UAE, Oman, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Central Asia.\n\nThe Sasanian Empire was recognized as one of the main powers in the world alongside its neighboring arch rival, the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years. The Sasanian dynasty began with Ardashir I in 224, who was a Persian from Estakhr, and was descended from the Achaemenid Kings, and ended with Yazdegerd III in 651. The downfall of the Sasanian Empire proved of great significance and effects to Zoroastrianism, the state religion of the Sasanian Empire. The previous Zoroastrian shahanshahs were replaced with Muslim Caliphs who forced the Zoroastrians and their faith to endure harsh conditions, including the destruction of fire temples throughout the previous Sasanian Empire and marginalization of the faith.\n\nArdashir I (\"r.\" 224–242), the founder of the Sassanian Empire, introduced the title \"Shahanshah of the Iranians\" (Middle Persian: ; Parthian: \"\"). Ardashir's immediate successor, Shapur I (\"r.\" 240/42–270/72) chooses the titles in a precise manner in the inscription at Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. In that Shapur names four of his Sasanian predecessors with different titles and in \"an ascending order of importance\" by giving the title (\"Xwaday\") \"the lord\" to Sasan, \"the king\" to Papag, \"King of Kings of Iranians\" to Ardashir, and \"king of kings of Iranians and non-Iranians\" ( ;; ) to himself. The title \"King of Kings of Iranians and non-Iranians\" has also seen on a single silver coin of Shapur I, which indicates that the title was introduced after his victory over Romans and incorporation of non-Iranian lands into the Sassanian realms. The title was later used in coins of all later Sassanian kings.\n\nThe head of the Sasanian Empire was the \"shahanshah\" (king of kings), also simply known as the \"shah\" (king). His health and welfare was always important and the phrase “May you be immortal\" was used to reply to him with. By looking on the Sasanian coins which appeared from the 6th-century and afterwards, a moon and sun is noticeable. The meaning of the moon and sun, in the words of the Iranian historian Touraj Daryaee, “suggest that the king was at the center of the world and the sun and moon revolved around him. In effect he was the “king of the four corners of the world,\" which was an old Mesopotamian idea.\" The king saw all other rulers, such as the Romans, Turks, and Chinese, as being beneath him. The king wore colorful clothes, makeup, a heavy crown, while his beard was decorated with gold. The early Sasanian kings considered themselves of divine descent; they called themselves for “bay\" (divine).\n\nWhen the king went to the publicity, he was hidden behind a curtain, and had some of his men in front of him, whose duty was to keep the masses away from the king and to make his way clear. When one came to the king, he/she had to prostrate before him, also known as \"proskynesis\". The king was guarded by a group of royal guards, known as the \"pushtigban\". On other occasions, the king was protected by a group of palace guards, known as the \"darigan\". Both of these groups were enlisted from royal families of the Sasanian Empire, and were under the command of the \"hazarbed\", who was in charge of the king's safety, controlled the entrance of the kings palace, presented visitors to the king, and was allowed to be given military command or used in negotiations. The \"hazarbed\" was also allowed in some cases to serve as the royal executioner. During Nowruz (Iranian new year) and Mihragan (Mihr's day), the king would hold a speech.\n\nThroughout its existence, the Sassanid Empire was an absolute monarchy. The Shahenshah was the height of authority, with satraps ruling over their satrapies underneath them. The shahanshah was the highest form of authority throughout the empire, but often faced rebellions from their satraps. In fact, the Sasanian Empire had been founded when a satrap rebelled against the Parthian Empire.\n\nThe Sasanian Empire reached its greatest extent under Khosrau II, who reigned for 38 years; the longest reigning king was Shapur II, who reigned for 70 years.\n\nThe Sasanian kings regarded themselves as successors of the Achaemenid Empire, and many Sasanian kings' goal was to conquer all territory previously held by the Achaemenids.\n\nThe table below lists Sasanian shahanshahs and titles used by them.\n\nTitles used by the Sasanian shahanshahs was:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "193489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193489", "title": "Mandaeans", "text": "Mandaeans\n\nMandaeans () are an ethnoreligious group indigenous to the alluvial plain of southern Mesopotamia and are followers of Mandaeism, a Gnostic religion. The Mandaeans were originally native speakers of Mandaic, a Semitic language that evolved from Eastern Middle Aramaic, before many switched to colloquial Iraqi Arabic and Modern Persian. Mandaic is mainly preserved as a liturgical language. In the aftermath of the Iraq War of 2003, the indigenous Mandaic community of Iraq, which used to number 60,000–70,000 persons, collapsed; most of the community relocated to nearby Iran, Syria and Jordan, or formed diaspora communities beyond the Middle East. The other indigenous community of Iranian Mandaeans has also been dwindling as a result of religious persecution over that decade.\n\nThere are several indications of the ultimate origin of the Mandaeans. Early religious concepts and terminologies recur in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and \"Jordan\" has been the name of every baptismal water in Mandaeism. The Mandaic language is a dialect of southeastern Aramaic and is closely related to the language of the Babylonian Talmud. There is archaeological evidence that attests to the Mandaean presence in pre-Islamic Iraq. Some scholars, including Kurt Rudolph connect the early Mandaeans with the Jewish sect of the Nasoraeans.\n\nIt appears that Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was partly influenced by the Mandaeans.\n\nA number of ancient Aramaic inscriptions dating back to the 2nd century CE were uncovered in Elymais. Although the letters appear quite similar to the Mandaean ones, it is doubtful whether the inhabitants of Elymais were Mandaeans. Under Parthian and early Sasanian rule, foreign religions were tolerated. The situation changed by the ascension of Bahram I in 273, who under the influence of the zealous Zoroastrian high priest Kartir persecuted all non-Zoroastrian religions. It is thought that this persecution encouraged the consolidation of Mandaean religious literature.\nThe persecutions instigated by Kartir seems to temporarily erase Mandaeans from recorded history. Traces of their presence can still however be found in the so-called Mandaean magical bowls and lead strips which were produced from the 3rd to the 7th centuries.\n\nThe Mandaeans re-appear at the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia, when their \"head of the people\" Anush son of Danqa appears before Muslim authorities showing them a copy of the Ginza Rabba, the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be John the Baptist, who is also mentioned in the Quran. The connection with the Quranic Sabians provided them acknowledgement as People of the Book, a legal minority religion within the Muslim Empire. They appear to have flourished during the early Islamic period, as attested by the voluminous expansion of Mandaic literature and canons. Tib near Wasit is particularly noted as an important scribal centre. Yaqut al-Hamawi describes Tib as a town inhabited by Nabatean (i.e. Aramaic speaking) Sabians who consider themselves to be descendants of Seth son of Adam.\n\nThe status of the Mandaeans became an issue for the Abbasid al-Qahir Billah. To avoid further investigation by the authorities, the Mandaeans paid a bribe of 50,000 dinars and were left alone. It appears that the Mandaeans were even exempt from paying the Jizya, otherwise imposed upon non-Muslims.\n\nEarly contact with Europeans came about in the mid-16th century, when Portuguese missionaries encountered Mandaeans in Southern Iraq and controversially designated them \"Christians of St. John\". In the next centuries Europeans became more acquainted with the Mandaeans and their religion.\n\nThe Mandaeans suffered persecution under the Qajar rule in the 1780s. The dwindling community was threatened with complete annihilation, when a cholera epidemic broke out in Shushtar and half of its inhabitants died. The entire Mandaean priesthood perished and Mandeism was restored due only to the efforts of few learned men such as Yahia Bihram. Another danger threatened the community in 1870, when the local governor of Shushtar massacred the Mandaeans against the will of the Shah. As a result of these events the Mandaeans retired to the more inaccessible Central Marshes of Iraq.\n\nFollowing the First World War, the Mandaeans were still largely living in rural areas in the lower parts of British protected Iraq and Iran. Owing to the rise of Arab nationalism, Mandaeans were Arabised at an accelerated rate, especially during the 1950s and '60s. The Mandaeans were also forced to abandon their stands on the cutting of hair and forced military service, which are strictly prohibited in Mandaenism.\n\nThe 2003 Iraq War brought more troubles to the Mandaeans, as the security situation deteriorated. Many members of the Mandaean community, who were known as goldsmiths, were targeted by criminal gangs for ransoms. The rise of Islamic Extremism forced thousands to flee the country, after they were given the choice of conversion or death. It is estimated that around 90% of Iraqi Mandaeans were either killed or have fled after the American-led invasion.\n\nThe Mandaeans of Iran lived chiefly in Ahvaz, Iranian Khuzestan, but have moved as a result of the Iran–Iraq War to other cities such as Tehran, Karaj and Shiraz. The Mandaeans, who were traditionally considered as People of the Book (members of a protected religion under Islamic rule) lost this status after the Islamic Revolution. Local authorities in Iranian Islamic Republic are known to encourage harassment and persecution of the Mandaeans. However, despite this, Iranian Mandaeans still maintain successful businesses and factories in areas such as Ahwaz. In April 1996, the cause of the Mandaeans' religious status in the Islamic Republic was raised. The parliament came to the conclusion that \"Sabaeans\" were included in the protected status of People of the Book alongside Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians and specified that, from a legal viewpoint, there is no prohibition against Muslims associating with Mandaeans, who are often regarded as being the Sabaeans mentioned explicitly in the Qur'an. That same year, Ayatollah Sajjadi of Al-Zahra University in Qom posed three questions regarding the Mandaeans' beliefs and seemed satisfied with the answers. These rulings however, did not lead to Mandaeans regaining their more officially recognized status as People of the Book.\n\nPre-Iraq War, The Iraqi Mandaean community was centered in Baghdad. The Mandeans originate, however, from southern Iraq in cities like Nasiriyah. Many also live across the border in Southwestern Iran in the cities of Ahvaz and Khorramshahr. Mandaean emigration from Iraq began during Saddam Hussein's rule, but accelerated greatly after the American-led invasion and subsequent occupation. Since the invasion Mandaeans, like other Iraqi ethno-religious minorities (such as Assyrians, Armenians, Yazidi, Roma and Shabaks), have been subjected to violence, including murders, kidnappings, rapes, evictions, and forced conversions. Mandaeans, like many other Iraqis, have also been targeted for kidnapping since many worked as goldsmiths. Mandaeism is pacifistic and forbids its adherents from carrying weapons.\n\nMany Iraqi Mandaeans have fled the country in the face of this violence, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction. Out of the over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s, fewer than 5,000 to 10,000 remain there; as of early 2007, more than 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan as a result of the Iraq War.\n\nThe number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 and 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.\n\nUntil the Iranian Revolution, Mandaeans had mainly been concentrated in the Khuzestan province, where the community used to exist by side with the local Arab population. They had mainly been practising the profession of goldsmith, passing it from generation to generation. After the fall of the shah, its members faced increased religious discrimination, and many sought a new home in Europe and the Americas.\n\nIn Iran, the \"Gozinesh\" Law (passed in 1985) has the effect of prohibiting Mandaeans from fully participating in civil life. This law and other \"gozinesh\" provisions make access to employment, education, and a range of other areas conditional upon a rigorous ideological screening, the principal prerequisite for which is devotion to the tenets of Islam. These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans, Ahl-e Haq, and Baha'i.\n\nIn 2002 the US State Department granted Iranian Mandaeans protective refugee status; since then roughly 1,000 have emigrated to the US, now residing in cities such as San Antonio, Texas. On the other hand, the Mandaean community in Iran has increased over the last decade, because of the exodus from Iraq of the main Mandaean community, which used to be 60,000–70,000 strong.\n\nFollowing the Iraq War, the Mandaean community dispersed throughout the Middle East. Living as refugees the Mandaeans in Jordan number 49 families, while in Syria there are as many as 1,250 families.\n\nThere are small Mandaean diaspora populations in Sweden (c. 7,000), Australia (c. 3,500 as of 2006), the USA (c. 2,500), the UK (c. 1,000), and Canada. Sweden became a popular destination because a Mandaean community existed there before the war and the Swedish government has a liberal asylum policy toward Iraqis. Of the 7000 Mandaeans in Sweden, 1,500 live in Södertälje. The scattered nature of the Mandaean diaspora has raised fears among Mandaeans for the religion's survival. Mandaeism has no provision for conversion, and the religious status of Mandaeans who marry outside the faith and their children is disputed.\n\nThe status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call upon the U.S. government to extend refugee status to the community. In 2007, \"The New York Times\" ran an op-ed piece in which Swarthmore professor Nathaniel Deutsch called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community. Iraqi Mandaeans were given refugee status by the US State Department in 2007. Since then more than 2500 have entered the US, many settling in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nOn the 15th of September 2018 the first ever purpose-built Mendi in Europe was consecrated in Dalby, Scania, Sweden.\n\nMandaeans are a closed ethno-religious community, practicing Mandaeism, which is a Gnostic religion (Aramaic \"manda\" means \"knowledge,\" as does Greek \"gnosis\") with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist.\n\nThe Mandaeans group existence into two main categories: light and dark. They have a dualistic view of life, that encompasses both good and evil; all good is thought to have come from the World of Light (i.e. lightworld) and all evil from the World of Darkness. In relation to the body–mind dualism coined by Descartes, Mandaeans consider the body, and all material, worldly things, to have come from the Dark, while the soul (sometimes referred to as the mind) is a product of the lightworld. Mandaeans believe the World of Light is ruled by a heavenly being, known by many names, such as “Life,” “Lord of Greatness,” “Great Mind,” or “King of Light”. This being is so great, vast, and incomprehensible that no words can fully depict how awesome Life is. It is believed that an innumerable number of beings, manifested from the light, surround Life and perform cultic acts of worship to praise and honor this great being. They inhabit worlds separate from the lightworld and are commonly referred to as emanations from First Life; their names include Second, Third, and Fourth Life (i.e. Yōšamin, Abathur, and Ptahil ).\n\nThe Lord of Darkness is the ruler of the World of Darkness formed from dark waters representing chaos. A main defender of the darkworld is a giant monster, or dragon, with the name “Ur;” an evil, female ruler also inhabits the darkworld, known as “Ruha”. The Mandaeans believe these malevolent rulers created demonic offspring who consider themselves the owners of the Seven (planets) and Twelve (Zodiac signs).\n\nAccording to Mandaean beliefs, the world is a mixture of light and dark created by the demiurge (Ptahil) with help from dark powers, such as Ruha, the Seven, and the Twelve. Adam’s body (i.e. believed to be the first human created by God in Christian tradition) was fashioned by these dark beings; however, his “soul” (or mind) was a direct creation from the Light. Therefore, many Mandaeans believe the human soul is capable of salvation because it originates from the lightworld. The soul, sometimes referred to as the “inner Adam” or “hidden Adam,” is in dire need of being rescued from the Dark, so it may ascend into the heavenly realm of the lightworld. Baptisms are a central theme in Mandaeanism, believed to be necessary for the redemption of the soul. Mandaeans do not perform a single baptism, as in religions such as Christianity; rather, they view baptisms as a ritualistic act capable of bringing the soul closer to salvation. Therefore, Mandaeans get baptized repeatedly during their lives. John the Baptist is a key figure for the Mandaeans; they consider him to have been a Mandaean (2015). John is referred to as a “disciple” or “priest,” most known for the countless number of baptisms he performed, which helped close the immense gap between the soul and salvation.\n\nToday, many Mandaeans are refugees and are not willing to accept converts into their religion. Sunday, as in other religious traditions, is their holy day, centered largely on mythical beliefs. Some Mandaeans consider Jesus an “apostate Mandaean”.\n\nThe Mandaic language is an eastern dialect of Aramaic, although its alphabet is unique. It has mainly survived as a liturgical language.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100393", "title": "Mortification of the flesh", "text": "Mortification of the flesh\n\nMortification of the flesh is an act by which an individual or group seeks to mortify, or put to death, their sinful nature, as a part of the process of sanctification. In Christianity, common forms of mortification that are practiced to this day include fasting, abstinence, as well as pious kneeling. Also common among Christian religious orders in the past were the wearing of sackcloth, as well as flagellation in imitation of Jesus of Nazareth's suffering and death by crucifixion. Christian theology holds that the Holy Spirit helps believers in the \"mortification of the sins of the flesh.\" Although the term 'mortification of the flesh', which is derived from and in the Bible, is primarily used in a Christian context, other cultures may have analogous concepts of self-denial; secular practices exist as well. Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) precursors include Zechariah 13:6 and I Kings 18:28-29 . Some forms unique to various Asian cultures are carrying heavy loads and immersion in water. \n\nThe term \"mortification of the flesh\" comes from the Book of Romans in the Christian Bible: \"For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.\" The same idea is seen in the following verses: \"Put to death what is earthly in you: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry\"; \"And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires\". Support for such behavior in the Old Testament is found here: \"Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.\"\n\nAccording to Christian exegesis, \"deeds of the body\" \"what is earthly\", refer to the \"wounded nature\" of man or his concupiscence (evil inclinations due to forming part of the Fall of Man); humanity suffers the consequences of the original sin. The Apostle Paul, who authored Romans, expected believers to \"put to death\" the deeds of the flesh. This is because the word in Koine Greek, the language in which the New Testament was originally written, for flesh is sarx (σάρξ). This word denotes the fallen or sinful elements, parts, and proclivities of humanity. This word is juxtaposed in Romans 8:13, cited above, with body (σῶμα), which more strictly refers to the physical body of a human. Thus in Romans 8:13 Paul is drawing a parallel between fallen people, with proclivities to sin without chance of redemption, and redeemed people who are so changed that mortification of their fleshly sin can turn to bodily life, from σάρξ to σῶμα.\n\nIn its simplest form, mortification of the flesh can mean merely denying oneself certain pleasures, such as permanently or temporarily abstaining (i.e. fasting), from food, alcoholic beverages, sexual relations, or an area of life that makes the person's spiritual life more difficult or burdensome. It can also be practiced by choosing a simple or even impoverished lifestyle; this is often one reason many monks of various religions take vows of poverty. Among votarists, traditional forms of physical mortification are the cilice and hair-shirts. In some of its more severe forms, it can mean using a discipline to flagellate oneself.\n\nIn Christianity, the Rev. Michael Geisler, a Catholic priest of the Opus Dei Prelature in St. Louis, wrote two articles explaining the theological purpose behind corporal mortification. \"Self-denial helps a person overcome both psychological and physical weakness, gives him energy, helps him grow in virtue and ultimately leads to salvation. It conquers the insidious demons of softness, pessimism and lukewarm faith that dominate the lives of so many today\" (\"Crisis magazine\" July/August 2005). Some theologians explain that the redemptive value of pain makes pain lovable in its effects, even though by itself it is not. Pain is temporal and limited, thus to undergo it is worthwhile to gain the real benefits. For those with this viewpoint, pain is seen as a means to an end. Thus, a modern Catholic saint, Josemaria Escriva said, while consoling a dying woman who was suffering in a hospital, \"Blessed be pain! Glorified be pain! Sanctified be pain!\" The root of the modern-day perplexity over mortification, according to some theologians, is the \"practical denial of God,\" a refusal to accept any but material realities.\n\nThe early Christian evangelist and church-planter Paul wrote, \"I chastise my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps when I have preached to others I myself should be castaway\" (1 Cor 9:27); \"In my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, that is the Church.\" (Col 1:24).\n\nThrough the centuries, some Christians have practiced voluntary penances as a way of imitating Jesus who, according to the New Testament, voluntarily accepted the sufferings of his passion and death on the cross at Calvary in order to redeem humankind. Some Christians note that the cross carried by Jesus is the crossbar or \"patibulum\", a rough tree trunk, which probably weighed between 80 and 110 pounds.\n\nChrist also fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, an example of submission to the first person of the Trinity, God the Father, and as a way of preparing for ministry. \nThe early Christians mortified the flesh through martyrdom and through what has been called \"confession of the faith\": accepting torture in a joyful way. As Christians experienced persecution, they often embraced their fate of suffering due to their love for Christ and the transformation they said they experienced from following him; these individuals became martyrs of the Christian faith. Saint Jerome, a Western church father and biblical scholar who translated the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate), was famous for his severe penances in the desert.\n\nSome canonized Catholic saints and founders of Roman Catholic religious organizations practiced mortification in order to imitate Christ. Another way of self-denial that developed quickly in the early centuries was celibacy, which the Roman Catholic tradition interprets as forsaking sex and procreation for a superior chastity and higher supernatural ends. Women affected by the eating disorder anorexia mirabilis often engaged in rituals aimed at causing them pain and injury, to remind them of Christ's suffering and make them unattractive to men.\n\nThe Augsburg Confession of the Lutheran Church supports the practice of mortification of the flesh, stating:\n\nIn the Lutheran tradition, mortification of the flesh is not done in order to earn merit, but instead to \"keep the body in a condition such that it does not hinder one from doing what one has been commanded to do, according to one's calling (Latin: \"juxta vocationem suam\").\" In \"The Ninety-Five Theses\", Martin Luther stated that \"inner repentance is worthless unless it produces various outward mortification of the flesh.\" He practiced mortification of the flesh through fasting and self-flagellation, even sleeping in a stone cell without a blanket.\n\nSamuel Wesley Sr. examined the writings of Thomas à Kempis on the mortification of the flesh and concluded that \"mortification is still an indispensable Christian duty.\" His son, John Wesley, the evangelical Christian progenitor of the Methodist Church continued \"to hold à Kempis in high regard\". As such, he likewise wrote that \"efforts to manifest true faith would be 'quickened' by self mortification and entire obedience\". Moreover, he \"spoke approvingly of 'voluntary instances of mortification' in his journals\". Methodist circuit riders were known for practicing the spiritual discipline of mortifying the flesh as they \"arose well before dawn for solitary prayer; they remained on their knees without food or drink or physical comforts sometimes for hours on end\". John Cennick, the first Methodist itinerant preacher, prayed nine times a day, fasted and \"fancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a sinner as himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns, crabs, and grass\". The Methodist evangelist John Wesley Childs was known for \"limiting what he would eat\" and choosing \"to walk beside his horse rather than to ride in order to demonstrate his willingness to suffer for his calling and to try[ing] to heighten his religious experience through subjecting himself to trials.\" The \"Wesleyan Methodist Magazine\" published a statement written by Matthew Henry for Christian believers:\nThe Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate states that \"mortification of the flesh, or the putting to death of the passions which hinder attainment of the kingdom of heaven, is practiced with three disciplines of self-denial\". These spiritual disciplines include \"unostentatious fasting or self-denial; increased prayer, by attending to worship and various devotions; and the sacrificial giving of alms (charitable donations).\"\n\nIt became \"quite common\" for members of the Oxford Movement within the Anglican Communion to practice self-flagellation using a discipline. Congregationalist writer and leader within the evangelical Christian movement, Sarah Osborn, practiced self-flagellation in order \"to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God\". According to other evangelical Christian commentators, using Paul's writings and other passages from the New Testament to justify the practise of mortification of the flesh is a complete misinterpretation. In the verses leading up to Col 1:24 Paul holds a very high view of Christ's redeeming work. \"He understands this redemptive work to be finished, completed, and perfected. Nothing remains to be done, and the suffering of Christ's followers does not put the finishing touches on the triumph of Calvary. Paul does not believe that suffering has any atoning benefit for himself or for others. It does, however, 'serve to increase Paul's living knowledge of Christ.'\" This suffering Paul refers to comes as one takes on the commission to share the gospel. Persecution and suffering such as that experienced by Christ will follow and Christians should see this suffering as a divine necessity. In chapter 9 \"Paul compares the evangelistic lifestyle of believers to athletes who sacrifice normal pursuits for the sake of strict training and a competitive edge\". In the Corinth church there were grey areas of lifestyle and behaviors (see 1 Cor 8) not specifically covered by the Mosaic law, and Paul was encouraging them to discipline themselves to abstain from those behaviors and practices for the sake of winning others to Christ. Mortification of the flesh being self-flagellation is something that is read into the text and an errant interpretation of it.\n\nSome indigenous cultures' shamans believe that endurance of pain or denial of appetites serves to increase spiritual power. In many indigenous cultures, painful rites are used to mark sexual maturity, marriage, procreation, or other major life stages. In Africa and Australia, indigenous people sometimes use genital mutilation on boys and girls that is intentionally painful, including circumcision, subincision, clitoridectomy, piercing, or infibulation. In some Native American tribes enduring scarification or the bites of ants are common rituals to mark a boy's transition to adulthood. Human rights organizations in several areas of the world have protested some of these methods, which can be forced upon the participants, although some are voluntary and are a source of pride and status.\n\nShamans often use painful rites and self-denial such as fasting or celibacy to attain transformation, or to commune with spirits.\n\nIt has been speculated that extreme practices of mortification of the flesh may be used to obtain an altered state of consciousness to achieve spiritual experiences or visions. In modern times, members of the Church of Body Modification believe that by manipulating and modifying their bodies (by painful processes) they can strengthen the bond between their bodies and spirits, and become more spiritually aware. This group uses rites of passage from many traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism and shamanism, to seek their aims.\n\nIn some contexts, modern practices of body modification and plastic surgery overlap with mortification. Often, secular people will undergo painful experiences in order to become more self-aware, to take control of their bodies or \"own\" them more fully, to bond with a group that is spiritual in its aims, or to overcome the body's limitations in ways that do not refer to any higher power. Many times these rites are intended to empower the participant, rather than humble them. This represents a very different aim than many traditional mortifications.\n\nRoland Loomis re-creates Sun dance ceremonies and suspensions for those who believe these painful procedures expand their consciousness. Musafar explains his use of these rites as a way to awaken the spirit to the body's limits, and put it in control of them. Others who have used these experiences to transcend physical limitations report a feeling of mastery over their physical circumstance, along with a widened perspective.\n\n"}
{"id": "438709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438709", "title": "Mount Putuo", "text": "Mount Putuo\n\nMount Putuo () is an island southeast of Shanghai, in Zhoushan prefecture of Zhejiang province, China. It is a renowned site in Chinese Buddhism, and is considered the bodhimanda of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Guanyin). Mount Putuo is one of the four sacred mountains in Chinese Buddhism, the others being Mount Wutai, Mount Jiuhua, and Mount Emei (Bodhimandas for Manjusri, Ksitigarbha, and Samantabhadra respectively).\n\nMount Putuo lies in the East China Sea and incorporates the beauty of both mountain and sea. Mountain Putuo is at 29°58′3～30°02′3 north latitude, 122°21′6～122°24′9 east longitude. Its area is approximately and there are numerous famous temples. Every year on the 19th day of the 2nd lunar month, 19th day of the 6th lunar month, and 19th day of the 9th lunar month of the Chinese calendar, it welcomes millions of people for the celebration of the birth of Guanyin.\n\nMount Putuo has been a pilgrimage site for over a thousand years. After the Tang dynasty, Mount Putuo became a center of Guanyin worship. Traditionally there were three main temples: The Puji si (, founded 10th cent.), the Fayu si (, founded 1580 CE), and the Huiji si (, founded 1793 CE). The site has received numerous renowned visitors over the ages, including the then 20-year-old future Chan-master Yinyuan Longqi (Japanese: Ingen), who came to the site in 1612, while looking for his father, who had disappeared fifteen years earlier. The modern scholar-monk Taixu spent several years in solitary retreat at a small hermitage on Putuo.\n\n\nThere are 238 species of natural trees and shrubs in Putuo Mountain, including 63 species of rare and precious ancient trees and more than 100 years old, belonging to 37 families and 53 genera, with the largest number of eucalyptus trees.\n\nThe list of plants in Mountain Putuo:\n\n\nThe rare plant\n\n\n\nMany of the Zhoushan Islands are now linked by bridges. This means that Putuoshan can easily be reached by bus from Shanghai and Ningbo. The bus terminates at Shenjiamen Bus Station. From the Banshengdong Wharf on the Shenjiamen waterfront it is a 10-minute ride by fast ferry (22 RMB) to Putuoshan. In Shanghai, the Nanpu Bridge Bus Station, Shanghai Stadium Sightseeing Bus Center and Shanghai South Long Distance Bus Station have several departures daily to Shenjiamen (4–5 hours, 138 RMB). In Ningbo, the North and South bus stations both have regular daily departures to Shenjiamen (2–3 hours, 60 RMB).\n\nThere are two flights daily from Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai to Putuo Airport which is only from Shenjiamen. (approx 800 RMB).\n\nThe ferry services mentioned below are still available but the bus services now provide a greater level of convenience and comfort. \nPutuoshan can be reached by boat from the major cities of Ningbo and Shanghai. It will take approximately an hour by boat to reach the wharf at Ningbo, from where a bus transports passengers to Ningbo city centre. There are two boats linking Putuoshan and Shanghai. One departs in the evening and travels overnight, arriving in the early morning; the other leaves early in the day from a wharf outside of Shanghai city centre but takes less than two hours.\n\nThe transportation system of Mountain Putuo is very special. Private cars are not allowed there, and people can only rely on public transport. The reason for this rule is because the area of Putuo Mountain is very small, and only one road runs through the entire island. It is therefore necessary to control the number of cars on the island to avoid traffic congestion. At the same time, excessive vehicle emissions will affect the environment and air quality of Mountain Putuo. In addition, Putuo Mount is mountainous, so buses are not flexible enough for people to travel. And as there are thousands of tourists coming to Mountain Putuo and the number of buses is far from enough, the cable car has become another important means of transportation.\n\nIt is an Asian warm-temperate moist climate (\"Cfa\") and has four distinct seasons. It has plenty of rain and fog. The average temperature of whole year is . The coldest month is January, average temperature is . The hottest month is August, temperature is . It has typhoon season on July, August and September. The average speed of wind is .\n\nThe Mount Putuo has all-year-round travel seasons, but in regard to when and where to get on the island, tourists should be careful and check the weather forecast beforehand.\n"}

It is a private co-educational international Bahá'í school, drawing students from all over the world and is under the supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India.\n\nIt was founded in August 1945, and was one of the first Bahá'í education projects in India. In the 1970s and 1980s, the school setup programmes to assist the poor and underdeveloped villages in the region. It started as a service project for students and evolved into a separate institution known as the New Era Development Institute in 1987. The National Spiritual Assembly of Norway established an institution - Norwegian Agency for International Development Cooperation - and in 1988 it began a working relationship with the institute, with support for a two-year rural community development program. In 1989, funding was extended to cover a one-year community development facilitators course and short courses on agriculture, rural technology, literacy, and domestic science.\n\nNEHS is one of the top boarding schools in India. It did have a higher secondary school(11th-12th) till 1999, but discontinued it from 2000. Class 11th and 12th have been reintroduced from 2010 and the school offers Science and Commerce fields. The shooting of the film \"Taare Zameen Par\" took place here. The school played host to \"Amul Junior MasterChef Swaad ke Ustaad\" (a cooking reality show) where the contestants prepared food for the students of the school. The show was aired on Star Plus on October 26, 2013. Prominent students include Twinkle and Rinke Khanna - daughters of the Indian actress Dimple.\n\nThe principal Dr. Mehrassa supervises the school from Canada, Mr. Kalmadi is the acting principal. The school regularly reaches district level in sports such as football, basketball and cricket.\n\nThe present site was moved into in 1953 and consisted of five buildings. A play field and several added dormitories in 1980s gave the school the room to add over 500 students bringing the total student population to over 1000. In the 1990s the campus went through massive infrastructure growth and renovation - gaining its own power plant, campus fencing, intercom system, phone system for students, parents and staff, three wells, solar heating for the dining hall and a large garden. Computers handle student records, accounts, maintenance, personnel, and other administrative areas as well as facilitating student-parent communication.\n\nSpecial attention is given to academic excellence, moral education, specifically noted by the Universal House of Justice, values for world citizenship, and social and economic development in rural areas. Subject areas significantly expanded through the 1990s to include advances across the K-12 curriculum with peace and cooperative learning programs, computer training programs and extracurricular sports clubs and educational field trips.\n\nThe school was registered with the state in 1954 and the first students took their external examinations in 1958. Gloria Faizi, Abu'l-Qásim Faizi's wife, helped bring the school onto a more financial status by providing leadership and attracting investments. The current accreditation includes the standard ten high school exam of the Central Board of Secondary Education though it is increasingly switching to Indian Certificate of Secondary Education.\n\nThe Secondary Section in 2007 received top awards for all of Panchgani (with additional high marks in specific subject areas)\n\nThe Secondary Science program won awards in 2003 (National Level Science Talent Search Examination and Best Participation Award in the NSTSE)\n\nThe Secondary Computer Science curriculum serves the International General Certificate of Secondary Education.\n\nThe Secondary Arts program can support students reaching for the annual Government of Maharashtra Elementary and Intermediate Art Exams.\n\nAll topic areas have vocational courses\n\nThe school is ranked 64th across India by a broad range of criteria.\n\nIn 2005/6, New Era High School two students ranked 857th and 1824th (over 2000 were ranked) across all Indian students competing for the Amul Shakti Vidyashree award.\n\nAlong with standard academic and arts subject areas, and multilingual programs begin, a featured area is values education (including Peace Education, Conflict Resolution, and Environmental Education.)\n\nIn addition to the awards winning academic and arts subjects areas, most subject areas develop extension programs - poly-lingual plays, student quiz teams, and community outreach.\n\nThe computer system, especially present in the Secondary Section, is Open Source based - highlighting Mandriva 2007 and Fedora Core 7, OpenOffice.org, and GIMP.\n\nThe school developed a residential prefect-oriented system. The prefect body consists of thirty-two students who represent four virtues - Peace, Respect, Harmony and Wisdom.

Measuring 40 by 45 centimeters the image is a fresco executed on a thin layer of plaster no thicker than an egg shell. Over the centuries, devotions to Our Lady of the Good Counsel grew among saints and Popes, to the extent that a reference to it was added to the Litany of Loreto and the devotion spread throughout the world. Her feast day is April 26.\nIn the 5th century, during the reign of Pope Sixtus III, the town of Genazzano, about south of Rome, had contributed a large portion of its revenue for the Roman basilica now known as Santa Maria Maggiore. In appreciation, a church, called Santa Maria, was built in Genazzano and was later entrusted to the Augustinian Order in 1356. The Genazzano church became a popular place of pilgrimage. Numerous cures were said took place there. The Augustinian friars were invited to minister to the spiritual needs of the pilgrims. They continue to serve there to this day.\n\nAccording to tradition, over time the old Augustinian church of Santa Maria in Genazzano fell into disrepair. A local widow undertook to renovate the church but ran out of funds, for which she was heartily mocked for her lack of foresight. In the year 1467, in the midst of the festivities for the Feast of Saint Mark, the townfolk suddenly heard \"exquisite music.\" A mysterious cloud was then said to have descended and obliterated an unfinished wall of the parish church. In front of the populace, the cloud dissipated and a beautiful fresco, no thicker than a carte-de-visite and no more than eighteen inches square, of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child was revealed. It was widely believed that it had been miraculously transported from a church in Scutari, Albania, when that area was besieged by the Turks.\n\nThe picture of Our Lady was at first called \"La Madonna del Paradiso\" and now better known as \"Madonna del Buon Consiglio\" (Our Lady of Good Counsel).\n\nSuch was the holy image's reputation that Pope Urban VIII made a \"glittering\" pilgrimage there in 1630, invoking the protection of the Queen of Heaven, as did Pope Pius IX in 1864. On November 17, 1682, Pope Innocent XI had the picture solemnly crowned. Among her noted clients have been St Aloysius Gonzaga, St Alphonsus Liguori, St John Bosco, and Blessed Stephen Bellesini.\n\nArt experts consulted during a restoration conducted between 1957 and 1959 suggest that the image of the Madonna was once part of a larger fresco that covered the wall and was subsequently covered over with plaster. They believe the fresco is likely the work of the early fifteenth century artist Gentile da Fabriano, probably painted around the time of Pope Martin V (1417-1431). There is also a statue in the German town of Essen which depicts this Mary.\n\nOn April 22, 1903, Pope Leo XIII included the invocation \"Mater boni consilii\" in the Litany of Loreto. In 1939, Venerable Pope Pius XII placed his pontificate under the maternal care of Our Lady of Good Counsel and composed a prayer to her.\n\nThe Augustinian Order contributed to the spread of this devotion internationally. In 1753, Pope Benedict XIV established the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel. Leo XIII, who was himself a member of the pious union, was deeply attached to this devotion.\n\nThrough the years, various institutions have been named in honor of Mary under the title of Our Lady of Good Counsel. These institutions include a college, high schools, and churches.\n\nHer Feast is celebrated on April 26.\n\nThe small Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel (the White Scapular) was presented by the Hermits of St Augustine to Pope Leo XIII, who, on December 19-21, 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences in a Decree of the Congregation of Rites.\n\nOn the front panel of the sacramental (to be made of white wool) is the image of the fresco of Our Lady of Good Counsel, with the inscription, “Mater boni consilii [ora pro nobis].” On the second segment is found the papal coat-of-arms, which includes the Triple Tiara and the Keys of Heaven, with the words of Leo XIII: “Fili acquisce consiliis ejus” (Child, listen to her counsels). \n\nOur Lady of Good Counsel is the Patroness of the Missionary Sisters of Saint Peter Claver, the National Council of Catholic Women, and of the Catholic Women's League of Canada.\n\nThe \"Midwest Augustinians\" headquartered in Chicago have also adopted Our Lady of Good Counsel as their patroness, having named their Augustinian jurisdiction as the \"Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel.\"\n\nThe town Essen in the German Ruhr- Area is under the patronage of the Lady. The High church the Münster of Essen as it is called was given to her after the Ruhrbistum was established.\n\nOur Lady of Good Counsel in White Plains, New York is the site of the motherhouse of the Sisters of the Divine Compassion. The Good Counsel Complex is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n\n"}

The act of so moving is termed pioneering. Bahá'ís refrain from using the term \"missionary\". The first pioneer to enter a country or region mentioned in `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan is given the title of Knight of Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nDuring the Ten Year Crusade which ran from 1953 to 1963, hundreds of pioneers settled in countries and territories throughout the world, which eventually led to the establishment of 44 new National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies and the increase in the Bahá'í population.\n\nThe teaching work done by pioneers was done in many different ways including, but not limited to\nShoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá’í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, has written:\n\nFor Bahá'ís, pioneering refers to something similar to missionary work. However, Bahá'ís do not consider pioneering to be proselytism, a word which often implies the use of coercion to convert someone to a different religion.\n\nThe following is a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual:\n\nDuring Bahá'u'lláh's lifetime (died 1892) he encouraged some of his followers to move to India. When the religion began to grow in India, other Bahá'ís moved on - for example entering Vietnam and other places in 1950s. During the 1950s and 1960s the Bahá'í Faith spread rapidly in Vietnam, and the nearby countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. From 1957 to 1963 the Bahá'í community in Vietnam had more than tripled.\n\nThe Tablets of the Divine Plan to the followers of the religion in the North America, especially to the United States, in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. Their publication was delayed in the United States until 1919 — after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. Following their publication the first Bahá'í permanent resident in South America, Leonora Armstrong, arrived in Brazil in 1921. Shoghi Effendi, who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\n\n\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\"\nFollowing the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19th calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937-44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America. The first pioneer to Chile arrived in 1940 when her ship docked at Arica. After arriving in Panama in 1940, the first Guaymí Bahá'í converted in the 1960s. In 1985-6 the \"Camino del Sol\" project included indigenous Guaymí Bahá'ís of Panama traveling with the Venezuelan indigenous Carib speaking and Guajira Bahá'ís through the Venezuelan states of Bolívar, Amazonas and Zulia sharing their religion.\n\nIn 1946, a great pioneering movement began with sixty percent of the British Bahá'í community eventually relocating. Internationally this effort would take the Bahá'í Faith to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland and raising the numbers of Local Assemblies in the British Isles. In 1950-1 the Baha'is of the British Isles pioneered to Tanganyika, Uganda, and Kenya. On August 3, 1951 pioneers arrived in Kampala from which pioneers went to French Equatorial Africa, and Cameroon and so on. From 1953 to 1963 some 250 Americans and Persians moved to many locations. Wide-scale growth in the religion was observed following this across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n"}

The courts and government in both theory and practice uphold a constitutional right to freedom of speech, thought, and belief. A large majority of Papua New Guineans identify themselves as members of a Christian church (96% in the 2000 census); however, many combine their Christian faith with traditional indigenous beliefs and practices. Other religions represented in the country include the Bahá'í faith and Islam.\n\nThe 2010 Report on International Religious Freedom by the United States Department of State states that religious participations in the country are relatively peaceful and no reports of conflict are being reported. Public schools host a religious subject once per week and representatives of Christian churches teach the lessons, and the students attend the class operated by the church of their parents' choice.

The first Bahá'ís move there (what Bahá'ís mean by \"pioneering\",) in Papua New Guinea arrived there in 1954. With local converts the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1958. The first National Spiritual Assembly was then elected in 1969. According to the census of 2000 the number of Bahá'ís does not exceed 21000. But the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on \"World Christian Encyclopedia\") estimated three times more Bahá'ís at 60000 or 0.9% of the nation in 2005 Either way it is the largest minority religion in Papua New Guinea, if a small one.

The Archdiocese comprises the department of Yonne, which is in the region of Bourgogne. Traditionally established in sub-apostolic times, the diocese as metropolis of Quarta Lugdunensis subsequently achieved metropolitical status. For a time, the Archbishop of Sens held the title \"Primate of the Gauls and Germania\". Until 1622, it numbered seven suffragan (subordinate) dioceses: the dioceses of Chartres, Auxerre, Meaux, Paris, Orléans, Nevers and Troyes, which inspired the acronym CAMPONT. The Diocese of Bethléem at Clamecy was also dependent on the metropolitan see of Sens. The archdiocese is a suffragan of Dijon and consequently no longer wears the pallium. The archbishop is Yves François Patenôtre, whose cathedra (seat) is at Sens Cathedral but who resides in Auxerre.\n\nUntil the French Revolution, the Archbishop of Sens was also Viscount of Sens. In 1622, Paris had been elevated to a metropolitan see and the Sees of Chartres, Orléans and Meaux were separated from the Archdiocese of Sens. In return, the abbey of Mont Saint-Martin in the Diocese of Cambrai was united to the archiepiscopate. It was suppressed by the Napoleonic Concordat of 1802, which annexed to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Troyes the Dioceses of Sens and Auxerre. The somewhat complex agreement gave the title of Bishop of Auxerre to the bishops of Troyes, and the purely honorary title of Archbishop of Sens to the Archbishop of Paris (otherwise deprived of all jurisdiction over Sens). The Concordat of 1817 reestablished the Archdiocese of Sens and the Diocese of Auxerre, but this arrangement did not last. The law of July 1821, the pontifical brief of 4 September 1821 and the royal ordinance of 19 October 1821 suppressed the Diocese of Auxerre and gave to the Archdiocese of Sens the Department of the Yonne and the Dioceses of Troyes, Nevers and Moulins. A papal brief of 3 June 1823 gave to the Archbishop of Sens the title of Bishop of Auxerre. The Archbishop of Sens continued to reside at Sens until the 1920s, but is now resident at Auxerre. In 2002 Sens-Auxerre lost its metropolitan functions with the creation of an archbishopric for the Burgundy administrative region at Dijon.\n\nThe history of the religious beginnings of the church at Sens dates from Savinian and Potentian, and through legend to the Dioceses of Chartres, Troyes and Orléans. Gregory of Tours is silent regarding Savinian and Potentian, founders of the See of Sens; the Hieronymian Martyrology, which was revised before 600 at Auxerre (or Autun) ignores them. The cities of Chartres and Troyes have nothing about these men in their local liturgy prior to the 12th century, and that of Orléans nothing prior to the 15th, pertaining to the preaching of Altinus, Eodaldus and Serotinus (companions of Savinian and Potentian). Before the ninth century there was (in the cemetery near the monastery of Pierre le Vif at Sens) a group of tombs, among which are those of the first bishops of Sens. In 847, the transfer of their remains to the church of St-Pierre le Vif inspired popular devotion towards Savinian and Potentian. In 848, Wandelbert of Prüm named them the first patrons of the church of Sens. Ado, in his martyrology published shortly afterwards, speaks of them as envoys of the apostles and as martyrs. The \"Martyrology of Usuard\" (around 875) depicts them as envoys of the \"Roman pontiff\" and martyrs. In the middle of the 10th century the relics of these two saints were hidden in a subterranean vault of the Abbey of St-Pierre le Vif to escape the pillage of the Hungarians, but in 1031 they were placed in a reliquary established by the monk Odoranne. This monk (in a chronicle published about 1045) speaks of Altinus, Eodaldus, and Serotinus as apostolic companions of Savinian and Potentian, but does not view them as legitimate.\n\nIn a document which (according to the Abbé Bouvier) dates from the end of the sixth century or the beginning of the seventh—but according to Louis Duchesne, who labels the Gerbertine legend as written in 1046 and 1079 under the inspiration of Gerbert, Abbot of St-Pierre le Vif—is first described a legend tracing to Savinian and Potentian (and their companions) the evangelization of the churches of Orléans, Chartres and Troyes. After some uncertainty, the legend became fixed in the chronicle of Clarius, compiled about 1120. The Christian faith could not have been preached at Sens in the second century, but we know from Sidonius Apollinaris that in 475 the Church of Sens had its 13th bishop; the list of bishops does not indicate that the episcopal see existed prior to the second half of the third century or the beginning of the fourth.\n\nAmong the bishops of Sens in the fourth century were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter (Vaulter) (887–923): anointed Eudes in 888, Robert I in July 922, and Rudolph of France on 13 July 923 in the Church of St-Médard at Soissons; he inherited from his uncle Vaultier (Bishop of Orléans) a sacramentary composed between 855 and 873 for the Abbey of St-Amand at Puelle. This document (which he gave to the church of Sens) is an example of Carolingian art and is now in the National Library of Sweden.\n\nGelduinus (1032–1049) was deposed for simony by Pope Leo IX at the Council of Reims. The second half of the 11th century saw a decline in prestige for the Diocese of Sens. Under the episcopate of Richerius (1062–96), Pope Urban II withdrew primatial authority from the See of Sens to confer it on the archbishopric of Lyon, and Richerius died without having accepted this decision; his successor Daimbert (1098–1122) was consecrated at Rome in March 1098 after giving assurance that he recognized the primacy of Lyons. Bishop Henri Sanglier (1122–42) caused the condemnation by a council in 1140 of certain propositions of Abelard.\n\nHugues de Toucy (1142–1168). The see regained some prestige under who at Orléans in 1152 crowned Constance (wife of King Louis VII) despite protests by the Archbishop of Reims, and during whose episcopate Pope Alexander III (driven from Rome) installed the pontifical court at Sens for 18 months, on the advice of the bishops.\n\n\n\n\nA large number of church councils were held at Sens between 600 and 1485. The first involved a controversy over the date of Easter which meant that St. Columbanus refused to attend. The council of 1140 condemned the writings of Abelard. The council of 1198 was concerned with the Manichaean sect of Poplicani.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The region of Sindh has historically been, and still is, home to the largest community of Hindus in Pakistan. Following the Arab Muslim conquest in the 8th century, Islam spread throughout the region and over the period of time Islam became the faith practiced by the majority of Sindhi people. The Islamic religion, coupled with traditional influences and exposure to and interaction with Hinduism, has shaped the diverse Sindhi culture. Starting with Muhammad bin Qasim and Habbari dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire ruled the region. After the partition of India in 1947, the majority of Sindhi Hindus migrated to India, and settled primarily in neighboring Gujarat and the city of Mumbai, where their population is estimated to be 3 million. There are also sizable Sindhi Hindu communities elsewhere in the world, sometimes termed, the 'Sindhi diaspora'.\n\nFollowing the partition of India, a significant number of Sindhi Hindus left Sindh following religious-based persecution against Hindus in the province. Many initially settled in Rajasthan and in the neighbouring Kutch district of Gujarat, which bears linguistic and cultural similarities to Sindh. As per Census of India 2011, there are around 2,772,264 Sindhi speakers living in India.\n\nMost Sindhi Hindu family names are a modified form of a patronymic and typically end with the suffix \"-ani\", which is used to denote descent from a common male ancestor. One explanation states that the -ani suffix is a Sindhi variant of 'anshi', derived from the Sanskrit word 'ansh', which means 'descended from' (see: Devanshi). The first part of a Sindhi Hindu surname is usually derived from the name or location of an ancestor. In northern Sindh, surnames ending in 'ja' (meaning 'of') are also common. A person's surname would consist of the name of his or her native village, followed by 'ja'. Sindhi Hindus generally add the suffix ‘-ani’ to the name of a great grandfather and adopt the name as a family name.\n\n\n\n"}

Singha Sartha is also considered to be a previous incarnation of the Buddha. \n\nSingha Sartha led a merchant caravan to Tibet. They arrived at a place where there were many beautiful women, and the traders fell under their spell. Each one of them got a mistress and they spent the days partying, forgetting that they were on a business trip. One night, Karunamaya, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, appeared to Singha Sartha in the flame of an oil lamp, and warned him that their gorgeous lovers were actually demonesses who were waiting for an opportunity to eat them. He told Singha Sartha to check his lover's feet if he was unconvinced, and he would find that the heel pointed to the front and the toes to the back.\n\nKarunamaya then told him that he would help him and his friends to escape. He instructed them to get up before the women and hurry to the river bank where they would find a winged horse. They were to climb on the horse and it would fly them across the river to safety. He also warned them that they should not look back whatever happened, otherwise the demonesses would drag them off the horse and kill them. \n\nSingha Sartha spread the word among his companions, and they all agreed that they had to flee.

It is especially associated with the practices of Christian monasticism.\n\nReferring to the desert landscape inhabited by the earliest Christian monks, Peter Brown, in \"A History of Private Life\", explains:\nThe bleak, asocial landscape of the desert was a distant image of Paradise -- the first, the true home of humankind, where Adam and Eve had dwelt in full majesty, before the subtle and overpowering onset of the doublehearted cares of human life in settled society, before marriage, physical greed, the labor of the earth, and the grinding cares of present human society robbed them of their original serenity. Totally singlehearted, therefore joined with the angelic hosts in unfailing and undivided praise of God, the life of the monk mirrored on earth the life of the angels. \nSøren Kierkegaard expressed a similar concept in his maxim \"Purity of heart is to will one thing\" and his sermon-form essay bearing that title.\n"}

Jaki (Jáki Szaniszló László), OSB (17 August 1924 in Győr, Hungary – 7 April 7, 2009 in Madrid, Spain) was a Hungarian-born priest of the Benedictine order. From 1975 to his death, he was Distinguished University Professor at Seton Hall University, in South Orange, New Jersey. He held doctorates in theology and in physics and was a leading contributor to the philosophy of science and the history of science, particularly to their relationship to Christianity.\n\nAfter completing undergraduate training in philosophy, theology and mathematics, Jaki did graduate work in theology and physics and gained doctorates in theology from the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome (1950) and in physics from Fordham University (1958), where he studied under the Nobel laureate Victor Hess, the co-discoverer of cosmic rays. He also did post-doctoral research in Philosophy of Science at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University and Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.\n\nJaki authored more than two dozen books on the relation between modern science and orthodox Christianity. He was Fremantle Lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford (1977), Hoyt Fellow at Yale University (1980) and Farmington Institute Lecturer at Oxford University (1988–1989). He was the Gifford Lecturer at Edinburgh University in 1974–1975 and 1975–1976. In 1987, he was awarded the Templeton Prize for furthering understanding of science and religion.\n\nHe was among the first to claim that Gödel's incompleteness theorem is relevant for theories of everything (TOE) in theoretical physics. Gödel's theorem states that any theory that includes certain basic facts of number theory and is computably enumerable will be either incomplete or inconsistent. Since any 'theory of everything' must be consistent, it also must be incomplete.\n\nJaki died in Madrid following a heart attack. He was in Spain visiting friends, on his way back to the United States after delivering lectures in Rome, for the Master in Faith and Science of the Pontificio Ateneo Regina Apostolorum.\n\n\n\n"}

The first book was printed in 1531 in Paris, Cologne, and Antwerp, while the full three volumes first appeared in Cologne in 1533.\n\nThe three books deal with Elemental, Celestial and Intellectual magic. The books outline the four elements, astrology, kabbalah, numbers, angels, God's names, the virtues and relationships with each other as well as methods of utilizing these relationships and laws in medicine, scrying, alchemy, ceremonies, origins of what are from the Hebrew, Greek and Chaldean context.\n\nThese arguments were common amongst other hermetic philosophers at the time and before. In fact, Agrippa's interpretation of magic is similar to the authors Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and Johann Reuchlin's synthesis of magic and religion, and emphasize an exploration of nature. Unlike many grimoires of the time, these books are more scholarly and intellectual than mysterious and foreboding.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the son of Shiva and Kulivaka – a tribal woman, while in some versions Parvati disguises herself as Kulivaka.\n\nAccording to Hindu mythology Shiva while on a hunt happened to hear a sweet voice in the jungle. He was surprised to find that it belonged to a tribal girl, \"Kulivaka\" (Pronounced as Koolivaaka) - a girl of immense beauty. The solitude in that forest area called Kuli van, and the wild beauty of the forest girl, made the Lord lustful. He informed Kulivaka of his wish and told her to wait for him until he returned from his hunt\n\nKulivaka, who was a devotee of Parvati realized that mating with lord would bring forth the wrath of the goddess upon her; but she feared the wrath of Shiva also in case she refused him. She prayed to her Goddess to save her from the predicament. Parvati, pleased with her innocence appeared before her and revealed her true identity. In her previous birth Kulivaka was Manaswini, a servant in the retinue of Parvati. One day she happened to breast-feed Ganesha who was a baby at that time. Parvati didn't appreciate the fact of a servant breast-feeding her baby. She cursed Manaswini that she would be born in a chandala(outcaste)family. When Parvati's anger subdued, she took pity on Manaswini. Devi Parvati blessed her that although she be born as a chandala she would get the opportunity to breast-feed the son of Shiva.\n\nDevi disclosed that it was the pre-ordained fate that made possible her meeting with Lord Shiva and his passion for Koolivaka. She told the girl that she herself would take on the form of Koolivaka and deceive the Lord Shiva. She also informed Koolivaka that the son born from such a union would be the killer of Jalandhara, a powerful Asura. Thus revealing the course of fate, she sent the innocent girl away.\n\nThe pseudo Koolivaka started swinging on a creeper attached to a jackfruit tree and waited for the arrival of Lord Shiva. A child with divine power was born through their union. Lord Shiva arranged a buffalo for the protection of the child. This divine child who came to be known as Chathan was given to Koolivaka for rearing. Koolivaka thus became the mother of Chathan, son of Lord Shiva fulfilling the boon of Parvati.\n\nChathan lived with Koolivaka for about seven years. The tribals loved the boy who saved them from many dangers. He roamed the jungle riding his buffalo and playing a musical instrument known as \"Ezhara\".\n\nOn his seventh birthday, the tribals held a feast in his honour. During the feast the sage, Narada manifested himself. He revealed to Chathan the secret of his birth. Moreover, Narada advised Chathan to visit his true parents in Kailasa. He also told Chathan the true purpose of his birth.\n\nChathan started his journey to Kailasam with the permission of his foster mother and friends. He rode on his buffalo to Kailasam. When he was about to reach Kailasam he realized that Nandikeshwara would not allow him to enter Kailash in his present form. So he took the form of Lord Vishnu. On seeing their son, Shiva and Parvati were very happy and hugged their son. Lord Shiva blessed him, saying, \"You invoked the form of Vishnu by Maya (magic). So you will be known as Vishnu Maya\". Moreover, he taught him the art of warfare and the secrets to kill Jalandhara (an asura who had been harassing the Devas).\n\nJalandhara was an asura who had got a boon from Indra and he was terrorizing the three worlds (Heaven, Pathala (Nether World) and Earth). Chathan challenged him to battle. After a fierce battle, Chathan took the form of Sudarsana Chakra with his Maya to behead Jalandhara. Sensing danger, he escaped and hid himself in the seas. Chathan as Chakra followed him. Due to the heat of the fiercely revolving Chakra the water where Jalandhara was hiding started to boil. Unable to bear the heat, Jalndhara came out and he was promptly beheaded. Thus came the end of Jalandhara. With the killing of Jalandhara, the power of Chathan was recognized by the Devas. Indra invited him to Heaven. But Chathan declined the offer saying that his place was among the poor people who needed his protection. Chathan returned to his own people.\n\nAnother powerful Asura called Briga saw Koolivaka in the forest and wanted to take her as his wife. He came with a large force and tried to capture her. Chathan along with his elder brother, \"Karinkutty\" resisted the attack. Chathan was injured in the conflict. From the blood that fell on the ground, there arose 400 \"Kuttichathan\"s. Sensing his immediate defeat, Briga used ten Brahmastras against Chathan, ten Kuttichathans valiantly swallowed the weapon and gave up their life. The remaining 390 Kuttichathans defeated the army while Chathan killed Briga with his Kuruvadi (short Stick). Some of the famous Ancient Traditional Vishnumaya Temples in Kerala are Avanangattil Kalari first vishnumaya temple (moolasthanam)kizhakkumuri, Vishnumaya temple peringottukara, thrissur district kerala state india. Other important temples include, Karumanthra Shree Vishnumaya Temple Meloor, Kannanchira Shree Vishnumaya Temple, Perigottukara Devasthanam, Kanadikavu Kuttichathan Kavu situated in Thrissur district of Kerala. Most of this temple built by few years back most of them bring idols from avanangattilkalri sree vishnumaya temple. Particularly thrissur district most of family temples have a vishnumaya idol with the main deity. In addition to these famous temples, Lord Vishumaya is one of the main deity in Pakkalippallam Temple (situated in the valley of Chembra peak, in the midst of forest) in Wayanad district of Kerala. Lord Vishnumaya is also the main deity of Hindus in central Kerala.\n\nAccording to the old history Puchanellur Battathiri first prayed to god Shiva and goddess Parvati. Through his prayer Shiva and Parvati were satisfied but they instructed him to pray to the god Sree Vishnumaya. He prayed (upasana) to the god Sree Vishnumaya. With Continuous prayer god Sree Vishnumaya and 390 brother blessed him. He built a pooja room at his own house (punchanellur mana). God Vishnumaya's blessing achieved goals. After a few years of time Bhattathiri started thinking about maintaining family line and status. He had only one daughter called Ettinarayani. She could not follow the rule of vishnumaya upasana (pooja ) to god sree vishnumaya. Same time at Avanangattil kalari there were two brothers unnithaman and kelluuni. They were maintaining kalari. They were praying to god Ganesha. But they desired to do Upasana to a (uggra moorthi) powerful god who can help win over enemy's. When they set about searching for that, they heard about Punchanellur Battathiri and god sree vishnumaya. Unnithamman panicker and kellunni panicker visited puchanellur and they requested for help.Puchanellur battathiri agreed to give hand of his daughter to them and provide manthra's to propitiate God Vishnumaya. In exchange battathiri requested Ganesha moolamathra's. Avanangattilkalari unnithaman panicker and kellunni panicker agreed for exchange. When they returned to avanangattilkalari they started upasana(continues prayer). After 41 days god sree vishnumaya blessed them with his 390 brothers.After that unnithaman panicker requested god sree vishnumaya, that until his return god need to protect his family and give blessings in avanangattilkalari. He went to a well near to avanangattil kalari, which had no water but steps and started praying and sacrificed life for family. Before he started praying he instructed his brother kellunni to close well opening. He never returned. As per given word god sree vishnumaya continues to bless avanangattilkalari vishnumaya temple.\n"}
