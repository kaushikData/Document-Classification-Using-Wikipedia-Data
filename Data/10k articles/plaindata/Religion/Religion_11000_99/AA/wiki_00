It upholds the view that special allowances do not need to be made by employers for people who want to follow particular religious practices, because people are free to choose their jobs. However, it suggests that employers should give genuine and serious consideration about ways to accommodate their employees requests, even if they cannot ultimately do so.\n\nA teacher, Iftikhar Ahmad was a British citizen born in India in 1940 and a Muslim. He had worked at an inner London primary school for maladjusted children from 1968 to 1972. He took study leave and, given the opportunity to change schools, he chose one closer to a mosque. The headmaster allowed him extra time to pray on Fridays at lunch break. He then moved again to Chisern School, Bethnal Green, where his job was to do individual reading with children. The headmistress objected to him being away for an extra 50 minutes. He moved again to Bonner Primary School, Bethnal Green. The headmaster there also refused extra time off, and he went anyway. He moved again to Bethnal Green Primary School. Then he moved again to the Roman Catholic primary school in Mile End. Here he took time off in spite of being told not to. He was told he could take part-time teaching, but he refused and instead he resigned. At this time part-time jobs were not protected by equal pay laws, and often, part-time contracts were paid less per hour than full-time ones.\n\nAt tribunal, Dr Pasha said Friday prayer was so important that in Saudi Arabia, three times not attending leads to beheading. One of the main questions was whether under Article 9 ECHR (the right to freedom of religion and conscience) the school ought to have given Mr Ahmad the time off.\n\nThe Court of Appeal (Scarman LJ dissenting) dismissed the case [1978] QB 38. Lord Denning MR held,\n\nThe convention is not part of our English law, but, as I have often said, we will always have regard to it. We will do our best to see that our decisions are in conformity with it. But it is drawn in such vague terms that it can be used for all sorts of unreasonable claims and provoke all sorts of litigation. As so often happens with high-sounding principles, they have to be brought down to earth. They have to be applied in a work-a-day world. I venture to suggest that it would do the Muslim community no good - or any other minority group no good - if they were to be given preferential treatment over the great majority of the people. If it should happen that, in the name of religious freedom, they were given special privileges or advantages, it would provoke discontent, and even resentment among those with whom they work. As, indeed, it has done in this very case. And so the cause of racial integration would suffer. So, whilst upholding religious freedom to the full, I would suggest that it should be applied with caution, especially having regard to the setting in which it is sought. Applied to our educational system, I think that Mr. Ahmad's right to \"manifest his religion in practice and observance\" must be subject to the rights of the education authorities under the contract and to the interests of the children whom he is paid to teach. I see nothing in the European Convention to give Mr. Ahmad any right to manifest his religion on Friday afternoons in derogation of his contract of employment: and certainly not on full pay.\n\nScarman LJ said there was a duty to accommodate devout Muslims, even if it involved additional cost, because Art.9 required the right of worship to be unimpeded.\n\nThe European Commission of Human Rights held that there was not even interference with his freedom of religion under Art.9(1) (at 23). Freedom of religion is not absolute and 'it may as regards the modality of a particular religious manifestation, be influenced by the situation of the person claiming that freedom' (para 11). It also noted that United Kingdom society was with its increasing Muslim community in a period of transition.' But they also made the point that there was no failure to consider better working arrangements.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20890959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20890959", "title": "Bricket Wood coven", "text": "Bricket Wood coven\n\nThe Bricket Wood coven, or Hertfordshire coven was a coven of Gardnerian witches founded in the 1940s by Gerald Gardner. It was notable for being the first coven in the Gardnerian line, though having its supposed origins in the pre-Gardnerian New Forest coven. The coven formed after Gardner bought the Fiveacres Country Club, a naturist club in the village of Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, southern England, and met within the club's grounds. It played a significant part in the history of the neopagan religion of Wicca.\n\nMany important and influential figures in Wicca were members of the coven, including Dafo, Doreen Valiente, Jack Bracelin, Fred Lamond, Dayonis, Eleanor Bone and Lois Bourne. The coven is still active today, though it maintains secrecy and its history is only known up until the 1970s.\n\nGardner founded the coven around 1946 after moving to the area from the New Forest with his wife Donna. In the New Forest, Gardner claimed to have been initiated into the New Forest coven, where he learned the mysteries and practices of the witchcraft religion. Gardner, fearing that the \"Old Religion\", as he called it, would die out, decided to form a new coven near to his new home, where he could initiate more people into the craft and keep it alive.\n\nGardner acted as the coven's High Priest, with Dafo acting as High Priestess. She had also been a member of the New Forest coven. Dafo remained a member of the coven until she left it by late 1952, annoyed at Gardner for seeking publicity.\n\nGardner gained several members to the coven, all of whom were either members of the Fiveacres naturist club or were already witches, although Donna, Gardner's wife, never got involved, having no interest in witchcraft. They held their meetings on the grounds of the local wooded Fiveacres nudist club, which Gardner had purchased in 1945. He was himself not interested in running the club, and as such appointed an administrator to take on the job.\n\nGardner re-assembled what he called \"The Witches' Cottage\" on a plot of land which he owned in the club grounds. The small cottage was decorated with magical sigils on the inside. He had purchased this building from a friend, the Freemason John S.M. Ward, who was a pioneer of the restoration of historical buildings. It was within this 16th-century cottage that Ward had found near to Ledbury, Herefordshire that the coven assembled to perform their rituals.\n\nDoreen Valiente, whom Gardner had initiated into the craft at Midsummer 1953 at the home of Dafo in the New Forest, joined the coven, and rose to become High Priestess.\n\nIn 1956, Jack Bracelin was initiated into the coven by Valiente. He became a favourite of Gardner, who gave him the job of running the Fiveacres club after sacking the previous administrator, who \"had deliberately run the club at a loss by setting unrealistically high requirements for membership, hoping thereby to persuade Gerald to eventually sell him the club at a low price\". The sacked administrator had felt scorned, and convinced the president of the Central Council of British Naturism, Ernest Stanley, that the club was a cover for witchcraft, and that they should not be allowed membership to the CCOBN. Hoping to help Jack and Gardner's club out, the coven performed a ritual, and the situation was resolved.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Gardner began to encourage more publicity, something which annoyed many coven members. In 1957, Valiente and several other coven members confronted Gardner over this, claiming that they should have a set of rules to regulate such a thing. Gardner, in response, brought about the Wiccan Laws (not to be confused with the Wiccan Rede), which offended Valiente, and in 1957 she and many of the group's older members left to form their own coven.\n\nThe split-off coven asked if they could continue to use the Witches' Cottage for their rituals, but in a letter Gardner replied that:\n\nGardner was left with a much younger coven, composed of Dayonis, her then partner Jack Bracelin, Fred Lamond, a hospital anaesthetist, and a new initiate.\n\nWith Valiente gone, Dayonis took over as the high priestess of the coven in January 1958. With Dayonis in charge, Gardner asked her to immediately initiate anyone who asked into the craft, in contrast with his former belief that prospective candidates should wait for a year and a day before initiation. One such of these new fast-tracked initiates was Fred Lamond, who was initiated only four months after meeting the coven for the first time. Gardner also insisted on the initiation of Eleanor Bone, despite the fact that the coven members felt that they \"simply couldn't circle with her\" because of differences in exuberance. Within a month, Gardner had brought about her 2nd and 3rd initiations, and set her up as the High Priestess of a new coven, independent of the Bricket Wood one.\n\nIn spring 1958, whilst Gardner was away from the coven staying at his museum on the Isle of Man, the other members decided that they did not want to continue using only binding and scourging to raise energies, and so they tried to do so by the circle dance method, which most found to be more effective than Gardner's preferred methods. At the same time, the group decided that they wanted to celebrate the solstices and the equinoxes as well as the cross-quarter days (the coven at the time called them Halloween, Candlemass, Beltane and Lammas). Gardner gave his written permission for this, and it was adopted by other practitioners of the craft, such as Doreen Valiente. This was the beginning of the belief in the Wiccan Wheel of the Year.\n\nDayonis moved to Canada in October 1959, and Lois Bourne became the coven's high priestess.\n\nAfter Gardner's death in 1964, Jack Bracelin, who had remained loyal to Gardner throughout, took over the group as high priest. At the same time he inherited the Fiveacres club from Gardner. However, he soon left the coven and abandoned the craft; this, according to coven member Fred Lamond, was because \"he asked himself whether the Book of Shadows' simplified ceremonial magic rituals expressed his own religious feelings, and concluded they did not\".\n\nThe coven continued to assemble at the Witches' Cottage, which Bracelin allowed them to use as long as they paid rent on it. Many coven members were not happy with this, as they were not members of the nudist club, though they did so anyway.\n\nIn 1972, the group stopped using the Witches' Cottage all year round, and instead started meeting at the north London home of the High priest and priestess during winter.\n\nIn 1975, Bracelin tried to get the group to pay for the nudist club's electricity as well as paying rent; the coven members were unwilling to do this, and so they sold their plot to another club member.\n"}
{"id": "4507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4507", "title": "Bunyip", "text": "Bunyip\n\nThe bunyip is a large mythical creature from Australian Aboriginal mythology, said to lurk in swamps, billabongs, creeks, riverbeds, and waterholes.\n\nThe origin of the word \"bunyip\" has been traced to the Wemba-Wemba or Wergaia language of Aboriginal people of Victoria, in South-Eastern Australia. But the figure of the bunyip was part of traditional Aboriginal beliefs and stories throughout Australia, while its name varied according to tribal nomenclature. In his 2001 book, writer Robert Holden identified at least nine regional variations of the creature known as the bunyip across Aboriginal Australia. Europeans recorded various written accounts of bunyips in the early and mid-19th century, as they began to settle across the country.\n\nThe word \"bunyip\" is usually translated by Aboriginal Australians today as \"devil\" or \"evil spirit\". This contemporary translation may not accurately represent the role of the bunyip in pre-contact Aboriginal mythology or its possible origins before written accounts were made. Some modern sources allude to a linguistic connection between the bunyip and Bunjil, \"a mythic 'Great Man' who made the mountains and rivers and man and all the animals.\" The word \"bunyip\" may have first appeared in print in English about the mid-1840s.\n\nBy the 1850s, \"bunyip\" was also used as a \"synonym for impostor, pretender, humbug and the like\" in the broader Australian community. The term \"bunyip aristocracy\" was first coined in 1853 to describe Australians aspiring to be aristocrats. In the early 1990s, Prime Minister Paul Keating used this term to describe members of the conservative Liberal Party of Australia opposition.\n\nThe word \"bunyip\" can still be found in a number of Australian contexts, including place names such as the Bunyip River (which flows into Westernport Bay in southern Victoria) and the town of Bunyip, Victoria.\n\nDescriptions of bunyips vary widely. George French Angus may have collected a description of a bunyip in his account of a \"water spirit\" from the Moorundi people of the Murray River before 1847, stating it is \"much dreaded by them ... It inhabits the Murray; but ... they have some difficulty describing it. Its most usual form ... is said to be that of an enormous starfish.\" Robert Brough Smyth's \"Aborigines of Victoria\" (1878) devoted ten pages to the bunyip, but concluded \"in truth little is known among the blacks respecting its form, covering or habits; they appear to have been in such dread of it as to have been unable to take note of its characteristics.\" Common features as reported in many 19th-century newspaper accounts include a dog-like face, a crocodile-like head, dark fur, a horse-like tail, flippers, and walrus-like tusks or horns, or a duck-like bill.\n\nThe Challicum bunyip, an outline image of a bunyip carved by Aborigines into the bank of Fiery Creek, near Ararat, Victoria, was first recorded by \"The Australasian\" newspaper in 1851. According to the report, the bunyip had been speared after killing an Aboriginal man. Antiquarian Reynell Johns claimed that until the mid-1850s, Aboriginal people made a \"habit of visiting the place annually and retracing the outlines of the figure [of the bunyip] which is about 11 paces long and 4 paces in extreme breadth.\" The outline image no longer exists.\n\nNon-Aboriginal Australians have made various attempts to understand and explain the origins of the bunyip as a physical entity over the past 150 years. Writing in 1933, Charles Fenner suggested that it was likely that the \"actual origin of the bunyip myth lies in the fact that from time to time seals have made their way up the Murray and Darling (Rivers)\". He provided examples of seals found as far inland as Overland Corner, Loxton, and Conargo and reminded readers that \"the smooth fur, prominent 'apricot' eyes, and the bellowing cry are characteristic of the seal\", especially southern elephant seals and leopard seals.\n\nAnother suggestion is that the bunyip may be a cultural memory of extinct Australian marsupials such as the \"Diprotodon\", \"Zygomaturus\", \"Nototherium\", or \"Palorchestes\". This connection was first formally made by Dr George Bennett of the Australian Museum in 1871. In the early 1990s, palaeontologist Pat Vickers-Rich and geologist Neil Archbold also cautiously suggested that Aboriginal legends \"perhaps had stemmed from an acquaintance with prehistoric bones or even living prehistoric animals themselves ... When confronted with the remains of some of the now extinct Australian marsupials, Aborigines would often identify them as the bunyip.\" They also note that \"legends about the\" mihirung paringmal\" of western Victorian Aborigines ... may allude to the ... extinct giant birds the Dromornithidae.\"\n\nIn a 2017 \"Australian Birdlife\" article, Karl Brandt suggested Aboriginal encounters with the southern cassowary inspired the myth. According to the first written description of the bunyip from 1845, the creature, which laid pale blue eggs of immense size, possessed deadly claws, powerful hind legs, a brightly coloured chest, and an emu-like head, characteristics shared with then undiscovered Australian cassowary. As the creature's bill was described as having serrated projections, each \"like the bone of the stingray\", this bunyip was associated with the indigenous people of Far North Queensland, renowned for their spears tipped with stingray barbs and their proximity to the cassowary's Australian range.\n\nAnother association to the bunyip is the shy Australasian bittern (\"Botaurus poiciloptilus\"). During the breeding season, the male call of this marsh-dwelling bird is a \"low pitched boom\"; hence, it is occasionally called the \"bunyip bird\".\n\nDuring the early settlement of Australia by Europeans, the notion became commonly held that the bunyip was an unknown animal that awaited discovery. Unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of the island continent's peculiar fauna, early Europeans believed that the bunyip described to them was one more strange Australian animal and they sometimes attributed unfamiliar animal calls or cries to it. Scholars suggest also that 19th-century bunyip lore was reinforced by imported European folklore, such as that of the Irish Púca.\n\nA large number of bunyip sightings occurred during the 1840s and 1850s, particularly in the southeastern colonies of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, as European settlers extended their reach. The following is not an exhaustive list of accounts:\n\nOne of the earliest accounts relating to a large unknown freshwater animal was in 1818, when Hamilton Hume and James Meehan found some large bones at Lake Bathurst in New South Wales. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as very much like a hippopotamus or manatee. The Philosophical Society of Australasia later offered to reimburse Hume for any costs incurred in recovering a specimen of the unknown animal, but for various reasons, Hume did not return to the lake. Ancient \"Diprotodon\" skeletons have sometimes been compared to the hippopotamus; they are a land animal, but have sometimes been found in a lake or water course.\n\nMore significant was the discovery of fossilised bones of \"some quadruped much larger than the ox or buffalo\" in the Wellington Caves in mid-1830 by bushman George Ranken and later by Thomas Mitchell. Sydney's Reverend John Dunmore Lang announced the find as \"convincing proof of the deluge\", referring to Biblical accounts of the Flood. But British anatomist Sir Richard Owen identified the fossils as the gigantic marsupials \"Nototherium\" and \"Diprotodon\". At the same time, some settlers observed that \"all natives throughout these ... districts have a tradition (of) a very large animal having at one time existed in the large creeks and rivers and by many it is said that such animals now exist.\"\n\nIn July 1845, \"The Geelong Advertiser\" announced the discovery of fossils found near Geelong, under the headline \"Wonderful Discovery of a new Animal\". This was a continuation of a story on 'fossil remains' from the previous issue. The newspaper continued, \"On the bone being shown to an intelligent black, he at once recognised it as belonging to the bunyip, which he declared he had seen. On being requested to make a drawing of it, he did so without hesitation.\" The account noted a story of an Aboriginal woman being killed by a bunyip and the \"most direct evidence of all\" – that of a man named Mumbowran \"who showed several deep wounds on his breast made by the claws of the animal\".\n\nThe account provided this description of the creature:\n"}

{"id": "5843956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5843956", "title": "Compadre", "text": "Compadre\n\nThe compadre (, , , literally \"co-father\" or \"co-parent\") relationship between the parents and godparents of a child is an important bond that originates when a child is baptized in Iberian, Latin American, and Filipino families. The abstract noun compadrazgo (Spanish and Filipino), compadrio (in Portuguese), both meaning \"co-parenthood,\" is sometimes used to refer to the institutional relationship between \"compadres\".\n\nFrom the moment of a baptism ceremony, the godparents (godfather and godmother, \"padrino\" and \"madrina\" in Spanish, \"padrinho\" and \"madrinha\" in Portuguese, and \"ninong\" and \"ninang\" in Filipino) share the parenting role of the baptised child with the natural parents. By Catholic doctrine, upon the child's baptism the godparents accept the responsibility to ensure that the child is raised according to the dictates of the Catholic faith and to ensure the child pursues a life of improvement and success (through education, marriage, personal development, and so forth).\n\nAt the moment of baptism, the godparents and natural parents become each other's \"compadres\" (the plural form \"compadres\" includes both male and female co-parents). The female equivalent of \"compadre\" is comadre (, , Brazil: ). Thus, the child's father will call the child's godmother \"comadre,\" while she will call him \"compadre,\" and so on.\n\nTraditionally among Iberians and Latin Americans, this relationship formalizes a pre-existing friendship which results in a strong lifelong bond between \"compadres\". In its original form, the \"compadre\" relationship is among the strongest types of family love soon after one's nuclear family. In many Latin American societies, lifelong friends or siblings who have always spoken to each other informally (using the informal Spanish second-person, \"tú\") may mark their new \"compadre\" relationship by using respectful or formal speech (using the formal Spanish second-person, \"usted\").\n\nThere are a number of other ritual occasions that are considered to result in a \"compadre\" relationship in various Latin American societies. These may include ritual sponsorship of other Catholic sacraments (first communion, confirmation, and marriage); sponsorship of a \"quinceañera\" celebration; and, in Peru, sponsorship of a ritual first haircut ceremony that normally takes place when a child turns three years old. \n\n\"Compadrazgo\" has its roots in mediaeval European Catholicism. The Doge of Venice Pietro II Orseolo worked all his life for creating solid contacts with the contemporary monarchs, achieving good relationships with the Byzantine Empire. On the other hand, he approximated to Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor and eventually named him literally with the title of \"compadre\", which meant \"the co-father of the Venetian Doge's children\". Otto specially liked this, and became the children's godfather.\n\nThe classic Spanish novel Don Quixote (1605–1615) contains several references to \"compadres\"; however, the \"compadre\" relationship has much less formal meaning in modern Spain where it is a reference both to a godfather/\"padrino\" or just to a best friend, with no reference to any ritual. The expression is in use particularly in southern Spain. In medieval England, parents and godparents called each other \"godsibs\" (that is, \"God siblings\"). The only trace of this old Catholic English practice in modern English is the word gossip, presumably a reference to the propensity of close companions such as \"compadres\" to chat and gossip with one another. In Spanish, the verb \"comadrear\" (from \"comadre\") similarly means \"to gossip,\" as does the French cognate \"commérage\" (from \"commère\").\n\nThe term \"compadre\" has been extended in some regions, such as Brazil to describe a common relationship between two good friends. In Argentina and Paraguay, the word is used in popular speech (especially in the diminutive, \"compadrito\") to mean \"braggart, loud-mouth, bully.\" However, among more traditional Latin American and Hispanic/Latino families, the word retains its original meaning and symbolism, and for its members, to be asked to be a \"padrino\" or \"compadre\" is a great, lifelong honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19187131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19187131", "title": "Cynicism (philosophy)", "text": "Cynicism (philosophy)\n\nCynicism () is a school of thought of ancient Greek philosophy as practiced by the Cynics (, ). For the Cynics, the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature. As reasoning creatures, people can gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which is natural for themselves, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, sex, and fame. Instead, they were to lead a simple life free from all possessions.\n\nThe first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was followed by Diogenes, who lived in a pot on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire.\n\nCynicism gradually declined and finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity. By the 19th century, emphasis on the negative aspects of Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions.\n\nThe name Cynic derives (genitive: \"kynos\"). One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called \"dogs\" was because the first Cynic, Antisthenes, taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at Athens. The word \"cynosarges\" means the \"place of the white dog\". It seems certain, however, that the word \"dog\" was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets. Diogenes, in particular, was referred to as the \"Dog\", a distinction he seems to have revelled in, stating that \"other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them.\" Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained:\nCynicism is one of the most striking of all the Hellenistic philosophies. It offered people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertainty. Although there was never an official Cynic doctrine, the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nThus a Cynic has no property and rejects all conventional values of money, fame, power and reputation. A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence, and one can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of convention. The Cynics adopted Heracles as their hero, as epitomizing the ideal Cynic. Heracles \"was he who brought Cerberus, the hound of Hades, from the underworld, a point of special appeal to the dog-man, Diogenes.\" According to Lucian, \"Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog.\" \n\nThe Cynic way of life required continuous training, not just in exercising judgments and mental impressions, but a physical training as well:\n[Diogenes] used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance, as very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind and body.\n\nNone of this meant that a Cynic would retreat from society. Cynics were in fact to live in the full glare of the public's gaze and be quite indifferent in the face of any insults which might result from their unconventional behaviour. The Cynics are said to have invented the idea of cosmopolitanism: when he was asked where he came from, Diogenes replied that he was \"a citizen of the world, (\"kosmopolitês\").\" \n\nThe ideal Cynic would evangelise; as the watchdog of humanity, they thought it their duty to hound people about the error of their ways. The example of the Cynic's life (and the use of the Cynic's biting satire) would dig up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions.\n\nAlthough Cynicism concentrated solely on ethics, Cynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world, ultimately becoming an important influence for Stoicism. The Stoic Apollodorus writing in the 2nd century BC stated that \"Cynicism is the short path to virtue.\" Pillars of their philosophy were Adiaphora, Parrhesia and Anaideia.\n\nThe classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the title of \"Cynic\", derived from the Greek word \"κύων\" (meaning \"dog\") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.\n\nThe ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, to the modern understanding of cynicism as \"an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others.\" This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized \"virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire.\"\n\nVarious philosophers, such as the Pythagoreans, had advocated simple living in the centuries preceding the Cynics. In the early 6th century BC, Anacharsis, a Scythian sage, had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics. Perhaps of importance were tales of Indian philosophers, known to later Greeks as the \"gymnosophists\", who had adopted a strict asceticism together with a disrespect for established laws and customs. By the 5th century BC, the sophists had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as religion, law and ethics. However, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was Socrates. Although he was not an ascetic, he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference to wealth, together with a disdain for general opinion. These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of Plato's philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, Antisthenes.\n\nCynics were often recognized in the ancient world by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.\n\nIn the social evolution from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the \"poleis\". Originally it was expected that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, and at the same time it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.\n\nThe story of Cynicism traditionally begins with Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC), who was an older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates. About 25 years his junior, Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates' disciples. Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism, his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism. In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes Laërtius, writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time. It is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty:\nI have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed, to drink till my thirst is sated; to clothe myself as well; and out of doors not [even] Callias there, with all his riches, is more safe than I from shivering; and when I find myself indoors, what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls?\n\nDiogenes (c. 412–323 BC) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure. He originally went to Athens, fleeing his home city, after he and his father, who was in charge of the mint at Sinope, got into trouble for falsifying the coinage. (The phrase \"defacing the currency\" later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.) Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes, but it is by no means certain that they ever met. Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes' teachings and the ascetic way of life, pursuing a life of self-sufficiency (\"autarkeia\"), austerity (\"askēsis\"), and shamelessness (\"anaidei\"a). There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism (sleeping in a tub), his shameless behaviour (eating raw meat), and his criticism of conventional society (\"bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters\"), and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are true, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness.\n\nCrates of Thebes (c. 365–c. 285 BC) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history. He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes, but again this is uncertain. Crates married Hipparchia of Maroneia after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens, where Crates was treated with respect. Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism. The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his \"Republic\") can be ascribed to Crates' influence.\n\nThere were many other Cynics in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, including Onesicritus (who sailed with Alexander the Great to India), and the moral satirists Bion of Borysthenes and Menippus of Gadara. However, with the rise of Stoicism in the 3rd century BC, Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline, and it is not until the Roman era that Cynicism underwent a revival.\n\nThere is little record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC; Cicero (c. 50 BC), who was much interested in Greek philosophy, had little to say about Cynicism, except that \"it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor.\" However, by the 1st century AD, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of Imperial Rome, like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier, may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again. Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtue. Lucian complained that \"every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog,\" and Aelius Aristides observed that \"they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence.\" The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was Demetrius, whom Seneca praised as \"a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects.\" Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker. In the 2nd century AD, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus, nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, Demonax, in a dialogue.\n\nCynicism came to be seen as an idealised form of Stoicism, a view which led Epictetus to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse. According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic \"must know that he is sent as a messenger from Zeus to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered.\" Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: \"consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind.\"\n\nUnlike Stoicism, which declined as an independent philosophy after the 2nd century AD, Cynicism seems to have thrived into the 4th century. The emperor, Julian (ruled 361–363), like Epictetus, praised the ideal Cynic and complained about the actual practitioners of Cynicism. The final Cynic noted in classical history is Sallustius of Emesa in the late 5th century. A student of the Neoplatonic philosopher Isidore of Alexandria, he devoted himself to living a life of Cynic asceticism.\n\nSome historians have noted the similarities between the teachings of Jesus and those of the Cynics. Some scholars have argued that the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke, has strong similarities to the teachings of the Cynics. Scholars on the quest for the historical Jesus, such as Burton L. Mack and John Dominic Crossan of the Jesus Seminar, have argued that 1st-century AD Galilee was a world in which Hellenistic ideas collided with Jewish thought and traditions. The city of Gadara, only a day's walk from Nazareth, was particularly notable as a centre of Cynic philosophy, and Mack has described Jesus as a \"rather normal Cynic-type figure.\" For Crossan, Jesus was more like a Cynic sage from a Hellenistic Jewish tradition than either a Christ who would die as a substitute for sinners or a messiah who wanted to establish an independent Jewish state of Israel. Other scholars doubt that Jesus was deeply influenced by the Cynics and see the Jewish prophetic tradition as of much greater importance.\n\nMany of the ascetic practices of Cynicism may have been adopted by early Christians, and Christians often employed the same rhetorical methods as the Cynics. Some Cynics were martyred for speaking out against the authorities. One Cynic, Peregrinus Proteus, lived for a time as a Christian before converting to Cynicism, whereas in the 4th century, Maximus of Alexandria, although a Christian, was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle. Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty, although they scorned Cynic shamelessness: Augustine stating that they had, \"in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs.\" The ascetic orders of Christianity also had direct connection with the Cynics, as can be seen in the wandering mendicant monks of the early church who in outward appearance, and in many of their practices differed little from the Cynics of an earlier age.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "600698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600698", "title": "Erlang Shen", "text": "Erlang Shen\n\nErlang Shen (二郎神), or Erlang is a Chinese God with a third truth-seeing eye in the middle of his forehead.\n\nEr-lang Shen may be a deified version of several semi-mythical folk heroes who help regulate China's torrential floods, dating variously from the Qin, Sui and Jin dynasties. A later Buddhist source identify him as the second son of the Northern Heavenly King Vaishravana.\n\nIn the Ming semi-mythical novels \"Creation of the Gods\" and \"Journey to the West\" Erlang Shen is the nephew of the Jade Emperor. In the former he assisted the Zhou army in defeating the Shang. In the latter, he is the second son of a mortal and Jade emperor's brother. In the legend, he is known as the greatest warrior god of heaven.\n\nOf the various identifications of Erlang Shen the most common is as Li Erlang, the second son of Li Bing, the engineer behind the Dujiangyan irrigation system.\n\nAccording to the \"Story about Li Bing and His Son in Harnessing the Rivers\" in \"Records of Guansian\", Li Erlang assisted his father in the construction of the complex irrigation system that prevented the Min River from flooding and irrigated the Chengdu Plain. In thanks for the prosperity that this brought to them the local people elevated the father and son to gods and dedicated the Two Kings Temple to their honour.\n\nLegend states that Governor Li Bing sent his son out to discover the source of the flooding. He spent a year exploring the county without success. One day whilst sheltering in a cave he encountered a tiger which he slew and seven hunters who had witnessed this bravery agreed to join him on his quest.\n\nThe group finally came to a cottage on the outskirts of Guan County (modern Dujiangyan City). From within they heard the sound of an old woman crying. The woman was Grandma Wang and she told them that her grandson was to be sacrificed to an evil dragon who was the local river god. Li Erlang reported this to his father who devised a plan to capture the dragon.\n\nThe eight friends hid in the River God Temple and jumped out on the dragon when it arrived to claim its offering. The dragon fled to river pursued by Li Erlang who eventually captured it. Grandma Wang arrived with an iron chain and the dragon was secured in the pool below the Dragon-Taming Temple, freeing the region from floods.\n\nAnother legend tells of Li Erlang suppressing a fire dragon that lived in the mountains north of Dujiangyan by climbing to the top of Mount Yulei, turning into a giant and building a dam with 66 mountains then filling it with water from Dragon Pacifying Pool.\n\nErlang Shen means \"2nd son god\" as direct translation. Er means 2nd, lang means boy, and Shen means god. His mother was the goddess of the desire realm in heaven. Her job was to limit the gods and spirit's mortal desires such as love/affection, greed, and dream. When she was chasing an evil dragon who broke his chain in his heavenly prison, she fell in love with a mortal man who was willing to save her with his heart. They had three children: Yang Jiao, Yang Jian (Erlang Shen), and Yang Chan (Holy Mother of Hua Shan). When Jade emperor discovered her marriage, he sent his son and heaven armies to kill the half bloods, the mortal man, and the goddess of desire realm. Only Erlang and his sister Yang Chan survived.\n\nAs Li Bing, the first hydraulic engineer in the Shu area, was the hero who stopped the flooding of the Min River by constructing the Dujiangyan. This somehow led to Li Bing being turned into a folk hero who defeated a river god in order to save his prefecture from being flooded, where this story had then associated him as a new river god that protected the local people in the area from floods.\nHowever a discrepancy comes up that even though Li Bing/Erlang was known as Guankou Shen, the river that he is associated with is in Qianwei and not Guankou. \nAnother discrepancy is that Li Erlang had never appeared in any of the tales related to stopping the Min River. The first appearance of Li Erlang was in Zhishui ji 治水記 by Li Ying 李膺 of the Liang 梁 Dynasty.\n\nHistorically Li Bing was conferred an official title until the Five Dynasties period under the rule of the Shu kingdom. He rose to political power when the great flood that occurred on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month in 920 CE, was reported to the emperor by Daoist Du Guangting 杜光庭.\n\nMany legends and novels often describe Erlang as Yang Jian, a nephew of the Jade Emperor.\nAccording to an ancient text Erlang Baojuan, Yang Jian's mother was the Jade Emperor's sister, Princess Yaoji who was imprisoned under Mount Tao, because she violated the Heavenly Rules by marrying a human named Yang Tianyou. Many years later her son Yang Jian cleaved Mount Tao using his axe, hoping to set his mother free. Unfortunately ten Sun Gods (the Jade Emperor's sons) arrived and burnt her to death. \nThe angry Yang Jian killed nine of the sun deities, but was advised to release the last sun by the Queen of moon. Later he married a Dragon Princess and canonized as a deity.\n\nErlang Shen is also identified with Zhao Yu, a hermit who lived on Mount Qingcheng and was appointed by Emperor Yang of Sui as Governor of Jiazhou. Zhao Yu is said to have set forth with 1000 men to defeat a flood dragon that had been tormenting the area. Upon reaching the river Zhao Yu dived into the water with his double-edged sword and emerged holding the dragon’s head, Following his death, according to the \"Chronicle of Changshu County\", the region was once again plagued by flood and he was seen riding a white horse amidst the swirling currents. The locals built a temple enshrining Zhao Yu as the God Erlang and the floods were subdued.\n\nDeng Xia is said to have been a general under Erlang who surpassed his predecessors in valour and defeated a flood dragon, receiving the title \"Erlang Shen\" and a temple in his honour at Zhongqingli in Hangzhou.\n\nErlang makes an appearance near the start of the classic \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Cheng'en. Erlang, who is titled as being either True Lord, or Illustrious Sage, is the nephew of the Jade Emperor. Erlang made his first appearance when he had been ordered by the Jade Emperor (in which Erlang was also with his seven elite sages whom he called his brothers) to subdue Sun Wukong, who was to be punished for his havoc in heaven.\n\nThroughout the course of Erlang's duel between Sun Wukong, Erlang had been the stronger adversary though Sun Wukong always managed to stay ahead and at times get the better of Erlang thanks to his quick wits. After many transformations that were performed in their duel (Sun Wukong fleeing as a fish; Erlang and Sun Wukong becoming larger birds, and so forth). Near the conclusion of the battle, he managed to see through Sun Wukong's disguise (as a temple) using his third-eye. He eventually defeated Wukong through teamwork with several other gods; Laozi personally had dropped his refined golden ring that had hit Sun Wukong on the head, giving Erlang a chance to bring him down, and Erlang's dog bit him in the leg. After Sun Wukong had been captured (to which Sun Wukong retorts that they are cowards for attacking from behind), he and his heavenly soldiers would burn random areas of the Mount Huaguo. Erlang is seen again far later in the novel when he assists Sun Wukong through chance by fighting against a certain ancient Dragon King and his villanous son-in-law, a Nine-headed Demon.\n\nIn \"Investiture of the Gods\", Yang Jian would first appear during the time of the Diablo Brothers' attack on the Western Foothills. After hearing of the situation, Yang would personally take the offensive against the brothers. During his duel against all four brothers, Yang would deliberately allow himself to be consumed by Diablo Long Life's flying mink. Following the battle, Yang Jian would suddenly reappear before Jiang Ziya after killing the mink inside its stomach with his many transformations. To trick the Diablo Brothers, Yang Jian would later transform himself into Long Life's flying mink and steal Diablo Red's Havoc-Umbrella. Thus, Yang would be renowned as the true reason for Jiang Ziya's victory over the Diablo Brothers at an overall point.\n\nIn the tale Lotus Lantern (\"Bao Lian Deng\"), Erlang had a sister known as the Holy Mother of Mount Hua (\"Hua Shan\"). She married a mortal man, Liu Yanchang, who was a scholar. Together, they had a son by the name of Chen Xiang. She was admonished by Erlang for this unlawful human-deity union and imprisoned under Mount Hua. When Chen Xiang came of age, he split the mountain with an axe to free his mother, but not before facing people who repeatedly tried to undermine his mission, most notably his own uncle Erlang.\n\nIn Chinese belief he was a filial son that entered the Chinese underworld to save his deceased mother from torment and will punish unfilial children by striking them with thunder strike as a punishment, hence the Chinese parent saying \"Being smitten by lightning for being unfilial and ungrateful\" towards unruly children. A warrior deity, he wields a \"Sān Jiān Liǎng Rèn Dāo\" (三尖兩刃刀 - \"three-pointed, double-edged blade\") and always has his faithful \"Xiàotiān quǎn\" (嘯天犬 - \"Howling Celestial Dog\") by his side. This dog also helps him subdue evil spirits.\n\nErlang Shen is mostly portrayed, whether in ancient legends or games or television, as a noble and powerful Warrior God who slays and vanquishes Demons and Monsters in the mortal realm and who embodies justice and righteousness. He is shown to have vast, superhuman strength, being able to cleave an entire mountain with his axe to save his mother in just one stroke and being capable of 72 Transformations(sometimes said to be 73 Transformations), meaning he can transform into virtually anything he wants.\nHis main weapon of choice is his \"three-pointed, double-edged Lance\" (三尖兩刃槍), a long three-pointed Spear with two cutting edges of a Saber. This Spear is powerful enough to penetrate and cleave through steel and stone like wool. Erlang wields the Divine Spear with unmatched skill and superior mastery, being an unstoppable force of destruction in battle when wielding said Spear, having slain countless Evil Gods, monstrous demonic beasts and vast, massive armies of demons & ogres with it. He is almost always accompanied by his faithful 'Howling Celestial Dog' (嘯天犬), which has the ability to viciously attack, maul and subdue Demons and evil spirits.\n\nErlang Shen has also been portrayed as possessing a unique skill known as the \"Nine Turns Divine Skill\" (九轉玄功). It grants him vast, physical durability of undefined limits and nigh-invulnerability to conventional weapons and various magic spells. In the novel \"Creation of the Gods\", Erlang was shown to be completely impervious to hits from various powerful mystical objects due to this skill; he has emerged completely unscathed from mystical weapons and artifacts that have proven capable of severely injuring or even killing other Immortals.\n\nErlang Shen, as a God that embodies justice, can execute 'Heaven's Punishment, by calling down countless massive, devastating bolts of Holy Lightning to strike and totally disintegrate evil beings.\n\nThe third-eye on his forehead does not have a fixed name, though its most popular name currently is \"The Eye of Heaven\" (天眼). It has the ability to differentiate truth from lies and see through deceptions and disguises. It may be used as an offensive weapon, being able to fire continuous, highly destructive blasts of light energy and/or divine fire. \n\nThe light & fire blasts from the third-eye possesses vast, almost immeasurable destructive power; enough power to utterly destroy and vaporize anything it hits, even powerful enough to shatter and disintegrate entire mountains, or completely erase and obliterate hundreds of thousands of Demons from existence in one go, or even cripple and destroy Immortals that have supposedly 'indestructible' bodies.\n\nErlang Shen is a playable character in the RPG 'League of Immortals' (亂鬥西遊), an action-adventure game that combined RPG and MOBA gameplay. He is known as only 'Erlang' in the game and is of the Immortal Class（仙）, which is strong against the Devil Class（魔）.\n\nThe playable character 'Exiled God'（神將）from the Asian MMORPG 'Asura Online'（鬥戰神）is based on Erlang Shen, in appearance and skills. He is a melee fighter who mainly uses the Spear but can also use the Sword and Crossbow. While most of his skills involves deadly combos with his Spear, they include melee attacks with the Celestial Hound and ranged Power attacks with his Heavenly Eye.\n\nIn the MOBA game SMITE, he is a playable character featured as a melee warrior.\n\nThe character of Combustion Man from takes inspiration from Erlang Shen.\n\nDragon Ball character Tien Shinhan is inspired by him. He even has a third eye as well.\n\nIn the 1973 animation Chinese Gods the likeness of Bruce Lee is used to portray him. Here he possesses the Third Eye, kills a dragon and fights a shape-shifting priest.\n\nIn the Gumballs&Dungeons roguelike RPG for Android, Erlang Shen, accompanied by his dog Xiàotiān quǎn as sidekick is a playable character with the \"Eye of Heaven\" designed as a specific attack for him, causing damage and diminishing the defense of the enemies.\n\n"}

The church is notable not only for its age and architectural type, but also because it is believed to contain the earliest representation of Christ in Spanish religious art. It was classified as a national monument on November 25, 1929.\n\nThe geographical area surrounding Santa María De Lara was populated by numerous Roman villae preceding the construction of the church. After the Visigoths had invaded the Iberian Peninsula (particularly the area we now know as Spain) and the Romans had left the area, they settled in Quintillana de las Vinas, and built the church of Santa María De Lara, around the beginning of the 8th century. Soon afterwards, in 711 AD, the Moors invaded the Iberian Peninsula and Lara was abandoned as the populace fled north to the mountains.\n\nIn the 9th century, during the Spanish Reconquista, the areas that were previously abandoned (such as Lara), were repopulated, although the buildings were largely in ruins. Santa María De Lara was neglected during the period of Moorish rule, and therefore the church had to be rebuilt. A funerary stela that is now housed in the Museum of Burgos that has been studied by archeologists, is believed to record the date of the reconstruction of Santa María De Lara. It is inscribed with the letters DCCCC (...), and despite the only partial remnant of the date, it is widely believed that this refers to the year 902 (bearing in mind that the inscription adheres to the Spanish medieval dating system, from which 38 years must be subtracted to obtain the European chronological year).\nA document that has been dated from the year 967 AD (or the Spanish Medieval date 929) records a monetary donation to the church and the monastery that, at that time, was under the control of Santa María de Lara, by a woman named \"Muniadona\", the mother of Fernán González of Castile. However, due to the lack of documents from that early era, historians have been unable to verify the location of this monastery.\n\nIn 1038, the church was donated to the nearby monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza and from then on the church began a gradual decline both in religious status and architectural stability. Undated documents from the Bishopry of Burgos later refer to it as a 'hermitage'.' After that, the church was abandoned, and parts of the building collapsed and much of its ancient carvings and decoration was lost.\n\nIn 1921, a local parish priest, was walking near Quintanilla de las Vinas, when he came across the remains of Santa María de Lara, forgotten since the early Middle Ages and hidden by thick bush. Don Bonifacio Zamora, the priest, strived to bring his discovery to the interest of historians and experts. However, until 1927, he was unsuccessful and the site was used simply as a corral for livestock. In 1927, the church was finally brought to the attention of experts such as Helmut Schlunk, a notable German scholar, who, amongst others, visited this 'newly discovered' Visigoth church in order to research it.\n\nAfter two years of studying the site, it was granted 'National Monument' status on 25 November 1929. Later, during the 1930s, extensive excavations were carried out that revealed a large amount of data that shows the area was inhabited from early times. The research undertaken in the 1920s and 1930s has given us almost all we know about the church today. Many of the artefacts uncovered, such as funerary stelae, dolmens and objects from Roman villae, are now housed in the 'Museo Provincial de Burgos.'\n\nUp until the 1970s, the church could only be reached by a local road, until Jesus Vicario Moreno, who looked after Santa María de Lara and showed it to visitors until his recent death, oversaw the construction of an asphalt road leading to the church from Quintanilla de las Vinas, where he lived. Tourism and visitors to the site have provided money to keep the church stable and protect it with projects such as the modern wooden roof. Numbers of visitors have increased significantly and in 1992, 8000 tourists were recorded to have visited the site.\n\nLady Flammola is mentioned in an inscription carved onto the right side of the triumphal arch within the church of the church. Translations differ, but it is believed that the text, reading \"\", meaning \"Flammola, the least of the least, makes this promised offering to God\". Another translation is: \"This small gift the Lady Flammola offers to God\". Dona Lambra, as modern historians now refer to Lady Flammola, possibly ordered the restoration of the church in the 10th century, and supported it with the money that she donated according to the inscription. However, there are numerous women dating from that period of time that bear the same name, so a more accurate dating of the inscription may reveal precisely who it was that ordered the restoration.\n\nMuniadona features in an early document from 967 AD, which records her giving a donation to the church. Muniadona was the mother of Count Fernán González of Castile (who at that point ruled over Castile).\n\nFernán González of Castile, the first independent count of Castile, was closely linked to the church, which is evident for three reasons. First, he was a member of the influential Lara family, and shares his name with the church. He grew up in, and later commanded, the castle of Lara, which is visible from Santa María de Lara with favourable weather. He was buried in the monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza, which at that point owned Santa María de Lara.\n\n"}
{"id": "2170764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2170764", "title": "Historical Vishnuism", "text": "Historical Vishnuism\n\nHistorical Vishnuism as early worship of the deity Vishnu is one of the historical components, branches or origins of the contemporary and early Vaishnavism, which was subject of considerable study, and often showing that Vishnuism is a distinctive worship — a sect. The tradition was forming in the context of Puranic Vaisnavism evolving in the process of revitalizing religion of Brahmanism, of which Vishnuism is believed to be a part, through assimilating a number of orthodox, non-conformist and tribal elements; the absorption of mother goddess worship, into what now known a Vaishnava sampradayas. It is a tradition of the historical Vedic religion and is distinguished from other historic schools later forming the Vaishnavism by its primary worship of Vishnu, later identified as the source of all Avatars. A number of separate sects or traditions merged with each representing the names of god of Vaishnavism. In contemporary Vaishnavism God is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism, that relates to historic traditions that some scholars theorize to be separate and distinct historically. It is distinct from Krishnaism, as in the revival of Bhakti, found in the Bhagavata it is referred as Vishnuism.\n\nThe followers of Vaishnavism are referred to as \"Vaishnava(s)\" or \"Vaishnavites\". According to recent statistics, a majority of Hindus are Vaishnavas, with the vast majority living in India. The name Vaishnavite is a direct translation of Vishnite and often lead to confusion. Some sources identify Visnuism with Vaishnavism, while others prefer to distinguish Vishnuism from Krishnaism and Ramaism.\n\nIn his \"The Religions of India\", Edward Washburn Hopkins presents an accepted distinction as to the assumption that Vishnuism is associated with Vedic brahmanism, and was part of brahmanism. Krishnaism was adopted much later, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that despite its modern iniquities Siva has appealed more to the brahmanas than Krishna. Its only later that Vishnuism merged with Krishnaism.\n\nThe term \"Vaishnavism\" and \"Vishnuism\", entered the English language in the 19th century, and was formed by attaching the suffix \"-ism\" to Sanskrit \"Vaishnava\" or \"Vishnu\" (IAST: or ), where first is the \"vriddhi\" form of the second meaning \"relating, belonging, or sacred to Vishnu\" or \"a worshiper or follower of Vishnu\". However \"Vaishnava\" may also refer to worshiper of Rama, Nrisimha or Krishna, whereas \"Vishnuite\" more often refers to one who primarily worships Vishnu.\n\nThe principal belief of Vishnuism is the identification of Vishnu as supreme or principal worship of him as was the case in the Historical Vedic times. Hopiks writes: there is a passage like the great Ka hymn of the Rig Veda, 'whom as god shall one worship?' The sages say to Vishnu: \"All men worship thee;\" In the Rig Veda he is referred by his name of \"trivikrama\" (who took three strides) and is believed by some scholars as the starting point of the evidence of such worship.\n\nNumber of stages to the history of Vaishnavism place worship of Vishnu in different perspective according to the different theories by different authors. On the first stage, in its twofold aspect - historic and philosophical, is referred as by some as Bhagavata and is believed to be founded by Krishna-Vasudeva, of Yadava tribe. The philosophical basis of this stage was that supreme being is eternal, infinite and full of grace, and that salvation consisted in a life of perpetual bliss near the Lord. During this stage some believe that Pancaratra entered into alliance with ancient Samkhya yogic system, in line with tendency to combine philosophy with religion. It is this period that is described as the stage when the sect of Narayana was absorbed into temple of Krishna-Vasudeva. According to Grierson's views at this stage Bhagavatism became a sect of Brahmanised anti-Brahmanists. Hopkins often remarked on the often expressed view, that Bhagavad Gita bears witness to the compromise thus arrived at between Brahmanism and Bhagavatism - \"it is a Krishnaite version of a Vishnuite poem. For this reason Krishna, the personal name of Vasudeva, was given \"admission\" into the circle of Brahminical gods as an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nAdoption of Buddha as one of the avatars of Vishnu under Bhagavatism believed to be similarly a canalizing factor in assimilation in relationships during Gupta period 330-550 CE. Thus Mahayana Buddhism is sometimes called \"Buddha-Bhagavatism\". It is in this period that it is commonly accepted among academics that the concept of avatar of Vishnu was fully developed.\n\nThus complex religion of Vaishnavism is often viewed as a synthesis of the worship of gods Vishnu, Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna which is archived by the time of Bhagavad Gita (c. 4th century BCE to 3rd century CE). Worship of Vishnu is called Vishnuism and the monotheistic worship of Vishnu was already well developed in the period of the Itihasas.\n\nThis form of Vaishnavism flourished in South India and it is still commonplace, especially in present-day Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, as a result of the twelve Alvars, saints who spread the sect to the common people with their devotional hymns. The temples which the Alvars visited or founded are now known as Divya Desams. Their poems in praise of Vishnu and Krishna in Tamil language are collectively known as \"Naalaayira\" Divya Prabandham (alternatively called as Dravida Vedas).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11113141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11113141", "title": "Iara (mythology)", "text": "Iara (mythology)\n\nIara, also spelled Uiara or Yara (, , , , ) or Mãe das Águas (, \"mother of waters\"), is a figure from Brazilian mythology based on ancient Tupi and Guaraní mythology. The word derives from Old Tupi \"yîara\" = \"y\" + \"îara\" (water + lord/lady) = lady of the lake (water queen). She is seen as either a water nymph, siren, or mermaid depending upon the context of the story told about her. The Brazilian town of Nova Olinda claims the Cama da Mãe D’água as the home of Iara.\n\nIara is a beautiful young woman, sometimes described as having green hair, light brown or copper-colored skin (as that of an Indigenous Amerindian from Brazil, or of a ) and brown eyes, connected to a freshwater dolphin, manatee or fish body (the Tupi word \"y\" did not have a distinct meaning, being used in general for any riverine or freshwater lacustrine place) who would sit on a rock by the river combing her hair or dozing under the sun. When she felt a man around she would start to sing gently to lure him. Once under the spell of the Iara a man would leave anything to live with her underwater forever, which was not necessarily a bad thing, as she was pretty and would cater for all needs of her lover for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is often claimed that, until the 18th century, the Iara legend was originally about an aggressive monstrous river merman known as Ipupiara (\"freshwater monster\", in Portuguese phonological rules; by that [Pre-Pombaline] time, most Brazilians still spoke ), that would readily devour fishers, rather than that of a seducing, docile river mermaid.\n\nIaras are immortal (like the nymphs of Greek mythology), but her lovers do age and die, which means that they live most of eternity alone.\n\nThe legend of the Iara was one of the usual explanations for the disappearance of those who ventured alone in the jungle.\n\nIara (or Yara) is also a very popular female name in Brazil.\n\nThe Iara is similar in nature to several other female figures of folklore from other regions such as La Llorona from Mexico and the Southwestern United States, the Colombian creatures La Patasola and the \"Tunda\" and the Deer Woman of North America. All are females who at times function as sirens leading men to their death.\n\nIn the 1969 film version of the novel \"Macunaíma\", the protagonist of the same name meets his death at the hands of an Iara. He embraces her eagerly and sees too late the blow hole in the back of her neck that gives her away as the creature she is and not the beautiful woman he mistook her for.\n\nThis physical deformity marking an otherwise perfect woman is a common theme among siren figures in the Americas but it is usually one of the feet. Deer Woman has hooves for feet, La Patasola and the \"Tunda\" have deformed feet and \"La Llorona\" is often said to have no feet by those who see her.\n\n"}
{"id": "2436131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2436131", "title": "Imamate (Twelver doctrine)", "text": "Imamate (Twelver doctrine)\n\nImāmah () means \"leadership\" and is a concept in Twelver theology. The Twelve Imams are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, in the Twelver branch of Shia Islam. According to Twelver theology, the successors to Muhammad are infallible human beings, who rule justly over the community and maintain and interpret sharia and undertake the esoteric interpretation of the Quran. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the Imams guide the community. For this, the Imams must be free from error and sin and chosen by divine decree—\"nass\"—through the Prophet.\n\nShi'a believe that divine wisdom—'Aql—is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge—\"hikmah\"—and that their suffering is a means by which their devotees may acquire divine grace. The Imam is not the recipient of divine revelation, but has a close relationship with God, who guides him, allowing the Imam in turn to guide others. The Imamat, or belief in the divine guide, is a fundamental belief in Shia Islam and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.\n\nAccording to the Twelvers, an Imam of the Age is always the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law. Ali was the first Imam in this line and in the view of Twelvers the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by the male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be alive and in hiding.\n\nAccording to al-Mofid and Allamah Hilli, Imamate is a universal authority over the religious and secular matters of the community as the successor of the prophet and in Shia theology it means the legitimate successor to the Islamic community who are just the family of the prophet (ahl al-Bayt). not because they are the prophet's family, but because they have the prerequisites of religious and political leadership. Allamah Tabatabaei states that Imamate is under investigation from three perspectives: Islamic government, Islamic sciences and spiritual guidance.The Motahhari states that the term Imamate reflects spiritual and sociopolitical leadership. Shia theology, philosophy and mysticism, politics as well as historical progression derives from the doctrine of Imamah.\n\nTwo important functions of Muhammad were to reveal the divine law to humans and to guide them towards God. Twelver Shia believe that with the death of Muhammad, the first function, divine legislation, is completed, but that the second, guiding people and preserving and explaining the divine law, is continued through the Imams. Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam, explaining why the Imams are needed, states: \"So that the world may remain in righteousness, thus Allah withholds chastisement from the world while a Prophet or Imam is upon it, for Allah has said 'Allah will not chastise them while you are among them' 8:33 and the Prophet had said ' the stars are safety for the people of the heaven and the members of my family are safety for the people of the earth. By \"members of my family\" is meant the Imams...Through them Allah gives sustenance (Rizq) to His servants and through them His lands prosper and the rain falls from the heaven and the earth gives out its blessings\". The prophetic mission must be followed by a keeper of the Quran because it contains esoteric depth, superficial contradictions and hidden meaning. The meaning can be manifested not by ordinary knowledge, but by an inspired heir who is the Hujjah of Allah. Divine knowledge is attainable only through divine revelation or inspiration. While the prophet was a \"legislative prophet\" (nabi al-tashri), the continuation of the \"esoteric prophecy\" (nubuwah al-batiniyah) is through walayah. The role of the Imam in society is equivalent to the role of the mind in the body.\n\nBefore the creation of the world, from His own light, Allah derived a light called light of Nubuwwa (prophethood) or exoteric and from that derived another light called Walaya (Imamah) or esoteric. Allah said \"Here is a Light from my Light, its trunk is the prophecy and its branch is the Imamate; prophecy belongs to Muhammad, my servant and messenger and Imamate belongs to Ali, my proof and my friend. Without them, I would have created none of my creation...\" The very names of prophecy and Imamate are derived from the names of Allah. Allah has two kinds of attributes: Essence (Dhat) and Act (Fi'l); attributes of Essence exist in Allah Himself, not having its opposites, but attributes of the act, the Most Beautiful Names of Allah, are those which are manifested in His creatures, these creatures of manifestation of these attributes are Imams.Through these creatures, men could know His attributes.This is His plan to make Himself known. By verse 2:124, Shia believe that the position of Imamate is higher than prophethood. Shia believe that Imam is God's Witness for the people, the Gate to God (bāb Allāh) and the Road (sabīl) and the Pillar of His Unity so he should be infallible and chosen by God. Allamah al-Majlisi, a Shia scholar of the Safawid era, states: \"The Imams are superior to the prophets (except Muhammad) and the entire creation. The Covenant of the Imams was taken from the prophets, the angels and the entire creation. The major prophets called ulul-‘Azm (Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa and ‘Isa ) attained the status of ulul-‘Azm on account of loving the Imams.\" Muḥammad al-Bāqir narrates that God chose Ibraham first as a worshipper (ʿabd), then a prophet (nabī), then a messenger (rasūl), then a friend (khalīl) and finally as an Imam over the people. The Imams in many passages of Quran are referred as the Light of God (Nur), His Witnesses among mankind (Shuhada), His Signs (Ayat), those firm in the knowledge (Rasikhun), the vicegerents of God on earth (Khulafa), the gates through which he is approached (Abwab), the heirs of the knowledge of the prophet.The Imam is endowed with the holy spirit (Ruh al-Kuds). Shi'a Twelver believes that five \"Messengers\" achieved the rank of Leadership:Nuah, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa, Muhammad\n\nThe Imam as vicegerent is the representative of all of God's attributes, whom he manifests. The Imam is God's image and face. It is the highest position for man that is mentioned, (2:30) which causes the angels to prostrate themselves before him (15:30). Khalifah is God's appointee (38:26). As God's best representative and sign, the vicegerent in the best way can contribute to God's goals. So every attribute which God owns by His Essence, the vicegerent also owns by accident. The vicegerent is the epiphany (mazhar) of God's divine names. In fact he is the soul of the universe which can cause ontological changes in it.\n\nAllamah al-Majlisi states that the Imams are mediators between God and humankind and that through their intercession, man can escape the punishment of the last day. In addition to Muhammad's role as intermediate between God and man, he is also a mediator before God on behalf of his followers. According to Shia belief, this idea of a religious mediator includes the Imams. Al-Shaykh al-Saduq has recorded a tradition that the prophet told Ali: \"There are three things that I swear to be true. The first is that you and your descendants are mediators for mankind, as they will not be able to know Allah except through your introduction. The second is that you are to present to Allah those who may enter Paradise, i.e. those who recognize you and those whom you recognize. The third is that you are the absolute mediators, for those who will go to Hell will only be those who do not recognize you and whom you do not recognize.\" Al-Baqir said, \"through us God is known and is worshiped by human kind...whoever calls Allah through our mediation is blessed\". Without Imam, theophanic form (mazhar) and Face of Allah, no one can know Allah because through him, Allah manifests himself. Mulla Sadra explains that as the Imam is the perfect man—\"insan al-Kamel\"—is a higher-degree creature and the existence of the lower depends upon the higher degree, so the existence of the Imam is necessary.\n\nShia believe that the Divine Truth or the True Religion has two aspects: exoteric (zahir) and esoteric (batin). The exoteric side is revealed by the prophet and his Holy Book to the general people but the esoteric side is the mission of Imams and for the believers by the Esoteric interpretation of the Quran(Ta'wil). As the exoteric speaks of Shariah and esoteric speaks of Haqiqah, it is not a matter of succession but a matter of simultaneity. Haqiqah is based on the spiritual meaning of Quran. The kinship between the prophet and Imams is the sign of their walayah, not the basis for their walayah. According to Shia just those are the real faithful that \"Allah has written faith upon their hearts\" (58:22): only if Walayah is obtained the faith is perfect. Shia theologians refer to the verse 5:55 as a proof for the Walayah of Imams. According to Motahhari, Walayah has four dimensions: the right of love, loving the Ahl al-Bayt is obligatory for all Muslims, the authority of Alh al-Bayt in spiritual guidance, the authority of Ahl al-Bayt in socio-political guidance and the authority of the universal nature by the grace of Allah. By Shia, in fact, a guardian must protect the religion against any additions or subtractions after the prophet. According to al-Baqir, the prophet has revealed the religion but in every age there must be an Imam who leads to the religion and verse 13:7 refers to Imam. A hadith narrates that \"He who knows himself knows his Lord.\", but knowing Allah without His theophanic form (Mazhar), the Face of Allah, is impossible. Imam is the one who carries the human knowledge of Allah, without him we will be trapped in ta'til or metaphysical idolatry (tashbih).\" Numerous Shia hadith narrate: The Quran is the silent Imam, the Imam is the speaking Quran; Imam is the Guide by whom Quran remains alive. Regarding this matter, Mulla Sadra believes that the earth can not be without an Imam otherwise, the Quran will die. By Shia, Wali is the one who has the most love and devotion to God, so God has bestowed His knowledge upon him.\n\nThe Hujja means the proof or God's guarantee to men; as the presence of the Hujja, whether hidden or apparent, is necessary for all times, this presence expresses the metaphysical reality of the Hujja and the inseparability of the prophetology from Imamology. Al-Baqir stated, \"...Imam is the Proof of Allah to His servants and the earth will not remain without the Proof of Allah to His servants\". From the Time of Adam, Allah has sent Imams to guide the people towards Him who are His Hujjah upon His worshippers. Khomeni described \"Proof of Allah\" as follows: \"A ‘Proof of Allah’ is one whom Allah has designated to\nconduct affairs, all his deeds, actions and sayings constitute a proof for the Muslims. If someone commits an offense, will be made to the ‘proof’ for adducing evidence and formulating the charge. If the ‘proof’ commands you to perform a certain act, to implement the penal provisions of the law in a certain way, or to spend the income derived from booty,\nzakat and sadaqa in a certain manner and if you fail to obey him in any of these respects, then God Almighty will advance a ‘proof’ against you on the day of Judgment\".\n\nThe Shia believe that only the divinely chosen one is the legitimate leader of the community who owns some spiritual gifts. The first of these leaders was Ali ibn Abi Talib and his successors were the descendants of the prophet and the heirs of the charisma of Ali. Imams possess all the attributes, duties, authorities of the prophet except receiving revelation. They are the political and religious guardians over the community. Although Imam has a political role, his Imamah does not depend on this role. According to verse 5:55, because absolute authority belongs to Allah, He can grant this authority to whomever He wishes as Guardians. Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr stated that the political and spiritual dimensions are inseparable.\n\nAccording to Shia theology, Imam must display three attributes: divine appointment (nass), wisdom (hikmah), superiority (afdaliyyah). This right to authority is derived from the prophet and Quran and thereby Allah.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of Shia is that Imam is designated by the prophet and every Imam nominates his successor by divine designation (nass). The divine designation is a logical necessity because Imam must be infallible and as this is a hidden virtue, known only to Allah. Thus this designation is expressed to the people only by an infallible: the previous Prophet or Imam. Al-Baqir stated that the prophet was commanded by Allah, before his death, to grant to Ali his knowledge, his faith and the Great Name (al-Ism al-A'zam), as well as the legacy of knowledge and prophethood so that the Divine Heritage would be continued through the prophet's progency. So one of the fundamentals in the principle of Imamate was nass al-Jali (explicit designation) which was hereditary. Shia Muslims believe that Allah appointed leaders for those who practice the religion of Allah. When the prophet had taught the people the religion, he would then appoint a leader, in accordance with the orders of Allah, to guide believers towards perfection. Imamate is a universal authority and this right is derived from (niyabah) the prophet. Allamah Majlesi stated that from the time of Adam, every prophet had a successor. Imam like the prophet had a perfect authority over the Muslim community including matters of religion and government. As the prophet is the representative of Allah, his successor is also a representative of Allah. If he is to represent Allah, he must be appointed by Allah. Imam can not be distinguished except by designation. Following verse 2:124 of Quran, Shia believe that Imamah is something that is given by Allah and must be appointed by Him. The earth never can be without a true Imam. The relation between Imams is spiritual, carrying the Muhammadan Light from one Imam to the other. The Shia idea that the succession should continue in the descendants of the prophet originates from the Quran as verse 4:54.\n\nShia believe that Ismah is a logical prerequisite of Imamah as Allah has made their obedience necessary and the verse 33:33 proves Ismah of the fourteen infallible. Ismah in addition to sinlessness means infallibility, without error. Imam by virtue of Nass based on Hikmah (wisdom) and Nur (light) becomes Ma'sum (Infallible).\n\nThe Imam has a perfect knowledge about religion and mankind. The Imams are the most knowledgeable in religious law and the rewards and punishments of the next world. They understand the literal meaning and the internal meaning (Ta'wil) of the Quran. Some Hadiths state the link between Allah and the Imams is a pillar descending from the heaven. The sources of the knowledge of Imam are the transmission from the previous Imam, inherited knowledge, acquired through angels and acquired from books whose contents are known only to the Imams. According to some Hadiths, Imams possess several special books including Al-Jafr (The Divination), Al-Sahifa (The Book), Al-Jamia (The Compilation), Book of Fatimah and a codex of Quran and its commentary (Mus'haf of Ali) written by Ali. He has the knowledge of the Greatest Name of Allah. As Imams are the manifestation of the attributes of act (fi'l) of Allah, their Knowledge is equivalent to the Knowledge of Allah. Imams have all the revealed books of the prophets. As Sayyid Haydar Amuli states: \"All the Imams are one and the same Light (nur), one and the same Essence (haqiqah), exemplified in twelve persons.\" The hereditary character of nass embodied in itself a kind of exclusive Hikmah for its recipient which was traced back to Ali of whom the prophet told \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\". Ibn Babaway states that \"the title Amir al-Momenin reserved for Imam indicates that he is the storehouse (mirror) of knowledge (mira't al-ilm) from whom people derived knowledge but he did not derive knowledge from anyone else.\" Only Imam has knowledge of Unseen (Ilm al-Qayb) and fully understands Quran and worldly matters, a knowledge that he received from Allah through Muhammad. Only Quran and Imam can truly manifest the Divine Truth.\n\nAs the Imam is infallible (masum), he is the best of his age, otherwise, Allah would choose another. Ontologically the fourteen infallibles are superior to prophets, since they are created from a nobler matter. In Quran, with respect to kingship (Imamate) and wisdom (hikmah, book), the heirs of the prophets are their descendants and kin. Al-Baqir states that Imamate is among the progeny of Imams as indicated in verse 33:6 which its interpretation refers to the descendants of Husayn ibn Ali. He added that the light that is mentioned in verse 64:8 refers to Imams who are the light of Allah, this spiritual light which passes from the prophet to Imams is the symbol of eternal knowledge (hikmah). Referring to the light, he stated,\" the first beings that Allah created were Mohammad and his family, the rightly guided ones and the guides, they were the phantoms of light before Allah\". Personal qualities are known only through Quran or hadith. Although Imamate is not hereditary, Shia believe that Imamate are among the progeny of Muhammad.\n\nAccording to Ja'far al-Sadiq: \" We are the ones to whom Allah has made obedience obligatory. The people will not prosper unless they recognize us and the people will not be excused if they are ignorant of us. He who has recognised us is a believer (Momin) and he who has denied us is an unbeliever (Kafir)\"... Al-Riza remarks that \"...whoever tends not to be separated from Allah, he love the household of Mohammad ...and follow his Imam, whoever does this is under the mercy of Allah...\" Kulaini, Na'mani attributed a tradition to al-Baqir that those who worship Allah without recognizing his righteous Imam are not accepted.\n\nIf the Imamate of Imams is not affirmed, one can not enter into heaven. Al-Baqir states that according to verse 42:23, the believers must both obey and love the Imams. Shia believe that Imamah is inseparable from Wilayah, which involves loving ahl al-Bayt (Imams), obeying them in their commands and prohibitions, recognising their rights and believing in their Imamat and that this is one of the five principles (usul) of Shia. According to al-Khu'i: \"the wilayat and imamate in the meaning of succession (khilafat) is an essential part (dharuriy) of Shi'ism; anyone who rejects this dimension of the wilayat would not be considered as a Shia\". Muhammad Baqir Majlisi states: \"All the Imamis agree that the spiritual validity of deeds and Allah's approval of them are conditioned by faith (Imam); this point is as integral a part of faith as is love for the Twelve Imams and their imamate.\" Sajjad, the fourth Imam, states that the religion is attained only through submission and whoever submits to the Imams is guided and blissful. Obeying the Imams is obligatory because Allah has thus commanded.\n\nAccording to Tabatabaei (21:73, 32:24) the word guidance is used side by side by the word Imamah and is followed by \"our command\", a kind of guidance with a divine command that conveys humankind to the final truth, not just showing the way. According to Mesbahyazdi, while Allah is the Creator, all praise is due to Him and He is the only ontological (takwini) and legislative (tashri'e) Lord. So everyone who wishes to be a servant and a monotheist should accept His legislative laws and accept the executer of His laws, because this is His Will (Iradah). A mutawatir hadith narrates that loving the prophet's family (Ahl al-Bayt) is the sign of faith and enmity towards them is the sign of hypocrisy. According to Mottahari, everyone who does not accept walayah, he is in enmity with walayah which causes his deeds to be worthless (6:88, 18:105, 14:18,3:117, 25:23), because he is not humble before the Truth which is the basis of a pure deed. Many hadith introduce Imam as the Guide because there is no knowledge of Allah accessible to man without the knowledge of Imam. Through hadiths, in order to reach to Allah, man must pass the Path (Sirat) who are the Imams.\n\nAs Muhammad was the last person to receive revelation, the Imams receive divine inspiration (elham) and, as such, are in contact with the holy source of knowledge. A hadith narrates that \"Imam hears the voice of the Angel, but does not have his vision, either in sleep or in waking\". Imams get Revelation but not like the prophets. They are called Muhaddatht and are spoken to by angels via sounds through their ears and are supported by the Holy Spirit. They receive additional information on the Night of Power Laylat al-Qadr. They make Spiritual Ascension to the Divine Throne on Friday to add their knowledge. Regarding this matter, Shaykh al-Muzaffar explains: \"We maintain that the powers of the Imams to receive inspiration have reached the highest degree of excellence and we say that it is a Divinely given power. By this means the Imam is able to understand information about anything, anywhere and at anytime and he understands by means of this Divinely-given power at once, without recourse to methodological reasoning or guidance from a teacher. When he desires to know about some matter, it is reflected in his pure mind as if in a polished mirror. It is clear from the histories\nof their lives that like the Prophet, the Imams were not trained or taught by anyone at all, not even in reading and writing, from their childhoods to the maturing of their minds. No author or teacher was seen to instruct one of them, but they were incomparable masters of knowledge so that they never asked\nabout any problem without being able to answer it immediately and they never said that they did not know. They never required time to consider a question before replying.\"\n\nShias claim the verse of Light (24:35) is attributed to The Fourteen Infallible. According to Shia sources on the nature and basis of Imamate, H al-Baqir emphasizes that verse 5:55 refers to Ali. According to al-Baqir's interpretation of verse 35:32, Imams are \"Then we caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants\". Shias mind verse 4:59, which signifies a perfect love and obedience to divine guides.\n\nOther Shia sources claim that Imams are expressed in Quran as: \"the Supreme Sign\" (al-Ayat al-Kobra) (79:20), \"the August Symbol\" (al-Mathal al-a'la) (16:60), \"the Most Solid Handle\" (al-Urwat al-Wuthqa) (2:256), (31:22). According to al-Baqir Imams are the Light of Allah (64:8, 57:28). These verses (28:68, 2:30, 38:26, 2:124, 21:73) state that Imamate is a divine appointment and a fallible person can not be an Imam. Madelung, regarding the blood ties which is found in Quran, states the superiority of Ali for his succession. Regarding verse 2:124, Tabatabaei states that Imamah is a divine status, Imam must be Ma'sum (infallible), the earth can not be without an Imam, Imam have the complete knowledge which is related to this world and the next of the people, Imam excels all people in all virtues. However it is argued by many scholars that the 12 Shia Imams have not been mentioned in the Quran and the Shia doctrine of Imamah is based heavily on interpretation based on weak hadiths.\n\nIn Ghadir Khum, when Ali was appointed Imamate, verse 5:3 was revealed, which expresses that the religion had become perfect because of the appointment of Ali to Imamate. and obedience to him had become obligatory upon Muslims. Hadith of Two Weighty Things reflects the proximity of the Imams to the Quran. Addressing Hussain, the prophet said:\" you are Imam, the son of the Imam, the brother of the Imam, nine of your lineal descendants will be pious Imams, the ninth of them being their Qa'im. The Shia scholar 'Allamah Kashif al-Ghita said about the Imamah: \"Imamah is a divine station, just like Nubuwwah. Just as Allah chooses whomsoever He wants to for Nubuwwah and Risalah … similarly, for Imamah, too, He selects whomsoever He wishes.\"\n\nAl-Baqir states that while people need a guide for their journey to a strange place, their journey to heaven is stranger and more in need of a guide. Al-Mufid states that an Imam is necessary for defining the exact laws that are obligatory upon the Muslims. Many verses in Quran are ambiguous, revelation of Quran without further explanation is unlikely from Allah. While Imamate brings the people nearer to obedience and away from disobedience, it is Grace (Lutf) that is incumbent of Allah. Regarding rejecting the Imamah-doctrine, , writes: \"Imamah is a universal grace (lutf ‘amm) while Nubuwwah (prophethood) is a special grace (lutf khass), it is possible that a specific period in time can be void of a living Nabi while the same is not true for the Imam. To reject universal grace is worse than to reject any special grace. The prophet founded an eternal Shari'ah for all the times and this eternal religion could not continue without a leader.\n\nIn the period of Minor Occultation, theologians like Ibn Qube Razi, Newbakhtis, al-Shaykh al-Mufid, Seyyed Morteza and al-Shaykh al-Tusi rebuild the theological school of Imamiyah. In the second and third century of Hijra, a Ma'sum (infallible) and divinely chosen leader of the religion was more focused than the political role of the Imams by the theologians. Although Imamiyah believed that most of the works on the early Islamic centuries argue that Shi'ism began as a political movement rather than a religious group. However this does not mean that religious sentiments were absent in the first century.\nDakake believes that the doctrine of Imamate was established in the time of Ja'far al-Sadiq, while Kohlberg states that the Twelver Shi'ism dates back not much before the beginning of the \"Major_Occultation\".\n\nMuhammad is reported to have said that the Islamic leadership is in Koreish (i.e., his tribe) and that 12 “Imams” shall succeed him. Sunni and Shiite sects differ as to whom Muhammad was referring. Muhammad stated (authenticated by Sunnis and Shiites), that “Whoever does not know the Imam of his Lifetime (Hadith of the Current Imam: i.e., recognizes same) has died the death of Ignorance”. The idea of a prophet appointing a successor is found in the Old Testament where Joshua son of Nun is declared Moses’ successor or manager of his affairs after his death.\nShias believe that just as Moses appointed Aaron as his successor on Bani-Israel, (Hadith of position), in accordance with God’s order, Muhammad, the final prophet, appointed Ali ibn Abi Talib to be the leader of the believers.\n\nThe Shi'a Twelver denomination of Islam consider it to be the highest level of responsibility given by God to a human.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jacques was a young aimless dreamer. Brought up a Roman Catholic, he abandoned religion by the age of 17, after his parents divorced. He was expelled from school for laziness and misconduct. At 21, he married his pregnant girlfriend Pierrette in a civil ceremony. He gave up a position at his father's bank, lived the life of a playboy, left his wife and their daughter, and fathered an illegitimate son with another woman. Disillusioned with his life, he dreamed of escaping to sail around the South Pacific Ocean, but his parents refused to pay for a boat.\n\nOn 24 February 1954, to fund the purchase of a boat, he went to rob Alexandre Sylberstein, a money changer, of gold coins. Sylberstein was struck but not unconscious, and raised the alarm. Fesch fled, losing his glasses, and shot wildly at Jean Vergne, a pursuing police officer, killing him. Minutes later he was arrested. Murdering a police officer was a heinous crime and public opinion, inflamed by newspaper reports, was strongly in favour of his execution. The Cour d'assises of Paris condemned him to death on 6 April 1957.\n\nAt first Fesch was indifferent to his plight and mocked his lawyer's Catholic faith. However, after a year in prison, he experienced a profound religious conversion, became very pious, and bitterly regretted his crime. He corresponded regularly with his family, notably his brother and stepmother, and kept a spiritual journal. He accepted his punishment serenely and was reconciled to his wife the night before his execution. His last journal entry was \"In five hours, I will see Jesus!\". An appeal for clemency to President René Coty failed, and he was guillotined.\n\nAfter his death his wife and daughter honoured his memory as an example of redemption. At first he was excoriated by the public, but with the work of Soeur Véronique, a Carmelite nun, and Father Augustin-Michel Lemonnier, the family effected publication of his writings, and from the 1970s these served as an inspiration to many.\n\nOn September 21, 1987 the Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, opened a diocesan inquiry into his life; the cause for his beatification was formally opened in 1993. This has proved controversial, with those who feel his early crimes make him unfitting as a role model opposed to those who emphasize the hope of his final conversion.\n\nThe extraordinary story of Jacques Fesch remains relatively unknown in France. However, inspired by the true events of this \"murderer turned Christian,\" the students of Ss Cyril and Method High School in Nitra, Slovakia, under the direction of Sr. Maria Marthe Galová, wrote and performed a theatrical play, \"Spomeň si na mňa\" (Remember Me), which is based on the life and conversion of Jacques.The play premiered on March 11, 2018, in the Andrej Bagar Theatre, Nitra.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1084815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1084815", "title": "Kum Nye", "text": "Kum Nye\n\nKum Nye and sKu-mNyé are a wide variety of Tibetan religious and medical body practices. The two terms are different spellings in the Latin alphabet of the same Tibetan phrase (Wylie: \"sku mnye\"), which literally means \"massage of the subtle body\". Some systems of \"sku mnye\" are vaguely similar to Yoga, T'ai chi, Qigong, or therapeutic massage. \"Kum Nye\", Ku Nye, and Kunye are also used to transcribe the Tibetan phrases \"dku mnye\" (\"belly massage\") and \"bsku mnye\" (\"oil massage\"), which are pronounced identically to \"sku mnye\". \"dKu mnye\" and \"bsku mnye\" manipulate the physical body, rather than the subtle (energetic) one.\n\nSystems of Kum Nye are found in many Tibetan Buddhist and Bön traditions. These can be entirely different both in purpose and in methods. For instance, some forms are very slow moving; others are intensely aerobic. Some systems are based in the Tibetan Medical Tantras (scriptures), and are mainly therapeutic. Other systems are based in Dzogchen, and are mainly religious in purpose.\n\nThree systems of \"sku mnye\" have been described and taught in detail in English. These are Tarthang Tulku's Kum Nye, the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé Systems of \"bsku mnye\" are taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine and the Shang Shung Institute.\n\nLama Tarthang Tulku first introduced Kum Nye into the West. He has written five books on the subject. \n\nThis system appears to be largely from the Medical Tantras, but includes exercises similar to those found in the Dzogchen series. It is based on very slow movements, stillness practices, and massage. This Kum Nye has been described as Inner Massage.\n\nTo give an example, in the exercise called \"flying\" the practitioner extends their arms slowly out from the side up to stretching above the head and then slowly back down again. One cycle can take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. The practice of breathing in and out of both nose and mouth at the same time is recommended while doing the exercises. The key is to pay close attention to the subtleties of sensations and the quality of experience while doing the exercises, thus linking body and mind in the presence of awareness given to the sensations.\n\nThis system is part of the Aro gTér, a Nyingma terma. It is described in detail in the book \"moving being\", by Khandro Déchen.\n\nAro sKu-mNyé belongs to Longde, the section of Dzogchen concerned with the subtle body. As with all Dzogchen methods, its main goal is to realize rigpa, or non-dual awareness. This is described as \"finding the presence of awareness in the dimension of sensation\". Physical exercises are used to \"shake\" the tsa-lung system of energetic \"channels\", winds\", and \"essences\". This perceptually disorients the practitioner, and produces \"zap nyams\". Zap nyams (Wylie: \"zab nyams\"), literally \"profound experiences\" in Tibetan, are described as \"intense psychophysical sensations\". These are said to occur in the energetic space that surrounds the body, rather than in the physical body.\n\nAlthough the purpose of the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé is mainly religious, the system is said also to have a variety of mundane benefits, including more vivid sensory experience, emotional openness, enhanced meditation, physical fitness, and lessening of depression.\n\nIn practice, Aro sKu-mNyé is a set of 111 movement exercises divided into series that correspond to the Buddhist five elements. They range from simple and gentle to vigorous and extremely difficult, and bear no similarity to any other Eastern or Western form of exercise. The moving exercises are alternated with periods of motionless meditation. The instructions for the Aro sKu-mNyé exercises frequently give very specific details about eye movements.\n\nAro sKu-mNyé is taught by instructors certified by a board headed by the Aro Lamas.\n\n\"lie on your back / legs splayed as far apart as comfortable / arms 90 degrees to your body / palms upwards / eyes closed / simultaneously (with a quick movement) raise your torso and legs (legs straight and locked at the knee) / simultaneously clap feet together and hands together (arms are straight and locked at the elbow) / in the moment of clapping, open eyes wide and shout Ra! (roll the 'R' to enunciate fiercely) / when clapping feet and hands, eyes, hands, and feet should be at the same height – feet and hands meet at the same level as your eyes; and at this point your bottom is all that is touching the floor / it is important that the back is kept absolutely straight / try to achieve an angle of 45 degrees to the floor, but NOT by bending your back – bending the back will result in injury! / relax back into the starting position and repeat\"\n\nThe Ku Nye taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine is a system of therapeutic oil massage. It is based in the Medical Tantras. Its benefits are said to include elimination of toxins, increased vitality, pain reduction, and calming of nervous disorders including insomnia, depression and anxiety.\n\nThe Shang Shung Institute, affiliated with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, offers a Training program in Kunye Massage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16458815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16458815", "title": "Lamdre", "text": "Lamdre\n\nLamdré is a meditative system in Tibetan Buddhism rooted in the view that the result of its practice is contained within the path. The name \"lamdré\" means the “path\" () with its fruit ). In Tibet, the lamdré teachings are considered the \"summum bonum\" of the Sakya school.\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, the lamdré teachings were originally bestowed upon Virūpa, an Indian monk, by the tantric deity Nairātmyā. By practicing the instructions given to him, Virūpa is said to have realized enlightenment. Hagiographical accounts of Virūpa’s exploits record outrageous events, including binge drinking, seducing women, and destroying non-Buddhist (Skt. \"tīrtika\") religious sites. Davidson suggests that this depiction shows the laxity of Buddhist morals during the Indian medieval period, but Wedemeyer suggests that the behavior shown in esoteric Buddhist hagiographies is intentionally scandalous, forming a social commentary on broader issues being discussed in the Indian religious milieu.\n\nDuring his adventures in India, Virūpa converted the Hindu yogin Kāṇha (also called Kṛṣṇa, ) and wrote the \"Vajra Verses\" as a guide to Kāṇha’s meditations. The teachings were passed from mentor to student in India until they reached the sage Gayādhara.\n\nLamdré entered Tibet through the Indian paṇḍita Gayādhara (d. 1103) in 1041. Gayādhara worked with a Tibetan lotsawa, Drogmi Śākya Yeshe (, 993-1077?), to translate a plethora of Buddhist tantras from Indian classical and vernacular languages. Drogmi himself spent considerable time in India and Nepal learning both the exoteric and esoteric teachings of Mahayana Buddhism, and was both an accomplished scholar and meditation master when he returned to Tibet. Gayādhara transmitted the entire Lamdré teaching to Drogmi, who in turn passed the teachings on to several other disciples. \n\nA student of Drogmi Lotsāwa, Chos bar, instructed Sachen Künga Nyingpo, who is considered the founder of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. Sachen mastered the teachings over a period of eighteen years and wrote several explications of the root text of the Lamdré system. He instructed his two sons, Loppön Sönam Tsemo and Jetsün Dragpa Gyaltsen, who themselves became accomplished masters of lamdré. The teachings became fully incorporated into the Sakya school and grew to be the main practice of the Sakyapa.\n\n\nThe lamdré system is rooted in a very specific view, that the path and its result are contained within each other. All beings have an inherently enlightened nature; however, due to afflictive obscurations, they are prevented from recognizing this nature. The path to Buddhahood, then, aims at removing these obscurations and experiencing the liberated existence of nirvāṇa. \n\nJetsün Dragpa Gyaltsen summarized the path into five stages:\n1. initiation \n2. the creation stage\n3. the completion stage\n4. training \n5. concluding practice with tantric seals\n\nThe view that saṃsāra (cyclical existence) and nirvana (liberation from suffering) are indivisible illuminates the Lamdré teachings. To enter the path, a student must be consecrated (Skt. \"abhiṣeka\") by an authentic mentor (Skt. guru, Tibetan lama), who instructs the student on how to recognize his or her own buddha-nature. Initiation into the system of practice is crucial because it shows the Lamdré practitioner the result of the path, the wisdom of a buddha.\n\nAfter being consecrated, the student then engages in the practices of the path. The path includes specific meditations and yogic exercises that aim to remove the adventitious obscurations that are the cause suffering. As with most Anuttarayoga Tantra systems, the Lamdré practitioner will engage in two stages of meditation, the creation stage (), where the meditator attempts to embody the awake nature of a buddha, and the completion stage (), which includes yogic meditations on various parts of the tantric anatomy. These practices directly purify obscurations. \n\nIn the lamdré tradition, the instructions for mediation are passed orally from mentor to student. As with all tantric Buddhist lineages, in the lamdré tradition, maintaining the secrecy of the teachings is extremely important. This is a reason why the consecration and initiation of the student into the tradition is strongly emphasized. Although eventually teachers like Sachen Künga Nyingpo wrote down oral instructions, originally, the important texts were memorized by the students. This tradition continues to the present day, where some oral teachings remain unwritten, known only by lamdré lineage holders.\n\nThe root text of the lamdré tradition is Virūpa’s \"Vajra Verses\" (). These verses form the basis of practice, explicate the view of the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and allude to experiences on the path. Because of the cryptic nature of the topics contained in the \"Vajra Verses\", secret instructions (Skt. \"upadeśa\") from the mentor are required to make use of them. Within the tradition of Lamdré literature, eleven commentaries on the \"Vajra Verses\" were written by Sachen Künga Nyingpo. Other volumes of importance include the \"Pod ser\" by Jetsün Dragpa Gyaltsen and the \"Pod nag\" by Lama Sönam Gyaltsen.\n\nAlthough the \"Vajra Verses\" are considered the essence of the lamdré teachings, the actual practice of the system comes from the \"Hevajra tantra\" and its supplemental explanatory tantras. \nThe \"Vajra Verses\" elucidate the experiences that one will have while practicing the tantric liturgy (Skt. sādhanā) of the deity Hevajra. However, although, traditionally the Lamdré is intimately connected with the \"Hevajra Tantra\", because of the ambiguous language of the \"Vajra Verses\", other tantric systems could theoretically be used in the creation stage, as Sachen does in his \"Yum don ma\" commentary, where he connects the \"Vajra Verses\" to the Cakrasaṃvara Tantra for the creation stage meditations. \n\nWithin the sub-sects of the Sakya school, there are unique traditions of lamdré instructions. Certain controversies of the types of practices included in some traditions occurred, but eventually most Sakyapas agreed that the Slob bshad teachings were the standard.\n\nThe lamdré tradition continues to be practiced by the Sakya school today. The current head of the Sakya school, the Sakya Trizin Ngawang Künga, gave the Lamdré teachings at Dzongsar Institute in India in 2008. In 2009, he bestowed lamdré in Australia.\n\nDavidson, Ronald M. \"Indian Esoteric Buddhism : A Social History of the Tantric Movement\".

He was the live-in son-in-law of the series' lead character, Archie Bunker, who frequently called him \"Meathead\". Michael was the husband of Archie's daughter Gloria (played by Sally Struthers). Rob Reiner played the role of Michael Stivic throughout the series.\n\nThe character of Michael Stivic is an Americanized version of the British original: \"Till Death Us Do Part\"'s Mike Rawlins, the Trotskyist \"Randy Scouse Git\" who arouses the passionate ire of his arch-conservative father-in-law Alf Garnett. For the American version of this character, the Trotskyist angle was drastically softened: Michael Stivic is a social liberal and a leftist, but not an adherent of any form of communism and is presented as possibly a Democrat who is sympathetic to the Students for a Democratic Society movement (SDS), which is hinted by his occasional use of SDS ally and Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman's guerrilla theatre antics.\n\nMichael Stivic is a Polish-American from Chicago. He was orphaned at a young age, with his parents having been killed in a car crash. He was raised by his uncle Casimir Stivic, an ex-Marine lieutenant turned florist, who calls him \"Mickey\" with great affection. He also had an uncle Alex.\n\nWhen \"All in the Family\" begins, Michael is married to Gloria and shares a bedroom with her in the home of her parents, whom he addresses as \"Ma\" and \"Archie\" (or \"Arch\"), while focusing his efforts on earning a college degree in sociology. His first meeting with Archie (seen in a flashback) shows him as a bearded hippie with a tie-dyed shirt. His wardrobe throughout most of the series is much more subdued: most often he wears a denim shirt, jeans, and boots. He shaves his beard for his wedding with Gloria, but keeps his mustache afterwards (on rare occasions later in the series, however, he would go for a clean-shaven look) and wears his hair well below the collar. (As Reiner's hairline was receding very rapidly early on in the series, he began wearing a toupee when playing the character.) In season 2, episode 5, \"Flashback: Mike Meets Archie\" (mentioned above), which first aired October 16, 1971, Mike and Gloria celebrate their first wedding anniversary. A 1972 episode centers on Mike and Gloria's second wedding anniversary, while in the 1978 episode \"The Stivics Go West\" it is revealed that Mike and Gloria are coming upon the ninth anniversary.\n\nExacerbating the conflicts between college student Michael and his conservative father-in-law Archie Bunker, is the fact that in the early years of the television series, these two characters live under the same roof. This proximity means that the tensions between these seemingly diametrically opposed people result in endless arguments over the simplest of topics, even the proper order in which to put on socks and shoes. Along with other issues, such as Michael's frequent decision to sit in Archie's coveted chair and huge appetite for food purchased by Archie's working-class income, their huge ideological differences greatly contributed to the conflict between the two characters. Michael is a determined agnostic-though he would at times identify himself as an atheist in order to rile up Archie, who assumed he was in complete disbelief of God-, in contrast to his mother-in-law's quiet Christian church attendance and his non-practicing but nonetheless staunchly Christian father-in-law. He also is a dedicated humanitarian who wishes to help change the world: originally, Michael wanted to become a social worker, but his career aspirations shifted towards teaching as the series progressed. When the neighboring Jefferson family moves out of the neighborhood, the family patriarch George allows Michael to rent his old house so Michael and Gloria can have a home of their own. George, however, is still the house's legal owner. Although being next door still results in frequent visits, the tension between Michael and Archie eases as they now live under different roofs.\n\nDespite his frequent conflicts with his father-in-law, Mike enjoys a warm relationship with his mother-in-law, Edith, whom he calls \"Ma\". Edith frequently intervenes to try to defuse tensions between her husband and son-in-law, though she also occasionally takes Mike to task for initiating unnecessary arguments with Archie, and, in 1973 episode \"Games Bunkers Play\", offers insight to Mike into Archie's attitude toward him, suggesting that Archie had to drop out of high school to help support his family during the Depression, and that he resents the fact that Mike had the chance to attend college and advance his education.\n\nMichael is presented as a representative of the counterculture of the 1960s (reflecting current events during the period in which the show was broadcast). There is no suggestion, however of the drug use or \"free love\" of that subculture and Michael is a dedicated academic. It is revealed in the season eight episode \"Gloria and Mike Meet\" that in 1969, Michael's dedication to humanitarianism was galvanized in order to weaken support for newly elected President Richard Nixon and that he was probably a member of the SDS's newly formed Worker Student Alliance that sought to encourage university students to find ways to fix problems within the working class.\n\nThough supportive of human rights, Michael would at times display male chauvinism as well; examples showed when he did not want his appendix removed by a female doctor and was a sore loser when playing a board game called \"Group Therapy\" with his family and neighbors. Though he differed with Archie over the potential successes women and racial minorities could achieve, Michael also believed that neither could socially evolve without good education from people like him; such an example showed when he falsely characterized a blue-collar handyman's African American assistant as a minstrel show stereotype who donned the same \"happy-go-lucky\" attire as his boss in the season 3 episode \"Everybody Tells the Truth\" (Archie's version is just as stereotyped—the assistant is a member of the Black Power movement and his boss is a mafia thug). He was also determined to ensure that Gloria shared his beliefs.\n\nAlthough taken by surprise, Michael is excited to learn that Gloria is pregnant in 1971, though the pregnancy ends in a miscarriage. Gloria becomes pregnant again in 1975 and their baby Joseph \"Joey\" Stivic is born in December of that year.\n\nDuring early episodes, Michael's best friend is Lionel Jefferson. In the first season, Lionel surprises Michael by announcing that he and his family are moving into the house next door to the Bunkers. However, the characters rarely see or refer to each other after the Jeffersons leave \"All in the Family\" to join the spin-off \"The Jeffersons\", George Jefferson, however, would later make a guest appearance at his old residence when the Stivics start preparing for their move to California and meet with him to give notice that they will no longer be staying in his house. Another of Michael's close friends, Al Bender (played by Billy Crystal), marries Gloria's best friend Trudy Tannen in a 1976 episode.\n\nMike accepts a faculty position at UCSB and he and Gloria move to Santa Barbara, California, at the end of the 1977–78 season (at which time Reiner and Struthers ceased to be regulars on the show). They appear in a Christmas episode during the 1978–79 season, in which Archie and Edith (and Edith's niece Stephanie) visit Michael and Gloria, exposing the fact that the couple have secretly separated due to troubles in their marriage, including an infidelity Gloria had with one of his college faculty colleagues. Though they seemingly resolve their differences during this episode, a Thanksgiving visit by Mike and Gloria to the Bunkers' house during the 1979-80 season of \"Archie Bunker's Place\" shows that the Stivics' marriage is still troubled, exacerbated by Michael having lost his job after he and Gloria participated in a nude protest of a proposed nuclear power plant and got arrested. This is the last appearance of the character.\n\nMichael Stivic does not appear in the 1982 spin-off series \"Gloria\", which starred Sally Struthers. Initially, Reiner had been asked to participate in the series, resurrecting his Michael Stivic character, but he declined. It is explained (on the show) that Michael had left his wife and young son Joey (then played by Christian Jacobs) to live in a California commune with one of his students (which suggests he had found a new teaching job) -- whom Gloria described as \"the homecoming queen, a girl named Muffy\"—and was in the process of going through a bitter divorce. At the beginning of the series (September 1982), it has been 63 days since Michael walked out on Gloria; Michael calls to invite Gloria to the commune, but things deteriorate quickly when he claims Gloria is incapable holding a job, or of supporting herself and Joey. By the end of the series (spring 1983), the divorce is final.\n\nArchie routinely refers to Michael by the derogatory nickname \"Meathead\", from the first time they meet, as seen in flashback in the second season episode \"Mike Meets Archie\". In Archie's own words, it means \"dead from the neck up\". Rob Reiner has said that \"I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write 'Meathead wins the Nobel Prize'.\"\n\nA later episode of \"All in the Family\" reveals that Archie Bunker himself was referred to as \"Meathead\" in his youth.\n\nNorman Lear said his father used to call him \"Meathead\".\n"}

It is associated with the historic image (statue) and pilgrimage centre in the community of Willesden, originally a village in Middlesex, England, but now a suburb of London. The pre-Reformation shrine was home to the Black Madonna of Willesden statue.\n\nWillesden has always possessed a water well, from which the community derives its name, which means \"spring at the foot of the hill\". The well was associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary, and with the church dedicated to her, St Mary's, Willesden. The church and well are of great antiquity, being mentioned in a royal charter of 939. Whilst the origins of the pilgrimage tradition are lost in history, it is clear that a significant volume of pilgrims visited the site, and medieval pilgrim medals were struck and sold, a number of which have been uncovered by archeological investigation. Thomas More was a pilgrim here only a fortnight before his arrest.\n\nA Visitation report dated 1249 reports two statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary at St Mary's Church. It is uncertain what the second image was, but the primary one was the \"Black Madonna\" image of Our Lady of Willesden, the central point of veneration for the pilgrims who journeyed to Willesden. The statue was said to possess miraculous powers.\n\nAt the Reformation the English shrines of Mary were destroyed, and their images burned. The \"Black Madonna\" image of Our Lady of Willesden was dragged to Chelsea in 1538, and burned there by the King's Commissioners.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century the Reverend James Dixon, Vicar of Willesden, restored the shrine, and placed a gilded image of Mary and Jesus at the location within the parish church where the original had once stood. A small number of pilgrims began visiting the shrine.\n\nThe Right Reverend Graham Leonard, Bishop of Willesden 1964-1973, actively promoted pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Willesden, and in 1972 a new \"Black Madonna\" statue was commissioned from the sculptor Catharni Stern. On completion it was set in the former chapel of St Catherine within St Mary's parish church, Willesden, and the chapel was redesignated the Shrine Chapel. A visit to this chapel is now the climax of the Willesden pilgrimage.\n\nThe older image was left in place, so that since 1972 the shrine has housed two images of the Blessed Virgin Mary, just as it did in medieval times according to the 1249 visitation report.\n\nThe original spring and holy well at St Mary's Church, which had become lost through disuse after the Reformation, were rediscovered in 1998, and returned to use.\n\nIn a similar manner to Our Lady of Walsingham, who is venerated at twin Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines a mile apart, Our Lady of Willesden today has two shrines. The original has been restored in the Anglican parish church of St Mary, and a Roman Catholic shrine has been established about two miles away in the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Willesden, where a crowned image of Our Lady forms the focus of the shrine. At both Walsingham and Willesden the twin shrines provide a vehicle for practical ecumenical endeavour between the two traditions.\n\nThe original shrine at St Mary's Church is administered by the Parochial Church Council, working in close cooperation with the Chapter of Our Lady of Willesden (see below).\n\nThe Companionate of Our Lady of Willesden is an Anglican devotional society for those who wish to be associated with the shrine. It is headed by an Episcopal Patron, a bishop who provides the figurative leadership of the Companions.\n\nThe day to day direction of the Companionate is in the hands of a Chapter of capitular priests (usually numbering six, of whom the vicar of St Mary's, Willesden, is a member \"ex officio\"), and laity (of whom the churchwardens of St Mary's are also \"ex officio\" members). Chapter priests of Our Lady of Willesden are distinguished by a black mozzetta with pale blue buttons, piping of blue and gold, and the seal of Our Lady of Willesden embroidered on the left breast. Lay members of Chapter are distinguished by a pale blue collarette from which the shrine badge is displayed.\n\nOther members, not on the Chapter, are known as a priest-companion or lay-companion, as the case may be. Companions wear the seal of Our Lady of Willesden as a badge, and undertake to pray for the work of the Shrine, and to visit it on pilgrimage when able.\n\nThe nearby Roman Catholic shrine has a similarly constituted Guild of Our Lady of Willesden.\n\nPrivate pilgrimages and parish pilgrimages journey to the shrine of Our Lady of Willesden throughout the year, but the main national pilgrimage takes place on a Saturday in July. The format of the day usually involves a public procession in the morning, a celebration of mass at midday in St Mary's parish church, a variety of stalls and entertainments during the afternoon, sprinkling at the holy well in the late afternoon, and benediction of the blessed sacrament to end the pilgrimage day.\n"}

It is believed to be from Damascus, Syria, where it is known as \"al-Qamar ad-Din\" (). It was first produced in the Ghouta, where the variety of apricots most suitable for qamar al-din was first grown. Qamar al-din is enjoyed across the Middle East and North Africa as well as in Somalia, though Syrian qamar al-din is still believed to be the best because the variety of apricots most suitable for making qamar al-din grow only in Syria and southwestern Turkey. The desert is known as \"lavashak\" (لواشک) in Iran.\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed for the origin of qamar al-din's name. One theory holds that it was named for its inventor, a Syrian man named Qamar al-Din. He was said to have been so handsome that he resembled the moon (\"qamar\", ), hence his name.\n\nAnother theory holds that apricot season coincided with the sighting of the new moon marking the beginning of Ramadan in the year when qamar al-din was invented. A similar theory, widespread in Egypt, traces the name's origin to a Caliph who was known to celebrate with qamar al-din upon seeing the crescent moon during Ramadan.\n\nTo produce Qamar al-din, apricots and sugar are boiled over a fire and then strained through a wooden strainer that is soaked in olive oil. The apricots are then left to dry in direct sunlight. Once it has completely dried, it is then packaged, shipped, and sold. This dried apricot leather is thicker, more consistent, and has a stronger flavor than ordinary apricot leather, and is thus more suitable for making qamar al-din. Making the drink from this apricot leather only requires adding rosewater or orange blossom water, though apricot pieces (fresh or dried) and ice are often added as well. Sometimes, some of the floral water is replaced with orange juice or plain water. Qamar al-din is traditionally served thick and cold, and it is believed to be especially fortifying and a good source of energy, electrolytes, and hydration, all of which are crucial after a day of fasting. Some in the Levant add pine nuts and ice to their qamar al-din, making a beverage that resembles a thicker, apricot-flavored version of jallab.\n\n"}

Before the forcible separation of \"kami\" and Buddhas of 1868 (\"shinbutsu bunri\") a \"shintai\" could even be the statue of a Buddhist deity.\n\nFamous \"shintai\" include the mirror (part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan), Mount Miwa, Mount Nantai, the Nachi Falls, and the Meoto Iwa rocks. Many mountains like Mount Miwa or the Three Mountains of Kumano (Kumano sanzan) are considered \"shintai\" and are therefore called . The most widely known and renowned \"shintai\" is Mount Fuji.\n\nA \"yokozuna\", a wrestler at the top of sumo's power pyramid, is a living \"shintai\". For this reason, his waist is circled by a \"shimenawa\", a sacred rope which protects sacred objects from evil spirits. A kannushi, that is, a Shinto priest, can become a living \"shintai\" when a kami enters his body during religious ceremonies.\n\nThe founding of a new shrine requires the presence of either a pre-existing, naturally occurring \"shintai\" (for example a rock or waterfall housing a local \"kami\"), or of an artificial one, which must therefore be procured or made to the purpose. An example of the first case are the Nachi Falls, worshiped at Hiryū Shrine near Kumano Nachi Taisha and believed to be inhabited by a \"kami\" called Hiryū Gongen. In the second, the \"mitama\" (spirit) of a \"kami\" is divided in half through a process called \"kanjō\" and one of the halves is then stored in a \"yorishiro\". This is the process which has led to the creation of networks of shrines housing the same \"kami\", as for example the Hachiman shrine, Inari shrine or Kumano shrine networks.\nBecause over the years the \"shintai\" is wrapped in more and more layers of precious cloth and stored in more and more boxes without being ever inspected, its exact identity may become forgotten. \nThe first role of a shrine is to house and protect its \"shintai\" and the \"kami\" which inhabits it. If a shrine has more than one building, the one containing the \"shintai\" is called \"honden\"; because it is meant for the exclusive use of the \"kami\", it is always closed to the public and is not used for prayer or religious ceremonies. The \"shintai\" leaves the \"honden\" only during festivals (\"matsuri\"), when it is put in a \"divine palanquin\" (\"mikoshi\", a term usually translated in English as \"portable shrine\"), and carried around the streets among the faithful. The portable shrine is used to physically protect the \"shintai\" and to hide it from sight.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23800030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23800030", "title": "Types of Karma (Jainism)", "text": "Types of Karma (Jainism)\n\nAccording to Jain karma theory, there are eight main types of karma (\"Prikriti\") which are categorized into the ‘harming’ and the ‘non-harming’; each divided into four types. The harming karmas (\"ghātiyā karmas\") directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These harming karmas are: \"darśanāvaraṇa\" (perception obscuring karma), \"Jnanavarniya\" (knowledge obscuring karma), \"antarāya\" (obstacles creating karma) and \"mohanīya\" (deluding karma). The non-harming category (\"aghātiyā karmas\") is responsible for the reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances (nāma), longevity (āyuś), spiritual potential (gotra) and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations (vedanīya). In other therms these non-harming karmas are: \"nāma\" (body determining karma), \"āyu\" (life span determining karma), \"gotra\" (status determining karma) and \"vedanīya\" (feeling producing karma) respectively. Different types of karmas thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature. Each of these types has various sub-types. \"Tattvārthasūtra\" generally speaks of 148 sub-types of karmas in all. These are: 5 of \"jñānavaraṇa\", 9 of \"darśanavaraṇa\", 2 of \"vedanīya\", 28 of \"mohanīya\" 4 of \"āyuṣka\", 93 of \"nāma\", 2 of \"gotra\", and 5 of \"antarāya\".\n\n\"Ghātiyā karmas\" (harming karmas) directly affect the attributes of the soul. These are:\n\n\nWhen \"ghātiyā karmas\" are totally destroyed, the soul attains \"kevala Jnana\" or omniscience. Liberation is guaranteed for such souls in the same lifetime as soon the aghātiyā karmas are exhausted in the due course.\n\n\"Jñānāvaraṇīya karma\" or the knowledge-obscuring karma are of five types:\n\nOf these, the last mentioned karman hinders omniscience altogether; the four others do not result in complete destruction of the corresponding faculties of knowledge, but often produce only greater or less disturbances.\n\n\"Darshanavarana karma\" or the perception-obscuring karma are of four types:\n\nThe last mentioned karma hinders completely; the three others produce under certain circumstances only a disturbance of the respective cognition faculties.\n\nIn addition to these four darshanavarana karmas there are five others which produce physio-psychological conditions in which the sense organs are not active, and which, therefore, exclude all possibility of perception. These are the five nidra karmas, (sleep karmas), namely:\n\n\n\"Mohaniya\" is derived from \"Moha\" which means attachment. \"Mohaniya\" karma (deluding karma) is the most dangerous, out of all the eight karmas because `moha' (attachment) is the root cause of all Kasayas (passions). It is also most difficult karma to destroy. If mohaniya karma is destroyed fully, the self becomes free from all Kasayas and liberation is assured. Two main categories of Mohaniya karman are—darshana mohaniya and charitra mohaniya karma. With their subtypes there are 28 sub-types of mohaniya karman.\n\nThe \"darshana mohaniya-karma\" causes a disturbance of the knowledge of the religious truth inherent in the jiva by natural disposition. These are further divided into three types according as to whether the disturbance is an absolute or a partial one:\n\nThe \"charitra mohaniya-karma\" disturbs the right conduct possessed innately by the jiva; it hinders the soul from acting according to the religious prescriptions. The disturbance of the conduct is produced through the sixteen passions \"(kasaya)\", the six emotions with are categorised as non-passions \"(nokasaya)\" and the three sexes \"(veda)\".\n\nThe four main passions are \"krodha\" (anger), \"maya\" (deceitfulness), \"mana\" (pride) and \"lobha\" (greed). The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions Each of these is separated into 4 sub divisions, according to the intensity of their manifestation. The first one is \"anantanubandhin\" (of lifelong duration) which completely hinders belief and conduct. The second one is \"apratyakhyanavarana\" (hindering and non-renunciation) It makes impossible every reninciation, but allows the existence of true belief and lasts for one year. The third one of still milder intensity is \"pratyakhyanavarana\" (hindering with renunciation). It hinders the beginning of complete self-discipline, but does not prevent the existence of true belief and partial self-discipline (desavirati). Its effect lasts for 4 months. The last one is samjvalana (flaming up). It allows complete self-discipline, yet works against the attainment of complete right conduct (yathakhyata charitra). It lasts a fortnight.\n\nThe nokasayas or the six non-passions are: \"hasya\" (laughing, joking or making fun of), \"rati\" (prejudicial liking or impartiality), \"arati\" (improper conduct) \"soka\" (sorrow), \"bhaya\" (fear), and \"jugupsa\" (disgust). All these six emotions are \"charitra mohaniyas\", because the soul which is subjected to them, is hindered through them in the practice of right conduct.\n\nThe vedas or the sex passion hinders the jiva from obeying the laws and from practicing self-discipline. It is of threefold variety, according to the three species of sexes:\n\nThe \"antaraya-karma\" hinders the energy (\"virya\") of the \"jiva\" in a fivefold manner:\n\nThese do not affect the soul directly; rather, they have an effect on the body that houses the soul. These are:\n\n\nAs soon as the Aghātiyā karmas gets exhausted soul attains \"moksa\" (liberation).\n\nThe \"ayus-karma\" confers on a being a certain quantum of life in one of the four states of existence. Therefore there are four types of \"ayu karmas\": \"deva ayu\" (the celestial lifespan), \"manusya ayus\" (the human lifespan), \"tiryancha ayu\" (the animal lifespan), and \"naraka ayu\" (the infernal lifespan). The \"ayu-karma\" bestows a certain quantity of life, but not a definite number of years of life. For, as with a sponge, the quantity of water that it absorbs is determined, but not the time it takes to leave it, so also the quantum of life is determined, but not the time occupied in its consumption. The word ayu would, therefore, be approximately interpreted by \"quantity of life\" or \"quantity of vitality\"). The ayu of the new existence is always bound during the life immediately preceding it, especially in the 3rd, 9th, or 27th part or within the last 48 minutes of life.\n\nThe \"nama-karma\" causes the individual diversities of the jivas. It is divided into 93 \"uttara prakrtis\" (sub-types), which are mostly quoted in a definitely fixed succession in 4 groups (\"pinda prakrtis, pratyeka prakrtis, trasadasaka, sthavara dasaka\"). They are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gotra karma or the status determining karma destines the rank occupied by a person through his birth. They are of two types:\n\nThe \"vedaniya karma\" or feeling producing karmas are of two types:\n\nWith gods and men the sata vedaniya is predominant, although, also with the former at the time of the downfall from the celestial world, and with the latter through cold and heat, death and accident, pain can be produced. Animals and infernal beings experience chiefly the asata vedaniya, although, also, at the birth of a Jina or on a similar occasion, they can experience a feeling of pleasure.\n\nThe maximum duration of attachment of karma is 7 Quadrillion Sagaropama or 7 x 10^225 Years. A Sagaropama or \"ocean measured year\"equals 10^210 Years. It is derived from Sanskrit word sagara or ocean. The minimum amount of time is less than one \"muharta\". The maximum and minimum time for which the karmas remain bound to our consciousness depends on the type of karma which is as follows:-\n\n"}
{"id": "489129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489129", "title": "Tzniut", "text": "Tzniut\n\nTzniut ( , , ; \"modesty\" or \"privacy\"; ) describes both the character trait of modesty and discretion, as well as a group of Jewish laws pertaining to conduct. In modern times, the term has become more frequently used with regard to the rules of dress for women within Judaism. The concept is most important within Orthodox Judaism.\n\n\"Tzniut\" includes a group of laws concerned with modesty of both dress and behavior. In the Babylonian Talmud, Rabbi Elazar Bar Tzadok interprets the injunction at Micah 6:8 to \"go discreetly with your God\" as referring to discretion in conducting funerals and weddings. The Talmud then extends his interpretation: \"If in matters that are generally performed in public, such as funerals and weddings, the Torah instructed us to go discreetly, matters that by their very nature should be performed discreetly, such as giving charity to a poor person, how much more so must one take care to do them discreetly, without publicity and fanfare\" (Tractate Sukkah 49b).\n\nIn the legal dimension of Orthodox Judaism, the issue of \"tzniut\" is discussed in more technical terms: how much skin may a person expose, and so on. These details underscore the concept of tzniut as a positive code of conduct, character, and awareness.\n\nThe principal guiding point of \"tzniut\" in regard to dress is that a Jew should not dress in a way that attracts undue attention. This does not mean dressing poorly, but that neither men nor women should dress in a way that overly emphasizes their physical appearance or attracts undue attention. There are many different interpretations of what \"tzniut\" means, so people from different communities will sometimes dress differently.\n\nOrthodox Judaism requires both men and women to substantially cover their bodies. According to many opinions, this involves covering the elbows and knees.\n\nIn Haredi communities, men wear long trousers and usually long-sleeved shirts; most will not wear short sleeves at all. Haredi Ashkenazi practice discourages sandals without socks both in and out of the synagogue, whereas Haredi Sefardi communities tend to accept sandals at least outside of synagogue. Dress in a synagogue and, according to many, in public should be comparable to that worn by the community when meeting royalty or government.\n\nHaredi women wear blouses covering the elbow and collarbone, and skirts that cover the knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that is tight. Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.\n\nModern Orthodox women also usually adhere to \"tzniut\" and dress in a modest fashion (as compared to the general society), but their communal definition does not necessarily include covering their elbows, collarbones, or knees, and may allow for wearing pants, although some Modern Orthodox women will, when in front of men or in public, wear skirts that cover their knees, preferably loose ones, and cover their elbows and cleavage.\n\nModern Orthodox men's dress is often indistinguishable from their non-Orthodox peers, apart from them wearing a skullcap. They may wear short-sleeved shirts and even shorts. Sandals without socks, while generally not worn in a synagogue, are usually accepted in Modern Orthodox and Religious Zionist communities in Israel for daily dress, for both men and women.\n\nConservative Judaism formally encourages but does not require modest dress. While day-to-day dress often simply reflects the general society, many Conservative synagogues expect somewhat more modest dress (although not necessarily as stringent as in Orthodox Judaism) for synagogue attendance, and may have specific dress requirements to receive synagogue honors (such as being called for a Torah reading).\n\nReform Judaism has no religious dress requirements.\n\nStyle of dress involves cultural considerations distinct from religious requirements. Members of Conservative and Reform synagogues may abide by dress codes generally ranging from business casual to informal. There are many Orthodox synagogues (especially in Israel), where dress, while meeting religious modesty requirements, is quite casual. Many Haredi and Hasidic communities have special customs and styles of dress that serve to identify members of their communities, but regard these special dress features as customs of their communities, rather than as general religious requirements expected of all observant Jews.\n\nJewish law governing tzniut requires married women to cover their hair; according to the Talmud, this is a biblical requirement, which in this context is called \"dat Moshe\" (the law of Moses). The most common hair coverings in the Haredi community are the sheitel (wig), the snood, and the \"mitpachat\" (Hebrew for 'scarf') or \"tichel\" (Yiddish), as well as hats and berets.\n\nThe practice of covering hair with wigs is debated among halakhic authorities. Many authorities, including Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, permitted it, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe actively encouraged it, while many other authorities, especially Sephardi rabbis, forbid it.\n\nModern Orthodox Jewish women usually use hats, berets, baseball caps, bandanas, or scarves tied in a number of ways to accomplish the goal, depending on how casually they are dressed. Some modern Orthodox women cover their hair with wigs. A style of half wig known as a \"fall\" has become increasingly common in some segments of Modern and Haredi Orthodox communities. It is worn with either a hat or a headband.\n\nIn Yemen, unmarried girls covered their hair also, like the Muslims there; however, upon Yemeni Jews' emigration to Israel and other places, this custom has been abandoned. While Rebbe Aharon Roth, founder of Shomer Emunim, praised this custom, no Ashkenazi community – including the most strict Haredi circles – have ever practiced such a custom.\n\nConservative and Reform Judaism do not generally require women to wear head coverings. Some more traditional Conservative synagogues may ask that married women cover their heads during services. However, some more liberal Conservative synagogues suggest that women, married or not, wear head-coverings similar to those worn by men (the kippah/yarmulke); and some require it (or require it only for women receiving honors or leading services from the \"bimah\") – not for modesty, but as a feminist gesture of egalitarianism. Almost all Conservative synagogues require men to wear a head covering (usually a kippah), but in Reform synagogues, there is no requirement. However, \"kippot\" may be provided to anybody who wishes to wear them.\n\nIn Orthodox Judaism, men are generally not allowed to hear women sing, a prohibition called \"kol isha\" (literally “a woman's voice”). The Talmud classifies this as \"ervah\" (literally \"nakedness\"). The majority view of halakhic authorities is that this prohibition applies at all times, and forbids a man to pray or study Torah in the presence of a woman who is singing, similar to other prohibitions classified as \"ervah\". A minority view holds that the prohibition of praying or studying in the presence of \"kol isha\" applies only while reciting the Shema Yisrael prayer.\n\nThere is debate between \"poskim\" whether the prohibition applies to a recorded voice, where the singer cannot be seen, where the woman is not known to the man who is listening, and where he has never seen her or a picture of her.\n\nThere are also opinions, following Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer, that exclude singing in mixed groups from this prohibition, such as synagogue prayer or dinner-table \"zemirot\", based on the idea that the female voice is not distinctly heard as separate from the group in these cases (\"Trei Kali Lo Mishtamai\", two voices cannot be heard simultaneously – Megila 21b).\n\nConservative Judaism interprets the relevant passage of the Talmud as expressing a rabbi's opinion, rather than imposing a requirement.\n\nReform Judaism fundamentally rethought the status of women within Judaism in a series of synods from 1837 onward in both Europe and the United States, formally abolishing most distinctions between men and women in the observance of Jewish life, particularly concerning dress and public participation. It no longer regards this traditional law as applicable to modern times.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "295074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295074", "title": "Word of Wisdom", "text": "Word of Wisdom\n\nThe \"Word of Wisdom\" is the common name of a section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a book considered by many churches within the Latter Day Saint movement to consist of revelations from God. It is also the name of a health code based on this scripture, practiced most strictly by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Mormon fundamentalists, and to a lesser extent, some other Latter Day Saint denominations. In the LDS Church, compliance with the Word of Wisdom is currently a prerequisite for baptism, service in full-time missionary work, attendance at church schools, and entry into the church's temples; however, violation of the code is not considered to be grounds for excommunication or other disciplinary action.\n\nThe text discourages \"strong drink\" and wine (in some cases this includes sacramental wine which has been replaced with sacramental water in some sects), the non-medicinal use of tobacco, \"hot drinks\", and meat used more than \"sparingly\". The scripture also recommends the consumption of herbs, fruits, and grains, as well as grain-based \"mild drinks\". As practiced by the LDS Church, there is no firm restriction relating to meat consumption, but all alcoholic beverages are forbidden, including beer. The LDS Church currently interprets \"hot drinks\" to mean coffee and tea.\n\nAccording to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Word of Wisdom was received in 1833 as a revelation from God. After Smith's death, Brigham Young stated that the revelation was given in response to problems encountered while conducting meetings in the Smith family home:\nWhen they assembled together in this room after breakfast, the first they did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk about the great things of the kingdom, and spit all over the room, and as soon as the pipe was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often when the Prophet [Joseph Smith] entered the room to give the school instructions he would find himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. This, and the complaints of his wife at having to clean so filthy a floor, made the Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the conduct of the Elders in using tobacco, and the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom was the result of his inquiry.\nThe Word of Wisdom was first published as a stand-alone broadsheet in December 1833. In 1835, it was included as section 89 in the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nThe revelation contains four parts:\n\nThe introduction and explanation as presented by Smith is:\n\nA Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion— To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days— Given for a principle with a promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. \n\nAmong the substances which the revelation indicates should not be ingested, the first is \"wine or strong drink\", which the revelation says should not be drunk. (An exception is allowed for the use of \"pure wine of your own make\" as part of the sacrament ordinance, though the LDS Church today uses water in place of wine.) The revelation also advises against the consumption of tobacco and \"hot drinks\".\n\nThe Word of Wisdom revelation also suggests proper uses for some prohibited substances. While \"strong drinks\" are not to be ingested, they are appropriate when used \"for the washing of your bodies\"; likewise, while human ingestion of tobacco is forbidden, tobacco is said to be \"an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.\"\n\nThe list of foods and substances which the revelation encourages includes \"wholesome herbs [and] every fruit in the season thereof\" and \"that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground.\" It also prescribes the use of \"all grain\", which is described as \"the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field.\" Barley and other grains are recommended for use in making \"mild drinks\".\n\nThe \"beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth\" may be used as food \"sparingly\" and \"with thanksgiving\". \n\nThe revelation states that it is pleasing to God if these recommendations are not used, \"only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\" and times of \"excess of hunger\".\n\nThe Word of Wisdom states that it comprises a \"principle with promise\". The promise given to those who followed the advice of the word of wisdom is as follows:\n\nAnd all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.\nOriginally, abiding by the recommendations and prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom was not considered mandatory: it explicitly declares itself to be \"not by commandment or constraint\". In February 1834, however, Joseph Smith proposed a resolution before the high council of the church that stated, \"No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office after having the word of wisdom properly taught him; and he, the official member, neglecting to comply with and obey it.\" This resolution was accepted unanimously by the council.\n\nIn 1842, Smith's brother Hyrum, who was the Assistant President of the Church and its presiding patriarch, provided an interpretation of the Word of Wisdom's proscription of \"hot drinks\":\nAnd again \"hot drinks are not for the body, or belly;\" there are many who wonder what this can mean; whether it refers to tea, or coffee, or not. I say it does refer to tea, and coffee.\nAccording to a book written by LDS missionary and hymnographer Joel H. Johnson in 1881, Joseph Smith shared Hyrum's interpretation:\nI understand that some of the people are excusing themselves in using tea and coffee, because the Lord only said \"hot drinks\" in the revelation of the Word of Wisdom ... Tea and coffee ... are what the Lord meant when He said \"hot drinks\".\n\nThe charge of \"not observing the Word of Wisdom\" was one of five leveled against David Whitmer on April 13, 1838, which led to his excommunication. Nevertheless, contemporary records indicate that Joseph Smith was not, himself, a strict observer. Smith is recorded at various times as drinking tea, beer, and wine. There is a report he also smoked tobacco: according to Amasa Lyman, a member of the First Presidency under Smith, Smith once finished preaching a sermon on the Word of Wisdom and immediately afterward rode through the streets smoking a cigar. According to Lyman, this was just one of many instances in which Smith \"tried the faith of the Saints ... by his peculiarities.\" (One modern commentator has suggested that this may have been done by Smith to ensure that his followers' faith was based on the Latter Day Saint religion and not on Smith's personality or leadership.)\n\nOn August 19, 1835, Almon W. Babbitt was brought before the church's high council on three charges. On the charge of \"not keeping the Word of Wisdom\", Babbitt stated \"that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong.\"\n\nIn 1838, Smith was operating a hotel/tavern in Far West, Missouri. In June 1838, the high council of Far West felt compelled to remind Smith's family that there was a ban on the sale and consumption of \"ardent spirits in the place\".\n\nAfter Smith's death, several factions emerged from the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these groups, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was led by Brigham Young. At a general conference of the church held on September 9, 1851, Young called on the attendees to \"leave off the use of\" items mentioned in the Word of Wisdom:\nThe Patriarch <nowiki>[</nowiki>John Smith<nowiki>]</nowiki> again rose to speak on the Word of Wisdom, and urging on the brethren to leave off using tobacco, &c.\n\nPresident Young rose to put the motion and called on all the sisters who will leave off the use of tea, coffee, &c., to manifest it by raising the right hand; seconded and carried.\n\nAnd then put the following motion; calling on all the boys who were under ninety years of age who would covenant to leave off the use of tobacco, whisky, and all things mentioned in the Word of Wisdom, to manifest it in the same manner, which was carried unanimously.\"\n\nThe Patriarch then said, may the Lord bless you and help you to keep all your covenants. Amen.\n\nPresident Young amongst other things said he knew the goodness of the people, and the Lord bears with our weakness; we must serve the Lord, and those who go with me will keep the Word of Wisdom, and if the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever them from the Church. I will draw the line, and know who is for the Lord and who is not, and those who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will cut off from the Church; I throw out a challenge to all men and women.\nThough Young encouraged Mormons to follow the Word of Wisdom code, the church was tolerant of those who did not follow it. In 1860, he counseled those chewing tobacco in church meetings to at least be discreet and not excessive, but did not charge users with sin. By 1870, however, he ended the practice of chewing and spitting tobacco in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.\n\nYoung also recognized a separation between using tobacco (which was discouraged), and selling it to non-Mormons as a business (which was encouraged). He also owned and maintained a bar in Salt Lake City for the sale of alcoholic beverages to non-Mormon travelers, on the theory that it was better for LDS Church authorities to run such establishments than for outsiders.\n\nThe Word of Wisdom states that \"flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air ... are to be used sparingly\", and that \"it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.\" Unlike the injunctions against tobacco, alcohol, and hot drinks, however, compliance with this injunction has never been made mandatory.\n\nMany LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat. In 1868, church president Brigham Young counseled, \"Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold.\" In 1868, apostle George Q. Cannon said, \"We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter.\" From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then church president Lorenzo Snow repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith's teaching that animals have spirits. In 1895, Snow stated, \"Unless famine or extreme cold is upon us we should refrain from the use of meat.\" Apostle George Teasdale taught the same thing, and held that eating pork was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee. When Joseph F. Smith succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the \"unnecessary destruction of life\", and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them .\n\nDespite these statements, restricting meat consumption was not made an explicit requirement for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the Word of Wisdom were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century. The increased emphasis on the Word of Wisdom took place during the presidency of Heber J. Grant, a long-time enthusiastic promoter of the Word of Wisdom. Although Grant did not make restricting meat consumption an explicit part of the standard, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the Word of Wisdom. In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours \"without fatigue and without feeling the least injury\". He attributed his excellent health, in part, to eating very little meat.\n\nSince Grant's presidency, the emphasis on limiting the consumption of meat has lessened, but there have been some church leaders who have taught on the subject. In a 1948 LDS general conference address, apostle Joseph F. Merrill emphasized the importance of not eating meat as \"freely as many Americans are doing\". In 1950, apostle and plant scientist John A. Widtsoe wrote, in relation to meat consumption, \"they who wish to be well and gain the promised reward stated in the Word of Wisdom must obey all of the law, not just part of it as suits their whim or their appetite, or their notion of its meaning.\" As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated \"the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.| To this day, the LDS Church's hymnal includes a hymn with the following lyrics:\n\nThat the children may live long / And be beautiful and strong, / Tea and coffee and tobacco they despise, / Drink no liquor, and they eat / But a very little meat; / They are seeking to be great and good and wise.\n\nA student manual published by the church has suggested that the suggestion that the consumption of meat be limited to wintertime may to some degree be a historical relic of the time in which the \"Word of Wisdom\" was delivered by Smith:\nThis verse has caused some to ask if meat should be eaten in the summer. Meat has more calories than fruits and vegetables, which some individuals may need fewer of in summer than winter. Also, before fruits and vegetables could be preserved, people often did not have enough other food to eat in winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season. The key word with respect to the use of meat is \"sparingly\".\n\nThe Word of Wisdom states in part,\n16. All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground—\n\n17. Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.\n\nThe revelation suggests that barley-based mild drinks (such as beer) may be permissible. As recently as 1901, apostles Brigham Young, Jr. and John Henry Smith argued that the revelation did not prohibit beer. However, LDS Church leaders now teach that consumption of any form of alcohol, including beer, violates the Word of Wisdom.\n\nIn a pamphlet written in 1930 called \"The Word of Wisdom\", apostle John A. Widtsoe taught that refined flour was contrary to the Word of Wisdom. The church, however, has never prohibited the use of refined flour.\n\nAdherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom was not made a requirement for entry into LDS Church temples until 1902. However, even then, church president Joseph F. Smith encouraged stake presidents to be liberal with old men who used tobacco and old ladies who drank tea. Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that were excluded from the temple. Around the turn of the century, the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom were not strictly adhered to by such notable church leaders. Anthon H. Lund, a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank beer and wine; apostle Matthias F. Cowley drank beer and wine; Charles W. Penrose, who also served as a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank wine; Relief Society general president Emmeline B. Wells drank coffee; and church president George Albert Smith drank brandy for medicinal purposes. In 1921, church president Heber J. Grant made adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom an absolute requirement for entering the temple.\n\nToday, adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom is required for baptism and for entry into temples of the LDS Church. BYU historian Thomas G. Alexander points out that while the original Word of Wisdom as a \"principle with promise\" was given by revelation, there is no evidence that any church leader has claimed a separate new revelation, or even a spiritual confirmation, of changing the Word of Wisdom from \"a principle with promise\" to a commandment.\n\nThe church's official statement on the interpretation of the Word of Wisdom is short: it reaffirms the long-standing meaning of \"hot drinks\" and extends the substances covered by prohibition:\nThe only official interpretation of \"hot drinks\" (D&C 89:9) in the Word of Wisdom is the statement made by early Church leaders that the term \"hot drinks\" means tea and coffee.\n\nMembers should not use any substance that contains illegal drugs. Nor should members use harmful or habit-forming substances except under the care of a competent physician.\nAlthough avoiding the prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom is a requirement for admission to LDS Church temples, violation of the Word of Wisdom no longer results in church discipline, as it once did; the church instructs its leaders that church discipline \"should not be [used] to discipline or threaten members who do not comply with the Word of Wisdom.\"\n\nLDS Church leaders have counseled church members that they should not have personal interpretations of, or become extreme in their observance of the Word of Wisdom. One church leader specifically warned that adding additional unauthorized requirements, emphasizing it with excess zeal, or making it a \"gospel hobby\" is a sign of spiritual immaturity and sometimes apostasy.\n\nThe prohibition of \"wine or strong drink\" is widely interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all alcoholic beverages, regardless of the level of alcoholic content of the drink.\n\nGenerally, members of the church view the prohibition on \"hot drinks\" as covering coffee and tea, whether or not the drinks are hot. There is generally thought to be no prohibition against drinking boiling or hot water, herbal tea, hot chocolate, coffee substitutes such as Postum or malt drinks such as Ovaltine or Milo. Other members choose to prohibit themselves from drinking any beverage that contains caffeine.\n\nA longstanding issue among members of the church is whether it is permissible to ingest drinks containing caffeine that are not coffee or tea. In 1918, Frederick J. Pack, a Latter-day Saint professor at the University of Utah, published an article in an official church magazine in which he reasoned that because Coca-Cola contained caffeine, which is also present in tea and coffee, Latter-day Saints should abstain from Coca-Cola in the same way that they abstain from the Word of Wisdom \"hot drinks\". Since Pack's article, many Latter-day Saints have come to believe that the reason tea and coffee are proscribed is the presence of caffeine in the drinks. However, the church has never stated that this is the reason for the prohibition.\n\nThe church does not have an official position on the consumption of caffeinated beverages, apart from the general statement that the Word of Wisdom does not specifically mention it. In 2012, in response to a report on Mormonism on NBC’s \"Rock Center with Brian Williams\", which claimed that LDS faithful were prohibited from drinking caffeine, the church wrote:\nDespite what was reported, the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. The Church’s health guidelines prohibits alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and \"hot drinks\"—taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.\nIn the past, a number of church leaders have discouraged the use of such products. For example, in 1922, church president Heber J. Grant counseled the Latter-day Saints:\nI am not going to give any command, but I will ask it as a personal, individual favor to me, to let coca-cola alone. There are plenty of other things you can get at the soda fountains without drinking that which is injurious. The Lord does not want you to use any drug that creates an appetite for itself.\nTwo years after making this statement, Grant met with a representative of The Coca-Cola Company to discuss the church's position on Coca-Cola; at the conclusion of their second meeting, Grant stated that he was \"sure I have not the slightest desire to recommend that the people leave Coca-Cola alone if th[e] amount [of caffeine in Coca-Cola] is absolutely harmless, which they claim it is.\" Grant never again spoke out against the use of cola drinks.\n\nApproximately fifty years later, the church issued an official statement which stated:\nWith reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided.\nBecause of such statements, some adherents believe that caffeine is officially prohibited under the Word of Wisdom. In the mid-1950's, the director of the food services for Brigham Young University, a college owned by the LDS Church, decided not to sell caffeine on campus. This changed in September 2017 when the current director of BYU Dining Services announced that caffeinated beverages would be sold on campus. Wright said this was the result of a change in customer preferences. Official church publications have occasionally published articles by medical practitioners that warn of the health risks of consuming caffeine. However, in November 2010, the \"Salt Lake Tribune\" noted that in the 2010 church \"Handbook\", which sets out the official position of the church on health and social issues, no position on drinking Coca-Cola or caffeinated drinks is included. \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" concluded that the church \"takes no official position on caffeine\".\n\nSpeculation also exists concerning the use of alcohol as a cooking ingredient or the use of decaffeinated coffee or tea. The LDS Church has taken no official stance on either.\n\nA 14-year selective study conducted by UCLA epidemiologist James E. Enstrom tracked the health of 10,000 moderately active LDS Church members in California and ended in 1987. Of these non-smoking, monogamous non-drinkers, Enstrom concluded from the study \"that LDS Church members who follow religious mandates barring smoking and drinking have one of the lowest death rates from cancer and cardiovascular diseases—about half that of the general population. ... Moreover, the healthiest LDS Church members enjoy a life expectancy eight to eleven years longer than that of the general white population in the United States.\" The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for whites in the general population is defined as 100. For males in the study, the SMRs \"are 47 for all cancers, 52 for cardiovascular diseases, and 47 for all causes; the SMRs for females are 72 for all cancers, 64 for cardiovascular diseases, and 66 for all causes.\" For LDS high priests who exercised, had proper sleep, and never smoked cigarettes, the mortality rate was less. The results were largely duplicated in a separate study of an LDS-like subgroup of white non-smoking churchgoers in Alameda County, California.\n\n"}
{"id": "1905672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905672", "title": "Yahshuah", "text": "Yahshuah\n\nThe pentagrammaton () or Yahshuah () is a constructed form of the Hebrew name of Jesus originally found in the works of Athanasius Kirchner, Johann Baptist Grossschedel (1619) and other late Renaissance esoteric sources. It is to be distinguished from the name Yahshua found in the works of the Sacred Name Movement in the 1960s, though there has been some conflation or confusion between the two. The pentagrammaton Yahshuah has no support in archeological findings, such as the Dead Sea scrolls or inscriptions, nor in rabbinical texts as a form of Joshua. Scholarship generally considers the original form of Jesus to be Yeshua, a Hebrew Bible form of Joshua.\n\nThe essential idea of the pentagrammaton is of an alphabetic consonantal framework Y-H-Sh-W-H, which can be supplied with vowels in various ways. (Also, the \"W\" can be converted into a \"U\", since the Hebrew letter ו \"waw\" writes either a [w] consonant sound — later on pronounced [v] — or a long [u] vowel sound: see Mater Lectionis.)\n\nThe first ones to use a name of Jesus something like \"Yahshuah\" were Renaissance occultists. In the second half of the 16th century, when knowledge of Biblical Hebrew first began to spread among a significant number of Christians, certain esoterically minded or occultistic circles came up with the idea of deriving the Hebrew name of Jesus by adding the Hebrew letter \"shin\" ש into the middle of the Tetragrammaton divine name \"yod-he-waw-he\" יהוה to produce the form \"yod-he-shin-waw-he\" יהשוה. \n\nThis was given a basic Latin transliteration JHSVH or IHSVH or IHSUH (since there was no letter \"W\" or \"sh\" / [š] sound in Latin, and \"I\" and \"J\" were then not yet clearly distinguished as letters of the alphabet, nor were \"U\" and \"V\"). This could then be supplied with further vowels for pronounceability. It was a coincidence that the first three letters of this consonantal transcription IHSVH etc. were identical with the old IHS/JHS monogram of the name of Jesus (from Greek \"iota-eta-sigma\").\n\nIn Renaissance occultistic works, this pentagrammaton (or five-letter divine name) was frequently arranged around a mystic pentagram, where each of the five Hebrew letters י ה ש ו ה was placed at one of the points (the letter \"shin\" ש was always placed at the upward-pointing vertex of the pentagram). One of the earliest attested examples of this diagram is in the \"Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum\" or \"Magical Calendar\" (published 1620 but dated 1582) of either\nTheodor de Bry (Flemish-born German, 1528–1598) or Matthäus Merian the Elder (Swiss, 1593–1650). This idea of the \"pentagrammaton\" was funneled into modern occultism by 19th-century French writer Eliphas Levi and the influential late 19th-century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn favored the consonantal transcription IHShVH or YHShVH, and the pronunciation Yeheshuah.\n\nHowever, in all early Hebrew or Aramaic sources, the name \"Jesus\"/\"Jeshua\" actually appears as \"yod-shin-waw-`ayin\" ישוע Yeshua (or as the related longer form of the same name, \"yod-he-waw-shin-`ayin\" יהושע \"Joshua\"; or as the intentionally altered derogatory Talmudic variant \"yod-shin-waw\" ישו Yeshu), so that the Renaissance speculations were incorrect. Note that the letter \"`ayin\" ע was specifically pronounced as a voiced pharyngeal consonant sound in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic, and could not be easily confused with either a pronounced [h] sound or a silent Hebrew letter \"he\" ה.\n\nSome modern religious groups have speculated that the most correct form of the Hebrew name of Jesus should be based on the spelling \"yod-he-shin-waw-`ayin\" יהשוע (apparently a reordering of the letters in the Hebrew spelling of the name \"yod-he-waw-shin-`ayin\" יהושע, pronounced [yěhōšūǎ`] and usually translated into English as \"Joshua\", but closely connected with the Hebrew form of the name of Jesus). This Hebrew letter sequence \"yod-he-shin-waw-`ayin\" can be transcribed into English in various ways (since Masoretic Niqqud is rejected), including Yahshua, Yahoshua, etc. — see Yahshua.\n\nWhen a final \"H\" is added on to these transcriptions (e.g. Yahshuah, Yahoshuah etc.), or when such consonantal transcriptions as YHSWH or YHShWH are used (both quite similar to the old transcription JHSVH, given the differences between the English and Latin uses of the alphabet), then it seems rather clear that there is confusion between the name of Jesus and the Tetragrammaton (whether under the influence of the old occultistic \"Pentagrammaton\", or independently). The consonantal transcription YHShVH is used both by occultists and Divine Name religious adherents.\n\n\n"}
