Unlike national academy and district schools, \"shuyuan\" were usually private establishments built away from cities or towns, providing a quiet environment where scholars could engage in studies and contemplation without restrictions and worldly distractions.\n\nThe \"shuyuan\" originated in 725 during the Tang dynasty. They were places where scholars could teach and study the classics, and where books collected from around the country could be preserved. By the late Tang dynasty, private academies had appeared all over China.\n\nDuring the Northern Song (960-1126), many academies were established with government encouragement. Each academy had its own teaching and administrative structure and was economically independent.\n\nThe bestowal of a calligraphic signboard by the emperor was an extremely important symbol of an academy's status during the Northern Song period. The following academies received this honour:\n\n\nBesides signboards, emperors also bestowed books. In 977, the Taizong Emperor bestowed on the White Deer Grotto Academy a copy of the Nine Chinese classics printed by the Guozijian. The Yuelu Academy, the Songyang Academy and other academies also received books from the Emperor on a number of occasions.\n\nHowever, academies had begun to decline by the twelfth century. The White Deer Grotto Academy, which had fallen into ruin, was rebuilt by the prominent neo-Confucianist Zhu Xi in 1179-80 during the Southern Song (1127–1279) and reopened in 1180. It became an important centre of Confucian thought during eight centuries. Zhu Xi himself taught here during the Southern Song as did Wang Yangming during the Ming. As a result of Zhu Xi's efforts, the \"shuyuan\" became a permanent feature of Chinese education, taking up major responsibilities of local education.\n\nThe system of academies was dismantled under the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) and all academies were placed under government control to become preparatory schools for the imperial examinations. However, the system was revived under the Ming (1368-1644) and the Qing (1644-1911).\n\nIn the Ming dynasty, academies devoted to discussing political issues appeared, such as the Donglin Academy, often resulting in political repression. According to one study, 40% of the 1239 known Ming academies were built during the Jiajing era (1522-1566). During the Qing, thousands of academies were created for the purpose of preparing students for the Imperial Examination, although there were still some that functioned as centres of study and research.\n\nThe academies were finally abolished under the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 at the end of the Qing dynasty.\n\nThere were more than 7,000 academies recorded. In the late Qing dynasty, some became universities, middle schools, public libraries and museums.\n\nIn Korea, which also adopted Confucianism, the \"shuyuan\" were known as Seowon.\n\nIn the late Qing dynasty, schools teaching Western science and technology were established. Many such schools were called \"Shuyuan\" in Chinese. Despite the common name, these \"shuyuan\" are quite modern in concept and are quite different from traditional academies of classical learning.\n\nIn discussing the \"shuyuan\", it is common to speak of the \"Four Great Academies\" (四大书院; \"sì-dà shū-yuàn\") of ancient China. Usually the \"Four Great Academies\" refers to the Four Great Academies of the Northern Song. However, sources give a number of different lists, sometimes expanded to Six or Eight Great Academies. Only one, the Yuelu Academy, appears in all lists. Each school went up or down the list in different periods. White Deer Grotto Academy had long been important. As for the impact on the politics of China, Donglin Academy in the Ming Dynasty is especially notable.\n\nAlso known as the Four Great Academies of the Northern Song or the Four Northern Song Academies.\n\nSometimes the Shigu Academy is substituted for the Songyang Academy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3656547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3656547", "title": "Aniran", "text": "Aniran\n\nAnīrân (Modern Persian, ) or Anērān (Middle Persian, ) is an ethno-linguistic term that signifies \"non-Iranian\" or \"non-Iran\" (non-Aryan). Thus, in a general sense, 'Aniran' signifies lands where Iranian languages are not spoken. In a pejorative sense, it denotes \"a political and religious enemy of Iran and Zoroastrianism.\"\n\nThe term 'Aniran' derives from Middle Persian \"anērān\", Pahlavi \"ʼnyrʼn\", an antonym of \"ērān\" that in turn denoted either the people or the Sasanian Empire. However, \"in Zoroastrian literature and possibly in Sasanian political thought as well, the term has also a markedly religious connotation. An \"anēr\" person is not merely non-Iranian, but specifically non-Zoroastrian; and \"anēr\" designates also worshipers of the \"dēws\" (\"demons\") or adherents of other religions.\" In these texts of the ninth to twelfth century, \"Arabs and Turks are called \"anēr\", as are Muslims generally, the latter in a veiled manner.\"\n\nIn official usage, the term is first attested in inscriptions of Shapur I (r. 241–272), who styled himself the \"king of kings of \"Ērān\" and \"Anērān\".\" Shapur's claim to \"Anērān\" reflected the emperor's victories over Valerian and Philip, and staked a claim against the Roman Empire, the enemies of the Sassanid state. This is also reflected in Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, where the emperor includes Syria, Cappadocia, and Cilicia - all three previously captured from the Romans — in his list of \"Anērān\" territories. \n\nThe proclamation as \"king of kings of Ērān and Anērān\" remained a stock epithet of subsequent Sassanid dynasts. Thirty years after Shapur, the Zoroastrian high-priest Kartir included the Caucasus and Armenia in his list of \"Anērān\" territories. In this, Kartir's inscription (also at Ka'ba-ye Zartosht) contradicts Shapur's, which included the same two regions in his list of regions of \"Ērān\".\n\nAlthough first attested in a Sassanid-era proclamation, \"Anērān\", like \"Ērān\", is conceptually several centuries older, appearing in the \"Younger Avesta\" as \"anairya\", where it denotes the \"Turanians\" (the identification of the Turan/Anērān with a particular place is a historically distinct development, see above and below). These \"Turanians\" of Anērān, apparently the traditional enemies of the Avestan-speaking peoples, appear in Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology as the noxious folk of the sixteen lands created by Angra Mainyu (\"Vendidad\" 1.18). These lands lay beyond the world river that encircled the sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the first of which was \"Airyanəm Vaējah\", meaning \"expanse of the Iranian peoples\". This same term in Middle Persian was \"Ērān (vēj)\".\n\nIn the ninth to twelfth century Zoroastrian texts, the legendary Turanian king and military commander Afrasiab is (together with Dahag and Alexander the Great) the most hated among the beings that Ahriman (Avestan \"Angra Mainyu\") set against the Iranians (\"Zand-i Wahman yasn\" 7.32; \"Menog-i Khrad\" 8.29)\n\nIn the \"Shahnameh\", the poet Ferdowsi draws on Zoroastrian scripture (with due attribution) and retains the association of \"Aneran\" with the Turanians. The poet, however, specifically places them beyond the Amu Darya and identifies the Turanians as \"Turks\". From the point of view of Ferdowsi's home in Khorasan, this identification coincides with the Avestan notion (e.g. \"Vendidad\" 7.2, 19.1) that the lands of Angra Mainyu (Middle Persian: Ahriman) lay to the north. The two sources do however diverge with respect to details. In the Avesta, Sogdia (Avestan \"Sughdha\", present-day Sughd and Samarqand Regions) is not Anērān – Sogdia is one of the sixteen lands created by Mazda, not one of the lands of Angra Mainyu.\n\nNonetheless, for Ferdowsi the division between Ērān and Anērān is just as rigid as it is in the \"Avesta\": When the primordial king Fereydun (Avestan \"Θraētaona\") divides his kingdom – the whole world – among his three sons, he gives the Semitic lands in the west to the eldest, the lands of the north to his middle son Tur (Avestan \"Turya\", hence the name \"Turanian\"), and \"Ērān\" to his youngest (\"Shahnameh\" 1.189). In the story, this partition leads to a family feud in which an alliance of the two elder sons (who rule over the Anērānian lands) battle the forces of the youngest (the Iranians). The Iranians win.\n\nFor Ferdowsi, the Turanians/Anērānians (often used interchangeably) are unquestionably the villains of peace. Their conflict with Iranians is the main theme of the \"Shahnameh\" and accounts for more than half of the text. The deaths of heroes and other admirable figures are frequently attributed to Turanians. Thus \"Shahnameh\" 5.92 says a Turanian raider named Tur-Baratur killed the 77-year-old Zoroaster in Balkh.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "179645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179645", "title": "Ashʿari", "text": "Ashʿari\n\nAshʿarism or Ashʿari theology (; \"al-ʾAšʿarīyya\" or \"al-ʾAšāʿira\") is the foremost theological school of Sunni Islam which established an orthodox dogmatic guideline based on clerical authority, founded by the Arab theologian Abu al-Hasan al-Ashʿari (d. AD 936 / AH 324). The disciples of the school are known as Ashʿarites, and the school is also referred to as the Ashʿarite school, which became the dominant strand within Sunni Islam. It is considered one of the orthodox schools of theology in Sunni Islam, alongside the Maturidi school of theology.\n\nAmongst the most famous Ashʿarites are Al-Bayhaqi, Al-Nawawi, Al-Ghazali, Izz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam, Al-Suyuti, Ibn 'Asakir, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Al-Qurtubi and Al-Subki.\n\nAbu al-Hasan al-Ashʿari was noted for his teachings on atomism, among the earliest Islamic philosophies, and for al-Ashʿari this was the basis for propagating the view that God created every moment in time and every particle of matter. He nonetheless believed in free will, elaborating the thoughts of Dirar ibn 'Amr and Abu Hanifa into a \"dual agent\" or \"acquisition\" (\"iktisab\") account of free will.\n\nWhile al-Ashʿari opposed the views of the Mu'tazili school for its over-emphasis on reason, he was also opposed to the view which rejected all debate, held by certain schools such as the Zahiri (\"literalist\"), Mujassimite (\"anthropotheist\") and Muhaddithin (\"traditionalist\") schools for their over-emphasis on taqlid (imitation) in his \"Istihsan al‑Khaud\":\n\nAshʿarism became the main school of early Islamic philosophy whereby it was originally based on the foundations laid down by Abu al-Hasan al-Ashʿari who founded the school in the 10th century based on the methodology taught to him by his teacher Abdullah ibn Sa'eed ibn Kullaab. However, the school underwent many changes throughout history resulting in the term Ashʿari, in modern usage, being extremely broad, e.g. differences between Ibn Fawrak (d. AH 406) and al-Bayhaqi (d. AH 384).\n\nFor example, the Asharite view was that comprehension of the unique nature and characteristics of God were beyond human capability. The solution proposed by Abu al-Hasan al-Ashʿari to solve the problems of tashbih and ta'til concedes that the Divine Being possesses in a real sense the attributes and Names mentioned in the Quran. Insofar as these names and attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they do not have either existence or reality apart from it. The inspiration of al-Ashʿari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level — something which Mu'tazili thinking had failed to grasp.\n\nThe Ashʿarite view holds that:\n\nIbn Taymiyyah attacked Ashari thought as (in the words of one historian, Jonathan A.C.Brown) \"a Greek solution to Greek problems\" that should \"never\" have concerned Muslims. Both Shah Wali Allah and Ibn Taymiyyah rejected the lack of literalism in Ashʿari “speculative theology” and advocated \"straightforward acceptance of God’s description of Himself.”\n\nOn the other hand, German orientalist Eduard Sachau blamed the theology of Ashʿari and its biggest defender, al-Ghazali, specifically for the decline of Islamic science starting in the tenth century, and stated that the two clerics were the only obstacle to the Muslim world becoming a nation of \"Galileos, Keplers and Newtons.\"\n\nOthers, however, argue that the Ashʿarites not only accepted scientific methods but even promoted them. Ziauddin Sardar points out that some of the greatest Muslim scientists, such as Ibn al-Haytham and Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, who were pioneers of the scientific method, were themselves followers of the Ashʿari school of Islamic theology. Like other Ashʿarites who believed that faith or \"taqlid\" should apply only to Islam and not to any ancient Hellenistic authorities, Ibn al-Haytham's view that \"taqlid\" should apply only to prophets of Islam and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his scientific skepticism and criticism against Ptolemy and other ancient authorities in his \"Doubts Concerning Ptolemy\" and \"Book of Optics\".\n\nSome authors have questioned the spiritual value of discussion methods employed by the Ashʿarites and other dialectical theologians. Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, himself a leading figure of the Ashʿari school, said at the end of his life: \"I employed all the methods which philosophy and dialectic had provided, but in the end I realised that these methods neither could bring solace to the weary heart nor quench the thirst of the thirsty. The best method and the nearest one to reality was the method provided by the Qur'an.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In English, the meanings are: Ay Ata: \"Father Moon\", Ay Dede: \"Grandfather Moon\" and Ay Tanrı: \"The Moon God\".\n\nAccording to the mythology, he is a moon god, and he has been living in sixth floor of the sky with Gun Ana (), the sun goddess, who he is coupled with. While Gün Ana is symbol of warmness and hotness, Ay Dede is the symbol of cold.\n\nIn Turkey, he is well known in modern times, Ay Dede is popular amongst children due to tales being told about him. The mythology is more common amongst Central Asian Turks, such as Altaians and Yakuts, who still have populations who actively practice Tengrism.\n\nNotably, in the \"Epic of Oghuz Khan\", Ay Tanrı also is mentioned as the father of Oghuz Khan, even though that part remains somewhat unclear. It's also notable Oghuz Khan's second son was named Ayhan (Ay Khan, \"moon khan\").\n\nFrom ancient times, the Turkic people believed that humans had secret lunar powers (Aisar or Aysar). Female pregnancy lasts about nine lunar months, and women often deliver during a full moon. The three phases of the moon were also symbolic. It was believed that at \"Ai Naazy\" (new moon) the moon symbolised a growing young child, who is pure and modest. At \"Ai Toly\" (full moon), the moon personified a mature good-natured mother or father. At \"Ai Karty\" (old moon) the moon aged, became wise. But at the same time quarrelsome and malicious. Before its death, the moon reigned over a totally dark night. The forces of life and death met during these nights. After the meeting they separated, only to meet again after a defined period. When the old moon died, a new one was born and so on, ad infinitum. The Turkic people trusted the magic influence of the Moon. She was their sole \"night lantern\". The celebrations of malicious spirits occurred mostly at night. The rituals and trances of witches and demons were always timed according to the phases of the Moon. In Turkish culture At night, illnesses got worse and caused more deaths. To please the Moon God, those born during a full moon were given names as such: Aisylu (Aysulu), Aituly (Aytulu), Ainir (Aynur), Aizirek (Ayzerek) and Ainaz (Aynaz).\n\n\n\n"}

Those who carry the title are experts in Islamic studies such as jurisprudence, Quran reading, and philosophy and usually teach in Islamic seminaries. The next lower clerical rank is Hujjat al-Islam.\n\nThe name \"ayatullah\" originates from a passage in the Quran which the Shi'a, unlike the Sunni, interpret to mean human beings can be regarded as 'signs' or 'evidence' of God. Passage 51:20–21 of the Quran states:\n\nThe term was not commonly used as a title until the early twentieth century. The title of Ayatollah became popularized with the creation of Qom Seminary in 1922.\n\nThe title is currently granted to top Shia \"mujtahid\", after completing \"sat'h\" and \"kharij\" studies in the \"hawza\". By then the \"mujtahid\" would be able to issue his own edicts from the sources of Islamic religious laws: the Qur'an, the \"Sunnah\", \"ijmāʻ\", and \"'aql\" (\"intellect\", rather than the Sunnī principle of \"qiyas\"). Most of the time this is attested by an issued certificate from his teachers.

Current examples of the Lady Mujtahidehs are Zohreh Sefati and Lady Ayatollah Aatieh Hassani, also known as Imam'ah Al-Hassani, daughter of Grand Ayatollah Gholamreza Hassani.\n\nHistorically, there have been several Mujtahidehs in Shi'ism, most famously the women in the family of Allama Hilli, as well as the Baraghani family of 19th-century Qazvin.\n\nOnly a few of the most important ayatollahs are accorded the rank of Grand Ayatollah (\"Ayatollah Uzma\", \"Great Sign of God\"). When an ayatollah gains a significant following and they are recognized for religiously correct views, they are considered a \"Marja'-e-Taqlid\", which in common parlence is \"grand ayatollah\". Usually as a prelude to such status, a \"mujtahid\" is asked to publish a juristic treatise in which he answers questions about the application of Islam to present-time daily affairs. \"Risalah\" is the word for treatise, and such a juritic work is called a \"risalah-yi'amaliyyah\" or \"practical law treatise\", and it is usually a reinvention of the book \"Al-Urwatu l-Wuthqah\".\n\nThere are 86 Maraji (plural of \"Marja\"') living worldwide as of 2017, mainly based in Najaf and Qom.

It limits the east with the people of Lela and west to the village of Karaoum. Its current population is approximately 200 native people from the village, considering that many residents living abroad. Its inhabitants are religionists Muslim Sunni, but also resides a family Christian Maronite in the community.\n\nThis town is known for being one of the many born of emigration from Lebanon. The first wave of migration that emerged in Baaloul was between 1935 - 1950, prior to Lebanese independence and during administration of the territory by France. The French Mandate of Lebanon exercised authority and take political and economic decisions in the territory. The French showed certain preferences to the community Christian Maronite, some discrimination to be reported to the Muslim. Lebanese Muslim men of the time were protesting the situation and claimed that they did not want to live in a country where decisions were exercised by foreigners over the Arab, this resulted in the displacement of these out of Lebanese territory.\n\nThe second displacement of its inhabitants began during the 70s, when the country was facing the beginning of a power struggle in the political and social field between the factions Muslim and Christian. Finally this struggle gave as a result the start of the Lebanese Civil War (1975 - 1990). The situation in the country was unstable and a sluggish economy and an increasingly bloody civil war that prevented raising their children; Many people decided to again begin to migrate.\n\nThe people emigrated mainly to countries of Latin America, among which are: Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Panama; there were also significant numbers who moved to Canada and US. These migrations are mostly round trips: after achieving a stable economic support the immigrant population Baaloul returns again to dedicate himself to building homes for their families.\n\nColombia it was one of the main destinations of emigration of people. Among the 70, 80 and 90 the Department of Colombian Guajira, specifically the population of Maicao was one of the places where the community was established.

It is choreographed as an annual Vaishnavism tradition in Melattur and nearby regions, and celebrated as a dance-drama performance art. The dance art has roots in a historic migration of practitioners of Kuchipudi, another Indian classical dance art, from Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu\n\nThe term \"Bhagavata\", state Brandon and Banham, refers to the Hindu text \"Bhagavata Purana\". \"Mela\" is a Sanskrit word that means \"gathering, meeting of a group\" and connotes a folk festival. The traditional Bhagavata Mela performance acts out the legends of Hinduism, set to the Carnatic style music.\n\nThe origins of the Bhagavata Mela are in Kuchipudi, another more ancient classical Indian dance, found in Andhra Pradesh. The invasion of the region by Islamic armies led to the fall of a Hindu empire, which triggered the mass migration of Hindu performance artist families to Tamil Nadu in 16th century, where the dance evolved into modern Bhagavata Mela. Prior to its fall, the court records of the Deccan region based Vijayanagara Empire – known for its patronage of the Indian religions and arts – indicate that drama-dance troupes of \"Bhagavatas\" from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court. The region saw wars and political turmoil, ending in the formation of Deccan Sultanates in 16th century. With the fall of Vijayanagara Empire and the destruction of temples and Deccan cities by the Muslim army around 1565, musicians and dance-drama artists migrated south, and Tanjore kingdom records indicate that some 500 such Kuchipudi artist families arrived from Andhra, were welcomed and granted land by the Hindu king Achyutappa Nayak, a settlement that grew to become modern Melattur near Tanjore (also called Thanjavur). These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela.\n\nKuchipudi declined and was a dying art in 17th-century Andhra, but in 1678, the last Shia Muslim Nawab of Golkonda, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, saw a Kuchipudi performance and was so pleased that he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they continue the dance-drama. The Shia Sultanate was overthrown in 1687 by the Sunni Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In order to regulate public and private morals, as well as end un-Islamic practices, Aurangzeb banned public performances of all music and dance arts, along with ordering the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments in Indian subcontinent under control of his Mughal Empire.\n\nThe Deccan region saw wars and political turmoil with Mughal imperial expansion ending the Deccan Sultanates by the end of the 17th century. During this period, more Bhagavatar community families moved south, invited by the newly established Maratha rajas in the Kaveri delta, to settle in and around Kumbakonam. These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela.\n\nThe Bhagavata Mela is traditionally celebrated in Hindu temple grounds or next to a temple, starting after dusk and through the night, and like the original Kuchipudi artists, male Brahmins were the artists who played the role of men and women characters in the underlying story. Modern productions include both male and female artists, and has evolved to show influences of both Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam – the main classical dance of Tamil Nadu.\n\nLike all classical dances of India, the Bhagavata Mela incorporates sophisticated gestures as sign language combined with intricate footwork and acting (\"abhinaya\") to communicate a religious story with spiritual message. These aspects of the Bhagavata Mela have roots in the \"Natya Shastra\", the ancient Hindu text on performance arts. The performance includes \"Nritta\", \"Nritya\" and \"Natya\". The \"Nritta\" performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of pure dance. The \"Nritya\" is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes. The \"Natya\" is a play performed by a team of artists. The roots of \"abhinaya\" are also found in the \"Natyashastra\" text which describes basic units of dance, the gestures and movements that connect with the audience and aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, and transports the individual into a super sensual inner state of being.\n\nThe communication in Bhagavata Mela is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) synchronized to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the \"ras\" (sentiment, emotional taste) and \"bhava\" (mood) of the underlying story. Like other Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: \"Angika\" (gestures and body language), \"Vachika\" (song, recitation, music and rhythm), \"Aharya\" (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and \"Sattvika\" (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates). \"Abhinaya\" draws out the \"bhava\" (mood, psychological states).\n\nThe Bhagavata Mela stories are typically from the Hindu Epics or the Puranas, with \"Prahlada Charitram\" being particularly popular. The music is Carnatic style, and most of the underlying story is sung to the rhythm of the music while the dance artists perform. The repertoire is aided by an orchestra of musical instruments, with mridangam (drum) and cymbals providing the beat, and flute, string instruments and harmonium completing the ensemble.\n\n"}

The text contains a highly esoteric description, with the Kāma-Gāyatṛi, of Kṛṣṇa in His abode Goloka.\n\nIn 1970, George Harrison produced a modern recording of these prayers performed by devotees of the Rādha Kṛṣṇa Temple in London. Titled \"Govinda\", the song took its title from the main chorus line of the prayer \"govindam ādi-puruṣam tam ahaṁ bhajāmi\", meaning \"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord\". This prayer was sung by Yamunā Devi, a disciple of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda.\n\nThe recovered fragment of the \"Śrī Brahma-samhitā\" commences at the fifth chapter, whose first verse states:\n\n<poem>\n\"īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ\"\n\"anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva kāraṇa kāraṇam śloka 5.1\"</poem>\n\nThis translates to:\n\n<poem>Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.</poem>\n\nThe text was first translated from Sanskrit into English by Bhakti Siddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura in 1932 and is often sung or recited as both a devotional and philosophical text.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one branch of British Traditional Wicca, alongside Gardnerian, Alexandrian Wicca and Mohsian, as defined by New Wiccan Church in California.\n\nThere are several theories about the origins of Central Valley Wicca, leading to a degree of debate among researchers. Some speculate that CVW is an early offshoot or even a precursor of Gardnerian Wicca, while others suggest that the CVW share a common ancestor with what later became Gardnerian Wicca. According to their original custom, an initiate of Central Valley Wicca was not told who their initiator's initiator was; therefore, the identity of the person who first brought Wicca to the Central Valley remains a mystery. What is known is that she had ties to England and had most likely lived there; she was either British or had close connection to a British subject prior to settling in California.\n\nAt that time, individual names for \"traditions\" of Wicca were not in use; they simply called themselves \"Wicca.\" Today, however, the various branches of Wicca that descend from the Central Valley Wicca have developed into traditions in their own right, including Silver Crescent, Kingstone, Daoine Coire, Assembly of Wicca, and Majestic. Some of the offshoot traditions from CVW have blended in influences from other related Pagan paths, although most retain the core essence of CVW.\n\nCentral Valley Wicca shares basic beliefs with, and has similar ritual structures and practices to, other forms of British Traditional Wicca as they are practiced in England. However, their interpretation of some of the material is unique, and their lore is similar but not identical.\n\n"}

She was voiced in both incarnations by Tracy Grandstaff.\n\nIn 2002, Daria placed at number 41 on the list of the\" Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters\" of all Time by \"TV Guide\" for her role in the two shows. She was also listed in AOL's 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.\n\nGlenn Eichler created the Daria character. MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" \"became successful, we ... created Daria's character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the foil.\" Terkuhle said that he added Daria \"to put [Beavis and Butt-Head] in their place.\"\n\nIn Daria's first incarnation as a recurring character on \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", she formed an intelligent female foil to the two main characters. She went through three different outfits, had a stockier figure, and initially was a more expressive character; her iconic monotone voice would only develop over time. She would become more sardonic over time, but showed early on that she could hold her own against the two and could react fast to their antics.\n\nShe had a minor role in her first appearance, \"Sign Here\". She answered questions from Van Driessen on furriers and their treatment of animals. In her second episode with them, \"Scientific Stuff\", she was forced to do a science class presentation with them and turned it to her advantage by using them \"as\" the presentation's experiment. In later appearances, she would alternate between being irritated by their antics and finding their stupidity to be amusing: in \"Sprout\", she specifically came over to watch them fail at planting seeds, and in \"Walkathon\" she got them to unwittingly pledge $100 apiece on a charity walkathon. In \"Sporting Goods\" she gave three eye-popping gasps while Beavis and Butt-head wear eye patches as athletic supporters, which is a dramatic contrast to her monotonous behavior in the later series. She lacked the passionate hatred for them that Principal McVicker and Coach Buzzcut had and was one of the very few characters that would willingly seek them out, but did not really believe there is any hope for them either as David Van Driessen had. On multiple occasions, she took it upon herself to explain simple concepts to them, such as informing them in \"U.S. History\" what graduation was (Beavis responded, \"You mean, like...school ends?\") and in \"Sprout\" that you put seeds in the ground.\n\nIn a Christmas special, it is stated that Butt-Head had been responsible for giving her a negative outlook on boys. Aside from that, she was one of the few characters that the duo never managed to drive crazy as they had with many other students and teachers. Butt-Head would sometimes treat her with some degree of respect, following her advice in \"Sprout\" and chuckling \"Daria's \"cool!\"\" after she asked Bill Clinton if \"you were just jerking us around\" on a campaign promise.\n\nJohn J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" describes Daria as \"as sharp as B. & B. are dimwitted.\" John Allemang of \"The Globe and Mail\" described Daria in \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" \"the prematurely wise girl who could be counted on to put their idiocy in perspective.\" Beavis and Butt-Head often call her \"Diarrhea\".\n\nIn the final episode of season 7, when the boys were believed dead, Daria expressed the sentiments that \"I guess it's sad they're dead\", but they did not have very bright futures to look forward to.\n\nDaria appeared frequently in the Marvel Comics adaptation of the TV show, and also got to appear on the cover of one issue and \"answer\" the fan mail in two others. In \"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America\", she appears once throughout the film with a group of students, but does not have any dialogue.\n\nDaria's own show would never mention Beavis and Butt-Head and only named Highland once at the beginning of the first episode of season one, carried over from the original and unbroadcast pilot. Despite this, it was frequently noted in media articles about the show that it was a spin-off from \"Beavis and Butt-Head\". In an \"interview\" on \"CBS Early Show\" on January 21, 2002, Daria was asked by Jane Clayson if she kept in touch with Beavis and Butt-Head; she responded \"I'd like to, but first they'd have to figure out that when the telephone makes that funny sound, you're supposed to pick it up and say hello\".\n\nAs revealed in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview with Mike Judge, Daria would not return to the new episodes of \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" in 2011, but she was referenced in \"Drones\" during a music video when Beavis assumed she had committed suicide. However, Butt-Head incredulously tells his friend \"What are you talking about, Beavis? Daria didn't die, she just moved away\".\n\nIn the series \"Daria\" which followed \"Beavis and Butt-head\", Daria remains bespectacled and plain. She is an unfashionably dressed, highly intellectual, entirely pessimistic about life altogether, cynical, and sarcastic teenage girl who is portrayed as an icon of sanity in an insane household in an equally insane upper middle class suburb. She resides with her vacuous, fashion-obsessed younger sister Quinn and career-obsessed parents Helen and Jake. John Allemang of \"The Globe and Mail\" said that Daria is \"both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn.\" She had moved to a new school, having transferred from the one in \"Beavis and Butt-Head\". Glenn Eichler said, in relation to \"Daria\" the series, of which he was a co-creator, \"I like to think that I've helped her come out of her shell.\"\n\nDavid L. Coddon of the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" described Daria as \"the anti-cheerleader, the un-social climber, the jaundiced eye in a cartoon world of too much makeup and superficial crayon colors.\" Coddon added that Daria \"may look like a misfit, but the catch is that Daria's the only character on the show who 'gets it.' It's everyone else who's a misfit.\" Daria states in the first episode that she does not have low self esteem: she has low esteem for everybody else. Anita Gates of \"The New York Times\" said \"The secret of Daria's popularity (everywhere but in her own home and school) may be our collective alienation.\" Gates says that \"her tastes are a little dark.\" As an example, Gates used the fact that she reads \"Howl\" by Allen Ginsberg at a reading to the elderly program.\n\nEichler said, \"Apparently everyone, with the exception of a very few people who were hit on the head when they were very young, felt like they were outsiders. You either identify with her as an outsider or you sort of envy her ability to navigate her life as an outsider and stay sane.\" John J. O'Connor, a television critic for \"The New York Times\", said \"In short, Daria is the perfect anti-Barbie Doll. Merchants of fashion and cosmetics are beneath her contempt. Her refusal to be Miss Goody Consumer borders on the truly subversive.\" He concludes that Daria \"is every glorious misfit I ever knew.\"\n\nAllemang said that in \"Daria\", Daria \"seems more tortured and neurotic, if only because it's more clear that the airheads have won.\" Daria often talks to herself. Allemang adds \"in a perky-teen world with its twisted values, soliloquies are the best hope of intelligent conversation.\" In addition he said \"There's nothing intrinsically wrong with Daria, just because she can't or won't hang out with the cool kids.\" John J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" said that Daria has \"a withering eye\" towards her classmates. Emily Nussbaum for \"Slate\" would praise the show for both having a character that many disaffected teenagers could relate to and for showing \"the flipside of her principled withdrawal from the world: her crippling terror of rejection, a streak of ugly self-righteousness\".\n\nDaria likes to watch the fictitious television show \"Sick, Sad World\". Gates added that \"Daria is the kind of girl who reads \"Heart of Darkness\" and Edgar Allan Poe's 'Telltale Heart' in class.\"\n\nAnita Gates of \"The New York Times\" says \"The Morgendorffers don't even seem to notice that Daria constantly gives them lip.\" In one scene, when Helen, her mother, says, \"There's no course that can teach you to be a perfect mother,\" Daria responds \"That's obvious.\" Gates says that \"nobody sends her to her room.\" Gates also said that Daria's popular, self-absorbed sister Quinn is \"the greatest burden on the home front.\" Jane Lane, Daria's best friend, met her at a self-esteem class. Gates adds that Jane \"knows all of Daria's peculiarities and still loves her.\" Gates said that Daria's \"silent intense crush\" on Jane's brother Trent is her \"only discernible weakness\" and that \"the absolute proof that Jane is a good friend is that she knows how Daria feels about Trent and will never, ever tell.\" In spite of her early infatuation with Trent, Daria's most significant romantic relationship is with Tom Sloane, who entered the show at the end of the third season and rapidly became Jane's love interest before beginning a relationship with Daria that continued throughout the rest of the show and caused some friction between Daria and Jane.\nThe first \"Daria\" movie, \"Is It Fall Yet?\", gave the principal characters time apart from one another in parallel narratives which foreshadowed further changes in their relationships.\n\nBy the time of the finale movie \"Is It College Yet?\", Daria's character has undergone noticeable growth. She chooses to attend Raft College. She graduates from Lawndale High, winning the Dian Fossey Award \"for dazzling academic achievements in face of near total misanthropy\", and crowning her acceptance speech with the assertion that \"there is no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can't be improved with pizza\".\n\nDaria wears rounded thick glasses, an orange T-shirt underneath a green jacket, a black skirt, and black boots. John Allemang of \"The Globe and Mail\" said \"to surrender is to be normal, to sacrifice your brain in the rush to be popular and wear uncomfortable shoes that make your legs look hot. Daria, as always, keeps her integrity. She wears sensible shoes, and finds her intellectual reward in not being hot.\"\n\nIn \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", Daria wears square glasses, a leather jacket, white T-shirt, a red skirt, black leggings and black boots. In the earlier episodes, she is seen wearing a brown jacket, beige skirt, green shirt and brown boots.\n\nDuring her run on MTV, Daria would narrate or \"host\" special events and shows, either with a real-life presenter or with Jane. She was part of the Cool Crap Auction in 1999, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking \"live\" to the winner of one prize, answering machine messages recorded by her. Daria and Jane also hosted MTV's \"Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown\" and two \"Daria Day\" marathons of their episodes; the \"Countdown\" and second marathon segments are included on the 2010 DVD release.\n\nDaria makes a brief cameo in the \"Drawn Together\" episode \"Lost in Parking Space, Part Two\". She is being tortured in the basement of a Hot Topic along with other cartoon characters. She has a nail being hammered into her eye and says, \"This is men's fault\", in her infamous monotone and is rather indifferent to the pain. Also, at one point in the MTV animated series \"Undergrads\", Gimpy is talking to his friends via webcam when a female hacker hacks into the video stream and edits Gimpy to look like Daria.\n\nIn late 2010, following the DVD release, Daria was licensed as a voice for Garmin and TomTom GPS systems; original putdowns and jokes were recorded.\n\nCarol A. Stabile and Mark Harrison, authors of \"Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture\", said that \"for the cerebral, writerly types who liked television Daria was the outcast she-hero who dared to say things they were too scared to say in their teenage years.\" Van Toffler, then the general manager of MTV, said in 1998 that Daria \"has an attitude about parents, school, and siblings that is common to the experiences of our audience. She is a good spokesperson for MTV... intelligent but subversive.\" A 1997 \"The Nation\" article referred to Daria as \"a 10th grade Dorothy Parker.\" Another critic praising the character said that she is like \"a 50-year-old deadpan Jewish comic in the body of a 16-year-old.\" Jennifer Vineyard, a writer of \"My Life as Liz\", said \"Daria made it cool to be a smart chick.\" Vineyard added, \"Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There's a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to.\"\n\nSome commentators believed that the character's deadpan humor had too much morbidity for the teenage audience. A critic said that Daria uses her \"omnivorous deadpan\" contempt against other people, represented a variety of \"living death\", and was \"a grim reaper in a dress\" who was more dangerous than Marilyn Manson. Anita Gates of \"The New York Times\" said \"And some people like her just because she says mean things. As far as I can tell, with her show well into its third season [...], Daria has never cracked a smile.\"\n"}

{"id": "4279226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4279226", "title": "Disenchantment", "text": "Disenchantment\n\nIn social science, disenchantment () is the cultural rationalization and devaluation of religion apparent in modern society. The term was borrowed from Friedrich Schiller by Max Weber to describe the character of modernized, bureaucratic, secularized Western society, where scientific understanding is more highly valued than belief, and where processes are oriented toward rational goals, as opposed to traditional society, where for Weber, \"the world remains a great enchanted garden\".\n\nWeber's ambivalent appraisal of the process of disenchantment as both positive \"and\" negative was taken up by the Frankfurt school in their examination of the self-destructive elements in Enlightenment rationalism.\n\nHabermas has subsequently striven to find a positive foundation for modernity in the face of disenchantment, even while appreciating Weber's recognition of how far secular society was created from, and is still \"haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs\".\n\nSome have seen the disenchantment of the world as a call for existentialist commitment and individual responsibility before a collective normative void.\n\nDisenchantment is related to the notion of desacralization, whereby the structures and institutions that previously channeled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities came under attack and waned in popularity. According to Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss, the ritual of sacrifice involved two processes: sacralization and desacralization. The first process endows a profane offering with sacred properties—consecration—which provides a bridge of communication between the worlds of the sacred and profane. Once the sacrifice has been made, the ritual must be desacralized in order to return the worlds of the sacred and profane to their proper places.\n\nDisenchantment operates on a macro-level, rather than the micro-level described above. It also destroys part of the process whereby the chaotic social elements that require sacralization in the first place continue with mere knowledge as their antidote. Thereby disenchantment can be related to Durkheim's concept of anomie: an un-mooring of the individual from the ties that bind in society.\n\nIn recent years, Weber's paradigm has been challenged by thinkers who see a process of \"reenchantment\" operating alongside that of disenchantment. Thus, enchantment is used to fundamentally change how even low paid service work is experienced.\n\nJung considered symbols to provide a means for the numinous to return from the unconscious to the desacralized world - a means for the recovery of myth, and the sense of wholeness it once provided, by a disenchanted modernity.\n\nErnest Gellner argued that though disenchantment was the inevitable product of modernity, many people just could not stand a disenchanted world, and therefore opted for various \"re-enchantment creeds\" (as he called them) such as psychoanalysis, Marxism, Wittgensteinianism, phenomenology and ethnomethodology. A noticeable feature of these re-enchantment creeds is that they all tried to make themselves compatible with naturalism: i.e., they did not refer to supernatural forces.\n\nLeo Ruickbie showed on the basis of research in the Neopagan community that modern magical practitioners demonstrated re-enchantment. Using both qualitative participant research and quantitative survey analysis he was able to demonstrate a range of re-enchanted characteristics conforming to those extrapolated from Weber's theories.\n\nAmerican historian of religion Jason Josesphson-Storm has challenged mainstream sociological and historical interpretations of the ideas of both disenchantment and reenchantment, labeling disenchantment as a \"myth.\" Josephson-Storm argues that there has not been a decline in belief in magic or mysticism in Western Europe or the United States, even after adjusting for religious belief, education, and class. Josephson-Storm has further argued that many influential theorists of disenchantment, including Weber and some members of the Frankfurt School, were not only aware of modern European magical and occult movements but consciously engaged with them. Foundational theorists of disenchantment such as Weber and James George Frazer did not envision a rigid binary between rationality or rationalization and magical thinking and did not describe a process of \"reenchantment\" to reverse or compensate for disenchantment. According to Josephson-Storm, this information necessitates a re-interpretation of Weber's idea of disenchantment as referring more to the sequestering and professionalization of magic.\n\n\n"}

It is about the treacherous nature of ego.\n\nHaving previously written about external obstacles in his book \"The Obstacle Is the Way\", Holiday sought to answer questions about what to do when the biggest obstacle is internal. In the prologue of the book, Holiday explains how finding early successes led him to the realization that ego can cloud ambition and hinder personal and professional growth, particularly when accomplishments are tied to self-worth.\n\nHoliday had the title of his book tattooed on his forearm as a daily reminder of its message.\n\n\"Ego Is the Enemy\" puts forth the argument that often our biggest problems are not caused by external factors such as other people or circumstances. Instead, our problems stem from our own attitude, selfishness and self-absorption. In other words, introducing ego into a situation often prevents us from being rational, objective and clear headed.\n\nThe book does not discuss Freud's ego or egotism as a clinical term but rather ego in a colloquial sense, defined as \"an unhealthy belief in your own importance.\" The book also discusses the difference between ego and confidence, and argues that the solution to the problem of ego is humility, self-awareness, purpose and realism.\n\n\"Ego Is the Enemy\" provides both cautionary tales as well as positive anecdotes about ego, citing numerous historical and contemporary figures including Christopher McCandless, George Marshall, John DeLorean, Larry Page, Paul Graham, Steve Jobs and William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\n\"Ego Is the Enemy\" has received generally positive reviews, with \"Outside Magazine\" commenting, \"Holiday takes philosophy out of the ivory towers and translates often-dense concepts into actionable insights.\" The book was featured in the \"NPR\" Book Concierge Guide To 2016’s Great Reads.\n\nIn the weeks after its release, the book was listed by \"Inc.\" as one of the must-read business books that summer.

{"id": "42125426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42125426", "title": "Ek Chuaj", "text": "Ek Chuaj\n\nEk Chuaj, also known as Ek Chuah, Ekchuah, God M according to the Schellhas-Zimmermann-Taube classification of codical gods, is a Postclassic Maya merchant deity as well as a patron of cacao. Ek Chuaj is part of a pantheon of Maya deities that have been depicted in hieroglyphs and artwork of various Maya sites and has been interpreted as a significant part of Maya religion.\n\nEk Chuaj can either be depicted as black-and-white striped, as he is in the Dresden Codex, or entirely black, as he is in the Madrid Codex. Other distinguishing characteristics of Ek Chuaj are his mouth, which is encircled by a red-brown border, his large lower lip, and the presence of two curved lines to the right of his eye. Other depictions of Ek Chuaj show him as an old man with only a single tooth. This is the appearance he most regularly takes in the Madrid Codex. He has been depicted with a pack of goods commonly carried by merchants, and his carrying of a burden is also indicated by the rope or tumpline tied around his head. He may also carry a spear and, in some instances, a scorpion's tail.\n\nEk Chuaj holds various meanings depending upon the contexts in which he is depicted. His principal associations are with trade and cacao use.\n\nEk Chuaj is often depicted carrying a pack and a spear, indicating transportation of goods as well as the dangerous life of a merchant. In this context, Ek Chuaj is a patron deity of travelers and journeys. During journeys, travelers would stack three stones on top of each other and offer incense to Ek Chuaj at night to ensure a safe journey home. It is possible that Ek Chuaj and the \"Guide of the Merchant,\" otherwise known as Polaris or the North Star, are related both symbolically and linguistically. \"Ek\" can be translated as either \"black\" or \"star\".\n\nCacao was one of the most important products traded by Maya merchants and it was often treated as currency. Because Ek Chuaj is a patron of cacao, owners of cacao groves would hold ceremonies or special festivals in his honor. One of these was held during Muwan, a \"month\" in the Maya solar calendar or \"haab'\". The presence of this ceremony suggests that Ek Chuaj was an agriculturally symbolic deity within Maya society.\n\nEk Chuaj is sometimes depicted in combat, most often with Buluk Chabtan (God F) the god of war, violence, and sacrifice. This interaction has been interpreted as representing the need for traveling merchants to have the ability to ward off hostile attacks. In the Madrid Codex, Ek Chuaj and God L are closely related and sometimes nearly indistinguishable from one another. It appears that God L was a Classic Maya counterpart of Ek Chuaj. As Ek Chuaj gained influence and importance, he supplanted God L. In some cases, Ek Chuaj seems have attributes of other deities. For example, in one instance he is depicted with the head of an old man, the spine of a death god, and the tail of a scorpion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25027698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25027698", "title": "Erusin", "text": "Erusin\n\nErusin () is the Hebrew term for betrothal. In modern Hebrew, \"erusin\" means engagement, but this is not the historical meaning of the term, which is the first part of marriage (the second part being \"nissuin\").\n\nSince the Middle Ages it is customary for the marriage to occur immediately after the betrothal, and to perform the betrothal during the marriage ceremony itself. Previously this was not the case, and there were often several months between the two events.\n\nIn Hebrew and classical rabbinic literature, betrothal is frequently referred to as sanctification (Hebrew: \"Kiddushin\", קידושין), on account of the bride becoming \"sanctified\" (dedicated) to the groom.\n\nThe idea of erusin as the minimum necessary condition to apply the death penalty for adultery, but less than a complete marriage, appears in Deuteronomy.\n\nA non-traditional view is that the betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). The price paid for her (bride price) is known by the Hebrew term \"mohar\" (מוהר‎). The girl's consent is not explicitly required by any statement in the Bible, neither is there explicit permission to ignore it. Yet, as the servant of Abraham was seeking a Bride for Isaac, and discovered Rebekah living in Haran, her father Bethuel, and her brother Laban, said, \"Let us call the young woman and ask her.\" And they called Rebekah and said to her, \"Will you go with this man?\" She said, \"I will go.\"(Genesis 24:57, 58) It was customary in biblical times for the bride to be given part of the \"mohar\". Gradually it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the \"mohar\" entirely to the bride, rather than to her father.\n\nThe traditional commentators do not necessarily explain \"mohar\" this way. Rashi understands \"mohar\" as a form of \"ketubah\", an agreement to pay a certain amount upon divorce, and Nachmanides understands it as \"sovlanut\", a sort of dowry or engagement present. Rashi understands Rachel and Leah's complaint to Jacob (\"we are considered strangers to him for he has sold us\") as saying that it was not normal for a father to sell his daughters, at least not without also giving them a dowry.\n\nThe Talmud states that there are three methods of performing erusin; by handing the woman a coin or object of nominal value, by handing her a document and through consummation (sexual intercourse), although the last is prohibited by the Talmud. In all cases the woman's consent is required; however, it can be implied by her silence. In religious law, two valid witnesses must see the ceremony.\n\nThe erusin is preceded by a blessing over wine and then the \"bircat erusin\" (betrothal blessing). If forgotten before the ceremony, it can be recited before the ketubah is read. Originally the blessings were recited by the groom but today it is more common for someone else to recite them such as the wedding's Rabbi.\n\nToday, the custom is to perform the betrothal by giving the bride an object whose value is well known, and fairly constant: a gold ring without a stone. This is in accordance with the first method mentioned above.\n\nThe actual betrothal now takes place. The groom takes the ring and says in Hebrew, \"Behold, you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the laws of Moses and Israel\". The groom now places the ring on the bride’s index finger.\n\nIn order to separate the erusin and nissuin - the two parts of the wedding - the ketubah is now read.\n\nFor legal purposes, a betrothed couple is regarded as husband and wife. Similarly, the union can only be ended by the same divorce process as for married couples. However, betrothal does not oblige the couple to behave towards each other in the manner that a married couple is required to, nor does it permit the couple to have a sexual relationship with each other.\n\nThe rabbis prohibited marrying without an engagement (\"shiddukhin\"). Therefore, an old custom is to sign a \"\" as a formal form of engagement, forming an informal declaration of the couple's intentions, and is read close to the start of the betrothal ceremony.\n\n"}

Some may hold strong anti-communist and anti-socialist positions and endorse neoliberal and pro-free market capitalist ideas in part due to the Prosperity Theology that many have. Some conspiracy theories like Cultural Marxism and New World Order may prove popular among its basis. They also tend to follow Christian Zionism and be strong supporters of Israel and support the moving of embassies of their countries to Jerusalem. \n\nSome have been describe also as supporters of the death penalty, \"hard hand\" on crime, Creationism (and opposition of teaching the scientific theories of Evolution and Big Bang on schools), corporal punishment for kids and harder laws for juvenile delinquents. Their most critical opponents signal them as having far-right, religious fundamentalist, theocratic, anti-democratic and authoritarian ideas wanting to replace democracy by theocracy.\n\nSimilar movements often interconnected or analogous according to some analysts are the Tea Party movement, the Christian right, the neo-nationalism, the alt-right and the conservative wave. \n\nRoman Catholics in Latin America tend to be more left-wing in economics due to the traditional teachings of the Catholic social doctrine and the Christian Democracy. Evangelical Christians on the other hand are mostly from the neo-Pentecostal movement and thus believers in the Prosperity Theology which justify most of their neoliberal economic ideas.\n\nProtestant missionary groups mainly from the Charismatic Movement originated in the Deep South of the United States were introduced deliberately as an strategy from Washington particularly during Republican administrations as a way to reduce the influence of left-leaning Catholic movements like Liberation Theology (which was popular among many far-left political parties and guerrillas) and the more moderate Christian socialist and Christian Democratic parties. According to Catholic blogger Jorge Rondón in his essay: \"La Expansión del Protestantismo Fue Parte del Plan de Guerra de la CIA para América del Sur\" (The Expansion of Protestantism Was Part of CIA War Plan for South America), US President Richard Nixon encouraged the introduction of Protestant missions after a 1969 memorandum received by then Vice President Nelson Rockefeller which stated: \"the Catholic church has ceased to be an ally in whom the U.S. can have confidence.\" Something confirmed by Wade Clark Roof in his book \"World Order and Religion\". Guatemalan archbishop Próspero Penados also blamed the US for encouraging and sponsor Evangelicalism in Guatemala for, according to him, more political than religious reasons arguing that: \"The diffusion of Protestantism in Guatemala is more part of an economic and political strategy\" to oppose the Catholic social justice doctrine. \n\nSeveral scandals involving the Catholic church, particularly those of sexual abuse, gravely affected the image of the institution causing an important drain of followers, some of which became irreligious, agnostics and atheist some went to other alternative religions like Buddhism, Islam and New religious movements, but a large segment of former Catholics, particularly those of more humble origins and lower classes, went into the Evangelical Churches, particularly those of neo-Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. Pentecostalism also became popular among the lower income classes and the most abandoned sectors of society specially those of very poor and periphreal areas who see the Churches ideas of economic growth through faith as an opportunity for social movility. In any case the growth of Evangelicals was quickly followed by their newly discovered political and electoral weight, with new forms of political activism and even the creation of specific political parties connected to their communities. Guatemalan dictator Efraín Ríos Montt was one of the first Evangelical Christians in attain power in Latin America's history.\n\nSome examples of these movements include the support from the Evangelical Christian community to Jimmy Morales (himself an Evangelical) in Guatemala, Juan Orlando Hernández in Honduras, Mauricio Macri in Argentina Sebastián Piñera in Chile The Evangelical opposition in the Colombian peace agreement referendum is considered for many pivotal in its rejection, as the Evangelical parties' support of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in Brazil. Countries with notorious conservative right-wing candidates supported by Evangelicals include Venezuela where pastor Javier Bertucci was the third more voted nominee, Costa Rica where preacher and Gospel singer Fabricio Alvarado went into the electoral run-off and Brazil where Evangelical Christians were pivotal in the triumph of Jair Bolsonaro. \n\nHowever, in some countries the alliance was with the left. The Authentic Renewal Organization is a Venezuelan Evangelical political party and member of the official Great Patriotic Pole of President Nicolás Maduro. Daniel Ortega was also supported by Evangelical pastors in Nicaragua and his wife and Vice President Rosario Murillo has links with Evangelical Churchers. The Social Encounter Party in Mexico it's also unofficially linked to the Mexican Evangelical Community (as the Mexican Constitution forbids the existence of confessional parties) and is a member of the \"Juntos Haremos Historia\" coalition that endorsed leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a move that brought out criticism as it was a coalition with two left-wing parties.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11638", "title": "Francis of Assisi", "text": "Francis of Assisi\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi (, ), born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone, informally named as Francesco (1181/11823 October 1226), was an Italian Catholic friar, deacon and preacher. He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the women's Order of Saint Clare, the Third Order of Saint Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land. Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in history.\n\nPope Gregory IX canonized Francis on 16 July 1228. Along with Saint Catherine of Siena, he was designated Patron saint of Italy. He later became associated with patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his feast day of 4 October. He is often remembered as the patron saint of animals. In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to convert the Sultan to put an end to the conflict of the Crusades. By this point, the Franciscan Order had grown to such an extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the Order. Once his community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from external affairs. Francis is also known for his love of the Eucharist. In 1223, Francis arranged for the first Christmas live nativity scene. According to Christian tradition, in 1224 he received the stigmata during the apparition of Seraphic angels in a religious ecstasy, which would make him the first person in Christian tradition to bear the wounds of Christ's Passion. He died during the evening hours of 3 October 1226, while listening to a reading he had requested of Psalm 142 (141).\n\nFrancis of Assisi was born in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several children of an Italian father, Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and a French mother, Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except that she was a noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis was born in Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco (\"the Frenchman\"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have had anything to do with his aptitude for learning French, as some have thought.\nIndulged by his parents, Francis lived the high-spirited life typical of a wealthy young man. As a youth, Francesco became a devotee of troubadours and was fascinated with all things Transalpine. He was handsome, witty, gallant, and delighted in fine clothes. He spent money lavishly. Although many hagiographers remark about his bright clothing, rich friends, and love of pleasures, his displays of disillusionment toward the world that surrounded him came fairly early in his life, as is shown in the \"story of the beggar\". In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for alms. At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets. His friends quickly chided and mocked him for his act of charity. When he got home, his father scolded him in rage.\n\nAround 1202, he joined a military expedition against Perugia and was taken as a prisoner at Collestrada, spending a year as a captive. An illness caused him to re-evaluate his life. It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for Apulia to enlist in the army of Walter III, Count of Brienne. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life. According to hagiographic accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, \"Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen\", meaning his \"Lady Poverty\". \n\nOn a pilgrimage to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at St. Peter's Basilica. He spent some time in lonely places, asking God for spiritual enlightenment. He said he had a mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the forsaken country chapel of San Damiano, just outside Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified said to him, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.\" He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose. When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.\n\nIn order to avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the Bishop of Assisi, Francis renounced his father and his patrimony.\nFor the next couple of months Francis wandered as a beggar in the hills behind Assisi. He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a penitent, during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the Porziuncola, the little chapel of St. Mary of the Angels in the plain just below the town. This later became his favorite abode. By degrees he took to nursing lepers, in the lazar houses near Assisi.\n\nOne morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the \"Commissioning of the Twelve\" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.\nHis example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a simple life in the deserted lazar house of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of Umbria, making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.\nIn 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (\"friars\"), the \"Regula primitiva\" or \"Primitive Rule\", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was \"To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps\". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from Pope Innocent III to found a new religious Order. Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company Giovanni di San Paolo, the Cardinal Bishop of Sabina. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was tonsured. This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the Waldensians decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the Basilica of St. John Lateran (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on April 16, 1210, and constituted the official founding of the Franciscan Order. The group, then the \"Lesser Brothers\" (\"Order of Friars Minor\" also known as the \"Franciscan Order\" or the \"Seraphic Order\"), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy. Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.\n\nFrom then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations. Hearing Francis preaching in the church of San Rufino in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman Clare of Assisi became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of Palm Sunday, March 28, 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies. This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a religious habit, or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of Benedictine nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, Caterina, and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano, to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as Poor Clares.\n\nFor those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance, a fraternity composed of either laity or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took religious vows. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives. Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the Secular Franciscan Order.\n\nDetermined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the Dalmatian coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On May 8, 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of La Verna (Alverna) as a gift from Count Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as “eminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind”.The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.\n\nIn the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain. Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them Tommaso da Celano, who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the Fourth Lateran Council, but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a canon, Dominic de Guzman (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the Friars Preachers, another Catholic religious order). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the Fifth Crusade where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of Damietta upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, al-Kamil, a nephew of Saladin, had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on August 29, 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks. It was most probably during this interlude that Francis and his companion crossed the Muslims lines and were brought before the Sultan, remaining in his camp for a few days. The visit is reported in contemporary Crusader sources and in the earliest biographies of Francis, but they give no information about what transpired during the encounter beyond noting that the Sultan received Francis graciously and that Francis preached to the Muslims without effect, returning unharmed to the Crusader camp. No contemporary Arab source mentions the visit. One detail, added by Bonaventure in the official life of Francis (written forty years after the event), has Francis offering to challenge the Sultan's \"priests\" to trial-by-fire in order to prove the veracity of the Christian Gospel.\n\nSuch an incident is alluded to in a scene in the late 13th-century fresco cycle, attributed to Giotto, in the upper basilica at Assisi. It has been suggested that the winged figures atop the columns piercing the roof of the building on the left of the scene are not idols (as Erwin Panofsky had proposed) but are part of the secular iconography of the sultan, affirming his worldly power which, as the scene demonstrates, is limited even as regards his own \"priests\" who shun the challenge. Although Bonaventure asserts that the sultan refused to permit the challenge, subsequent biographies went further, claiming that a fire was actually kindled which Francis unhesitatingly entered without suffering burns. The scene in the fresco adopts a position midway between the two extremes. Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912, many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for Acre, from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis. The Franciscan Order has been present in the Holy Land almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the Mameluke Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from Pope Clement VI in 1342.\n\nBy this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into provinces and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned to Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the \"First Rule\" or \"Rule Without a Papal Bull\" (\"Regula prima\", \"Regula non bullata\"), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.\n\nOn September 29, 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on March 10, 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.\n\nThe reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as Vicar of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the \"First Rule\", creating the \"Second Rule\" or \"Rule With a Bull\", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on November 29, 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars \"to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity\". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs. During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as Catania in Sicily and afterwards as far north as Bologna.\nWhile he was praying on the mountain of Verna, during a forty-day fast in preparation for Michaelmas (September 29), Francis is said to have had a vision on or about September 14, 1224, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, as a result of which he received the stigmata. Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. \"Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.\" Suffering from these stigmata and from trachoma, Francis received care in several cities (Siena, Cortona, Nocera) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where it all began, feeling the end approaching, he spent the last days of his life dictating his spiritual Testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, October 3, 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), \"Voce mea ad Dominum\".\n\nOn July 16, 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope Gregory IX (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. Francis was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by Pope Paul VI, and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.\n\nIt has been argued that no one else in history was as dedicated as Francis to imitate the life, and carry out the work of Christ, in Christ’s own way—. This is important in understanding Francis' character and his affinity for the Eucharist and respect for the priests who carried out the sacrament.\n\nHe and his followers celebrated and even venerated poverty. Poverty was so central to his character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle for the members of his Order.\n\nHe believed that nature itself was the mirror of God. He called all creatures his “brothers” and “sisters”, and even preached to the birds and supposedly persuaded a wolf to stop attacking some locals if they agreed to feed the wolf. In his \"Canticle of the Creatures\" (“Praises of Creatures” or “Canticle of the Sun”), he mentioned the “Brother Sun” and “Sister Moon”, the wind and water. His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that “he considered himself no friend of Christ if he did not cherish those for whom Christ died”.\n\nFrancis' visit to Egypt and attempted rapprochement with the Muslim world had far-reaching consequences, long past his own death, since after the fall of the Crusader Kingdom, it would be the Franciscans, of all Catholics, who would be allowed to stay on in the Holy Land and be recognized as \"Custodians of the Holy Land\" on behalf of the Catholic Church.\n\nAt Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas by setting up the first known \"presepio\" or \"crèche\" (Nativity scene). His nativity imagery reflected the scene in traditional paintings. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate the birth of the child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight. Both Thomas of Celano and Saint Bonaventure, biographers of Saint Francis, tell how he used only a straw-filled manger (feeding trough) set between a real ox and donkey. According to Thomas, it was beautiful in its simplicity, with the manger acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.\n\nFrancis preached the Christian doctrine that the world was created good and beautiful by God but suffers a need for redemption because of human sin. He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves. Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.\nAn incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the \"Fioretti\" (\"Little Flowers\"), a collection of legends and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\" The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.\n\nAnother legend from the \"Fioretti\" tells that in the city of Gubbio, where Francis lived for some time, was a wolf \"terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals\". Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.\n\n\"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil\", said Francis. \"All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.\" Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had “done evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.\n\nThree quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On November 29, 1979, Pope John Paul II declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology. During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder \"not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.\" The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, January 1, 1990, the saint of Assisi \"offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ...\" He went on to make the point that: \"As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation – animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon – to give honor and praise to the Lord. The poor man of Assisi gives us striking witness that when we are at peace with God we are better able to devote ourselves to building up that peace with all creation which is inseparable from peace among all peoples.\"\n\nSaint Pope John Paul II concluded that section of the document with these words, \"It is my hope that the inspiration of Saint Francis will help us to keep ever alive a sense of 'fraternity' with all those good and beautiful things which Almighty God has created.\"\n\nSaint Francis' feast day is observed on October 4. A secondary feast in honor of the stigmata received by Saint Francis, celebrated on September 17, was inserted in the General Roman Calendar in 1585 (later than the Tridentine Calendar) and suppressed in 1604, but was restored in 1615. In the New Roman Missal of 1969, it was removed again from the General Calendar, as something of a duplication of the main feast on October 4, and left to the calendars of certain localities and of the Franciscan Order. Wherever the traditional Roman Missal is used, however, the feast of the Stigmata remains in the General Calendar. \n\nOn June 18, 1939, Pope Pius XII named Francis a joint Patron Saint of Italy along with Saint Catherine of Siena with the apostolic letter \"Licet Commissa\". Pope Pius also mentioned the two saints in the laudative discourse he pronounced on May 5, 1949, in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva.\n\nSaint Francis is honored in the Church of England, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Episcopal Church USA, the Old Catholic Churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and other churches and religious communities on October 4. The Evangelical Church in Germany, however, commemorates Saint Francis' feast day on his death day, October 3.\n\nOn 14 March 2013, upon his election as Pope, Archbishop and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, becoming Pope Francis.\n\nAt his first audience on 16 March 2013, Pope Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cláudio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, \"Don't forget the poor\", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that “He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history.\" Bergoglio's selection of his papal name is the first time that a pope has been named \"Francis\".\nSt. Francis is the patron of Animals, Merchants & Ecology. He is also considered the patron saint: against dying alone; patron saint against fire; patron saint of animal welfare societies; patron saint of animals; patron saint of Assisi, Italy; patron saint of birds; patron saint of Catholic Action; patron saint of Colorado; patron saint of Denver, Colorado, archdiocese of; patron saint of ecologists; patron saint of ecology; patron saint of environment; patron saint of environmentalism; patron saint of environmentalists; patron saint of families; patron saint of Franciscan Order; patron saint of Freising, Germany; patron saint of Italy; patron saint of Kottapuram, India, diocese of; patron saint of lace makers; patron saint of lace workers; patron saint of Lancaster, England, diocese of; patron saint of Massa, Italy; patron saint of merchants; patron saint of Metuchen, New Jersey, diocese of; patron saint of Nambe Indian Pueblo; patron saint of needle workers; patron saint of peace; patron saint of Quibdo, Choco, Colombia; patron saint of Salina, Kansas, diocese of; patron saint of San Francisco, California, archdiocese of; patron saint of San Pawl il-Bahar, Malta; patron saint of Santa Fe, New Mexico; patron saint of Santa Fe, New Mexico, archdiocese of; patron saint of Sorbo, Italy ; patron saint of tapestry workers; patron saint of zoos.\n\nInformally, Ordnance disposal also consider St. Francis a patron saint, since if the person is killed by an explosion, there is frequently little left of the body but strips of flesh that are later devoured by birds.\n\nEven in Protestantism, the name and legacy of Saint Francis have endured.\n\n\nFor a complete list, see \"The Franciscan Experience\".\n\nSaint Francis is considered the first Italian poet by literary critics. He believed commoners should be able to pray to God in their own language, and he wrote often in the dialect of Umbria instead of Latin.

Gospel magic does not claim to invoke spirits or paranormal powers. Gospel magic is intended to present the Christian good news through \"visual parables\"; the trick or illusion is used to present theological points in an entertaining way with the intention that people will remember the message. Gospel magic is generally presented as stage magic or platform magic, but it can be adapted to close-up magic or micromagic situations.\n\nThe first modern use of Gospel magic is in the ministry of the Italian Catholic priest Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco (Don Bosco, 1815-1888). His autobiography lists many dozens of magic tricks used for the purpose of offering religious instruction to children and youth.\nDon Bosco has been seen as the Patron Saint of Catholic Magicians and, specifically, Catholic Gospel Magicians.\n\nIn 1910, C. H. Woolston published \"Seeing Truth: Object Lessons with Magical and Mechanical Effects\" which aimed to help adults working with children in church. Other texts were soon written that incorporated Gospel messages with magic.\n\nIn 1953, the International Fellowship of Christian Magicians began in the USA. This rapidly spread the use of the creative arts to teach the Gospel. Many Gospel Performers, dealers and authors made their first attempts at magic under their tuition. There are now chapters in many US and Canadian cities as well as in the UK, Germany and Hong Kong. An International magazine is published \"The Voice of the FCM \"every two months. Annual Conventions are held in USA, UK and Germany.\n\nThe word \"magic\" never appears in the Bible. Daniel is called the \"chief of the magicians\" or \"master of the magicians.\" Daniel 4:9 The Bible condemns sorcery, astrology, speaking to spirits and witchcraft, but never does it condemn \"magic.\"\n\nThe arts have long been used to present Christian teachings. Icons, parables, music, song, dance, poetry, sculpture, painting, stained glass, theater, radio, film, television, the Internet, stage magic and illusion have all been used. Today this often includes story-telling, drama, puppetry, ventriloquism, balloon-modelling and juggling.\n\n\n\nThese books are based on the Tarbell Course, a standard for stage magicians pre-World War II. It was originally intended to be expanded to cover all eight-volumes in the Tarbell Series, but Miller died before this project was completed.

In 2000 he founded the Helly Nahmad Gallery in Manhattan, New York, which holds several fine art exhibitions each year featuring artists such as Pablo Picasso, Chaim Soutine, Francis Bacon, and Giorgio de Chirico.\n\nIn 2018, Nahmad sold Picasso's \"Young Girl with a Flower Basket\" painting for $115 million. The painting will go on loan to Musée d'Orsay in Paris. \n\nHillel \"Helly\" Nahmad was born circa 1978. The son of art dealer David Nahmad, his extended family had developed a reputation as art collectors and dealers \"predominantly in 19th- and 20th-century art\" out of countries such as Italy and Monaco. Nahmad spent his childhood in Manhattan, New York and at a young age would shadow his father to fine art galleries, auctions, and museums. His father recollects that Nahmad was \"scoping out antiques at Sotheby’s auctions\" by five years of age, developing a fascination with artists such as Claude Monet by the age of twelve. His younger brother, Joe, would also go on to be active in art. Nahmad interned in the Jewish Museum in the summers and attended the private Dalton School in New York's Upper East Side. According to a former school official, he was expelled in his senior year for \"unclear\" reasons. Nahmad has refuted this retelling and states he missed school while traveling and turned down an opportunity to repeat his senior year. He graduated from Beekman High School Manhattan. He attended part of an art course at Christie's in 1997.\n\nIn 2000 he purchased the Davlyn Gallery and changed the name to the Helly Nahmad Gallery. The gallery since the 1990s has been located in the Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Nahmad’s gallery would go on to host several fine art exhibitions at the gallery per year, starting with the \"Sounds of Colours\" exhibition in 2004, which displayed the works of Wassily Kandinsky. The following year the gallery held two major exhibitions, a retrospective on Fernand Léger and a celebration of the work of Amedeo Modigliani. In 2006 and 2007 his gallery held both a Max Ernst and a Pablo Picasso exhibition, followed by a second Picasso exhibition titled \"Picasso's Bodegones\" in 2008. Also in 2008, the gallery held an exhibition that collected the works of Gustave Moreau. The Helly Nahmad Gallery New York then oversaw the display of a Jean Dubuffet collection and an Alexander Calder retrospective in 2009. In 2010 the gallery curated a Sam Francis exhibition.\n\nThrough May and into June 2011, the exhibition \"Soutine/Bacon\" was held at the Helly Nahmad Gallery, and was described by \"ArtDaily\" as \"the first comparative exhibition of Chaim Soutine and Francis Bacon.\" Works were lent from institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, the Bacon Foundation, the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Albertina, the Beyeler Foundation, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, the Kunsthaus Zurich, and the Pearlman Foundation. Also in 2011, the gallery held an exhibition on paintings by Alexander Calder.\n\nBy the spring of 2013, Nahmad had overseen the gallery's display of \"name-brand Modernists\" such as Jean Dubuffet, Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, Wassily Kandinsky and Francis Bacon. The gallery premiered a new show in April 2013 titled \"Impressionist & Modern Masters.\" Described by \"Bloomberg\" as \"an exhibition of modern and postwar artists including Joan Miro, Alexander Calder, Jean Dubuffet and Fernand Leger,\" it was open to the public and also featured works by Mark Rothko and Wayne Thiebaud. Nahmad's gallery pulled in $70 million in sales for 2013, with Nahmad attending auctions such as Christie's. \n\nIn November 2013, Nahmad pled guilty to one federal count of operating an illegal sports gambling business. As part of the plea deal, he agreed to forfeit around $6.4 million and a Raoul Dufy painting, \" Carnaval à Nice\", to the United States, with other charges such as money laundering, racketeering, and fraud dropped by prosecutors. Sentenced on April 30, 2014, he was released after four months of a 12-month sentence at the Otisville Federal Correctional Institution, also paying a $30,000 fine and taking part in drug testing, community service, and a gambling addiction program upon release. \n\nAfter the May 2015 premiere of its exhibit \"The Wounded Canvas: Burri Fontana Manzoni Tàpies\", Nahmad represented his gallery at the Art Basel art fair in Basel, Switzerland in June 2015. Among other pieces, his booth included three Pablo Picasso paintings including \"Les Femmes d’Alger (Version C), 28 Décembre, 1954\" for $16 million. Stating to the \"New York Times\" that over the past year collectors had been investing more in \"dead and late- and mid-career artists,\" Nahmad also selected works by Alexander Calder, Claude Monet, Joan Miró, and Mark Rothko. At USD$50 million, \"Art News\" related that the 1955 Rothko was \"almost certainly the most expensive work in the fair.\" From November 4, 2015 through January 2016, the Helly Nahmad Gallery in New York ran the \"Mnemosyne: de Chirico and Antiquity\" exhibition, which displayed \"Giorgio de Chirico’s surrealist 20th century works together with Greek and Roman antiquities\" such as ancient statues and Greek vases. For the show, Nahmad partnered with antiquities dealer Phoenix Ancient Art to curate a collection of pieces from private collections. \"Blouin Artinfo\" wrote that the show was \"an aesthetic move that matches de Chirico’s Neo-classical style, a later and less explored side of his work.\" \n\nIn 2011, Philippe Meastracci, the heir of art dealer Oscar Stettiner, filed suit in United States district court against the Helly Nahmad Gallery in New York for title to the 1918 Modigliani painting \"Seated Man with a Cane\", which was estimated to have a value of $25 million. Maestracci claimed that the painting, which had been sold in 1996 through Christie's for $3.2 million, had been looted from Stettiner in Paris during World War II. The complaint was withdrawn in 2012. In November 2015, Stettiner's estate filed an amended complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York again seeking title to \"Seated Man with a Cane\" from various Nahmad family members and the Helly Nahmad Gallery in New York. Arbitration was ongoing as of April 2016, with the defendants arguing that the painting had been legally purchased in good faith from Christie's, that Stettiner's claim of ownership was unproven, and that the Stettiner estate's case was bankrolled by individuals with a financial conflict of interest. In 2016, Nahmad’s gallery organized and held the exhibition \"Selected Works by 20th Century Masters.\" That December at Art Basel, Nahmad sold the painting \"Made in Japan I\" by Jean-Michel Basquiat for $15 million. Several days later \"Bloomberg\" described the transaction as \"the highest price so far at the event.\"\n\nNahmad resides in New York City, where he has owned property in Trump Tower in Manhattan, with a complete floor of purchased over a decade for over $18 million.\n"}
{"id": "4342452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4342452", "title": "High Priest of Israel", "text": "High Priest of Israel\n\nHigh priest ( \"kohen gadol\"; with definite article \"ha'kohen ha'gadol\", \"the\" high priest; Aramaic \"kahana rabba\") was the title of the chief religious official of Judaism from the early post-Exilic times until the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Previously, in the Israelite religion including the time of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, other terms were used to designate the leading priests; however, as long as a king was in place, the supreme ecclesiastical authority lay with him. The official introduction of the term \"high priest\" went hand in hand with a greatly enhanced ritual and political significance bestowed upon the chief priest in the post-Exilic period, certainly from 411 BCE onward, after the religious transformations brought about by the Babylonian captivity and due to the lack of a Jewish king and kingdom.\n\nThe high priests belonged to the Jewish priestly families that trace their paternal line back to Aaron, the first high priest of Israel in the Hebrew Bible and elder brother of Moses, through Zadok, a leading priest at the time of David and Solomon. This tradition came to an end in the 2nd century BCE during the rule of the Hasmoneans, when the position was occupied by other priestly families unrelated to Zadok.\n\nEven though Aaron was the first high priest mentioned in the Book of Exodus, the legendary passage revealed the first man assumed the title of high priest of God is Enoch who was succeeded by Methuselah, Lamech, Noah, Shem (or Melchizedek), Abraham, Isaac, and Levi.\n\nAaron, though he is but rarely called \"the great priest\", being generally simply designated as \"ha-kohen\" (the priest), was the first incumbent of the office, to which he was appointed by God (Book of Exodus ; ).\n\nThe succession was to be through one of his sons, and was to remain in his own family (). If he had no son, the office devolved upon the brother next of age: such appears to have been the practise in the Hasmonean period. In the time of Eli, however (), the office passed to the collateral branch of Ithamar (see Eleazar). But King Solomon is reported to have deposed the high priest Abiathar, and to have appointed Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, in his stead (; ). After the Exile, the succession seems to have been, at first, in a direct line from father to son; but later the civil authorities arrogated to themselves the right of appointment. Antiochus IV Epiphanes for instance, deposed Onias III in favor of Jason, who was followed by Menelaus.\n\nHerod the Great nominated no less than six high priests; Archelaus, two. The Roman legate Quirinius and his successors exercised the right of appointment, as did Agrippa I, Herod of Chalcis, and Agrippa II. Even the people occasionally elected candidates to the office. The high priests before the Exile were, it seems, appointed for life; in fact, from Aaron to the Captivity the number of the high priests was not greater than during the sixty years preceding the fall of the Second Temple.\n\nThe age of eligibility for the office is not fixed in the Law; but according to rabbinical tradition it was twenty. Aristobulus, however, was only seventeen when appointed by Herod; but the son of Onias III was too young (νηπιος) to succeed his father.\nThe age a Levite entered the priesthood was 30 years of age (Numbers 4:3,30).\n\nLegitimacy of birth was essential; hence the care in the keeping of the genealogical records and the distrust of one whose mother had been captured in war. The high priest had to abstain from ritual defilement. He may marry only an Israelite virgin (). In this restriction is extended to all kohanim (priests), an exception being made in favor of the widow of a priest (see Levirate marriage). According to He was not permitted to come in contact with the bodies of the dead, not even for his parents (regular priests could become unclean for the death of an immediate relative) ; and he was not permitted, as a sign of mourning, to leave his hair disheveled, to expose it, or to rend his garments ( et seq.). According to Josephus, birth on foreign soil was not a disqualification; but the disqualifications of et seq. applied to the high priest as well as to other priests.\n\nThe Torah provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the Tabernacle: \"And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty\" (). These garments are described in detail in , and . The high priest wore eight holy garments (\"bigdei kodesh\"). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests, and four were unique to the Kohen Gadol.\n\nThose vestments which were common to all priests, were:\n\nThe vestments that were unique to the high priest were:\n\nThe high priest, like all priests, would minister barefoot when he was serving in the Temple. Like all of the priests, he had to immerse himself in the ritual bath before vesting and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The Talmud teaches that neither the kohanim nor the Kohen Gadol were fit to minister unless they wore their priestly vestments: \"While they are clothed in the priestly garments, they are clothed in the priesthood; but when they are not wearing the garments, the priesthood is not upon them\" (B.Zevachim 17:B). It is further taught that just as the sacrifices facilitate an atonement for sin, so do the priestly garments (B.Zevachim 88b). The high priest had two sets of holy garments: the \"golden garments\" detailed above, and a set of white \"linen garments\" (\"bigdei ha-bad\") which he wore only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) (). On that day, he would change his holy garments four times, beginning in the golden garments but changing into the Linen Garments for the two moments when he would enter the Holy of Holies (the first time to offer the blood of atonement and the incense, and the second time to retrieve the censer), and then change back again into the golden garments after each time. He would immerse in the ritual bath before each change of garments, washing his hands and his feet after removing the garments and again before putting the other set on. The linen garments were only four in number, those corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.\n\nThe ceremonial of consecration, extending through an entire week (-; ), included certain rites which all priests were required to undergo: purification; the sacrifices; the \"filling\" of the hands; the smearing with blood. But Aaron the high priest was anointed with sacred oil, hence the title of the \"anointed priest\"; other passages have it that all priests were anointed (, ; , ; ).\n\nThe first consecration was performed by Moses; the Bible does not state who consecrated subsequent high priests. states emphatically that every new high priest shall be anointed; and et seq. commands that the official garments worn by his predecessor shall be worn by the new incumbent while he is anointed and during the seven days of his consecration (comp. ; Psalm 133:2).\n\nThe distinguished rank of the high priest is apparent from the fact that his sins are regarded as belonging also to the people (Lev. iv. 3, 22). He was entrusted with the stewardship of the Urim and Thummim (Num. xxvii. 20 et seq.). On Yom Kippur he alone entered the Holy of Holies, to make atonement for his house and for the people (Lev. xvi). He alone could offer the sacrifices for the sins of the priests, or of the people, or of himself (Lev. iv.); and only he could officiate at the sacrifices following his own or another priest's consecration (Lev. ix.). He also offered a meal- offering every morning and evening for himself and the whole body of the priesthood (Lev. vi. 14-15, though the wording of the law is not altogether definite). Other information concerning his functions is not given. Though other priests would serve only when it was their week on rotation and on feast days (and even then their function was decided by lot), he was privileged to take part at his own pleasure in any of the priestly rites at any time. Josephus contends that the high priest almost invariably participated in the ceremonies on Shabbat, the New Moon, and the festivals. This may also be inferred from the glowing description given in the Wisdom of Sirach i. of the high priest's appearance at the altar.\n\nThe high priest is the chief of all the priests; he should be anointed and invested with the pontifical garments; but if the sacred oil is not obtainable, investiture with the additional garments (see Biblical Data, above) is regarded as sufficient. A high priest so invested is known as \"merubbeh begadim.\" This investiture consists of arraying him in the eight pieces of dress and in removing them again on eight successive days, though (the anointing and) the investiture on the first day suffices to qualify him for the functions of the office. The only distinction between the \"anointed\" and the \"invested\" high priest is that the former offers the bull for an unintentional transgression.\n\nThe Great Sanhedrin alone had the right to appoint, or confirm the appointment of, the high priest. His consecration might take place only in the day-time. Two high priests must not be appointed together. Every high priest had a \"mishneh\" (a second) called the Segan, or \"memunneh\", to stand at his right; another assistant was the \"Catholicos\" (\"Yad\", l.c. 16–17). The right of succession was in the direct, or, the direct failing, the collateral, line, provided the conditions concerning physical fitness were fulfilled (ib. 20; Ket. 103b; Sifra, Ḳedoshim).\n\nFor offenses which entailed flagellation the high priest could be sentenced by a court of three; after submitting to the penalty he could resume his office (\"Yad\", l.c. 22). The high priest was expected to be superior to all other priests in physique, in wisdom, in dignity, and in material wealth; if he was poor his brother priests contributed to make him rich (Yoma 18a; \"Yad\", l.c. v. 1); but none of these conditions was indispensable.\n\nThe high priest was required to be mindful of his honor. He might not mingle with the common people, nor permit himself to be seen disrobed, or in a public bath, etc.; but he might invite others to bathe with him (Tosef., Sanh. iv.; \"Yad\", l.c. v. 3). He might not participate in a public banquet, but he might pay a visit of consolation to mourners, though even then his dignity was guarded by prescribed etiquette (Sanh. 18–19; \"Yad\", l.c. v. 4).\n\nThe high priest might not follow the bier of one in his own family who had died, nor leave the Temple or his house during the time of mourning. The people visited him to offer consolation; in receiving them, the Segan was at his right, the next in rank and the people at his left. The people said: \"We are thy atonement.\" He answered: \"Be ye blessed from heaven\" (\"Yad\", l.c. v. 5; and Mishneh Kesef, ad loc.). During the offering of consolation he sat on a stool, the people on the floor; he rent his garments, not from above, but from below, near the feet, the penalty for rending them from above being flagellation (Semag, Lawin, 61-62). He could not permit his hair to be disheveled, nor could he cut it (\"Yad\", l.c. v. 6). He had one house attached to the Temple (Mid. 71b), and another in the city of Jerusalem. His honor required that he should spend most of his time in the Sanctuary (\"Yad\", l.c. v. 7). The high priest was subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, but if accused of a crime entailing capital punishment he was tried by the Great Sanhedrin; he could, however, refuse to give testimony (Sanh. 18).\n\nThe high priest must be married, and \"should only marry a virgin\"; to guard against contingencies it was proposed to hold a second wife in readiness immediately before the Day of Atonement (Yoma i. 1); but polygamy on his part was not encouraged ( = \"one wife\"; Yoma 13a; \"Yad\", l.c. v. 10). He could give the \"halizah\", and it could be given to his widow, as she also was subject to the Levirate; his divorced wife could marry again (l.c.; Sanh. 18). When entering the Temple (\"Hekal\") he was supported to the curtain by three men (Tamid 67a; this may perhaps have reference to his entering the Holy of Holies; but see \"Yad\", l.c. v. 11, and the Mishneh Kesef ad loc.). He could take part in the service whenever he desired (\"Yad\", l.c. v. 12; Yoma i. 2; Tamid 67b; see Rashi ad loc.). On the Day of Atonement only he wore white garments, while on other occasions he wore his golden vestments (Yoma 60a; comp. 68b, ). The seven days preceding the Day of Atonement were devoted to preparing for his high function, precautions being taken to prevent any accident that might render him Levitically impure (Yoma i. 1 et seq.). The ceremonial for that day is described in detail in Mishnah Yoma (see also Haneberg, \"Die Religiösen Alterthümer der Bibel\", pp. 659–671, Munich, 1869). For other regulations concerning the high priest see \"Yad\", Biat ha-Miḳdash, ii. 1, 8; for details in regard to the vestments see \"Yad\", Kele ha-Miḳdash, viii. 2-4, 5 (in reference to soiled vestments: the white could be worn only once); l.c. vii. 1 (\"ẓiẓ\"), vii. 3 (\"me'il\"), vii. 6 (\"ḥoshen\"), vii. 9 (ephod), ix.\n\nJosephus enumerates only fifty-two pontificates under the Second Temple, omitting the second appointments of Hyrcanus II, Hananeel, and Joazar.\n\nAfter the Babylonian Exile, Joshua appears vested with the prominence that the Priestly source (P) ascribes to the high priest (Zech. iii.; Hag. vi. 13). The post-exilic high priests traced their pedigree back to Zadok, appointed as chief priest at Jerusalem by Solomon (I Kings ii. 35), and Zadok was held to be a descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron (II Chron. v. 34). Immediately after the return from the Captivity, as is clearly to be inferred from Zechariah and Haggai, political authority was not vested in the high priest. Political (Messianic) sovereignty was represented by, or attributed to, a member of the royal house, while religious affairs were reserved to the high-priesthood, represented in the Book of Zechariah by Joshua. But in the course of time, as the Messianic hope, or even the hope of autonomy under foreign (Persian, Greek, Egyptian,or Syrian) suzerainty became weaker, the high priest also became a political chief of the congregation, as much, perhaps, through the consideration shown him by the suzerain powers and their viceroys as through the effect of the increasingly thorough acceptance of the Levitical code by pious Judeans. The rigorists received Alcimus, the high priest, with confidence because he was \"a priest of the seed of Aaron.\" (I Macc. vii. 14)\n\nThe assumption of the princely authority by the Maccabean high priests (the Hasmoneans) was merely the final link in this development, which, beginning with the death of Zerubbabel, was to combine the two ideals, the politico-Messianic and the religio-Levitical, in one office. But after the brief heyday of national independence had come to an inglorious close, the high-priesthood changed again in character, insofar as it ceased to be a hereditary and a life office. High priests were appointed and removed with great frequency (see above). This may account for the otherwise strange use of the title in the plural (ἀρχιερεῖς) in the New Testament and in Josephus (\"Vita\", § 38; \"B. J.\" ii. 12, § 6; iv. 3, §§ 7, 9; iv. 4, § 3). The deposed high priests seem to have retained the title, and to have continued to exercise certain functions; the ministration on the Day of Atonement, however, may have been reserved for the actual incumbent. This, however, is not clear; Hor. iii. 1–4 mentions as distinctive the exclusive sacrifice of a bull by the high priest on the Day of Atonement and the tenth of the ephah (that is, the twelve \"ḥallot\"; comp. Meg. i. 9; Macc. ii. 6). But even in the latest periods the office was restricted to a few families of great distinction (probably the \"bene kohanim gedolim\", \"[members of] high-priestly families\"; Ket. xiii. 1-2; Oh. xvii. 5; comp. Josephus, \"B. J.\" vi. 2, § 2; see Schürer, \"Gesch.\" 3d ed., ii. 222). 001\n\nThe high priest was the presiding officer of the Sanhedrin. This view conflicts with the later Jewish tradition according to which the Pharisee \"tannaim\" (the \"Zugot\") at the head of the \"yeshivot\" presided over the great Sanhedrin also (Ḥag. ii. 2). However, a careful reading of the sources (\"Ant.\" xx. 10; \"Contra Ap.\" ii., § 22; comp. \"Ant.\" iv. 8, § 14; xiv. 9, §§ 3–5 [Hyrcanus II. as president]; xx. 9, § 1 [Ananus]), as well as the fact that in the post-Maccabean period the high priest was looked upon as exercising in all things, political, legal, and sacerdotal, the supreme authority, shows it to be almost certain that the presidency of the Sanhedrin was vested in the high priest (see Isidore Loeb in \"R. E. J.\" 1889, xix. 188–201; Jelski, \"Die Innere Einrichtung des Grossen Synhedrions\", pp. 22–28, according to whom the \"Nasi\" was the high priest, while the \"Av Beth Din\" was a Pharisaic \"tanna\").\n\nIn Christian tradition, Jesus is symbolically consecrated as eternal high priest \"after the order of Melchizedek\" () in light of his eternal intercession with God. The position of high priest of Israel was abolished with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, so Jesus' assumption of the title of high priest served as a symbolic continuation of the priesthood. Melchizedek is never identified explicitly as a \"high priest\" (כהן גדול) in the Hebrew Bible, but a \"priest of the most high God\" (כהן לאל עליון, ); the Aaronic high priesthood had not yet been established (Aaron is also never explicitly identified as \"high priest\"). Jesus is nevertheless identified in Hebrews as a \"high priest (ἀρχιερεύς) after the order of Melchizedek.\" The use of Melchizedek as a type of Christ is significant because Melchizedek was ordained a priest despite not being related to Aaron. As Jesus was not a descendant of Aaron, he would not normally have been eligible to serve as high priest; the \"order of Melchizedek\" emphasizes the precedent for his claim to priesthood.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40351271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40351271", "title": "History of the Jews in Ecuador", "text": "History of the Jews in Ecuador\n\nEcuadorian Jews are a small Jewish community in the territory of today's Ecuador. They form one of the smallest Jewish communities in South America.\n\nIn 1580 occurs in the Iberian peninsula union of the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, and King Philip II of Spain is the only heir to the throne of that kingdom. Many Portuguese \"suspicious of their faith\" begin to enter the Viceroyalty of Peru by the newly founded city in which surveillance Inquisition was weaker. The first Jews start arriving in Ecuador in the 16th and 17th centuries. Then union of the kingdoms lasts until 1640, when the Portuguese revolt against the Spanish monarchy and the Duke of Braganza, under the name of John IV, took the throne of the kingdom of Portugal. But they were sixty years during which Spanish America was under one crown, and for them, a large number of Christians grew from new Portuguese to the Spanish dominions domains. So to say that someone was \"Portuguese\" was synonymous with \"converted Jew\".\n\nThe inquisitorial actions achieved the effect of terrorizing the families of new Christians and encourage them to migrate to other regions of the Peruvian viceroyalty and preferably to those where there were no courts of the Inquisition. Luckily, the Viceroyalty of Peru was extremely large and there were still large territorial areas in which the Inquisition was not present, so persecuted fugitives or symbol (heretics, Judaizing, dogmatists, bigamous and etc.) could relatively easily be hidden away from the major urban centers and especially camouflaging to hide his true personal and group identity.\n\nIt was so \"new Christians\" settled in the Viceroyalty of Peru migrated from its center to the less populated and controlled outdoor areas, particularly towards the southern and northern Chile Audience of Quito . Regarding those who marched to Quito, the new diaspora took first to the Interior Juan Salinas and Loyola (later transformed into the township of Loja), which, according to studies by Ricardo Ordoñez Chiriboga, was an important center of filing Sephardim. Subsequently, many of these families migrated further north to the next judges of Cuenca, and then to the northernmost township of Chimborazo (Alausí, Pallatanga and Chimborazo), always looking away from the powerful and cruel inquisitorial arm. Early Sephardic Jews probably arrived in Cuenca and its nearby settlements between the late sixteenth century and early seventeenth, but seem to have been new waves of Jewish migration to the area in later times. But we can not deny the possibility that other Sephardim, had been established in the colonial territory since the early days of the Spanish conquest, as they seem to show the names of conquerors arrived with Benalcázar Sebastian and Pedro de Alvarado . In the seventeenth century appear new landowners of these are uncertain origin with surnames Saavedra, Hadaad and Iglesias that encamped in the council of Cuenca. They also reached the northern Peruvian Andes, due to cultural and ethnic influences of the place was not defined by colonial boundaries, much less what it is today; this cultural-historical unit comes even from pre-Columbian times.\n\nAll aforementioned largely explains the Sephardic presence in gold and commercial areas of Quito and Calacalí such as Loja, Zaruma, Cuenca, Santa Isabel, Yungilla, Tarquí, Chordeleg and Sígsig, and mountain passes or centers of trade routes between Guayaquil and Quito, as Alausí Chapacoto, Chimborazo St. Joseph, San Miguel de Chimborazo and Guaranda and in the northern highlands of Peru, due to its proximity. This presence of Western Sephardim Jews remained hidden for years in Ecuador and also settled in villages so remote sites as the Judaism practiced only in secret at home. Most of these Crypto-Jews still speak Ladino. Some say that Antonio José de Sucre, a leader in the struggle for independence in South America, and the hero of Ecuador, who served both as president of Peru (short term) and as president of Bolivia, is a descendant of those Jews. Certain family names among established Ecuadorian families attest to their Sephardi ancestry and Crypto-Jews; however, prior to World War II there was very little active Jewish immigration to Ecuador.\n\nSephardic names in Ecuador Navon, wise; Moreno , teacher; Gabay, official; Piedra, stone; Amzalag, jeweler; Saban, soap; Nagar, carpenter; Haddad, blacksmith; Hakim, medic.\n\nIn 1904 there were only four Jewish families in the country, and a survey in 1917 indicated the presence of 14 Jews. After 1924, when the United States established its immigration quota system, a handful more arrived in Ecuador. Yet, only in the wake of the rise of Nazism and the ensuing Holocaust in Europe did the Jewish mass immigration to Ecuador began. During the years 1933-43 about 2,700 Jews arrived, and by 1945 there were 3,000 new Jewish immigrants, 85% of whom were refugees from Europe.\n\nIn the early years of World War II, Ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants, and in 1939, when several South American countries refused to accept the 165 Jewish refugees from Germany aboard the ship \"Koenigstein,\" Ecuador granted them entry permits. Nevertheless, the country eventually gave way to a policy of selectivity. Jewish immigration to Ecuador were supposed to be employed in the agricultural realm, but the authorities soon surmised that the immigrants were actually merchants, industrialists, and businessmen, and were not farming. As a result, in 1938 legislation was passed compelling any Jew not engaged in agriculture or industry to leave the country. In addition, entry rights were limited to those Jews who possessed a minimum of $400, which they would have to invest in an industrial project.\n\nIn 1935 the Comite pour l'Etude de l'Industrie de l'Immigration dans la Republique de l'Equateur was established in Paris by the organization, the Freeland League of Jewish Colonization, with the purpose of creating a settlement program in Ecuador. An agreement was reached with the Ecuadorian government to transfer 500,000 acres of land to the Committee's jurisdiction for a period of 30 years to be settled by immigrants regardless of race, religion, or nationality. Several concessions were also promised, such as tax exemption for three years, citizenship after one year, customs exemption, and free transportation by train from the port to the interior of the country. The president signed the agreement several months later on the condition that a detailed program be presented by May 1937 and that the Committee invest $8,000 and settle at least 100 families. Some Jewish organizations, however, found the land proposed for the plan unacceptable, claiming that it was too far from population centers and that the climate was too severe. The result of these objections was the total abandonment of the project.\n\nFollowing this attempt, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and HICEM attempted to establish chicken farms for the immigrants in other areas of Ecuador, and 60 families were settled, but conditions precluded any success in the venture, which ultimately failed. Most of the immigrants were businessmen and professionals who preferred to carry on their professions. Many discovered that the native balsa wood was excellent for furniture craft and began production. Later, these immigrants introduced iron and steel furniture to the Ecuadorian market, previously unknown to the country. They also developed retail stores and opened hotels. The success of the immigrants, however, caused tension among the Syrian and Cuban community who had previously controlled those fields of business. This pressure led to an anti-Jewish sentiment for a while, but nothing more substantial.\n\nIn 1940 there were 3,000 Jews in Ecuador, the vast majority refugees from Germany. Jews in Ecuador entered the press, medicine industry and commerce. They established textile factories, pharmaceutical factories and important furniture factories.\n\nAt its peak, in 1950, the Jewish population of Ecuador was estimated at 4,000 persons, the majority living in Quito, several hundred in Guayaquil, and several scores in Ambato, Riobamba, and Cuenca. In 1952, a law was passed requiring every foreigner to supply proof that he was engaged in the occupation stipulated in his entry visa. The World Jewish Congress tried to help those Jews who were practicing business, but were only supposed to be in the agricultural sector; however, attempts at agricultural settlement were unsuccessful.\n\nEcuador's government policies regarding Jewish emigration were historically tentative and volatile: in 1935, for example, it gave the Jews permission to settle in an area of about 20,000 square kilometers, and on the other hand, in 1938, the government issued an order that all the Jewish residents that are not working in agriculture or are not capable to develop the industry would need to leave the country.\n\nThe Jewish community today lives in two major cities: Quito and Guayaquil. The community is about 290 people. The Jewish community of Ecuador is predominantly of German origin, but the younger generation is Spanish-speaking. The Ecuadorian Jewish community is a homogeneous group, a fact which has facilitated great communal organization. The Asociacion de Beneficencia Israelita, founded in 1938, is the central body for religious and cultural affairs. Other organizations in the country are the Zionist Federation, B'nai B'rith, Wizo, and Maccabi. A bilingual Spanish-German bulletin, Informaciones, is published by the community. Intermarriage is not as great of a problem in Ecuador as elsewhere since Jews form a separate middle-stratum between the upper, traditionally Catholic classes, and the lower classes of the indigenous population.\n\nThere is a Jewish school in Quito, the Colegio Experimental Alberto Einstein, established in 1973, which serves both Jewish and non-Jewish students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. All Jewish holidays are celebrated by the school, and Hebrew and other Jewish studies are taught there. The school has an excellent reputation and superb pre-college preparatory program. The Jewish community of Quito has its own building, a home for the aged, and a synagogue that holds services on the Sabbath and holidays.\n\nEcuador has traditionally maintained friendly relations with Israel, and has frequently supported Israel in the United Nations. The Ecuadorian Embassy is in Tel Aviv . In the late 1960s, a network of technical cooperation and assistance was developed between the two countries, especially in the fields of agriculture, and water development. Since 1948, 137 Ecuadorian Jews have emigrated to Israel.\n\nEcuadorian Jews have achieved prominence in various fields including academics, industry, and science. Benno Weiser (Benjamin Varon), who was an active Ecuadorian journalism, later entered the Israel diplomatic service and served in various Latin American countries. His brother, Max Weiser, was the first Israel consul in Ecuador. Moselio Schaechter a researcher involved studying bacterial growth and cell division.\n\nIn the industrial field, where Jews played an especially important role, the names Rothschild and Seligmann stand out in the area of the development of metal industries, and the pharmaceutical industry is indebted to Carlos Alberti Ottolenghi and Alberto Di Capua. Paul Engel, an endocrinologist and pathologist, was a co-founder of the Endocrine Society of Ecuador.\n\n"}
{"id": "20121625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20121625", "title": "Hungarian Native Faith", "text": "Hungarian Native Faith\n\nThe Hungarian Native Faith (Hungarian: \"Ősmagyar Vallás\"), also termed Hungarian Neopaganism, is a modern Pagan new religious movement aimed at representing an ethnic religion of the Hungarians, inspired by taltosism (Hungarian shamanism), ancient mythology and later folklore. The Hungarian Native Faith movement has roots in 18th- and 19th-century Enlightenment and Romantic elaborations, and early-20th-century ethnology. The construction of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in interwar Turanist circles (1930s–1940s), and, eventually, Hungarian Native Faith movements blossomed in Hungary after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe boundaries between Hungarian Native Faith groups are often traced along their differing ideas about the ethnogenetic origins of the Hungarians, which have historically been a matter of debate. Many organisations acknowledge the commonly accepted theory that Hungarians originated among the Uralic peoples. Other Hungarian Native Faith groups, however, cultivate further links with Scythian, Sumerian, Turkic and other cultures.\n\nBesides the elaborations developed within intellectual circles, the grassroots development of the Hungarian Native Faith largely relies upon the work of individual shamans or neoshamans, the \"táltos\", whom have become popular in Hungary since the 1980s. Some Hungarian Native Faith organisations are supported by political parties of the right-wing, including Fidesz and Jobbik.\n\nSince the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, throughout the Enlightenment and especially Romanticism, the study of the ancient religion of the Hungarians has been tied together with the debate about their ethnogenesis and the nature of their language. This kaleidoscopic search for the origins of the Hungarians has continued to be productive well into the twentieth century, especially as a means to build a strong national identity. According to scholars, this search was fueled by the experience of the Hungarians under foreign powers, namely the Austrian and Soviet dominations. The theme of a national Hungarian religion was also dear to Hungarian Turanist circles in the 1930s and the 1940s, who looked for evidences to demonstrate a kinship between the Uralic and Turkic peoples, and generally the origins of these \"Turanian\" populations in Central Asia. The Protestant priest Béla Muraközy, writing in 1921, forebode that Turanism, with its anti-Western slants and its fascination with the Orient, would have taken a religious direction trying to resurrect \"ancient paganism\". When Hungary was occupied by Soviet forces in 1945, many Turanists emigrated to Western countries and continued to work there on their ideas, to reintroduce them to Hungary starting in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nTheories about Scythian and Sumerian origins were supported by many Turanist ethnologists. At the turn of the twentieth century, the first to popularise the notion of a Turanian linguistic family inclusive of Hungarian and Sumerian was Gyula Ferenczy. In the post-war period, a direct filiation of the Hungarians from the Sumerians was theorised by Tibor Baráth, Victor Padányi, András Zakar, and especially Ida Bobula, though the most well-known supporter of the theory is Ferenc Badinyi-Jós, who emigrated to Argentina, according to whom the original undivided Sumerian-Hungarian ethnicity was based on the Carpathian Mountains. The theory has left a lasting influence in the Hungarian Native Faith movement, as Badinyi-Jós was among the first to propose the constitution of an ethnic \"Hungarian Church\". Other scholars proposed the kinship of the Hungarians with Hebrews, Persians, ancient Egyptians, and others even with Japanese, Chinese, Greeks, and other peoples.\n\nAlready in 1770, János Sajnovics demonstrated the relationship of Hungarian with Uralic languages, with the publication of the \"Demonstratio idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse\". In the nineteenth century, with new studies on folklore, academic circles welcomed the idea that ancient Hungarian religion was essentially shamanic, related to Uralic and Siberian traditions. In the meantime, Arnold Ipolyi, bishop of Oradea, published his monumental work \"Magyar Mythológia\" (\"Hungarian Mythology\"), finished in 1854, aimed at matching the Brothers Grimm's \"Deutsche Mythologie\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Mátyás Jenő Fehér, another emigrant to Argentina who was a church-historian and former Dominican, provided a seminal view for a post-Christian Hungary. From 1967, he published several books about the \"Kassai Kódex\" or \"Collectio Dominicana\". He claimed that in 1944 he had found in Kosice a previously unknown medieval codex with records from inquisition courts. The codex documented a centuries-long effort by the merciless Christian church to exterminate the taltoses, Hungarian shamans, the representatives of the pre-Christian Hungarian religion whose role was to preserve the integrity of the nation. Though it is considered a forgery by academic scholarship, the document is among the reference points for proponents of the Hungarian Native Faith to illustrate the high morality of the indigenous religion and of its representatives.\n\n\"Taltosism\" is Hungarian shamanism, practised by the \"táltos\" (English plural \"taltoses\"), that is to say Hungarian shamans, and is an essential element of the Hungarian Native Faith. Hungarian chronicles of the 13th century still reported about \"magicians\" (taltoses) who practised their rites for the welfare of society. Hungarian taltosism persisted until the World War II in rural areas, where certain people were still considered taltoses by the local communities, though they practiced weather-magic only.\n\nIdeas about an ethnic Hungarian shamanism as a defining characteristic of the Hungarian essence were studied within a psychoanalytic framework by Géza Róheim in the 1920s, and later by Vilmos Diószegi with field work in Siberia in the 1950s and the 1960s. The shamanic character of the original Hungarian religion is accepted by most contemporary scholars, and has been the focus of most new studies.\n\nDiószegi described taltoses as specialists who are able of going through a controlled ecstasy (\"rejtezés\"). One becomes a taltos by heredity or vocation, and the process of becoming one includes the typical stages of psychophysical disease, acceptance and healing: After an initial resistance to vocation and the various symptoms of the \"shamanic disease\", the chosen by the gods finally accepts his role and is endowed with his powers. Taltoses acquire superior knowledge at a young age—usually at seven—, through shamanic journeys taking place in days-long dreams, in which the main goal is to climb the \"égig érő fa\" (\"sky-high tree\"), also called \"élet fa\" (\"tree of life\"), \"világ fa\" (\"world tree\") or \"tetejetlen fa\" (\"tree without a top\"). Diószegi considered many elements of Hungarian taltosism to be peculiar to the Hungarian ethnicity, not to be found in Central Asian shamanic traditions. He described the role of the taltos as the \"recognition and accomplishment of things required by the community, but unresolved due to the limitation of its own [the community's] powers\".\n\nContemporary Hungarian religious studies, primarily the academic circle revolving around Mihály Hoppál, has acquired an important role for the international study of shamanism. The Hungarian ethnological discourse presents taltoses, and shamans in general, as those whose socio-religious role is to heal, prophesise, and keep the integrity of cultural traditions by connecting the past and the present and thus projecting into the future, integrating the individual and the community, mankind and the gods. In the words of Hoppál, shamanism is depicted as a \"bridge and symbol, because it interconnects the traditions of the past with the present, and anchors the future of traditions\". The shaman's tasks are \"leading the community, guarding the ethnic consciousness, being a (sacrificial) priest\".\n\nThe modern taltos movement started in the 1980s, developing links with Michael Harner and other representatives of core shamanism from the United States since 1986. However, there are significant differences between American neoshamanism and Hungarian modern taltosism. While the American movement aims at representing a trans-cultural technique, designed as adaptable to different cultural contexts, and focused on self-empowerment and healing application, Hungarian taltosism is first and foremost an ethnic religious technique. Mihály Hoppál supported the taltos revival in his country as a means for consolidating a Hungarian Native Faith, and therefore for ethnic rejuvenation.\n\nCongregations of taltoses and their followers hold weekly ritual and healing gatherings, and they organise pilgrimages to holy sites. Rituals practised by Hungarian Native Faith practitioners include rituals of initiation and passage, and rituals for fertility, healing and purification, either for the environment, the community of believers, or the entire Hungarian nation. They may involve sweat lodges, fire-walk, drumming, and techniques of meditation. While the ceremonies are usually led by taltoses, the community of believers is actively involved.\n\nAmong well-known modern taltoses there are Zoltán Nagy Sólyomfi, István Somogyi, Fehérholló Öskü, and András Kovács-Magyar. Other mediators of the tradition are Imré Máté, Attila Heffner, Tamás Hervay, and Gábor Szemző. Although they belong to different organisations, they agree on the monotheism of Hungarian Native Faith's theology and on the role of the taltos. According to them, the taltos functions as \"the bridge between the celestial and the earthly worlds, between the irrational and the rational, the endless and the finite\". Taltoses are interpreters of the transcendent.\n\nAccording to Attila Heffner's definition:\nTaltoses share their knowledge acting as instructors, teaching their ideas in organised frameworks (for instance Sólyomfi's School of the Ancient Source or Kovács' Taltos School), through lectures or in discussion circles. The techniques for getting in touch with the transcendent (\"révülés\") take place through an active participation in ceremonies and rituals. Taltoses are religious specialists, and their role of healers is particularly pronounced; for instance, exercises of directed meditation, induced by drumming, to eliminate harmful thoughts, play a prominent role in their practice.\n\nIn their responsibility for the entire nation, and their role as keepers and awakeners of the national essence, modern taltoses often claim connection with the royal House of Árpád—the first dynasty to rule Hungary—and with Jesus, reinterpreted as a shamanic figure. According to Attila Heffner:\nWithin the Hungarian Native Faith movement, two mythopoetic texts have become the bases of two concurrent streams of religious doctrine. These texts are the \"Arvisura\" written by Zoltán Paál, and the \"Yotengrit\" four-books collection written by Imre Máté. Mythopoetic themes from both the works have more recently been synthesised in other media, such as the long animated film \"Sons of Heaven\" (\"Az Ég ﬁai\", 2010). Another long animation influenced by Hungarian Native Faith narratives, this time based on ethnographic and historical data from the Uralic paradigm and realised with subsidy from the national government, is the \"Song of the Miraculous Hind\" (\"Ének a csodaszarvasról\", 2002).\n\nZoltán Paál (1913–1982) was a steelworker who, during the Second World War, was initiated by a Siberian Mansi shaman named Tura Salavare, whom was then soldier in the Red Army. Paál compiled the knowledge he acquired in the \"Arvisura\", which tells the history of the Hunnish tribes starting from a mythical prehistory, to their settling of Mesopotamia and then Ordos, and finally to Matthias Corvinus. The book draws elements from Finno-Ugric traditions.\n\nThe \"Yotengrit\" is more religious-philosophical in its message. Its author Imre Máté was the taltos, or \"bácsa\", founder of the Yotengrit Church. The work claims to represent the faithful transmission of the ancient knowledge preserved by people in the Rábaköz region of western Hungary, the heritage of the so-called \"Büün-religion\", the persecuted original faith of the Hungarians. The work and especially the \"Prophecy of Nyirka\" which it contains, an allegorical text supposed to forebode the future of Hungary and global politics, has become a stronghold for nationalism and far-right occultism.\n\nThere are a variety of Hungarian Native Faith churches reflecting the movement's internal diversity. These churches differ from each other in both their doctrines and the character of their activities. They often develop from local taltos-led communities, or are individually established by a taltos. These taltoses are considered by their followers valid spiritual leaders and while some practise only within the boundaries of their local communities, others have acquired a national reputation. Their popular acknowledgement depends on attributed ritual and healing efficacy.\n\nThere are churches which base their doctrines on an outspoken synthesis of different traditions, and churches which claim to represent purely native traditions. In the first group there are the Church of Esoteric Doctrines (\"Ezoterikus Tanok Egyháza\") or Church of the Holy Crown (\"Szent Korona Egyház\")—founded in 1996 and officially registered by the Hungarian state in 1997—, the Church of the Universe (\"Univerzum Egyháza\") of Giörgy Péter Pál Kisfaludy, and the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church of András Kovács. Most of the others fall within the second category, including the Community of Hungarian Religion of Attila Kovács, the Ancient Hungarian Church of László Hjadú Nimród, the Yotengrit Church of Imre Máté, the Firebird Taltos Drum Circle of Zoltán Sólyomfi, the People of Árpád Drumming Circle of Lehel Bakonyi, and the Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád. The most influential among them have been the Yotengrit Church and the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church.\n\nBesides these taltos-led groups there are taltoses who do not have a community and yet are regarded as the most charismatic figures of Hungarian Native Faith. They include Attila Heffner, Tamás Hervay the \"Soul-Lifting Taltos\", and János Majercsik Oguz.\n\nThe Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church (\"Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház\") founded by András Kovács, a disciple of Kisfaludy, teaches a Hungarian Native Faith doctrine which it claims to be the original religion of the Huns. According to the church, God the Father is an energetic vibration which incarnated in a host, the Mother of God, begetting the Sun God (of whom Jesus is a representation). The Pilis Mountains are a holy place according to the Ancient Hungarian Taltos Church. Kovács is also the founder and director of the Noetic Taltos School (\"Szellemi Táltos Iskola\").\n\nThe Community of the Hungarian Religion (\"Magyar Vallás Közössége\") inherits those scholarly studies of the nineteenth century which claimed that Hungarian and Sumerian language share an origin in the hypothetical Turanian linguistic family. Based on these ideas, in the 1930s Zoltán Bencsi founded the Turanian Monotheist Movement. After Miklós Horthy's government banned the organisation, some members went abroad. Among them was Ótto János Homonnay, who in the 1960s, in Canada, established the Hungarian Turul Society to promote the Turanist theses. In 1979, after Homonnay's death, János Páll took over the leadership of the group.\n\nThe Community of Hungarian Religion was founded in Hungary in 1992 as a continuation of the Turul Society. The current leader is Attila Kovács, according to whom the church already had gathered around one thousand members in the late 1990s. The church is distinctively anti-Christian, and considers the adoption of Christianity by King Stephen I in 1000 CE a disaster which brought about the destruction of authentic Hungarian religious culture. The church endorses the hypothesis of the kinship of Hungarians and Sumerians, and supports the use of the Old Hungarian alphabet instead of the Latin script.\n\nThe Yotengrit Church (\"Yotengrit Egyház\"), whose complete name is the Church of the Ancient Spirit of the Endless Sea (\"Tengervégtelen Ős-Szellem Egyháza\"), was founded around 2007 by Imre Máté. He, whose title in the organisation was \"bácsa\" (\"master\"), emigrated to Germany in 1956, during the revolution against the communist government of the Hungarian People's Republic in which he participated. While in Germany, he worked as a businessman and poet, but returned to Hungary in the 2000s to spend his last years in Bágyogszovát. He founded the Yotengrit Church as the representative of the ancient Hungarian religion, the so-called \"Büün-religion\", passed down through the unwritten tradition of the \"tudó\" (\"knower\") people along the Raba river. Máté published a series of nine books, entitled \"Yotengrit\", in which he explained theology and linguistic etymology. In recent years, the Yotengrit Church has become one of the most influential organisations of the Hungarian Native Faith. While it is considered by its adherents as a faithful heir of the pre-Christian Hungarian belief systems, it shows various non-indigenous influences.\n\nThe theology of the Yotengrit Church emphasises a conception of primordial God, called \"Yotengrit\", \"Tengrit\" or \"Tengri\", which represents all the deities in their yet undivided state. In Hungarian the related word \"tenger\" means \"sea\", and represents such primordial undifferentiation. The primordial God then manifests as a male–female duality: Ukkó, the mother goddess whose forehead is decorated by the moon, and who is identified as the \"Boldogasszony\" (the \"Blessed Lady\") of Christianised folk beliefs; and Gönüz, the sun-faced father god.\n\nAt the time of the foundation of the church, Imre Máté proclaimed the importance of an all-encompassing conception of God:\nAt the same time, the theology emphasises a national god peculiar to the Hungarians, Má-Tun, the deified hero of the folk tale entitled \"Fehérlófia\" (\"Son of the White Horse\"), who was originally a totemic animal ancestor. Má-Tun is identified with the historical figure of Maodu, founder of the first Xiongnu empire, and according to Máté also of the empire of the Huns. The Yotengrit Church is politically neutral, but, as Máté's stated, its teachings may be a \"source of sane, aggression-free national politics\".\n\nThe Ancient Hungarian Church (\"Ősmagyar Egyház\"), whose Hungarian headquarters are located in Mogyoród, was first established in Budapest in the 1990 by László Hjadú Nimród, and was officially registered in 1998. Nimród spends most of the year in the United States and the church has international headquarters located in Los Angeles. The doctrine of the Ancient Hungarian Church is a synthesis of ancient Hungarian, East Asian and Christian beliefs, though all of them are claimed to be original Hungarian-Turanian beliefs. The church has strict religious regulations. For instance, preachers have to wear white and purple clothes with folk patterns. They celebrate the major holidays of the Christian calendar, winter and summer solstice, national holidays and the birthdays of important Hungarian historical personages.\n\nThe Firebird Taltos Drum Circle (\"Tűzmadár Táltos Dobkör\") was founded in 2006 by Zoltán Nagy Sólyomfi, who also acted as the chief executive of the Yotengrit Church when it was registered by the government. He later left the Yotengrit Church for undisclosed internal disputes and, despite his wish to return, was not allowed to do so by Máté. The aim of the group is to revive ancient Hungarian spirituality, mediating it to society in modern forms, helping the individuals to understand themselves and thus healing the world tree, which manifests itself through the individuals.\n\nThe theology of the Drum Circle is \"based upon the ancient Hungarian conception of the world, which is the One (God) which incorporates everything that exists\". Sólyomfi teaches that there are two worlds: One is the \"manifest world\" represented by the world tree, while the other one is the \"unmanifested, unshaped space\" which contains the \"shared consciousness\" of mankind.\n\nThe Drum Circle emphasises practice over doctrine, including drumming, breathing and voice techniques. The aim of these practices is to widen one's consciousness to understand the operations of the One, becoming like the One. The group practises ritual ceremonies for birth, initiation, marriage, death and the feasts of the Yearly Round. The School of the Ancient Source (\"Ősforrás Iskola\"), associated with the church, organises camps and pilgrimages.\n\nThe Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád (\"Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház\") was founded in 2009 and has its reference points in the Turanist emigree ideologists Adorján Magyar and Victor Padányi, but it is also inspired by the Traditionalist School, the Nouvelle Droite of Alain de Benoist, and to the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion.\n\nThe group named Bolyanest (Gaffer Bolya's Nest) was founded in 1979 by Gaffer Bolya, a teacher in vocational secondary school titled \"Bolyapó\" within the group itself. Bolya's starting aim was to provide a way of good life for his students, whom formed the original core members of the group. The centre of the movement is in Budapest, and it was registered by the government in 1999. It is considered amongst the most influential Hungarian Native Faith movements today, especially concerning the process of re-mythologisation of Hungarian history. The group was originally focused on nature religion, while in the most recent decades its focus has shifted to the discourse about ethnic roots.\n\nBolya acts as the group's ceremonial leader. The group has a core membership of around one hundred people, but its influence reaches the thousands of people. They are mostly from Budapest's middle class, but there are also farmers, entrepreneurs and intellectuals. The average age is over fifty-five and most of them are highly educated. They outspokenly identify themselves as non-Christians, though they do not presume to be the continuators of a well-defined pre-Christian religion; rather, they consciously construct a new religion based on Hungarian folklore and elements from other cultures' indigenous religions. Sumerian culture has been one of the main sources, although other cultures are explored too; for instance, Sumerian prayers are sung together with Russian songs. They regard some natural sites surrounding Budapest and farther localities such as Sóskút, Borsodgeszt, and Bodrogköz, as their holy places where to make pilgrimage.\n\nA fundamental teaching of Bolya is the conceptual distinction between \"order\" and \"system\", which remains the core of Bolyanest's thought. The former, the order, defines the natural way of being of everything in nature; everything is interconnected and interdependent, and each single part has a role in its instinctual cooperation with the others. The latter, the system, defines unnatural and artificial superstructures which take shape in societies when individuals and groups are surrounded by growing webs of norms, and are gradually alienated from each other and from their natural contexts. Gaffer Bolya was likely inspired by his studies of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's and Leo Tolstoy's thought in the development of this vision.\n\nHungarian Native Faith groups generally put a great emphasis on the discourse about ethnic roots, which are re-mythologised. Many Hungarian Native Faith groups espouse nationalistic political views and organise their communities in exclusive ways, exhibiting political intolerance. At the same time, pluralism and multiculturalism are viewed as disturbances which erode Hungarian identity. The popularity of these stances is attributed by scholars to the abrupt fall of the Iron Curtain, followed by spiritual vacuum and the perception of being invaded by a \"multi-faceted cultural market\", which created an identity crisis in post-Soviet countries. In the case of Hungarian Native Faith groups, this resulted in a rejection of postmodern heterogeneity and a sacralisation of the national identity, in which language, religion and politics form a single entity. Hungarian Native Faith groups see themselves as a core minority, amongst all Hungarians, which represents the quintessence of Hungarianness.\n\nThe relationship between Hungarian Native Faith and Christianity varies from church to church. Some Hungarian Native Faith groups use Christian themes and terminology in their own doctrines, or propose the incorporation of Christianity itself into the Hungarian Native Faith, such as in the case of groups developing in the wake of the teachings of Ferenc Badinyi-Jós. Others, like the Community of Hungarian Religion and the Bolyanest, are instead outspokenly anti-Christian.\n\nA fundamental notion in Hungarian Native Faith is that each \"nation\" should have its own \"faith\", and a \"Christian Hungary\" represents an anomaly which needs to be rectified. This rectification should come from a liquidation of Christianity. Even among those Hungarian Native Faith groups which nourish warm feelings towards Jesus, regarded as compatible with the indigenous religion, including the Yotengrit Church, the Christian religious institution as it developed after Jesus—the so-called \"Pauline Christianity\"—is in any case perceived as a corrupt entity to be dismantled. More in particular, among these groups it is Eastern Christianity to be valued as compatible with the indigenous religion, and to be considered closer to what Jesus intended, while Western Christianity (the forms which have historically been dominant in Hungary) is seen as its antithesis and as a deviant, evil teaching. In these groups, Jesus is reinterpreted as a powerful ancestor and shaman.\n\nWithin the Bolyanest, most of the members deem Christianity a superstition aimed at the control of people. Christian symbolic motifs such as the cross and the tree of life are considered, together with the sun and the moon, as symbols of natural pre-Christian religion which were appropriated by the Christian churches. The majority of believers regards Christianity as the force which eradicated this natural ancient knowledge, including original Hungarian religion, and as the force responsible for the disenchantment of the world.\n\nThose taltoses who espouse Turanist theories sometimes declare explicit affiliation with Tengrism, the Turkic ethnic religion. This is the case of Zoltán Sólyomfi. These taltoses are generally characterised by their use of the Turkic name of God, \"Tengri\", instead of the Hungarian term \"Isten\".\n\nIn 2012 a nine-meters high \"élet fa\" (tree of life) was donated by Hungarian Native Faith groups to the Tengrists of Kazakhstan. In the same year, Ojun Adigzsi See-Oglu, a famous shaman from Tuva, was invited to the Hungarian Parliament Building to perform a ritual dance around the Holy Crown of Hungary for the welfare of the Hungarian nation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "63520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63520", "title": "Jane Fonda", "text": "Jane Fonda\n\nJane Seymour Fonda (born December 21, 1937) is an American actress, writer, political activist, former fashion model and fitness guru. She is the recipient of various accolades including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the AFI Life Achievement Award, and the Honorary Golden Lion.\n\nBorn to actor Henry Fonda and socialite Frances Ford Seymour, Fonda made her Broadway debut in the 1960 play \"There Was a Little Girl\", for which she received the first of two Tony Award nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year in \"Tall Story\". She rose to prominence in 1960s with such films as \"Period of Adjustment\" (1962), \"Sunday in New York\" (1963), \"Cat Ballou\" (1965), \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967) and \"Barbarella\" (1968). Her first husband was \"Barbarella\" director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969) and went on to win two Best Actress Oscars in the 1970s for \"Klute\" (1971) and \"Coming Home\" (1978). Her other nominations were for \"Julia\" (1977), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"On Golden Pond\" (1981) and \"The Morning After\" (1986). Consecutive hits \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" (1977), \"California Suite\" (1978), \"The Electric Horseman\" (1979) and \"9 to 5\" (1980) sustained Fonda's box-office drawing power, and she won an Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the 1984 TV film \"The Dollmaker\".\n\nIn 1982, she released her first exercise video, \"Jane Fonda's Workout\", which became the highest-selling VHS of all time. It would be the first of 22 workout videos released by her over the next 13 years which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by \"Stanley & Iris\" (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the 2005 hit \"Monster-in-Law\". Though \"Georgia Rule\" (2007) was the star's only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included \"The Butler\" (2013), \"This Is Where I Leave You\" (2014), \"Youth\" (2015), \"Our Souls at Night\" (2017) and \"Book Club\" (2018). In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 45-year absence from the stage, in the play \"33 Variations\" which earned her a Tony Award nomination, while her major recurring role in the HBO drama series \"The Newsroom\" (2012–2014) earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2010 and 2012. Fonda currently stars in the Netflix original series \"Grace and Frankie\", which premiered in 2015 and has brought her nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nFonda was a visible political activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War and later became involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi, during which she became widely known under the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\" She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization.\n\nJane Seymour Fonda was born in New York City on December 21, 1937. Her parents were Canadian-born socialite Frances Ford Brokaw (née Seymour; 1908–1950), and actor Henry Fonda (1905–1982). According to her father, their surname came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s. There, he intermarried, and the family began to use Dutch given names, with Jane's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650. She also has English, Scottish, and French ancestry. She was named for the third wife of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour, to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side. She has a brother, Peter, who is also an actor, and a maternal half-sister, Frances de Villers Brokaw (aka \"Pan\"), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.\n\nIn 1950, when Fonda was 12, her mother committed suicide while undergoing treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in Beacon, New York. Later that year, Fonda's father married socialite Susan Blanchard (born 1928), 23 years his junior; this marriage ended in divorce. At 15 Fonda taught dance at Fire Island Pines, New York. She attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nFonda attended the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York, and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie. Before her acting career, she was a model, appearing twice on the cover of \"Vogue\".\n\nFonda became interested in acting as a teenager, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of \"The Country Girl\" at the Omaha Community Playhouse. After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for six months to study art. Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, \"I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father – who had to say so – told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!\"\n\nFonda's stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with \"Tall Story\", in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. Frequent collaborator Robert Redford also made his debut in that film. \"Period of Adjustment\" and \"Walk on the Wild Side\" followed in 1962. The latter, in which she played a prostitute, earned her a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer.\n\nIn 1963, she appeared in \"Sunday in New York\". \"Newsday\" called her \"the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses\". However, she also had detractors – in the same year, the \"Harvard Lampoon\" named her the \"Year's Worst Actress\" for \"The Chapman Report\". Fonda's career breakthrough came with \"Cat Ballou\" (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations, with Lee Marvin winning best actor, and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom. After this came the comedies \"Any Wednesday\" (1966), opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones, and \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967), co-starring Robert Redford.\n\nIn 1968, she played the title role in the science fiction spoof \"Barbarella\", which established her status as a sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969) won her critical acclaim, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role. Fonda was very selective by the end of the decade, turning down lead roles in \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\".\n\nFonda won her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1971, again playing a prostitute, the gamine Bree Daniels, in the murder mystery \"Klute\". She won her second Oscar in 1978 for her role as an adulteress in \"Coming Home\", the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life. Both performances earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress as well.\n\nBetween \"Klute\" in 1971 and \"Fun With Dick and Jane\" in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in \"A Doll's House\" (1973), \"Steelyard Blues\" and \"The Blue Bird\" (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: \"I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted.\" However, in her 2005 autobiography, \"My Life So Far\", she rejected such simplification. \"The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed.\" She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.\n\nIn 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside Yves Montand in \"Tout Va Bien\", directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The two directors then made \"Letter to Jane\", in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda.\n\nThrough her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film \"Fun With Dick and Jane\" is generally considered her \"comeback\" picture. Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in \"Julia\", receiving positive reviews, BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress, and an Oscar nomination. During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down \"An Unmarried Woman\" because she felt the part was not relevant. She won another BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with \"The China Syndrome\", about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. The same year, she starred in \"The Electric Horseman\" with her previous co-star, Robert Redford.\n\nIn 1980, Fonda starred in \"9 to 5\" with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play \"On Golden Pond\", specifically for her father and her. \"On Golden Pond\", which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.\n\nFonda continued to appear in feature films throughout the 1980s, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for \"The Dollmaker\" (1984), and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in \"Agnes of God\" (1985). She was nominated for yet another Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of an alcoholic murder suspect in the 1986 thriller \"The Morning After\", opposite Jeff Bridges. She ended the decade by appearing in \"Old Gringo\". This was followed by the romantic drama \"Stanley & Iris\" (1990) with Robert De Niro, which was her final film for 15 years.\n\nFor many years Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming \"The China Syndrome\", she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The \"Leni Workout\" became the \"Jane Fonda Workout\", which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled \"Jane Fonda's Workout\", inspired by her best-selling book, \"Jane Fonda's Workout Book\". \"Jane Fonda's Workout\" became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.\n\nIn the early 1990s, after three decades in film, Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry. In May 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success \"Monster-in-Law\", starring opposite Jennifer Lopez. Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama \"Georgia Rule\" alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan.\n\nIn 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway, first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Moisés Kaufman's \"33 Variations\". The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.\n\nFonda filmed her second movie in French when she had a leading role in the 2011 drama \"All Together\". The same year she starred alongside Catherine Keener in \"Peace, Love and Misunderstanding\", playing a hippie grandmother. In 2012, Fonda began a recurring role as Leona Lansing, CEO of a major media company, in HBO's original political drama \"The Newsroom\". Her role continued throughout the show's three seasons, and Fonda received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nIn 2013, Fonda had a small role in \"The Butler\", portraying First Lady Nancy Reagan. She had more film work the following year, appearing in the comedies \"Better Living Through Chemistry\" and \"This is Where I Leave You\". She also voiced a character on \"The Simpsons\". She played an acting diva in Paolo Sorrentino's \"Youth\" in 2015, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination. She also appeared in \"Fathers and Daughters\" (2015) with Russell Crowe.\n\nFonda appears as the co-lead in the Netflix series \"Grace and Frankie\". She and Lily Tomlin play aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love. Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014, and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015. In 2016, Fonda voiced Shuriki in \"Elena and the Secret of Avalor\".\n\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Fonda and others told the stories of the people killed there.\n\nFonda starred in her fourth collaboration with Robert Redford in the 2017 romantic drama film \"Our Souls at Night\". The film and Fonda's performance received critical acclaim upon release. In 2018, she starred opposite Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen, and Candice Bergen in the romantic comedy film \"Book Club\".\n\nFonda is the subject of an HBO original documentary entitled \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts\". Directed by the documentarian Susan Lacy, it covers Fonda's life from childhood through her acting career and political activism and then to the present day. It premiered on HBO on September 24, 2018.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War. Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as \"small-c communism\". Along with other celebrities, she supported the Alcatraz Island occupation by American Indians in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regards to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indian sovereignty.\n\nShe supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers in the early 1970s, stating: \"Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood.\" She called the Black Panthers \"our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, propaganda and risk.\" She has been involved in the feminist movement since the 1970s and dovetails her activism in support of civil rights.\n\nIn April 1970, Fonda, with Fred Gardner and Donald Sutherland formed the FTA tour (\"Free The Army\", a play on the troop expression \"Fuck The Army\"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to Bob Hope's USO tour. The tour, described as \"political vaudeville\" by Fonda, visited military towns along the West Coast, with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (\"F.T.A.\") which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemen and servicewomen; it was released in 1972.\n\nOn May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on GI rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence. The quiet was broken when Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage. Drunk, Corso challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: Why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident: \"I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.\" On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president, Ferrel Heady. The protestors called themselves \"They Shoot Students, Don't They?\" – a reference to Fonda's recently released film, \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\", which was just screened in Albuquerque.\n\nIn the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and, for her efforts, was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator. On November 3, 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by \"The New York Times\", Fonda was a \"major patron\" of the VVAW.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans – mostly civil rights activists, teachers and pastors – traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese. News media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S. viewpoint, and American travelers to Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return to the States. Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River. Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were \"truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way\". Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as \"methodic\". Other journalists reported that the attacks were \"aimed at the whole system of dikes\".\n\nFonda was photographed seated on an anti-aircraft gun; the controversial photo outraged a number of Americans, and earned her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\". In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures and regretted taking them. In a 2011 entry at her official website, Fonda explained:\n\nIt happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit ... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return ... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me ... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed ... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen ... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever ... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.\n\nFonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, commenting on her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories damaged in the war and denouncing U.S. military policy in Vietnam. Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam, and her radio broadcasts. During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda called the returning POWs \"hypocrites and liars and pawns\", adding about the prisoners she visited, \"These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed.\" In addition, Fonda told \"The New York Times\" in 1973, \"I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture ... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie.\" Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely in the press and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have personally denied the rumors, and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these rumored allegations to be false as the persons named had never met Fonda.\n\nIn 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which continued to mobilize antiwar activists across the nation after the 1973 Paris Peace Agreement, through 1975, when the United States withdrew from Vietnam.\n\nBecause of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when a U.S. Naval Academy plebe ritually shouted out \"Goodnight, Jane Fonda!\", the entire company of midshipmen plebes, who had not yet been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam War, replied \"Goodnight, bitch!\" This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's \"Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures\". In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, \"My Life So Far\". He told reporters that he \"consider[ed] it a debt of honor\", adding \"she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did.\" Fonda refused to press charges.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:\n\nI would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. ... I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.\n\nSome critics responded that her apology came at a time when a group of New England Veterans had launched a campaign to disrupt a film project she was working on, leading to the charge that her apology was motivated at least partly by self-interest.\n\nIn a \"60 Minutes\" interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a \"betrayal\" of American forces and of the \"country that gave me privilege\". Fonda said, \"The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.\" She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: \"There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for.\" Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: \"Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war.\"\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project Minaret, a program that some NSA officials have described as \"disreputable if not downright illegal\". Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, Tom Hayden, were intercepted by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Under the UKUSA Agreement, intercepted data on Americans were sent to the U.S. government.\n\nOn November 3, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking. She had been re-entering the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, when her luggage was searched, and several small baggies containing pills seized. Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond. Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House. She wrote in 2009 that \"I told them what [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House. I think they hoped this 'scandal' would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\" Lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, and the charges were dropped with little media attention.\n\nFonda's mugshot from the arrest, in which she raises her fist in a sign of solidarity, has since become a famous image of the actress. It was used as the poster image for the 2018 HBO documentary on Fonda, \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts\", with a giant billboard sporting the image erected in Times Square in September, 2018. In 2017, she began selling merchandise with her mugshot image to benefit the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential.\n\nIn early March 2017, in an interview with Brie Larson, published by \"People\" magazine, Fonda stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right.\" She said, \"I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss.\" She said, \"I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing. I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape. They think, 'It must have been because I said 'no' the wrong way.'\"\n\nThrough her work, Fonda said she wants to help abuse victims \"realize that [rape and abuse] is not our fault\". Fonda said that her difficult past led her to become such a passionate activist for women's rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She was a victim of the \"disease to please\" in her early life, which plagued many American females of her generation. Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.\n\nFonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit \"The Vagina Monologues\", of which she is an honorary chairperson. She was at the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation.\n\nIn 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development.\n\nOn February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through Ciudad Juárez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler and other women, urging Mexico to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials in helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city. In 2004, she also served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of \"The Vagina Monologues\".\n\nIn the days before the September 17, 2006 Swedish elections, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party Feministiskt initiativ in their election campaign.\n\nIn \"My Life So Far\", Fonda stated that she considers patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were \"anti-male\". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she \"still loves men\", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.\n\nIn April 2016, Fonda said that while she was 'glad' that Bernie Sanders was running, she predicted Hillary Clinton would become the first female president, whose win Fonda believed would result in a \"violent backlash\". Fonda went on to say that we need to \"help men understand why they are so threatened – and change the way we view masculinity.\"\n\nFonda went to Seattle, in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear. The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population, protesting that \"Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs.\" The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.\n\nIn addition to environmental reasons, Fonda has been a critic of oil pipelines because of their being built without consent on Native American Land. In 2017, Fonda responded to American President Donald Trump's mandate to resume construction of the controversial North Dakota Pipelines by saying that Trump \"does this illegally because he has not gotten consent from the tribes through whose countries this goes\" and pointing out that \"the U.S. has agreed to treaties that require them to get the consent of the people who are affected, the indigenous people who live there.\"\n\nIn December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp. She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.\n\nIn September 2009, she was one of more than 1,500 signatories to a letter protesting the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival's spotlight on Tel Aviv. The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of \"the Israeli propaganda machine\" because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.\n\nRabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that \"People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel.\" Hier continued, saying that \"it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas.\"\n\nFonda, in \"The Huffington Post\", said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it \"was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.\" She continued, writing \"the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\" Fonda emphasized that she, \"in no way, support[s] the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people.\" Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to \"The Huffington Post\" rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as \"a strong supporter and friend of Israel\".\n\nFonda argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.\n\nIn September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist George Galloway at two stops on his U.S. book tour, Madison, Wisconsin and Chicago. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery.\n\nOn January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., declaring that \"silence is no longer an option\". She spoke at an anti-war rally earlier that day at the Navy Memorial, where members of the organization Free Republic picketed in a counter protest.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\". Kerry's opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart. A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated.\n\nIn 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama's permitting of Arctic drilling (Petroleum exploration in the Arctic) at the Sundance Film Festival. In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the \"March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate\", which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author Naomi Klein. The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated.\n\nIn addition to issues of Civil Rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau \"talked so beautifully of needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people ... and yet he has betrayed every one of the things he committed to in Paris.\"\n\nOn April 5, 2005, Random House released Fonda's autobiography \"My Life So Far\". The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third \"act\" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to the Christian religion, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.\n\nFonda's autobiography was well received by book critics and noted to be \"as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself\" in its \"Washington Post\" review, calling her a \"beautiful bundle of contradictions\". \"The New York Times\" called the book \"achingly poignant\".\n\nIn January 2009, Fonda started chronicling her Broadway return in a blog with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to fears and excitement about her new play. She uses Twitter and has a Facebook page. In 2011, Fonda published a new book: \"Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit – making the most of all of your life\". It offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls \"the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond\".\n\nFonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts.\n\nFonda marketed her highly-successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978.\n\nFonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid 1990s and the Fonda Family Foundation in the late 1990s. In the mid 2000s, Fonda founded the Jane Fonda Foundation in 2004 with one million dollars of her own money as a charitable corporation with herself as president, chair, director and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf. In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the proceeds of which benefit GCAPP.\n\nJane Fonda has been married and divorced three times.\n\nFonda married her first husband, French film director Roger Vadim, on August 14, 1965 at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. The couple had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim, born on September 28, 1968 in Paris, France and named after the actress and activist Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nOn January 19, 1973, three days after obtaining a divorce from Vadim in Santo Domingo, Fonda married activist Tom Hayden in a free-form ceremony at her home in Laurel Canyon. Their son, Troy O'Donovan Garity, was born on July 7, 1973 in Los Angeles and was given his paternal grandmother's maiden name, as the names \"Fonda and Hayden carried too much baggage\". Fonda and Hayden named their son for Nguyen Van Troi. Hayden chose O'Donovan as the middle name after Irish revolutionary Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. In 1982, Fonda and Hayden unofficially adopted an African-American teenager, Mary Luana Williams (known as Lulu), who was the daughter of members of the Black Panthers. Fonda and Hayden divorced on June 10, 1990 in Santa Monica.\nShe married her third husband, cable-television tycoon and CNN founder Ted Turner, on December 21, 1991 at a ranch near Capps, Florida, about 20 miles east of Tallahassee. The pair divorced on May 22, 2001 in Atlanta. From 2009 until 2017, Fonda was in a relationship with record producer Richard Perry.\n\nFonda grew up atheist but turned to Christianity in the early 2000s. She describes her beliefs as being \"outside of established religion\" with a more feminist slant, and views God as something that \"lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul).\" She practices Zazen meditation and Yoga.\n\nAs a child, Fonda suffered from a poor self-image and lack of confidence in her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said:\n\nI was raised in the '50s. I was taught by my father [actor Henry Fonda] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.\n\nIn adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said,\n\nIt was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout ... I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die. Having been diagnosed with breast cancer, Fonda underwent a lumpectomy in November 2010, and has recovered.\n\nIn 1962, Fonda was given the honorary title of \"Miss Army Recruiting\" by the Pentagon.\n\nIn 1981, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.\n\nIn 1994, the United Nations Population Fund made Fonda a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2004, she was awarded the Women's eNews 21 Leaders for the 21st Century award as one of Seven Who Change Their Worlds. In 2007, Fonda was awarded an Honorary Palme d'Or by Cannes Film Festival President Gilles Jacob for career achievement. Only three others had received such an award – Jeanne Moreau, Alain Resnais, and Gérard Oury.\n\nIn December 2008, Fonda was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. In November and December 2009, she received the National German Sustainability Award and New York Women's Agenda Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also selected as the 42nd recipient (2014) of the AFI Life Achievement Award.\nIn 2017, she received a Goldene Kamera lifetime achievement award.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43910260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43910260", "title": "Jupiter and Antiope (Watteau)", "text": "Jupiter and Antiope (Watteau)\n\nJupiter and Antiope (French: \"Jupiter et Antiope\") is an oil painting by the French artist Antoine Watteau. It is also known as the Satyr and the Sleeping Nymph and was probably painted between 1714 and 1719. Intended to be placed over a doorway, today it hangs in the Louvre in Paris.\n\nThe painting is oval shaped, with a width of 107.5 cm and a height of 73 cm. In the foreground it depicts the naked, sleeping Antiope. She lies with her head on the left edge of the painting, twisted so that her front side faces the viewer. Her right arm is bent under her head while her left arm hangs down into the abyss in front of her. This arm covers the right breast, while the left remains free. Her legs are bent up towards the viewer, with the right continuing the line of her body at the knee while her left leg is only slightly bent to point back to the lower right of the painting. The whole body is painted in pale, warm colours and lights up the otherwise dark and earthy image. Under the sleeping woman there is a cloth, which hangs over the abyss near her breast, disappears under her arm near her head and is lifted by the satyr behind her.\nThe satyr, whose head is crowned with grape vines symbolising the presence of the god Bacchus. lies in the opposite direction behind the woman, with the front of his body also facing the viewer. With his left arm he lifts the cloth to the height of Antiope's shoulder and it is obvious that he has just uncovered the sleeping maiden. His left arm is bent on a tree root at the right edge of the image and props up his upper body. With his head and upper body, the satyr looms over the hips of the sleeper in order to gaze upon her - he licks his lips lustfully. His body is shadowy and cannot be made out below his hips. The satyr is depicted in brown tones. His suntanned skin and muscular body forms a clear contrast with the softly worked, shapely Antiope.\n\nThe lower edge of the image is taken up by an abyss, which is depicted in dark brown tones and is edged with bare soil. On either side, gnarled roots grow in the soil, which rise into indistinct trees. The ground continues above the trees into the background, where there is a hill with lone houses. Above that is the cloudy sky, discreetly lit by the glow of twilight.\n\nThe composition fits the oval shape of the image. The sleeping Antiope forms the central horizontal, with her hips and bent legs creating the central vertical. The arms of the satyr and the legs of the woman curve in parallel with the upper edge of the painting - in this way the two central characters repeat the oval within the image, which is broken only by dangling left arm of the woman. Spatial depth is created by the stooped posture of Jupiter and by the bent knees of Antiope.\n\nThe painting comes out of the story of the seduction of Antiope by the god Zeus in Greek mythology, later imported into Roman mythology and told of the god Jupiter. According to this myth, Antiope, the beautiful daughter of King Nycteus of Thebes, was surprised and seduced by Zeus in the form of a satyr. She became pregnant and bore the twins Amphion and Zethus, who later killed Nycteus' brother Lycus in revenge for his treatment of Antiope and took over the city of Thebes.\n\nSatyrs and nymphs form two extremes in Greek mythology, which are united only by their instinctive natures. While the nymph was the source of the psychological term nymphomania (now hypersexuality), the satyr was the source of the once common but now outdated term satyriasis and can be understood as the nymph's male equivalent.\n\nAccordingly, both nymphs and saturs are very regularly depicted in mythology - and thence also in their subsequent artistic reception - in erotic contexts and are accordingly favoured topics of art. In addition there is a clear aesthetic contrast between the two stereotypes. The nymph is in general very beautiful and physically perfect. They were mostly depicted with ivory, light and very delicate colours and an idealised female form, having close similarities with depictions of Venus. On the other hand, the satyrs, who are the followers of Bacchus, are very ugly, with the horns, legs and sometimes the tail of a goat. They are also strong, muscular, and tanned. Thus nymphs and satyrs present an optical contrast, which could hardly be any stronger and which makes them a perfect pair for artistic purposes.\n\nThe circumstances of the painting's creation are not entirely clear (see below). In the art historical literature, the assumption that the painting was created as a commission for the banker Pierre Crozat under the instruction of Watteau's teacher Charles de La Fosse around the time of the creation of the four \"Seasons\" prevails. La Fosse encouraged Watteau who had not practiced history painting hitherto to take on the work of the allegories of the \"Seasons\", since he himself was not in the neighbourhood anymore. The \"Seasons\" seem to have been designed as oval paintings with mythological scenes intended to decorate Crozat's dining room.\nIn parallel with this series, Watteau produced a range of other paintings, which dealt with the theme of the mythological nude in this same oval format which was at that time unusual. At first he painted a number of historical images in the classical format, following Italian and Netherlandish classics, after which he next created \"Jupiter and Antiope\", the seasons and three further seasons in the oval format: another \"Autumn\", \"Venus Disarming Amor\" and the \"Morning Toilette\".\n\nModels for the painting of \"Jupiter and Antiope\" included the paintings of the same name by Antonio da Correggio and Titian as well as the \"Descent from the Cross\" of the Dutch painter Anthonis van Dyck, from which the arrangement of the satyr's arms is taken.\nDuring his preparation for the \"Jupiter and Antiope\", at least three sketches were created by Watteau, in which he attempted to work the satyr out. These include a drawing of the satyr in standing position and one in the reclining pose which he finally selected. No sketches of Antiope are known, but Watteau had already produced a great number of female nudes and studies which he could draw on for this painting. Finally, an image now lost showed the whole image and was used by the engraver Anne-Claude-Philippe, Comte de Caylus as model for a copper engraving which was first published by Jules de Jullienne.\n\nWatteau returned to the theme of the sleeping nymph in his 1719 painting \"The Elysian Fields\", a scene of the gardens of the Champs-Élysées in Paris. Here he depicted a stone copy of Antiope wearing a crown as a monument on the pedestal at the right hand side of the painting, as a kind of \"living sculpture\" which is typical of Watteau. This statue is placed directly above a gallantly dressed man seen only from behind (Hagestolz) who considers the scenery as part of a group of men in the foreground (Watteau also painted a similar group of people in the \"Rural Pleasure\" of 1720, in that case standing under a statue of Venus). According to Börsch-Supan, the Hagestolz represents the natural counterpoint to the lustful satyr - he observes the figure on the pedestal with particular interest.\n\nThe history of the painting after its creation is not yet completely clear and in particular its location before 1857 remains an open question.\n\nProbably Watteau painted the image as a commission for the merchant Pierre Crozat, for whom he also produced the series of \"Seasons\" painted at the same time. This is claimed in an exhibition catalogue from Vienna in 1966 and remains the most widely accepted theory in art history to this day, but it still cannot be proven.\n\nIn 1857 the painting appeared at the auction of the collection of Theodore Patureau in a catalogue in which it was listed as a former possession of Prince Paul d'Arenberg. Watteau maintained a friendly relationship with the ancestors of the prince in the early eighteenth century and a receipt of 14 May 1717 signed by Watteau records that he had sold two paintings to Léopold Philippe d'Arenberg. In their 1929 book \"Jean de Juliennes et les graveurs de Watteau au XVIII siècle\" E. Hérold and A. Vuaflart suggest that \"Jupiter and Antiope\" could have been one of these two paintings and develop a theory that de Ligne ordered the painting in 1714 during a trip to Paris and returned to collect the painting and pay for it three years later. Today this theory is largely rejected.\n\nHow the painting came into the possession of Paturae is no longer clear either, but he probably bought it from Price Paul d'Arenberg privately. In 1864 the Baron James Mayer de Rothschild bought the painting and then put it up for auction again in March 1868 through the art-dealer Bourlon de Sarty. It was bought by Louis La Caze who died the very next year, leaving it to the Louvre. The painting still hangs there today.\n\nThe conservation status of the painting is relatively poor. With the help of X ray imaging cracked areas were restored, particularly in the sky and around the edges. Further investigations revealed that Antiope originally wore a cloth of modesty which was later removed. Whether the cloth and its subsequent removal were painted by Watteau himself is not clear. A later addition and removal is also possible. The X-ray imagery and especially Watteau's sketches and the copper engraving of Watteau's contemporary the Comte de Caylus confirm that the satyr was painted by Watteau, which was once controversial. The old theory that the final private owner, Louis La Caze had made alterations to the painting can also now be considered disproven.\n\nAfter its creation \"Jupiter and Antiope\" was repeatedly copied and reworked. Two copies by an unknown artist are preserved in the Louvre in the \"Service d’Etudes et de Documentation\".\n\nThe previously mentioned copper engraving of the Comte de Caylus was created in the lifetime of Watteau and was included in Jean de Jullienne's collection \"Figures de différents caractères\". He based his depiction not on the painting itself, but like most of his engravings on a drawing by Watteau which is now lost. A drawing of the painting by Gabriel de Saint-Aubin also existed which is today on display in the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe French painter Lucien Lévy-Dhurmer painted an invented \"View of Watteau's Studio\" in 1890, in which the \"Jupiter and Antiope\" features as one of the paintings on the walls. Another painting in which the painting appears as part of the composition is the \"Salle La Caze\" painted by Édouard Vuillard in 1922. Ernest Laurent copied the image as a grisaille and a free modern interpretation was made by Claude Schurr in 1966.\n\nPatrick Süskind's novel \"Perfume\" published by Diogenes Verlag since 1985 has a detail from \"Jupiter and Antiope\" on the cover with the armpit of the naked sleeper in the centre. This might symbolise the novel's central theme of fragrant seduction. The novel was an international best seller, translated into 46 languages, with 15 million copies sold. The same image has been used on all versions of the cover except the American paperback edition (where it was prohibited to depict a women's nipple), thus the book has made Watteau's Antiope famous worldwide.\n\nIn July 1971 Paraguay produced a postage stamp with the motif of the sleeping nymph.\n\nThe information in this article derives mostly from the works cited in the bibliography below, but the following sources were also used:\n"}
{"id": "50491040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50491040", "title": "Kachchhapaghata dynasty", "text": "Kachchhapaghata dynasty\n\n<mapframe text=\"Find spots of the Kachchhapaghata inscriptions\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"7\" longitude=\"78.14\" latitude=\"25.92\">\n</mapframe>\nThe Kachchhapaghatas (IAST: Kacchapaghāta) were an Indian dynasty that ruled between 10th and 12th centuries. Their territory included north-western parts of Central India (present-day Madhya Pradesh).\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"Kachchhapa-ghata\" (कच्छपघात) literally means \"tortoise killer\". The Kachchhapaghatas were originally the vassals of the Pratiharas and the Chandelas. After the death of the Chandela king Vidyadhara, the Chandela kingdom was weakened by repeated Muslim (Yamini) invasions. Taking advantage of this situation, the Kachchhapaghatas gave up their allegiance to the Chandelas. They became powerful towards the end of the 10th century.\n\nA Sasbahu temple inscription suggests that Lakshmana was the first prominent member of the dynasty. This inscription, as well as a 977 Sihoniya inscription state that his successor Vajradaman captured Gopadri (Gwalior) from the king of Gadhinagara, that is the Pratihara ruler of Kannauj. Vajradaman, described as the \"tilaka\" of the dynasty in Gwalior inscriptions dated 1093-94 and 1104, was probably the first powerful ruler of the dynasty. He served as a feudatory to the Chandela kings Dhanga and Vidyadhara.\n\nThe dynasty was divided into three branches, which ruled from Gwalior (Gopādrigiri), Dubkunda (Chaṇdobha), and Narwar (Nalapur). Virasimha (also Virasimharama or Virasimhadeva), a Kachchhapaghata ruler of Nalapura, issued a copper plate grant in 1120-21. This record describes him using the high-status royal title \"Maharajadhiraja\". Gold coins issued by him have also been discovered.\n\nAccording to bardic tradition, the last ruler of the dynasty was Tejaskarana (alias Dulha Rai or Dhola Rai), the hero of the romantic tale \"Dhola Maru\". This account states that he left Gwalior in 1128 to marry the daughter of a neighbouring ruler, after leaving Paramal-dev (or Paramardi-dev) in-charge of the Gwalior fort. When he returned to Gwalior, Paramal refused to hand over the fort to him, and founded the Parihara dynasty which ruled Gwalior for 103 years. The Parihara ruler over Gwalior is also attested the 1150 inscription of Ramdeo and 1194 inscription of Lohanga-Deva. However, other inscriptions suggest that the Kachchhapaghatas ruled the area at least until 1155 CE. In addition, 1192 and 1194 inscriptions found at Gwalior show that the Kachchhapaghata ruler Ajayapala controlled Gwalior in the later years as well. Thus, the bardic account is not completely reliable, and the Parihara chiefs probably ruled Gwalior as feudatories of the Kachchhapaghatas.\n\nSulakshanapala, the last ruler of the dynasty, appears to have lost his kingdom to a Ghurid invasion. The \"Tajul-Ma'asir\" suggests the Ghurid general Qutb al-Din Aibak invaded Gwalior in 1196, and extracted tribute from Sulakshanapala (whom \"Tajul-Ma'asir\" labels Solankhapala of Parihar family). The Ghurids took over the fort in the later years, and Qutb al-Din's son Iltutmish became its governor.\n\nThe bardic accounts such as \"Dhola Maru\" suggest that the Kachwaha dynasty of Amber originated from the Tejaskarana, the last ruler of the Narwar branch of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty. However, the Kachwaha inscriptions claim a different origin for their dynasty.\n\nThe following is a list of known Kachchhapaghata rulers, with estimate of their reigns:\n\nSimhapaniya (Sihoniya) and Gopadri (Gwalior) branch\n\n\nDubkund (Dobha) branch\n\n\nNalapura (Narwar) branch\n\n\nThe dynasty patronized Shaivism and Vaishnavism, but were tolerant towards Buddhism and Jainism. Several temples were constructed during their reign in Kadwaha.\n\nThe Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior are especially noted for their art and architecture. Kachchhapaghata ruler Mahipala commissioned the Sas-Bahu Temple at Gwalior. Records of two grants issued by him at Gwalior, dated 1093 and 1104 CE, have been found. Several silver and gold coins issued by him have also been discovered. Ajayapala (r. c. 1192–1194) had the Gangola tank of Gwalior desilted, as attested by a 1194 inscription.\n\nOther temples constructed by the Gwalior branch include the ones located at:\n\n"}

{"id": "21188298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21188298", "title": "Lake Ronkonkoma (lake)", "text": "Lake Ronkonkoma (lake)\n\nLake Ronkonkoma, Long Island's largest freshwater lake, is in Suffolk County, New York, United States, and has a circumference of about , and is across on average.\nA kettle lake formed by retreating glaciers, it is owned by the Town of Islip under the terms of the Nichols Patent. The land around it is controlled by three town governments - Smithtown, Islip and Brookhaven. The separation originated because three different Native American communities claimed lands on different shores, and these claims continued when the tribes gave separate deeds to the land under their control. The name Ronkonkoma comes from an Algonquian expression meaning \"boundary fishing-lake\", also earlier written as Raconkumake and Raconkamuck.\n\nSmithtown founder Richard Smith's original holdings included the headwaters of the Nissequogue River east to a \"freshwater pond called Raconkamuck,\" which translates as \"the boundary fishing place\" in the Algonquian language. What is now known as Lake Ronkonkoma served as a boundary between lands occupied by four Native American communities: Nissequogues, Setaukets, Secatogues and Unkechaugs.\n\nThe Smithtown side of the lake was settled by the 1740s, but it was not until the late 1890s that the area gained widespread public attention. That's when boarding houses and hotels were erected to accommodate a growing number of tourists drawn by claims that the lake's waters had special healing powers. By the 1920s, beach pavilions had sprung up. The Long Island Rail Road, which was completed to nearby Lakeland in 1842 (the depot was moved to Ronkonkoma in 1883), helped transform what had been a sleepy farming hamlet.\n\nThe Lake was created by a retreating glacier. Portions of its irregular basin are unusually deep for Long Island, but most of the lake is less than deep. As a rule of thumb, it is unproductive to fish deeper than in Lake Ronkonkoma because there is seldom enough dissolved oxygen to sustain fish beyond this depth.\nThe primary gamefish are Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.\n\nLake Ronkonkoma holds large Bass but locating them is a challenge due to the scarcity of natural structure to attract these fish. Chain pickerel are extremely rare. In the last two decades, white perch and yellow perch populations have increased to the point of upsetting the ecological balance of the lake.\nMaximum depth: . Area: :\n\n\nThere have been unsubstantiated rumors of Piranha being caught in the lake over the past 2 decades. The idea that schools of piranha are ravaging the depths of Lake Ronkonkoma is unfounded and highly unlikely, as there undoubtedly would have been more attacks on bathers and more evidence of devoured fish. Actual specimens \"caught\" in the lake (or at least presented by people in a glass jar in the mid-1990s) have been either proven to have not come from the lake, or have been Pacu, a different species that looks very similar but is harmless and has a limited presence in the lake. Bites that have been reported on feet and the lower body in shallow water are likely to have been caused by turtles, which also have a moderately strong presence in the lake and may have a tendency to bite when threatened or irritated.\n\nLake Ronkonkoma was a popular Long Island summer resort in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There were a few boarding houses in town. One of the hotels on the lake was the Lake Front Hotel situated on twenty-four acres of land on the lake's shore. Most of the original settlers and local residents chose to live away from the lakefront. The land one half mile or so beyond the lake was flatter and better suited for farming. Little by little, the lakefront developed into a fashionable haven for the wealthier people who had summer estates there.\n\nIn 1911, the Long Island Motor Parkway was completed from Queens to Lake Ronkonkoma. Traveling the winding Motor Parkway to reach the lake in those days was an adventure in itself.\n\nLake Ronkonkoma became an exclusive summer enclave for the wealthy and famous from New York City. All summer long there was boating and swimming at the lake. While the area's population peaked during the summers, fall activities such as hunting were also popular, although hunting activity began to decline in the 1930s. During the winters, skating parties were often arranged. A favorite game on the ice was Crack the Whip.\n\nThe perimeter of the lake itself began to change from residential to commercial usage. As the lake front become less exclusive, many longtime residents began to leave the area. In the 1950s, the original owners began to sell their beaches to others. George Raynor, whose family had lived at the lake since the 1840s, owned a parcel of land which later became Raynor Beach. Many of the beach front pavilions, which were left unattended, burned down. On October 4, 1962, Brookhaven Town purchased land for the first town-owned beach on the lake. The unattended sections of beaches began to deteriorate. Rubbish, tin cans and bottles lined the shores in many places. Since the shoreline lay in between three townships, no single entity was willing to take responsibility. A Tri-Town Committee for the Preservation of Lake Ronkonkoma has been formed. The committee has agreed that the three towns would treat the pollution problems as a single problem, affecting all of the Long Island residents.\n\n"}
{"id": "2893723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2893723", "title": "Lectisternium", "text": "Lectisternium\n\nThe lectisternium was an ancient Roman propitiatory ceremony, consisting of a meal offered to gods and goddesses. The word derives from \"lectum sternere\", \"to spread (or \"drape\") a couch.\" The deities were represented by their busts or statues, or by portable figures of wood, with heads of bronze, wax or marble, and covered with drapery. It has also been suggested that the divine images were bundles of sacred herbs tied together in the form of a head, covered by a waxen mask so as to resemble a kind of bust, rather like the straw figures called Argei. These figures were laid upon a couch (\"lectus\"), the left arm resting on a cushion (\"pulvinus\", whence the couch itself was often called \"pulvinar\") in the attitude of reclining. The couch was set out in the open street, and a meal placed before it on a table.\n\nLivy says that the ceremony took place \"for the first time\" in Rome in the year 399 BC, after a pestilence had caused the Sibylline Books to be consulted by the \"duumviri sacris faciundis\", the two (later 15) priestly officials who maintained the archive. Three couches were prepared for three pairs of gods — Apollo and Latona, Hercules and Diana, Mercury and Neptune. The feast lasted for eight (or seven) days, and was also celebrated by private individuals. The citizens kept open house, quarrels were forgotten, debtors and prisoners were released, and everything done to banish sorrow.\n\nSimilar honors were paid to other divinities in subsequent times: Fortuna, Saturnus, Juno Regina of the Aventine, the three Capitoline deities (Jupiter, Juno, Minerva). In 217 BC, after the Roman defeat at Lake Trasimene, a lectisternium was held for three days to six pairs of gods, corresponding to the Twelve Olympians of ancient Greek religion: Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Mars, Venus, Apollo, Diana, Vulcan, Vesta, Mercury, Ceres.\n\nIn 205 BC, alarmed by unfavorable prodigies, the Romans were ordered to fetch the Great Mother of the gods from Pessinus in Phrygia; in the following year the image was brought to Rome, and a lectisternium held. In later times, the lectisternium became a constant or even daily occurrence, celebrated in the different temples. Occasionally the \"Draping of Couches\" was part of Roman Triumph celebrations. Aulus Hirtius reports that Julius Caesar was greeted with \"draped dining couches\" following his victory in Gaul, in anticipation of a forthcoming triumph. Such celebrations must be distinguished from those which were ordered, like the earlier lectisternia, by the Sibylline Books in special emergencies.\n\nIn the Imperial era, chairs were substituted for couches in the case of goddesses, and the lectisternium in their case became a \"sellisternium\". This was in accordance with Roman custom, since in the earliest times all the members of a family sat at meals, and in later times at least the women and children. This is a point of distinction between the original practice at the lectisternium and the \"epulum Jovis\", the goddesses at the latter being provided with chairs, whereas in the lectisternium they reclined.\n\nIn Christian times the word was used for a feast in memory of the dead.\n\nOfferings of food were made to the gods in very early Roman times on such occasions as the ceremony of \"confarreatio\", and the \"epulum Jovis\" (often confounded with the lectisternium). The lectisternia, however, are likely of Greek origin. The Greek \"theoxenia\" (Θεοξένια) is similar, except that the gods played the part of host. The gods associated with it were either previously unknown to Roman religion, though often concealed under Roman names, or were provided with a new cult. Thus Hercules was not worshipped as at the Ara Maxima, where, according to Servius and Cornelius Balbus a lectisternium was forbidden. The Sibylline Books, which decided whether a lectisternium was to be held or not, were of Greek origin; the custom of reclining at meals was Greek.\n\nSome, however, assign an Etruscan origin to the ceremony, the Sibylline Books themselves being looked upon as old Italian \"black books.\" It may be that as the lectisternia became an almost everyday occurrence in Rome, people forgot their foreign origin and the circumstances in which they were first introduced, and then the word \"pulvinar\" with its associations was transferred to times in which it had no existence.\n\n\n"}

Dohan has a sharp wit and notable ability to find the unlikely joke\". In speaking toward her work with her co-stars, they wrote \"Their quick banter and easy back-and-forth are polished and at times charming, and together they make even the most disjointed material a pleasure to watch\". \"The New York Times\" also spoke well of \"Bath Party\", comparing Dohan to \"a younger, prettier, blonder Rosanna Arquette\", noting it as an essentially a one-woman show which \"focuses on her not particularly interesting efforts to jump-start an American career, complete with film and television clips, circumlocutory monologues and, perhaps most important for this particular performer, multiple opportunities to reveal her appealing anatomy\", and also praising the work of the few others in the cast.\n\nOf Dohan's work in the Anthony Neilson play \"Stitching\", \"The New York Times\" wrote \"With an actress as extremely gorgeous as Meital Dohan and a script that requires her to thrash around in ways most often seen in straight-to-video steamers, you would think that \"Stitching\" would be heating up the Wild Project theater to the boiling point.\" They found that it did not, blaming the Neilson script for working \"so hard at being gimmicky that it doesn’t give Ms. Dohan and her co-star, Gian Murray Gianino, a chance to find real chemistry. No chemistry, no combustion.\" They granted that the two leads \"give energetic, bruise-inducing performances under Timothy Haskell’s direction\", but that the script's manner of ricocheting \"from comedy to pathos to psychosis without ever really providing the starting point that any play needs\" placed too many demands on them.\n\nOf Dohan's work in the film \"Monogamy\", \"The Los Angeles Times\" stated, \"Meital Dohan has no lines in the indie thriller, but her sexy, mysterious presence helps propel the film ...\" It notes that even though the character has no lines in the film, she receives top billing.\n\n\n"}

The film follows an alien who comes to Earth on a research mission, but loses his remote to a thief, who later sells it to a godman. He befriends a television journalist and in his quest to retrieve the remote, questions religious dogmas and superstitions. The film stars Aamir Khan in the titular role with Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput, Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla and Sanjay Dutt in pivotal roles.\n\nAfter the success of \"3 Idiots\" (2009), Hirani and Joshi's began scripting their next project; finding similarities with the plot of \"Inception\" (2010), they scrapped the film. It was later rewritten with a different angle and tone. During production, the film was first titled \"Talli\" and later \"Ek Tha Talli\" before being changed to \"PK\" as the latter title was found too similar to \"Ek Tha Tiger\" (2012). The film's soundtrack was composed by Shantanu Moitra, Ajay−Atul and Ankit Tiwari with lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire, Amitabh Varma and Manoj Muntashir. UTV Motion Pictures acquired the distribution rights of the film.\n\n\"PK\" was released on 19 December 2014. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the performances, particularly Khan, and its portrayal of superstitions. Criticism was focused on the Anti-Hindu sentiment. The film received eight nominations at the 60th Filmfare Awards, winning two. Additionally, it won five Producers Guild Film Awards, and two Screen Awards. \"PK\" garnered the Telstra People's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.\n\nProduced on a budget of 85 crore, \"PK\" was the first Indian film to gross more than 7 billion and US$100 million worldwide. At the time, it emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, and ranks as the 70th highest-grossing film of 2014 worldwide. The film's final worldwide gross was .

He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in Bruges, an Indian Hindu woman Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets a Pakistani Muslim Sarfaraz (Sushant Singh Rajput) and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father (Parikshit Sahni) objects to their relationship citing religious differences. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla) who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding chapel, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the marriage due to cultural differences.\n\nJaggu returns to India and becomes a TV reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She saves him when he attempts to take money from a collection box, earning his trust. The alien tells her that he is a researcher from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication. They transfer ideas by holding hands. The alien learned to fit in with humans by wearing clothes and using money stolen from \"dancing cars\".\n\nIn a flashback, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt), who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute's (Reema Debnath) hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. Bhairon suggests him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behavior, people assume he is drunk and calls him \"peekay\" (Hindi for drunk). The alien names himself PK. People tell him that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. PK sincerely practices Indian religions attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.\n\nPK conjectures that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen, by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass-movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote control to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a \"wrong number\". Bhairon informs him that they will come to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack. The attack is later declared by Tapasvi's group to be stated as protecting their Gods.\n\nTapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God that created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realizes that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\n\nJaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy tells her that Sarfaraz still loves her, and is now living in Lahore. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced to return PK's remote. Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him.\n\nOne year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with several other members of his species (including one played by Ranbir Kapoor) .\n\nAfter the success of \"3 Idiots\", director Rajkumar Hirani and writer Abhijat Joshi started work for the next project. They had written a story about a character who had the ability to get into another person’s mind to make that person a better human being. They spent one year to write a story, but it turned out to be similar to \"Inception\". After watching \"Inception\", Hirani and Joshi were shocked by the similarities. Eventually, they decided to scrap the film, then Hirani and Joshi reworked on the script, changing the entire tone and angle. It took five years to make the film and three years to write it.\n\nIn \"PK\", Khan played nine avatars and, during the course of the film, the actor had to chew over 10,000 betelnut preparations called \"paan\". Betelnut is a psychoactive stimulant used throughout Asia and characterized by its ability to stain users' mouths red. \"In real life \"paan\" is not a habit, I have it once in a while but for this film I chew \"paan\" for every scene. I would at times eat about 100 \"paans\" in a day. We had a \"paanwala\" [a \"paan\" maker] on the sets,\" said Khan in the report. For every take, Khan had to eat a fresh \"paan\" to fill his mouth. Before beginning the shoot, he would eat at least 10–15 \"paans\" to get the right color inside his mouth and on his lips. Viral Thakkar was the visual effects supervisor. The visual effects company was Riva Digital at a point employing 100 artists working on the film.\n\nIn 2011, Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma signed on for the film. Khan's nephew Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were considered for a role which eventually went to Sushant Singh Rajput before the release of his debut movie \"Kai Po Che\". Earlier reports said that Rajkumar Hirani had signed Arshad Warsi for the film when it was reported that Arshad will be playing an important role. In 2013 Arshad said in an interview \"I couldn`t have worked out on dates. I wouldn't refuse Raju for anything. In fact when he offered me the film, I did not even ask for the script, I was like I am ready to come on whenever you want. So that is the connection I share with Raju.\" Before Sushant and Arshad were signed on, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were said to be cast in the film. Junaid Khan, son of Aamir Khan worked as an assistant director in this film.\n\n\nIn 2011, in its initial scripting stage, Rajkumar Hirani named the film 'Talli', then changed it to 'Ek Tha Talli' which he loved but later on came to know that 'Ek Tha Tiger' was already in production (released in 2012). He dropped the idea and, after many titles, he came up with a title that only had initials, 'PK'. After starting the film, Hirani felt PK was not a good enough title. He decided to change the title to 'Talli'. But after a few weeks of shooting, Hirani decided to go back to the original title.\n\nFirstpost compared \"PK\" to Hirani and Khan's previous collaboration \"3 Idiots\" (2009), as they both involve \"A socially awkward and 'different' young man—who walks and talks in a strange, enthusiastic childlike manner—observes the system, questions it, asks you to look at the many ludicrous things that inform it, and eventually brings about a minor revolution.\"\n\nAccording to Rajkumar Hirani, \"PK\" is a \"satire on Hindu god and their godmen\". The co-director Khan began looking for shooting locations in July 2012. Second unit filming was set to begin in late 2012, which was stalled after the rumoured departure of three department heads for the film and bad weather stalling initial shoots. Hirani denied rumours that the film would be delayed, stating that principal filming had always been intended to begin in mid-January 2013 in Delhi and Rajasthan to \"capture the winter of Delhi\".\n\nShooting officially began on 1 February 2013, with the filming scheduled to occur over a 45-day period. A 26-day schedule of shooting of \"PK\" started in Delhi from 27 September 2013.\n\nThe Movie was marketed by a Mumbai Based company named Spice PR owned by Prabhat Choudhary. In July 2014, the makers released a motion poster of the film, revealing the first look. It featured Aamir Khan posing almost nude, with only a radio cassette recorder covering his genitals.\n\nThe second motion poster was released on 20 August 2014. It features Aamir in a red angrakha teamed up with white pyjama and a trumpet in his hand. Aamir said at the launch of the second poster \"There is a story in each and every image that we reveal. We will have a poster campaign and we will reveal eight to 10 posters till the time the film releases.\"\n\nThe third motion poster was released on 15 September 2014. This time launched Sanjay Dutt as Bhairon Singh. In this poster, Aamir Khan asks the viewers, \"Why are you staring? It's not me. It's my friend—Bhairon Singh.\" In the poster, Aamir is seen wearing an oversized police uniform.\n\nThe fourth motion poster featuring Anushka Sharma was released on 16 October 2014. In the poster Anushka is dressed like Aamir holding a transistor and introducing herself as Jagat Janini after she is seen wearing a plain T-shirt, shorts, and long white dress.\n\nThe makers unlocked a teaser trailer on 23 October 2014. It achieved 3.4 million views on YouTube within five days, subsequently receiving 12 million views. It has been regarded as the most viewed movie trailers on YouTube. The teaser was attached with the film \"Happy New Year\". The makers also released the videos of behind-the-scenes like making of the movie, characters, songs, \"PK\" funnies, \"PK\" ki bhasha, dialogue promos and battery recharge dance of Aamir and Anushka on YouTube.\nIn August the makers found a new promotional strategy to interact with the audiences by introducing talking standees. This was the first time a Bollywood film used a talking standee at varied locations as a part of its promotions. The standee had Aamir Khan talking to people in a prominent places in popular theatres and multiplexes.\n\nOn 7 December 2014, Aamir Khan began the city tour for promotions with Patna. The character he plays speaks in Bhojpuri which is the main language used for communication in Bihar. Aamir said at the event \"I have decided to launch the promotional campaign of my film ‘PK’ from Bihar to connect with the language. My character speaks Bhojpuri in the film.\" Hence, the actor decided to start his promotional schedule from Bihar. Although he wanted to visit Bhojpur, which is 60 kilometers from Bihar, he could not because of security issues. In Bihar he visited the Litti Chokha stall to try the authentic flavor of the city. The Litti Chokha stall owner has renamed his stall in Aamir’s name when he visited him last year, and Aamir couldn’t leave the city without visiting the stall again. Then the crew proceeded to Varanasi where they had a screening of their film \"3 Idiots\" and they interacted with the people one-to-one. Aamir Khan made an impromptu visit to Krishana Paan shop to savor a Banarasi pan. The actor specially removed time from his schedule to visit this place. He enjoyed a \"mitha banarasi paan\" there. After the crew visited Delhi, Ahemdabad, Raipur, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore, Bangalore and other locations in India. Aamir and makers also promoted the film in Dubai.\n\nIndiagames, a part of Disney India’s Interactive business, announced the launch of the official mobile game ‘PK’ based on the film. On 14 December 2014, Aamir Khan, Anushka Sharma, Rajkumar Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Siddharth Roy Kapur, managing director of Disney India and Sameer Ganapathy, VP and head, Interactive of Disney India launched the game at the Reliance Digital Store in Juhu amidst much fanfare.\n\n\"PK\" was earlier scheduled to release on 6 June 2014. The director (who is also editor of the film), Rajkumar Hirani, wanted to spend more time editing. Besides, some portions with Sanjay Dutt were yet to be shot. Also, the second season of \"Satyamev Jayate\" was to kick off from March. So Aamir Khan was not sure if he would be able to promote \"PK\" in June. Hence the makers settled for a December release.\n\n\"PK\" was released on 19 December 2014, as the 200th Bollywood release in 2014. The release was later expanded to 6000 screens worldwide, which included 5200 screens in India and 844 screens overseas.\n\n\"PK\" was initially released in 4844 screens worldwide. \"PK\" has been made tax-free in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. \"PK\" is the widest Indian movie released in the U.K. (198 screens), Pakistan (over 70 screens), Australia (35 screens) and outside of India (844 screens in over 40 overseas markets). \"PK\" was released theatrically in China on 22 May 2015 across 4,600 screens.

{"id": "157909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157909", "title": "Repentance", "text": "Repentance\n\nRepentance is the activity of reviewing one's actions and feeling contrition or regret for past wrongs, which is accompanied by commitment to change for the better. Today, it is generally seen as involving a commitment to personal change and the resolve to live a more responsible and humane life. In other words, being sorry for one's misdeeds. But it can also involve sorrow over a specific sin or series of sins that an individual feels he or she has committed. The practice of repentance plays an important role in the soteriological doctrines of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, in which it is often considered necessary for the attainment of salvation. Analogous practices have been found in other world religions as well. In religious contexts, it often involves an act of confession to God or to a spiritual elder (such as a monk or priest). This typically includes an admission of guilt, a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible. As such, it can be seen as having a certain relationship to modern day therapeutic practices though it clearly differs in its particulars.\n\nIn Biblical Hebrew, the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs: שוב \"shuv\" (to return) and נחם \"nacham\" (to feel sorrow). In the New Testament, the word translated as 'repentance' is the Greek word μετάνοια (\"metanoia\"), \"after/behind one's mind\", which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta' (after, with), and the verb 'noeo' (to perceive, to think, the result of perceiving or observing). In this compound word, the preposition combines the two meanings of time and change, which may be denoted by 'after' and 'different'; so that the whole compound means: 'to think differently after'. \"Metanoia\" is therefore primarily an after-thought, different from the former thought; a change of mind and change of conduct, \"change of mind and heart\", or, \"change of consciousness\". metanoia: change of mind, repentance\nOriginal Word: μετάνοια, ας, ἡ\nPart of Speech: Noun, Feminine\nTransliteration: metanoia\nPhonetic Spelling: (met-an'-oy-ah)\nShort Definition: repentance, a change of mind\nDefinition: repentance, a change of mind, change in the inner man.\n\nThe doctrine of repentance as taught in the Bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another. The repentance (\"metanoia\") called for throughout the Bible is a summons to a personal, absolute and ultimate unconditional surrender to God as Sovereign. Though it includes sorrow and regret, it is more than that. It is a call to \"conversion\" from self-love, self-trust, and self-assertion to obedient trust and self-commitment to God. It is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions, attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a Godly lifestyle and biblical commands, and an intentional turning toward doing that which the Bible says pleases God. In repenting, one makes a complete change of direction (180° turn) toward God. The words \"repent,\" \"repentance,\" and \"repented\" are mentioned over 100 times in the Bible.\n\nRepentance typically requires an admission of guilt for committing a wrong or for omitting to do the right thing; a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong or the omission where possible.\n\n says, \"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.\"\n\nRabbinic Jewish literature contains extensive discussions on the subject of repentance. Many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world, so that it was one of the seven provisions which God made before the Creation. \"The Holy One, blessed be His name, said to Elijah, 'Behold, the precious gift which I have bestowed on my world: though a man sins again and again, but returns in penitence, I will receive him.' \" \"Great is repentance: it brings healing into the world\"; \"it reaches to the throne of the Lord\"; \"it brings redemption\"; \"it prolongs man's life\"; Talmud Yoma 86a).\n\"Repentance and works of charity are man's intercessors before God's throne\". Sincere repentance is equivalent to the rebuilding of the Temple, the restoration of the altar, and the offering of all the sacrifices.\n\nSincere repentance is manifested when the same temptation to sin, under the same conditions, is ever after resolutely resisted. \"He that confesses his sin and still clings to it is likened to a man that holds in his hand a defiling object; though he batheth in all the waters of the world he is not cleansed; but the moment he casteth the defiling object from him a single bath will cleanse him, as it is said: 'Whosoever confesses and forsakes them [his sins] shall have mercy' \".\n\nAccording to Jewish doctrine, repentance is the prerequisite of atonement. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, derives its significance only from the fact that it is the culmination of the ten penitential days with which the Jewish religious year begins; and therefore it is of no avail without repentance Though man ought to be penitent every day, the first ten days of every year are the acceptable time announced by the prophet Isaiah: \"Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near\".\n\nRepentance and the Day of Atonement only absolve one from sins committed against God; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained.\n\nNo one need despair on account of his or her sins, for every penitent sinner is graciously received by God. Jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late, even on the day of death, to return to God with sincere repentance for \"as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself, so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner\". Jewish doctrine states that the hand of God is continually stretched out to receive a sinner. One view in the Talmud holds that a repentant sinner attains a more exalted spiritual eminence than one who has never sinned. It is a sin to taunt a repentant sinner by recalling their former sinful ways.\n\nRepentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the Middle Ages. Bahya ibn Paquda devotes a special section to it in his 'Hovot ha-Levavot\", \"Gate of Repentance.\" Maimonides devotes the last section of \"Sefer ha-Madda'\" in his Mishneh Torah to the subject. One of the most significant medieval works on Repentance is \"Shaarei Teshuva,\" the \"Gates of Repentance\" by Rabbeinu Yona of Gerona.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, repentance generally leads to salvation. In some cases, individuals or nations repent of their sins and are spared God's judgment. Sometimes the punishment avoided is destruction in this life, and sometimes it is damnation. In the Book of Jonah, the prophet initially chose to disobey God's command, and then he repented and became obedient. However, Jonah returned to disobedience when he hoped for the destruction of the city of Nineveh. The Hebrew term \"teshuvah\" (lit. \"return\") is used to refer to \"repentance\". This implies that transgression and sin are the natural and inevitable consequence of man's straying from God and His laws, and that it is man's destiny and duty to be with God. The Bible states that God's loving-kindness is extended to the returning sinner.\n\nThe Torah (five books of Moses) distinguishes between offenses against God and offenses against man. In the first case, the manifestation of repentance consists in: (1) Confession of one's sin before God, the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again. (2) Making certain prescribed offerings. Offenses against man require, in addition to confession and sacrifice, restitution in full of whatever has been wrongfully obtained or withheld from one's fellow man, with one-fifth of its value added thereto. If the wronged man has died, restitution must be made to his heir; if he has no heir, it must be given to the priest who officiates at the sacrifice made for the remission of the sin.\n\nThere are other manifestations of repentance mentioned in the Bible. These include pouring out water, which symbolizes the pouring out of one's heart before God; prayer self-affliction, as fasting; wearing sackcloth; sitting and sleeping on the ground. However, the Prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance, insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner's mental and spiritual attitude. \"Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth him of the evil\". In , the Bible states that repentance brings pardon and forgiveness of sin. Apart from repentance, no other activities, such as sacrifices or religious ceremonies can secure pardon and forgiveness of sin.\n\nIn the New Testament, one of many examples of repentance in the New Testament can be found in the parable of the prodigal son found in . Other instances of repentance included water baptism, restitution, and the burning of occultic possessions.\n\nRepentance appears prominently in the Scriptures. See the description of repentance in the Hebrew Bible above for repentance in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, the first command that Jesus gave was to repent. He thus repeated the message of John the Baptist. Jesus sent out disciples who \"proclaimed that people should repent\". In his Pentecost sermon, Peter the Apostle called on people to repent, an appeal he repeated in his sermon at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple: \"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out\". Paul the Apostle likewise testified \"both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God\" and said that \"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent\".\n\nThe Greek word used for repentance in the New Testament is μετάνοια (\"metanoia\"), and the Greek verb for \"to repent\" is μετανοῶ, contracted from μετανο-έω (\"metano-eo\"), as in Mark's account of the initial preaching of Jesus: \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; \"repent\", and believe in the good news.\"\n\nIn English, the prefix \"meta\" can indicate \"beyond, about\", as \"meta-economics\" or \"meta-philosophy\" (see meta), inspired by the non-Greek use of the word \"metaphysics\", which in Greek was just the title of a work of Aristotle, the \"Metaphysics\", so named simply because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following the \"Physics\"; the Greek word thus meant nothing more than \"[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] \"Physics\"\". In Greek, composite words that have μετα- (\"meta-\") as the initial element are most frequently used \"of \"change\" of place, condition, plan, etc.\", as in the English word \"metamorphosis\". Even in a non-religious context, the Greek word μετάνοια (\"metanoia\"), in particular, meant \"change of mind or heart, repentance\" or, in rhetoric, \"afterthought, correction\".\n\nThe Augsburg Confession, (known in Latin as Confessio Augustana), is the primary confession of faith used in the Lutheran Church. It is one of the most important documents of the Protestant Reformation. It divides repentance into two parts:\n\n\nIn the Calvinist tradition within Protestantism, there is a threefold idea involved in true repentance. The Protestant reformer John Calvin wrote that repentance \"may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to God, proceeding from a serious fear of God, and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man, and in the vivification of the Spirit.” He further said that \"it will be useful to amplify and explain the definition we have given; in which there are three points to be particularly considered\".\n\nIn the first place, when we call repentance 'a conversion of the life to God', we require a transformation, not only in the external actions, but in the soul itself; which, after having put off the old nature, should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its renovation... \nIn the second place, we represented repentance as proceeding from a serious fear of God. For before the mind of a sinner can be inclined to repentance, it must be excited by the knowledge of the Divine judgment.\nIt remains for us, in the third place, to explain our position, that repentance consists of two parts—the mortification of the flesh and the vivification of the spirit... Both these branches of repentance effects our participation of Christ. For if we truly partake of his death, our old man is crucified by its power, and the body of sin expires, so that the corruption of our former nature loses all its vigor... If we are partakers of his resurrection, we are raised by it to a newness of life, which corresponds with the righteousness of God.\" [Quotes from \"A Compend of the Institutes of the Christian Religion\" by John Calvin edited by Hugh T. Kerr, The Westminster Press-Philadelphia 1939.]\n\nThe word \"tawbah\" (repentance) in Arabic literally means 'to return', and is mentioned in the Quran. In an Islamic context, it refers to the act of leaving what Allah has prohibited and returning to what he has commanded. The act of repentance can redeem the sins and give the opportunity to go to heaven:\n\nAlthough repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins, the Quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of Shirk, i.e. the act of worshiping another deity besides Allah. The believing person must repent for shirk sin and seek the forgiveness of Allah. Two verses are giving comments regarding Shirk, \"An-Nisaa\" 4:48 and 4:116.\n\nIslam does not accept the concept of original sin; instead, it teaches that a person is born in a state of innocence and pure belief. The person remains in that state of sinlessness until reaching the age of puberty, after which he is accountable for his sins.\n\nThe Buddha considered shame over doing wrong (Pali: \"hiri\") and fear of the consequences of wrongdoing (Pali:\"otappa\") as essential safeguards against falling into evil ways and further as extremely useful in the path of purification. Also recommended was the regular practice of self-assessment or wise reflection (Pali: \"yoniso manasikara\") on one's own actions in relation to others and the bigger picture.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is Samantabhadra's Repentance Verse taken from Chapter 40 of the Flower Adornment Sutra:\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\n\"Hooponopono\" (ho-o-pono-pono) is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with (repentance) prayers. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the South Pacific, including Samoa, Tahiti and New Zealand.

The school is the site of the first cathedral west of the Missouri River and east of the Rockies, the 1851 \"log cathedral\" of Bishop John Baptist Miège, S.J., Apostolic Vicar of Pope Pius IX known familiarly as \"The Bishop East of the Rockies\".\n\nThe 465 acre (1.9 km²) college had been operated by the Jesuit order as a seminary since 1931, when the entire theology faculty of Saint Louis University left that school and transferred to St. Mary's. It closed in 1968 as the Jesuit order reoriented itself to other commitments.\n\nIn 1978, the Society of Saint Pius X acquired the property along with 12 major buildings. The school is now incorporated in Kansas as \"The Society of Saint Pius X, Saint Mary's, Inc.\" It has no direct ties with the previous St. Marys College.\n\nAs of 2014, the Academy had enrollment of over 800 students K-12 and the two-year college had an enrollment above 90 in a liberal arts curriculum. St. Mary's does not have a seminary program.

{"id": "23771524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23771524", "title": "Seneca's Consolations", "text": "Seneca's Consolations\n\nSeneca's Consolations refers to Seneca’s three Consolatory works, \"De Consolatione ad Marciam\", \"De Consolatione ad Polybium\", \"De Consolatione ad Helviam\", written around 40–45 AD.\n\nSeneca’s three Consolatory works, \"De Consolatione ad Marciam\", \"De Consolatione ad Polybium\", and \"De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem\", were all constructed in the \"Consolatio\" Literary Tradition\", dating back to the fifth century BC. The Consolations are part of Seneca’s Treatises, commonly called Dialogues, or Dialogi. These works clearly contain essential principles of Seneca’s Stoic teachings. Although they are personal addresses of Seneca, these works are written more like essays than personal letter of consolation. Furthermore, although each essay is particular in its address of consolation, the tone of these works is notably detached. Seneca seems more preoccupied with presenting facts of the universe and the human condition instead of offering solace. This detachment may be a result of Seneca’s attempt to gain favor and contrive a return from exile through these Consolatio works, instead of merely offering a friendly hand of comfort.\n\nIn \"De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem\", Seneca writes his mother to console her on his recent exile to Corsica. In this work, Seneca employs many of the rhetorical devices common to the \"Consolatio Tradition\", while also incorporating his Stoic Philosophy. Seneca is the consoler and the one inflicting suffering in this work, and notes this paradox in the text.\n\nSeneca was charged with adultery with Julia Livilla, sister of Emperor Caligula in 41 AD. He was shortly after exiled to Corsica. Scholars have concluded that the \"De Consolatione ad Helviam\" is dated roughly 42/43 AD. In the text, Seneca tells his mother he does not feel grief, therefore she should not mourn his absence. He refers to his exile merely as a ‘change of place’ and reassures her his exile did not bring him feelings of disgrace. Seneca comments on his mother’s strong character as a virtue that will allow her to bear his absence.\n\nSeneca’s seemingly positive outlook on his own exile follows his Stoic philosophy teachings that one should not be upset by uncontrollable events. This quote from \"De Consolatione ad Helviam\", shows Seneca’s presentation of his life as tolerable, and even spiritually enjoyable.\nI am joyous and cheerful, as if under the best of circumstances. And indeed, now they are the best, since my spirit, devoid of all other preoccupations, has room for its own activities, and either delights in easier studies or rises up eager for the truth, to the consideration of its own nature as well as that of the universe…\n\nSeneca wrote \"De Consolatione ad Polybium\" approximately 43/44 AD, during his years in exile. Scholars often refer to this work as the definitive representation of the part of Seneca’s life he spent in exile. This Consolatio addresses Polybius, Emperor Claudius’ Literary Secretary, to consol him on the death of his brother. The essay contains Seneca’s Stoic philosophy, with particular attention to the inescapable reality of death. Although the essay is about a very personal matter, the essay itself doesn’t seem particularly empathetic to Polybius’ unique case, but rather a broader essay on grief and bereavement. In fact, the reader doesn’t ever find out the name of Polybius’ deceased brother. One scholar claims that the \"De Consolatione ad Polybium\" is an attempt by Seneca to contrive his return from exile. (Rudich) This letter to Polybius clearly tries to gain his favor, and as well as flatter the Emperor Claudius, ironically seeking to draw empathy for himself in the process:\nAs many tears as are left to me by my own fortune I do not refuse to shed lamenting yours. For I will manage to find in my eyes, exhausted as they are by my private crying, some that still may pour out, if this will do you any good.\n\nIn the text of \"De Consolatione ad Polybium\", Seneca encourages Polybius to distract himself from grief with his busy work schedule. The tonal switch from consoling Polybius to flattery of Emperor Claudius occurs in chapter 12. (Ball) Seneca credits the emperor as the source of his ‘high station’ and as the giver of his, ‘pleasure of being able to perform duties.’ (Ball) Seneca then delves into a series of prayers of devotion and flattery, which invoke long life for the emperor. This switch is sudden, abrupt, and incongruent with Seneca’s Stoic philosophy. (Rudrich) It appears almost desperate in its presentation. In fact, the tone is so recognizably changed, some scholars claim other authorship besides Seneca. (Ball) However, it is most widely accepted that the tonal switch in \"De Consolatione ad Polybium\" was nothing more than Seneca’s desperate attempt to escape exile and return from Corsica. (Rudich)\n\n\"De Consolatione ad Marciam\" (\"On Consolation to Marcia\") is a work by Seneca written around 40 AD. Like Seneca’s other Consolatory works, this Consolation is constructed in the \"Consolatio\" tradition, and takes the form of an essay versus a personal letter. Seneca was most likely motivated to write this letter of consolation to Marcia in order to gain her favor; Marcia was the daughter of a prominent historian, Aulus Cremutius Cordus, and her family’s enormous wealth and influence most likely inspired Seneca to write this letter of consolation. Through the essay he sticks to philosophical abstractions concerning Stoic precepts of life and death. For a letter offering solace, he notably lacks empathy toward Marcia's individual grief and loss.\n\nMarcia actively mourned the death of her son Metilius for over three years. In \"De Consolatione ad Marciam\", Seneca attempts to convince her that the fate of her son, while tragic, should not have been a surprise. She knew many other mothers who had lost their sons; why should she expect her own son to survive her? The acknowledgement, even expectation, of the worst of all possible outcomes is a tenet of Seneca's Stoic philosophy. While Seneca sympathised with Marcia, he reminded her that \"we are born into a world of things which are all destined to die,\" and that if she could accept that no one is guaranteed a just life (that is, one in which sons always outlive their mothers), she could finally end her mourning and live the rest of her life in peace.\n\nthe inhabited world... in huge conflagration it will burn and scorch and burn all mortal things... stars will clash with stars and all the fiery matter of the world... will blaze up in a common conflagration. Then the souls of the Blessed, who have partaken of immortality, when it will seem best for god to create the universe anew… will be changed again into our former elements. Happy, Marcia, is your son who knows these mysteries! (Seneca, \"Ad Marciam de Consolatione\")\n\nSeneca contrasted two models of maternal grieving: that of Octavia Minor, sister of Augustus, who, on losing her only son Marcellus in his twenties, \"set no bounds to her tears and moans\"; with that of Livia, wife of Augustus, who on losing her son Drusus \"as soon as she had placed him in the tomb, along with her son she laid away her sorrow, and grieved no more than was respectful to Caesar or fair Tiberius, seeing that they were alive.\"\n\nSeveral of Seneca's \"Moral Epistles\" are also consolations. Two of the consolations are addressed to Lucilius: \"Epistle\" 63 consoles him on the death of his friend Flaccus; \"Epistle\" 93 consoles him on the death of the philosopher Metronax. \"Epistle\" 99 consists largely of a copy of a letter Seneca wrote to his friend Marullus, following the death of his \"little son.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "165511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165511", "title": "Ulama", "text": "Ulama\n\nThe Arabic term ulama (; ', singular ', \"scholar\", literally \"the learned ones\", also spelled \"ulema\"; feminine: \"alimah\" [singular] and \"uluma\" [plural]), according to the Encyclopedia of Islam (2000), in its original meaning \"denotes scholars of almost all disciplines\". More specifically, in the context of Sunni Islam, ulama are regarded as \"the guardians, transmitters and interpreters of religious knowledge, of Islamic doctrine and law\".\n\nBy longstanding tradition, ulama are educated in religious institutions \"(madrasas)\". The Quran, \"sunnah\" (authentic hadith), \"qiyas\" (analogical reasoning, for Sunni Islam) or \"'aql\" (\"dialectical reasoning\", for Shia Islam), \"ijma\" (juridical consensus) are the sources of traditional Islamic law.\n\nOver time, the intellectual discourse and teachings of the ulama have significantly contributed to the debates in the Muslim public sphere, and still do so to the present day. Increasingly, the traditional scholars of Islam are becoming prominent actors in contemporary Muslim societies and politics.\n\nStudents did not associate themselves with a specific educational institution, but rather sought to join renowned teachers. By tradition, a scholar who had completed his studies was approved by his teacher. At the teacher's individual discretion, the student was given the permission for teaching and for the issuing of legal opinions \"(fatwa)\". The official approval was known as the \"ijazat at-tadris wa 'l-ifta\" (\"license to teach and issue legal opinions\"). Through time, this practice established a chain of teachers and pupils who became teachers in their own time.\n\nThe traditional place of higher education was the madrasa. The institution likely came up in Khurasan during the 10th century AD, and spread to other parts of the Islamic world from the late 11th century onwards. The most famous early madrasas are the Sunni Niẓāmiyya, founded by the Seljuk vizir Nizam al-Mulk (1018–1092) in Iran and Iraq in the 11th century. The Mustansiriya, established by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mustansir in Baghdad in 1234 AD, was the first to be founded by a caliph, and also the first known to host teachers of all four major madhhab known at that time. From the time of the Persian Ilkhanate (1260–1335 AD) and the Timurid dynasty (1370–1507 AD) onwards, madrasas often became part of an architectural complex which also included a mosque, a Sufi ṭarīqa, and other buildings of socio-cultural function, like baths or a hospital.\n\nMadrasas were merely (sacred) places of learning. They provided boarding and salaries to a limited number of teachers, and boarding for a number of students out of the revenue from religious endowments \"(waqf)\", allocated to a specific institution by the donor. In later times, the deeds of endowment were issued in elaborate Islamic calligraphy, as is the case for Ottoman endowment books \"(vakıf-name)\". The donor could also specify the subjects to be taught, the qualification of the teachers, or which madhhab the teaching should follow. However, the donor was free to specify in detail the curriculum, as was shown by Ahmed and Filipovic (2004) for the Ottoman imperial madrasas founded by Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nAs Berkey (1992) has described in detail for the education in medieval Cairo, unlike medieval Western universities, in general madrasas had no distinct curriculum, and did not issue diplomas. The educational activities of the madrasas focused on the law, but also included what Zaman (2010) called \"Sharia sciences\" \"(al-ʿulūm al-naqliyya)\" as well as the rational sciences like philosophy, astronomy, mathematics or medicine. The inclusion of these sciences sometimes reflect the personal interests of their donors, but also indicate that scholars often studied various different sciences.\n\nEarly on in Islamic history, a line of thought developed around the idea of mysticism, striving for the perfection \"(Ihsan)\" of worship. Originating out of Syria and Iraq rather than the Hijaz, the idea of Sufism was related to devotional practices of eastern Christian monasticism, although monastic life in Islam is discouraged by the Quran. During the first Islamic century, Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (642–728 AD) was one of the first Muslim scholars to describe, according to Albert Hourani (1991) \"the sense of the distance and nearness of God ... in the language of love\". During the 7th century, the ritual of Dhikr evolved as a \"way of freeing the soul from the distractions of the world\". Important early scholars who further elaborated on mysticism were Harith al-Muhasibi (781–857 AD) and Junayd al-Baghdadi (835–910 AD).\n\nThe early Muslim conquests brought about Arab Muslim rule over large parts of the Hellenistic world. During the time of the Umayyad Caliphate, at latest, the scholars of the emerging Islamic society had become familiar with the classical philosophical and scientific traditions of the world they had conquered. The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language initiated a period which is known today as the Islamic Golden Age. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes al-Kindi (c. 801–873 AD), \"the father of Islamic philosophy\", as follows:\n\"We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples. For him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than truth itself.\"\nThe works of Aristotle, in particular his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like Al-Farabi (870–950 AD), Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992 AD) and Ibn Sīnā (ca. 980–1037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the \"sharia\". The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses \"was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought\". As exemplified by the works of al-Razi (854–925 AD), during later times, philosophy \"was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion\".\n\nThe founder of Islamic philosophical ethics is Ibn Miskawayh (932–1030 AD) He combined Aristotelian and Islamic ethics, explicitly mentioning the Nicomachean Ethics and its interpretation by Porphyry of Gaza as the foundation of his philosophical thoughts.\n\nIn the 12th century, the early Islamic Neoplatonism which had developed out of Hellenistic philosophy was effectively criticised by al-Ghazali, one of the most influential scholars of Islam. In his works \"Ahāfut al-Falāsifa\" (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), \"Mizan al-'amal\" (Criterion of Action) and \"Kimiya-yi sa'ādat\" (The Alchemy of Happiness), he refuted the Philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, and demonstrated that the Aristotlean ethics is incompatible with Islamic ethics: The latter is based on the belief in God and in life after death, which together provide the foundation of action in the pursuit of \"sa'āda\" (Happiness).\n\nAccording to Shia Islam, the authority to interpret the messages of the Quran and the Hadith lies with the Imamah, a line of infallible interpreters of the truth. The Sunni majority, however, reject this concept and maintain that Gods Will has been completely revealed in the Quran and \"sunnah\" of the Prophet. The capacity of its interpretation lies with the ulama.\n\nBy the eleventh century, the major schools of law \"(madhhab)\" had emerged. Whilst, historically, the schools were at times engaged in mutual conflicts, the differences became less controversial over time, and merely represent regional predominances today. The four most important of them are:\n\nShia madhhab include the Ja'fari and Zaidi schools. Minor madhhab also mentioned in the Amman message are the Ibadi and the Zahiri schools.\n\nAll Sunni \"madhhabs\" recognize four sources of \"sharia\" (divine law): the Quran, \"sunnah\" (authentic hadith), \"qiyas\" (analogical reasoning), and \"ijma\" (juridical consensus). However, the \"madhhabs\" differ from each other in their conception of the Principles of Islamic jurisprudence, or \"uṣūl al-fiqh\", as briefly summarised by Hourani (1991). The Hanbalis only accepted the consensus of the Companions of the Prophet \"(aṣ-ṣaḥābah)\", which gave more leeway to independent reasoning \"(ijtihad)\" within the boundaries of the rules of \"qiyās\". The Hanafis hold that strict analogy may at times be supported by a limited use of juristic preference \"(istihsan)\", whereas the Maliki school also allows pragmatic considerations in the interest of public welfare \"(istislah)\" are also acceptable. Instead of the Sunni concept of analogy \"(qiyās)\", Shia ulama prefer \"dialectical reasoning\" \"('Aql)\" to deduce law.\n\nThe body of substantive jurisprudence \"(fiqh\") defines the proper way of life through interpretation of \"sharia\", which Muslims should follow if they want to live according to God's will. Over time, the \"madhhabs\" established \"codes of conduct\", examining human actions in the light of the Quran and Hadith. Supplementing the sharia were customs \"(ʿurf)\" within a given society. Islamic law and regional customs were not opposed to each other: In 15th century Morocco, qadis were allowed to use a process called \"ʻamal\" in order to choose from different juridical opinions one which applied best to the local customs, even if they were not supported by the consensus of the majority. More often, the use of sharia led to changes in local customs.\n\nʿIlm al-Kalām, the \"science of discourse\", also termed \"Islamic theology\", serves to explain and defend the doctrine of the Quran and Hadith. The concept of \"kalām\" was introduced during the first Islamic centuries by the Muʿtazila school. One of the most prominent scholars of the Muʿtazila was Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad (935–1025 AD). From the 11th century on, the Muʿtazila was suppressed by the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate and the Seljuk Empire, but it continued playing an important role in the formation of Shia theology. The Ash'ari school encouraged the use of Kalām as the basis of fiqh, and was followed in this approach by parts of the Shafi'i madhhab. In contrast, the Hanbali and Maliki madhhabs discouraged theological speculation. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (853–944 AD) developed his own form of Kalām, differing from the Ash'ari view in the question of Man's free will and God's omnipotence. Maturidi Kalām was often used in combination with Hanafi fiqh in the northwestern parts of the Islamic world.\n\nA distinct school of theology often called traditionalist theology emerged under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal in the early centuries of Islam among hadith scholars who rejected rationalistic argumentation. In the wake of the Ash'arite synthesis between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, its original form survived among a minority of mostly Hanbalite scholars. While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni \"orthodoxy\", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.\n\nIslamic theology experienced further developments among Shia theologians.\n\nThe study of, and commentaries on Quran and hadith, debates about \"ijtihad\" and \"taqlid\" and the issuing of \"fatwa\" as well as the use of Arabic, and later also Persian as common languages of discourse constituted the religious authority of the ulama throughout the entire Islamic world. Zaman (2010) has demonstrated that, as personal contacts were key to acquiring knowledge, Islamic scholars sometimes travelled far in search of knowledge \"(ṭalab al-ʿilm)\". Due to their common training and language, any scholars travelling from one region of the Islamic world to another could easily integrate themselves into the local Muslim community and hold offices there: The traveller Ibn Baṭūṭah (1304–1368 or 1369), born in Tangiers, Morocco, to a family of ulema, was appointed qadi by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi. Nuruddin ar-Raniri (d. 1658), born to a Gujarati Muslim family, travelled to, and worked as Shaykh ul-Islam in modern-day Indonesia under the protection of Iskandar Thani, Sultan of Aceh. Both scholars were able to move freely in an \"interconnected world of fellow scholars\". According to Zaman, their offices and positions as respected scholars were only questioned if they proved themselves unfamiliar with local customs (as happened to Ibn Baṭūṭah]), or met resistance from opponents with stronger local roots (ar-Raniri).\n\nThrough their travels and teachings, ulama were able to transmit new knowledge and ideas over considerable distances. However, according to Zaman (2010), scholars were often required to rely on commonly known texts which could support their \"fatwas\". A text which might be widely known within the intellectual circles of one region could be unknown in another. The ability of scholars from one region to support their argument in another might therefore be limited by the familiarity with the respective texts of the community they were working in. Likewise, in an era without book print or mass communication media, a scholar's reputation might remain limited if he was unfamiliar with the local canon of texts. As the \"ijazah\", the scholar's approval by another master, was key to the scholar's reputation, the latter would be greater in regions where the approving masters were more widely known.\n\nThe formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with pragmatic issues of authority and teaching than with theory. Progress in theory began to develop with the coming of the early Muslim jurist Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book \"ar-Risālah\". The book details the four roots of law (Qur'an, Sunnah, \"ijma\", and \"qiyas\") while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) must be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.\n\nAccording to Feldman (2008), under many Muslim caliphate states and later states ruled by sultans, the ulama were regarded as the guardians of Islamic law and prevented the Caliph from dictating legal results, with the ruler and ulama forming a sort of \"separation of powers\" in government. Laws were decided based on the \"Ijma\" (consensus) of the Ummah (community), which was most often represented by the legal scholars.\n\nThe Sunni Ottoman, and the Shi'a Safavid Persian dynasties, rulers of the two opponent early modern Islamic empires, both relied on ulama in order to legitimise their power. In both empires, ulama patronised by the royal courts created \"official\" religious doctrines which supported the dynastic rule. At the high points of their political power, respectively, the development took different paths: The Ottoman Sultan Süleyman I successfully integrated the imperial ulama into the imperial bureaucracy, and Ottoman secular law into Islamic law. In contrast, Shah Abbas I of Persia was unable to gain similar support by the Shi'a ulama, who retained a more independent position. During the late Safavid empire, the Shi'a ulama developed into one of the warrantors of continuity in a period of instability of the central government, thus securing a relative independency which they retained during the reign of subsequent dynasties.\n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the leaders and subjects of the Ottoman Empire became increasingly aware of its role as a great power of its time. This new self-awareness was associated with the idea to legitimise the new political role by linking the religious scholarship to the political system: Ottoman historians of the 15th and 16th century like Ibn Zunbul or Eyyûbî, described the deeds of the Ottoman sultans in terms of idealised Islamic ghazi warriors. According to Burak (2015), the Ottoman literature genres of the \"rank order\" ( and the \"biografic lexicon\" () compiled the biographies of scholars in such ways as to create a concise and coherent tradition of the doctrine and structure of the Ottoman imperial scholarship. During the 16th century, scholars like the Shaykh al-Islām Kemālpaşazade (d. 1534), Aḥmād b. Muṣṭafā Taşköprüzāde (1494–1561), Kınalızāde ʿAli Çelebi (d. 1572) and Ali ben Bali (1527–1584) established a seamless chain of tradition from Abu Hanifa to their own time. Explicitly, some authors stated that their work must not only be understood as the historiography of the Hanafi madhhab, but that it should be consulted in case of eventual disagreements within the school of law. This exemplifies their purpose to establish a canon of Hanafi law within the Ottoman imperial scholarship. which modern Ottomanists termed the \"Ottoman Islam\".\n\nAfter 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror (1432–1481) had established eight madrasas in former Byzantine church buildings, and later founded the \"sahn-ı şeman\" or \"Eight courtyards madrasa\", adjacent to the Fatih mosque, where he brought together the most distinguished Islamic law scholars of his territory. In his 2015 study on the \"second formation of Islamic law\", Burak has shown in detail how the Ottoman state gradually imposed upon the traditional ulama a hierarchy of \"official imperial scholars\", appointed and paid by the central government. From the conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo in 1517 onwards, the Ottoman ulama set up their own interpretation of the Sunni Hanafi doctrine which then served as the official religious doctrine of the empire. The formal acknowledgment by decree of the sultan became a prerequisite to issue fatwas. In the 17th century, the annalist al-Hamawi used the expression \"sultanic mufti\" \"(al-ifta' al-sultani)\" to delineate the difference between the officially appointed religious leaders and those who had followed the traditional way of education. Other authors at that time called the Ottoman law scholars \"Hanafi of Rūm [i.e., the Ottoman Empire]\" \"(Rūmi ḫānāfi)\", \"Scholars of Rūm\" \"(ʿulamā'-ı rūm)\" or \"Scholars of the Ottoman Empire\" \"(ʿulamā' al-dawla al-ʿUthmaniyyā)\". The Shaykh al-Islām \"()\" in Istanbul became the highest-ranking Islamic scholar within, and head of the ulama throughout the empire.\n\nThe ulama in the Ottoman Empire had a significant influence over politics because it was believed that secular institutions were all subordinate to Islamic law, the Sharia \"()\". The ulama were responsible for interpreting the religious law, therefore they claimed that their power superseded that of the government. Within the Ottoman hierarchy of ulama, the Shaykh al-Islām held the highest rank. He exerted his influence by issuing fatwas, his written interpretations of the sharia had authority over the entire Ottoman population. In the 16th century, as the support by the ulama of the sultan and the central government was essential for shaping the still-growing empire, the importance of the office rose, and its power increased. As members of the \"Ilmiye\", the imperial scholars were part of the Ottoman elite class of the Askeri, and were exempt from any taxes.\n\nHowever, by approving scholars and appointing them to offices, over time the sultan's influence increased over the religious scholars, although, as a Muslim, he still stood under the Islamic law. Even the Shaykh al-Islām was subordinate to the sultan; his position, like the ranks of the muftis, was described as a \"service\" () or \"rank\" ( or \"paye-ı Sahn\"), to which a candidate was appointed or elevated. Sometimes, the sultans made use of their power: In 1633, Murad IV gave order to execute the Shaykh al-Islām Ahīzāde Ḥüseyin Efendi. In 1656, Shaykh al-Islām Ḥocazāde Mesʿud Efendi was sentenced to death by sultan Mehmed IV.\n\nThe use of the Sunni Islam as a legitimisation of the Ottoman dynastic rule is closely linked to Sultan Süleyman I and his kazasker and later Schaykh al-Islām Ebussuud Efendi. Ebussuud compiled an imperial book of law \"(ḳānūn-nāme)\", which combined religious law \"(sharīʿah)\" with secular dynastic law \"(ḳānūn)\" in the person of the sultan. For example, Ebussuud provided a reason why the government could own land, or could levy and increase taxes, as the government was responsible for the protection of the common good of all Muslims.\n\nShaikh Ṣāfī ad-Dīn Isḥāq Ardabīlī (1252–1334) was the founder of the Safaviyya tariqa. Safi ad-Din's great-great grandson Ismail, who from 1501 onwards ruled over the Persian Empire, was the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Shah Ismail I proclaimed the Twelver Shi'a as the new Persian state religion. To propagate the Safavid faith, he invited ulama from Qom, Jabal 'Āmil in southern Lebanon and Syria to travel around Iran and promote the Shi'a doctrine. In 1533, Shah Tahmasp I commissioned a new edition of the Safvat as-safa, Shaikh Ṣāfī's genealogy. It was rewritten in order to support the royal family's claim at descendency from Musa al-Kadhim, the Seventh Imam, and thus to legitimise the Safavid rule.\n\nDuring the reign of Shah Abbas I (1571 – 1629 AD), the argument of the theocratic unity of religious and political power was no longer sufficient to legitimise the Shah's authority: Shi'a ulama renounced the monarch's claim to represent the hidden Imam by teaching that descendancy did not necessarily mean representation. Likewise, as the influence of Sufi mysticism weakened, the Shah's role as the head of the Safaviyya lost its significance as a justification for his political role. Abbas I thus sought to associate himself with eminent ulama like Shaykh Bahāʾi (1574–1621 AD), whom he made Shaykh al-Islām in his new capital, Isfahan. Other famous ulama working under Abbas's patronage were Mir Damad (d. 1631 or 1632 AD), one of the founders of the School of Isfahan, and Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ardabili (d. 1585). By their teachings, they further developed the Shi'a Islamic teachings and religious practice. However, as religion did no longer suffice to support political power in Persia, Abbas I had to develop independent concepts to legitimise his rule. He did so by creating a new \"ghulam\" army, thus evoking the Turco-Mongol tradition of Timur and his reign.\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, the Ottoman ulama still retained their political influence. When sultan Selim III tried to reform the Ottoman army, the ulama opposed his plans, which they rejected as an apostasy from Islam. Consequently, his reform failed. However, Selims successor Mahmud II (r. 1808–1839) was more successful: He called the new troops, organised according to European models, by the name \"Victorious army of Muhammad\" \"(Asâkir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye)\". By doing so, he was able to overcome the accusation of apostasy and secure the ulama's support. Mahmuds reforms created a new imperial elite class who spoke Western European languages and were knowledgeable of the Western European societies and their political systems. As the political and economic pressure increased on the Ottoman Empire in the course of the 19th century, this new elite carried on the Sultan's reforms and helped initiating a new era of reform, the Tanzimat. In parallel, the political influence of the ulama was circumvented and reduced step by step. A ministry for religious endowments was created in order to control the finances of the vakıf. Thus, the ulama lost direct control over their finances, which significantly reduced their capacity to exert political influence.\n\nIn Iran, a period of political instability began with the collapse of the Safavid reign after shah Sultan Husayns death in 1722. In the light of the discontinuity and fragmentation of the central government, two social groups maintained continuity and, consequently, rose in power: Tribal chieftains established, amongst others, the Khanates of the Caucasus, the Afsharid and Zand dynasties. The second group who benefitted from the weakness of the central authority was the Shi'a ulama. According to Garthwaite (2010), \"the ulama constituted one institution that not only provided continuity, but gradually asserted its role over and against royal authority.\" A process of change began which continued throughout the 19th century and into the present.\n\nAlready some of the last Safavids, Sulayman Shah (r. 1666–1694) and Tahmasp II (r. 1722–1732) had sought the ulama's support in an attempt to strengthen their authority. Particularly, they associated themselves with a group of ulama who supported the \"official\" Twelver Shi'a doctrine, established by the Iranian Shaykh al-Islām Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (1627–1699) during the later decades of Safavid rule. The dispute between the Twelver Shi'a and Mir Damad's (d. 1631 or 1632) and Ṣadr ad-Dīn Muḥammad Shīrāzī's (c. 1571/2 – 1640) School of Isfahan, who promoted Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy, continued throughout the 18th century, and shaped the relationship between ulama and government during the reigns of the subsequent dynasties.\n\nWith the accession of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar to the Iranian throne, the Qajar dynasty consolidated the central power. However, the Qajar Shahs, in particular Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–1896), whose reign paralleled that of the Ottoman Sultans of the Tanzimat time, failed at obtaining central control over the ulama. The Shiite scholars retained their political influence on the Persian society. They also maintained unrestricted access to the financial resources from the religious endowments. In addition, the Islamic Zakat tax was paid to individual imams and not to state-sponsored tax collectors. Both their religious influence and their financial means allowed the Shiite ulama to act, at times, against the Shah. Thus, under the Qajar dynasty, the ulama provided a source of religious legitimacy and served as interpreters of religious law in a dual legal system where the state administered law based on custom \"(ʻurf)\".\n\nStarting in the first half of the 19th century, direct contacts began and gradually increased between members of the ulama and modern Western Europe. The Egyptian alim Rifa'a al-Tahtawi (1801–1873) was amongst the first members of the ulama who travelled to Europe. As a religious counsellor to a delegation by the Egyptian khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha he stayed in Paris from 1826 to 1831. His report \"The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris\" \"(Taḫlīṣ al-ibrīz fī talḫīṣ Bārīz)\" (1849) included some outlines of future reforms and potential improvements in his native country. Although al-Tahtawi had gone through the traditional education of an alim, his interest focused on modern French concepts of administration and economy. He only referred to Islam in order to emphasize that Muslims can adopt practical knowledge and insights from Europe. As such, at-Tahtawis report reflects the political efforts of Muhammad Ali Pasha, who did not intend to reform al-Azhar university, but aimed at building an independent educational system sponsored by his government.\n\nHayreddin Pasha (1822/3–1890) was an Ottoman Tunisian alim and statesman who reformed the administration and jurisdiction of the province. He was able to explain his ideas in French (\"Réformes nécessaires aux États musulmans\" – Necessary reforms of the Muslim states. Paris, 1868), which he had learned whilst representing his sovereign Ahmad Bey at the court of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1855. In contrast to al-Tahtawi, Hayreddin Pasha used the religious concept of the Muslim collective interest \"(maṣlaḥa)\" to make his point, thereby applying the idea of ijtihad to public affairs.\n\nPositions comparable to the Western Islamic ulama were also taken in the Eastern parts of the Islamic world by Syed Ahmad Khan, the pioneering Muslim modernist in South Asia, and Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī. The latter is regarded as the mentor of Pan-Islamism, but also as one of the founders of the political Islam and of the late 19th and 20th century Salafi movement.\n\nThe Egyptian Grand Mufti Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905), who was granted the degree of 'Alim by al-Azhar university in 1877, was the first who used the term Islāh in order to denote political and religious reforms. Until 1887 he edited together with al-Afghānī the newspaper \"al-ʿUrwa al-Wuthqā\" (\"The firm bond\"). The gazette widely spread the pan-islamistic concept of Islam representing a religious bond which was believed to be stronger than nationality or language. From 1876 on, ʿAbduh edited the newspaper \"al-Ahrām\". Since 1898, he also edited, together with Rashīd Ridā (1865–1935), the newspaper \"al-Manār\" (\"The Beacon\"), in which he further developed his ideas. \"al-Manār\" appeared in print for almost 40 years and was read throughout the Islamic world.\n\nʿAbduh understood Islah as a concept of \"reform of mankind\" \"(iṣlāḥ nauʿ al-insān)\". In his works, he emphasized the special importance of a reform of the traditional madrasa system, which was taken to disadvantage by the parallel establishment of the secular, state-sponsored educational system in Egypt. He strove at reconciling the traditional and modern educational systems, thereby justifying from the point of view of Islam the introduction of modern institutions by the national state. He referred to the Islamic concept of the collective interest or common good of the Muslim community \"(maṣlaḥa)\", to which he accorded overarching importance \"(al-maṣlaḥa shar)\" in the interest of his fellow Muslims. The concept of \"islāh\" gained special relevance for the future, as it strives at understanding and justifying all aspects of modern life from the Islamic doctrine.\n\nAfter ʿAbduhs death in 1905, Rashīd Ridā continued editing \"al-Manār\" on his own. In 1924, he published a collection of writings by some ulama of Najd: \"Maǧmūʿat al-ḥadiṭ an-naǧdīya\". Thus, the teachings of the Yemeni alim Muhammad ash-Shawkani (1759–1839), which had already been discussed since the 1880s, gained greater publicity. Likewise, the writings of the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328) came to attention again. Ibn Taymiyyah's doctrine provided a link between the \"wahhabiyya\" and parts of the \"salafiyya\" movements. The theological differences between the two movements were altogether too large for a complete union of the two doctrines. However, the opening of the Salafi movement towards Wahhabism helped to reconcile the latter with the Islamic public after king Ibn Saud's invasion of the Hijaz in 1924. Central Arabian militia (\"Iḫwān\") had occupied and looted the holy towns of Mecca and Medina, thereby destroying monuments which they considered pagan \"(\"shirk\")\". Starting with the Pan-Islamic Congress in Mecca in 1926, the pro-Saudi movement developed into one of the most relevant currents of Islamic thought.\n\nIn his Egyptian exile, the Syrian alim ʿAbd ar-Rahmān al-Kawākibī (1854–1902) met al-Afghānī, ʿAbduh and Ridā. In his books \"Ṭabāʾiʿ al-istibdād\" (\"The nature of despotism\") and \"Umm al-Qurā\" (\"Mother of villages [i.e., Mecca]\", 1899) he accused the Ottoman sultan Abdülhamid II of corrupting the Islamic community. The Ottoman despotism \"encroaches on the rights of its citizens, keeps them ignorant to keep them passive, [and] denies their right to take an active part in human life\". Therefore, the law must be reformed. By the use of \"ijtihad\", a \"modern and unified system of law\" must be created, and \"proper religious education\" must be provided. Because of the central position of the Arabic peoples in the \"ummah\" and the Arabic language in the intellectual discourse, but also because \"Arabian Islam is ... free from modern corruptions and the bedouin are free from the moral decay and passivity of despotism\", the balance of power must shift from the Turks towards the Arabs. The Ottoman dynasty must give up their claim to the caliphate, and a new caliph of Quraysh descent must be elected by representatives of the \"ummah\". His temporal authority would be set up in the Hejaz, whilst he would hold religious authority over the entire Muslim community, \"assisted ... by a consultative council nominated by the Muslim rulers\".\n\nAl-Kawākibīs idea that the Arabian doctrine represented a more puristic form of the Islam, according to Cleveland and Bunton (2016), prepared the ground for the 20th century Arab nationalism as well as the Islamic renewal movement of the Nahda.\n\nIn 1912, the Muhammadiyah organization was founded in Yogyakarta, which, together with Nahdlatul Ulama (\"Reawakening of the ulama\"), founded in 1926, form the two largest Muslim organizations in the world. Since the 1930s, their religious boarding schools \"(\"pesantren\")\" also taught mathematics, natural sciences, English and history. Since the 1980, the Nahdlatul Ulama schools also offered degrees in economy, jurisdiction, paedagogical and medical sciences. In the 1990s, under their leader Abdurrahman Wahid, the organization adopted an anti-fundamentalistic doctrine, teaching democracy and pluralism.\n\nDarul Uloom Deoband, next to al-Azhar one of the most influential madrasas, was founded in the city of Deoband, Uttar Pradesh, in 1867. Initially, the intention of the school was to help Indian Muslims, who had become subjects of the British Empire after 1857, to lead their lives according to Islamic law. The Deobandi propagate a Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school, which was the most prevalent madhhab in South Asia. Still today, they aim at a revival of the Islamic society and education. Following the example of Deoband, thousands of madrasas were founded during the late 19th century which adopted the Deobandi way of studying fundamental texts of Islam and commenting on Quran and Hadith. By referring back to traditional Islamic scholars, the Deobandi School aims at defending the traditional Islamic madhhab, especially the Hanafi, against criticism which arose from other Islamic schools like the Ahl-i Hadith. During the 1990s, the Afghan \"taliban\" also referred to the Deoband School. Ashraf Ali Thanwi (1863–1943) is one of the most prominent teachers of Darul Uloom Deoband. Thanwi initiated and edited multi-volume encyclopedic commentaries on the Quran. However, he was also able to reach out to a larger audience: His book Bahishti Zewar, which is still widely read in South Asia, as it details, amongst other topics, the proper conduct and beliefs for Muslim women.\n\nAhl-i Hadith is a movement which emerged in North India in the mid-19th century. By rejecting \"taqlid\" (following legal precedent) and favoring \"ijtihad\" (independent legal reasoning) based on the foundational scriptures of Islam, they oppose the traditional madhhab and criticize their reliance on legal authorities other than the traditional texts. The Ahl-i Hadith was the first organization which printed and spread the works of Muhammad ash-Shawkani, whose writings did also influence the doctrine of the Salafi movement in the Arab Middle East and worldwide.\n\nIn most countries, the classical institution of the madrasa as a place of teaching remained largely intact until the beginning of the 20th century. In the Western parts of the Islamic world, national states arose from the disintegration and partition of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The government of kemalist Turkey sought to distance the nation from the religious traditions and institutions of the Ottoman past.\n\nIn Egypt, the establishment of a state-controlled educational system had already begun in the 1820s. From 1961 onwards, Gamal Abdel Nasser tried to increase the state control over ancient Islamic institutions like al-Azhar university. The head of al-Azhar was – and still is – appointed directly by the president, and new faculties were created in this ancient Islamic institution.\n\nInitially giving rise to modernist reforms, up to a certain degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their independence from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria, in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government's attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely on the academic institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide social support and access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on large parts of the population, but actually increased their political influence and power.\n\nIn the kemalist Republic of Turkey, traditional Ottoman religious institutions were abolished like the Ottoman Caliphate, the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam, as well as the dervish brotherhoods. The Presidency of Religious Affairs (, or Diyanet) was created in 1924 by article 136 of the Constitution of Turkey by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey as a successor to the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam. From 1925 onwards, the traditional dervish tekkes and Islamic schools were dissolved. Famous convents like the Tekke of the Mevlevi order in Konya were secularized and turned into museums.\n\nIn Iran, contrary to many other Islamic countries, the Shi'a ulama had maintained their religious authority together with considerable sources of income by waqf endowments and the zakat tax. Thus, they maintained their ability to exert political pressure. Between 1905 and 1911, a coalition of ulama, bazaari, and some radical reformers incited the Persian Constitutional Revolution, which led to the establishment of the parliament (majlis) of Iran during the Qajar Dynasty. The Islamic Revolution in Iran was led by a senior Shia cleric—the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini—who established an Islamic Republic whose constitution calls for a cleric as the country's Supreme Ruler.\n\nIn his study on \"Religion and state in Syria\" (2013), Pierret pointed out how the training of Syria's ulama gradually became more institutionalised, based upon the traditional madrasa system: In 1920, the madrasa of the Khusruwiyah Mosque complex (which was to be destroyed in 2014 during the Syrian Civil War) introduced an entrance exam and a stable curriculum for its Islamic seminary. Graduates were issued a diploma carrying the name of the institution, which bore the signatures of all teachers, signifying individual \"ijazah\". In 1947, courses also included natural sciences and foreign languages. In 1947, the state-run \"Faculty of Sharia\" was initiated in Damascus by Kamil al-Qassab (1853–1954), a former student of Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) in Cairo. Until 1954, all Syrian ulama aiming at higher degrees had to join Al-Azhar University in Cairo. In 1954, however, Syria's first higher faculty of sharia was founded by members of the modernist wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. Its curriculum, which included economy and the \"current situation of the Muslim world\", according to Pierret, \"anticipated the 1961 modernist reform of al-Azhar by Nasser\". In 1972, the curriculum of the state-run \"Sharia high schools\" was reformed again, thus providing access for their students to all faculties of Syrian high schools.\n\nAccording to Pierret (2015), the Ba'ath Party coup of 1963 brought about a weakening of the state-controlled sharia high schools by the secular government. Many teachers of the Damascus faculty of sharia were forced into exile during the 1960s. Attempts of the regime during the 1980s at changing the curricula of the faculty and create a new \"Ba'athist ulama\" failed. The faculty, maintaining their ability to recruit competent teachers, was able to resist the political pressure. Consequently, the Syrian government prohibited the faculty to grant doctorates until 1998, and delayed the establishment of another faculty in Aleppo until 2006.\n\nIn 1961, Gamal Abdel Nasser put the Al-Azhar University under the direct control of the state. \"Azharis were given military uniforms and found themselves marching in step under the orders of army officers.\" After the independence of Algeria, President Ahmed Ben Bella also deprived the Algerian ulama of their power. repression in Iraq led to a drop of enrollment in the Shia holy cities of Iraq from 12,000 students in the early 1900s to only 600 scholars and students in 1977.\n\nWhen in the 1980s and 1990s the inner-Islamic conflict escalated in Pakistan between Sunnite and Shiite sectarians, Islamic organizations represented the religious and political frontiers, and spread their ideas in the madrasas which they sponsored. Graduates \"(talib)\" from North Pakistani madrasas like \"Mullah\" Mohammed Omar played a role in the establishment of the Afghan Taliban regime as well as in the development of the radical Islamic terrorism. Under the pressure of Islamic terrorism, the traditional Islamic educational system together with their ulama came into general disregard within the Western world.\n\nIslam, unlike Christianity, does not know a centralised process of ordination of its clergy. The traditional way of education and training relied largely on personal relationships between a teacher and his students. Whenever Islamic national governments tried to influence their regional ulama, they did so by controlling their income, or by establishing state-controlled schools and high schools. Traditional madrasas, representing merely decentralised \"places of learning\" and not institutions comparable to Western universities, often remained beyond state control. Whenever the state failed to control the resources of the madrasas, e.g., by controlling the income from religious endowments, or collecting Muslim taxes on behalf of the clergy, the ulama also retained the independence of their teaching. In particular, this held to be true in the Arabian provinces of the Ottoman Empire and the Arabian national states which arose out of the empire after the First World War.\n\nFor many people living in the poorer Islamic countries of today, especially those without natural resources like petroleum, the madrasa system, privately sponsored by foreign aid and not or insufficiently controlled by the state, often constitutes their only access to some form of education and social rise. Saudi Arabian humanitarian organizations use the madrasas they sponsor to spread their wahhabitic doctrine, whilst Shiite madrasas are frequently influenced by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Islamic revival originated largely from institutions which were financially independent from the state, and beyond its control. This led to a resurgence of the social and political influence of the traditional ulama in at least some countries. Insufficient state control over the educational institutions and the frequently insufficient qualification of the teachers remain an issue, as does the ideologic indoctrination and the future professional perspectives of the graduates.\n\nSome opinions from within the Muslim world have criticized the lack of scientific training of the ulama, and argued that those proficient in the sciences should qualify for this title. In Egypt, the Al-Azhar University has begun to introduce scientific and practical subjects in its traditional theological colleges to help the ulama face the challenges of the modern world. N. Hanif states:\nA religious hierarchy on the defensive against nationalists, secularists, modernists, apologists fundamentalists and romantics, and, possibly even in the bad books of the government of the day, trained only to transmit traditional knowledge in a parrot-like fashion is not likely to use its influence with the broad masses for the promotion of a modern approach to social and political life.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "249314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249314", "title": "Wreath", "text": "Wreath\n\nA wreath (\"pronunciation\": /ɹiːθ/) is an assortment of flowers, leaves, fruits, twigs, or various materials that are constructed to resemble a ring.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, wreaths are used typically as household ornaments, mainly as an Advent and Christmas decoration. They are also used in ceremonial events in many cultures around the globe. They can be worn as a chaplet around the head, or as a garland around the neck. Wreaths have much history and symbolism associated with them. They are usually made from evergreens and symbolize strength, as evergreens last even throughout the harshest winters. Bay laurel may also be used, and these wreaths are known as laurel wreath.\n\nThe word wreath comes from Middle English \"wrethe\" and from Old English \"writha\", \"band\".\n\nWreaths were a design used in ancient times in southern Europe. The most well-known are pieces of Etruscan civilization jewelry, made of gold or other precious metals. Symbols from Greek myths often appear in the designs, embossed in precious metal at the ends of the wreath. Ancient Roman writers referred to Etruscan \"corona sutilis\", which were wreaths with their leaves sewn onto a background. These wreaths resemble a diadem, with thin metal leaves being attached to an ornamental band. Wreaths also appear stamped into Etruscan medallions. The plants shown making the wreaths in Etruscan jewelry include ivy, oak, olive leaves, myrtle, laurel, wheat and vines.\n\nWreaths were worn as crowns by Etruscan rulers. The Etruscan symbolism continued to be used in Ancient Greece and Rome. Roman magistrates also wore golden wreaths as crowns, as a symbolic testament to their lineage back to Rome's early Etruscan rulers. Roman magistrates also used several other prominent Etruscan symbols in addition to a golden wreath crown: fasces, a curule chair, a purple toga, and an ivory rod.\n\nIn the Greco-Roman world, wreaths were used as an adornment that could represent a person’s occupation, rank, their achievements and status. The wreath that was commonly used was the laurel wreath. The use of this wreath comes from the Greek myth involving Apollo, Zeus’ son and the god of life and light, who fell in love with the nymph Daphne. When he pursued her she fled and asked the river god Peneus to help her. Peneus turned her into a laurel tree. From that day, Apollo wore a wreath of laurel on his head. Laurel wreaths became associated with what Apollo embodied; victory, achievement and status and would later become one of the most commonly used symbols to address achievement throughout Greece and Rome. Laurel wreaths were used to crown victorious athletes at the original Olympic Games and are still worn in Italy by university students who just graduated.\n\nOther types of plants used to make wreath crowns also had symbolic meaning. For example, oak leaves symbolized wisdom, and were associated with Zeus, who according to Greek mythology made his decisions while resting in an oak grove. The Twelve Tables, dating to 450 BC, refer to funeral wreaths as a long-standing tradition. Olive wreath was the prize for the winner at the ancient Olympic Games.\n\nHarvest wreaths, a common household decoration today, are a custom with ancient roots in Europe. The creation of harvest wreaths in Europe can be traced back to ancient times, and is associated with animistic spiritual beliefs. In Ancient Greece, the harvest wreath was a sacred amulet, using wheat or other harvested plants, woven together with red and white wool thread. The harvest wreath would be hung by the door year-round.\n\nHarvest wreaths were an important symbol to the community in Ancient Greece, not merely to the farmer and his family. The festivals devoted to Dionysus, the Oschophoria and Anthesteria, included a ritual procession called the \"eiresîonê\". A harvest wreath was carried to Pyanopsia and Thargelia by young boys, who would sing during the journey. The laurel or olive wreath would be hung at the door, and then offerings were made to Helios and the Hours. It was hoped that this ritual would bring protection against crop failure and plagues.\n\nIn Poland, the harvest wreath (\"wieniec\") is a central symbol of the Harvest Festival, \"Dozynki\". Wreaths are made of different shapes and sizes, using harvested grain plants, fruit and nuts. The wreath is then brought to a church for a blessing by a priest. The tradition includes a procession to the family home from the church, with a girl or young woman leading the procession and carrying the wreath. The procession is followed with a celebration and feast. Ukraine, Hungary, and other Eastern Europe cultures also have similar rituals that began as part of pre-Christian culture.\n\nIn Christianity, wreaths are used to observe the Advent season, in preparation for Christmastide and Epiphanytide, as well as to celebrate the latter two liturgical seasons. These wreaths, as with other Advent and Christmas decorations, are often set up on the first Sunday of Advent, a custom that is sometimes done liturgically, through a hanging of the greens ceremony. The Advent wreath was first used by Lutherans in Germany in the 16th century, and in 1839, Lutheran priest Johann Hinrich Wichern used a wreath made from a cart wheel to educate children about the meaning and purpose of Christmas, as well as to help them count its approach, thus giving rise to the modern version of the Advent wreath. For every Sunday of Advent, starting with the fourth Sunday before Christmas, he would put a white candle in the wreath and for every day in between he would use a red candle. The use of the Advent wreath has since spread from the Lutheran Church to many Christian denominations, and some of these traditions, such as the Catholic Church and Moravian Church, have introduced unique variations to it. All of the Advent wreaths, however, have four candles, and many of them have a white candle in the centre, the Christ candle, which is lit on Christmas Day. Advent and Christmas wreaths are constructed of evergreens to represent everlasting life brought through Jesus and the circular shape of the wreath represents God, with no beginning and no end. Advent and Christmas wreaths are now a popular symbol in preparation for and to celebrate the coming of Christ, with the former being used to mark the beginning of the Christian Church’s liturgical year and both serving as décor during Advent and Christmas festivities. While Advent wreaths are erected on stands or placed on tables, Christmas wreaths are often hung on doors or walls. Within Advent, the Church observes Saint Lucy's Day, the memorial of Saint Lucy, who is said to have brought \"food and aid to Christians hiding in the catacombs\" using a candle-lit wreath to \"light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible\"; as such, on this day, many young Christian girls dress as Saint Lucy, wearing a wreath on their head.\n\nThe symbolism of wreaths has been used at funerals since at least the time of Ancient Greece, to represent a circle of eternal life. Evergreen wreaths were laid at the burial place of early Christian virgin martyrs in Europe, the evergreen representing the victory of the eternal spirit over death.\n\nIn early modern England, a wreath custom existed for the funerals of \"young maidens\". A young woman of the same age as the one being mourned would lead the funeral procession, carrying a wreath of white flowers to represent the purity of the deceased, and \"that eternal crown of glory reserved for her in heaven\".\n\nBy the Victorian era, the symbolism of flowers had grown to become an elaborate language, and the symbolism of funeral wreaths was no exception. Flowers represented life and resurrection. Specific flowers were used in funeral wreaths to represent particular sentiments. Cypress and willow were used for crafting wreath frames, and were associated with mourning by the Victorians.\n\nWreaths are commonly laid at the tombs of soldiers and at memorial cenotaphs during Memorial Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies. Wreaths may also be laid in memory of persons lost at sea, either from an accident or due to navy action. In a memorial service at sea, the wreath is lowered to the water and set adrift.\n\nA wreath may be used as a headdress made from leaves, flowers and branches. It is typically worn in festive occasions and on holy days. Wreaths originally were made for use with pagan rituals in Europe, and were associated with the changing seasons and fertility. Christianity accepted the symbolism of the wreath based upon its Roman association with honour and moral virtue. During the Middle Ages, Christian art featured depictions of the Virgin Mary and various saints crowned with wreaths, much as figures from Roman and Greek mythology were depicted wearing wreaths, as well as Roman and Greek rulers and heroes.\n\nWreath customs in Europe have survived over many centuries. The observance of May Day in England includes Maypole festivities, culminating in a race by young unmarried men to climb to the top of the Maypole to capture the May Day wreath perched at the top of the pole. The winner of this contest would wear the wreath as his crown, and would be recognized as the May Day King for the rest of the holiday. Plants traditionally used to make Midsummer wreaths and garlands include white lilies, green birch, fennel, St. John's Wort, wormwood, vervain and flax. The flowers used in making the Midsummer wreath had to be picked early in the morning before the dew had dried; the belief was that once the dew dried, the magical properties of the plants evaporated with the dew.\n\nMidsummer celebrations are still observed in Germany and Scandinavia as well, with Maypoles and wreaths playing a prominent role, similar to England.\n\nBy the Renaissance period, wreaths became symbols of political and religious alliances in England. Protestant reformers such as the Puritans saw wreaths and the holidays they were associated with, such as May Day, as being pagan corrupting influences that destroyed healthy Christian morality. Soldiers confiscated wreaths in Oxford on May Day of 1648. During the Interregnum following the overthrow of Charles I of England, wreaths symbolized Royalist sympathies. In Bath, Somerset, the coronation of Charles II of England was marked with a procession of 400 maidens in white and green, carrying \"gilded crowns, crowns made of flowers, and wreaths made of laurel mixed with tulips\", and led by the mayor's wife.\n\nSaint Lucy is traditionally depicted in Christian artwork wearing a wreath as a crown, and on the wreath stand lit candles symbolizing the light of the world represented by Christ. Sweden in particular has a long history of observing Saint Lucy's Day (St. Lucia's Day). \"St. Lucia's crowns\", made of a brass wreath holding candles, are part of the customs associated with this holiday.\n\n"}
{"id": "1262099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1262099", "title": "Ājīvika", "text": "Ājīvika\n\nAjivika (IAST: ) is one of the nāstika or \"heterodox\" schools of Indian philosophy. Purportedly founded in the 5th century BCE by Makkhali Gosala, it was a śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete communities.\n\nOriginal scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature. Scholars question whether Ājīvika philosophy has been fairly and completely summarized in these secondary sources, as they were written by groups (such as the Buddhists and Jains) competing with and adversarial to the philosophy and religious practices of the Ajivikas. It is therefore likely that much of the information available about the Ājīvikas is inaccurate to some degree, and characterisations of them should be regarded carefully and critically.\n\nThe Ājīvika school is known for its \"Niyati\" (\"Fate\") doctrine of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists. They believed that in every living being is an \"ātman\" – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.\n\nFounded in what is now the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Ājīvika philosophy reached the height of its popularity during the rule of the Mauryan emperor Bindusara, around the 4th century BCE. This school of thought thereafter declined, but survived for nearly 2,000 years through the 14th century CE in the southern Indian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Ājīvika philosophy, along with the Cārvāka philosophy, appealed most to the warrior, industrial and mercantile classes of ancient Indian society.\n\nAjivika (\"Ājīvika\", Sanskrit: आजीविक) is derived from Ajiva (\"Ājīva\", आजीव) which literally means \"livelihood, lifelong, mode of life\". The term \"Ajivika\" means \"those following special rules with regard to Iivelihood\", sometimes connoting \"religious mendicants\" in ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts. \n\nAaseevagam (Tamil for Ajivika or Ajivikam) can be split as aasu + eevu + agam. Where \"aasu\" means errorless, verified and available knowledge, \"eevu\" means solutions and \"agam\" means the place. Ajivika means a place where solutions are provided for problems. \n\nThe name \"Ajivika\" for an entire philosophy resonates with its core belief in \"no free will\" and complete \"niyati\", literally \"inner order of things, self-command, predeterminism\", leading to the premise that good simple living is not a means to salvation or moksha, just a means to true livelihood, predetermined profession and way of life. The name came to imply that school of Indian philosophy which lived a good simple mendicant-like livelihood for its own sake and as part of its predeterministic beliefs, rather than for the sake of after-life or motivated by any soteriological reasons.\n\nSome scholars spell Ajivika as Ajivaka.\n\nĀjīvika philosophy is credited in ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism to Makkhali Gosala, a contemporary of the Buddha and Mahavira. Exact origins of Ājīvika is unknown, but generally accepted to be the 5th century BCE.\n\nPrimary sources and literature of the Ājīvikas is lost, or yet to be found. Everything that is known about Ājīvika history and its philosophy is from secondary sources, such as the ancient and medieval texts of India. Inconsistent fragments of Ājīvika history is found mostly in Jain texts such as the \"Bhagvati Sutra\" and Buddhist texts such as the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\", and Buddhaghosa's commentary on Sammannaphala Sutta, with a few mentions in Hindu texts such as Vayu Purana.\n\nThe Ājīvikas reached the height of their prominence in the late 1st millennium BCE, then declined, yet continued to exist in south India until the 14th Century CE, as evidenced by inscriptions found in southern India. Ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism mention a city in the 1st millennium BCE named Savatthi (Sanskrit \"Śravasti\") as the hub of the Ājīvikas; it was located near Ayodhya in what is now the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In later part of the common era, inscriptions suggests that the Ājīvikas had a significant presence in the South Indian state of Karnataka, prominently in Kolar district and some places of Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe Ājīvika philosophy spread rapidly in ancient South Asia, with a \"Sangha Geham\" (community center) for Ājīvikas on the island now known as Sri Lanka and also extending into the western state of Gujarat by the 4th century BCE, the era of the Maurya Empire.\n\nRiepe refers to Ājīvikas as a distinct heterodox school of Indian tradition. Raju states that \"Ājīvikas and Cārvākas can be called Hindus\", and adds that \"the word Hinduism has no definite meaning\". Epigraphical evidence suggests that emperor Ashoka, in the 3rd century BCE, considered Ājīvikas to be more closely related to the schools of Hinduism than to Buddhists, Jainas or other Indian schools of thought.\n\nMakkhali Gosala (Pali; Sanskrit \"Gośala Maskariputra\", c. 484 BCE) is generally considered as the founder of the Ājīvika movement. Some sources state that Gosala was only a leader of a large Ājīvika congregation of ascetics, but not the founder of the movement himself. The Swiss Indologist and others suggest the Ājīvika tradition existed in India well before the birth of Makkhali Gosala, citing a variety of ancient Indian texts.\n\nGosala was born in Magadha and was the son of Mankha, a professional mendicant. His mother was Bhaddā. His name Gosala \"cowshed\" refers to his humble birthplace.\n\nGosala is described in ancient texts as a contemporary of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, and of Gautama Buddha. The Jain \"Bhagavati Sutra\" refers to him as Gosala Mankhaliputta (\"son of Mankhali\"). The text depicts Gosala as having been a disciple of Mahavira's for a period of six years, after which the two had a falling out and parted ways. According to the \"Bhagvati Sutra\", Makkhali Gosala met with Mahāvīra again later in life, but Gosala asserted to Mahavira that he was not the same person. Makkhali Gosala referred to the example of a sesame plant which “had been pulled up, and had temporarily died, but it had been replanted and thus reanimated, becoming once more living, while the seven pods had developed”. Gosāla declared that the original Gosāla who was Mahavira's companion once was dead, and that the soul now inhabiting the apparent Gosāla in front of him was a reanimated, completely different Gosala. This argument was declared a form of sophistry by Mahavira, and this led to a significant break in the relations between the two.\n\nSeveral rock-cut caves belonging to Ājīvikas are dated to the times of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (r. 273 BC to 232 BC). These are the oldest surviving cave temples of ancient India, and are called the Barabar Caves in Jehanabad district of Bihar. The Barabar caves were carved out of granite, has a highly polished internal cave surfaces, and each consists of two chambers, the first is a large rectangular hall, the second is a small, circular, domed chamber. These were probably used for meditation.\n\nĀjīvikas competed with and debated the scholars of Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. The Ājīvika movement is primarily from historical references left behind in Jain and Buddhist sources, that may therefore be hostile to it. It is unknown to what degree the available non-Ājīvika sources reflect the actual beliefs and practices of the Ājīvikas. Most of what is known about them was recorded in the literature of rival groups, modern scholars question the reliability of the secondary sources, and whether intentional distortions for dehumanization and criticism was introduced into the records.\n\nMore recent work by scholars suggests that the Ājīvika were perhaps misrepresented by Jain and Buddhist sources.\nPaul Dundas states that the Jain and Buddhist texts cannot be considered reliable source of Ājīvika history and philosophy, because \"it seems doubtful whether a doctrine [of Ajivikas] which genuinely advocated the lack of efficacy of individual effort could have formed the basis of a renunciatory path to spiritual liberation\", and that \"the suspicion must be that the Jains and Buddhists deliberately distorted Ajivika doctrine for their own polemical purposes\". In contrast, other scholars suggest that at least the common elements found about Ājīvikas in Jain and Buddhist literature may be considered, because Jainism and Buddhism were two different, competing and conflicting philosophies in ancient India.\n\nThe problems of time and change was one of the main interests of the Ajivikas. Their views on this subject may have been influenced by Vedic sources, such as the hymn to \"Kala\" (Time) in Atharvaveda. Both Jaina and Buddhist texts state that Ājīvikas believed in absolute determinism, absence of free will, and called this \"niyati\". Everything in human life and universe, according to Ajivikas, was pre-determined, operating out of cosmic principles, and true choice did not exist. The Buddhist and Jaina sources describe them as strict fatalists, who did not believe in karma. The Ajivikas philosophy held that all things are preordained, and therefore religious or ethical practice has no effect on one’s future, and people do things because cosmic principles make them do so, and all that will happen or will exist in future is already predetermined to be that way. No human effort could change this \"niyati\" and the karma ethical theory was a fallacy. James Lochtefeld summarizes this aspect of Ajivika belief as, \"life and the universe is like a ball of pre-wrapped up string, which unrolls until it was done and then goes no further\".\n\nRiepe states that the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism does not mean that they were pessimistic. Rather, just like Calvinists belief in predeterminism in Europe, the Ajivikas were optimists. The Ajivikas simply did not believe in the moral force of action, or in merits or demerits, or in after-life affected because of what one does or does not do. Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.\n\nMakkali Gosala seems to have combined the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in \"niyati\" (destiny), \"svabhava\" (nature), and \"sangati\" (change), and possibly \"parinama\", which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as \"ahetuvadin\", \"vainayikavadin\", \"ajnanavadin\", and \"issarakaranavadin\". According to him all beings undergo development (\"parinama\"). This culminates in the course of time (\"samsarasuddhi\") in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of \"niyati\" (destiny), \"bhava\" (nature), and \"sangati\" (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to \"niyativada\" (fatalism) only in the sense that he thought that \"some\" future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.\n\nAjivikas were an atheistic philosophy. They did not presume any deity as the creator of the universe, or as prime mover, or that some unseen mystical end was the final resting place of the cosmos.\n\nIn later texts, the Tamil \"Nīlakēci\", a story of two divinities, Okkali and Ōkali, relates the Ājīvikas instructed men in the scriptures.\n\nAjivikas believed that in every being there is a soul (Atman). However, unlike Jains and various orthodox schools of Hinduism that held that soul is formless, Ajivikas asserted that soul has a material form, one that helps meditation. They also believed that the soul passes through many births and ultimately progresses unto its pre-destined \"nirvana\" (salvation). Basham states, that some texts suggest evidence of Vaishnavism-type devotional practices among some Ajivikas.\n\nAjivikas developed a theory of elements and atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism. Everything was composed of minuscule atoms, according to Ajivikas, and qualities of things are derived from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces.\n\nThe description of Ajivikas atomism is inconsistent between those described in Buddhist and Hindu texts. According to three Tamil texts, the Ajivikas held there exist seven \"kaya\" (Sanskrit: काय, assemblage, collection, elemental categories): \"pathavi-kaya\" (earth), \"apo-kaya\" (water), \"tejo-kaya\" (fire), \"vayo-kaya\" (air), \"sukha\" (joy), \"dukkha\" (sorrow) and \"jiva\" (life). The first four relate to matter, the last three non-matter. These elements are \"akata\" (that which is neither created nor destroyed), \"vanjha\" (barren, that which never multiplies or reproduces) and have an existence independent of the other. The elements, asserts Ajivika theory in the Tamil text Manimekalai, are made of \"paramanu\" (atoms), where atoms were defined as that which cannot be further subdivided, that which cannot penetrate another atom, that which is neither created nor destroyed, that which retains its identity by never growing nor expanding nor splitting nor changing, yet that which moves, assembles and combines to form the perceived.\n\nThe Tamil text of Ajivikas asserts that this \"coming together of atoms can take diversity of forms, such as the dense form of a diamond, or a loose form of a hollow bamboo\". Everything one perceives, states the atomism theory of Ajivikas, was mere juxtapositions of atoms of various types, and the combinations occur always in fixed ratios governed by certain cosmic rules, forming \"skandha\" (molecules, building blocks). Atoms, asserted the Ajivikas, cannot be seen by themselves in their pure state, but only when they aggregrate and form \"bhutas\" (objects). They further argued that properties and tendencies are characteristics of the objects. The Ajivikas then proceeded to justify their belief in determinism and \"no free will\" by stating that everything experienced – \"sukha\" (joy), \"dukkha\" (sorrow) and \"jiva\" (life) – is mere function of atoms operating under cosmic rules.\n\nRiepe states that the details of the Ajivikas theory of atomism provided the foundations of later modified atomism theories found in Jain, Buddhist and Hindu traditions.\n\nAnother doctrine of Ajivikas philosophy, according to Buddhist texts, was their antinomian ethics, that is there exist \"no objective moral laws\". Buddhaghosa summarizes this view as, \"There is neither cause nor basis for the sins of living beings and they become sinful without cause or basis. There is neither cause nor basis for the purity of living beings and they become pure without cause or basis. All beings, all that have breath, all that are born, all that have life, are without power, or strength, or virtue, but are the result of destiny, chance and nature, and they experience joy and sorrow in six classes\".\n\nDespite this ascribed premise of antinomian ethics, both Jain and Buddhist records note that Ājīvikas lived a simple ascetic life, without clothes and any material possessions.\n\nTamil literature on Ajivikas suggests that they practiced Ahimsa (non-violence) and a vegetarian lifestyle. Arthur Basham notes that Buddhist and Jaina texts variously accuse Ajivikas of immorality, unchastity and worldliness, but they also acknowledge the confusion among Buddhists and Jainas when they observed the simple, ascetic lifestyle of Ajivikas.\n\nThe Ajivika had a fully elaborate philosophy, produced by its scholars and logicians, but those texts are lost. Their literature evolved over the centuries, like other traditions of Indian philosophy, through the medieval era. The Pali and Prakrit texts of Buddhism and Jainism suggest that Ajivika theories were codified, some of which were quoted in commentaries produced by Buddhist and Jaina scholars.\n\nThe main texts of the Ajivikas included the ten \"Purvas\" (eight \"Mahanimittas\", two \"Maggas\") and the \"Onpatu Katir\". The \"Mahanimittas\" of Ajivikas, claims Bhagavati Sutra, was extracted from the teachings Gosala received from Mahavira, when he was a disciple.\n\nThe belief of Ajivikas in absolute determinism and influence of cosmic forces led them to develop extensive sections in their Mahanimittas texts on mapping the sun, moon, planets, stars and their role in astrology and fortune telling.\n\nIsaeva states that the ideas of Ajivika influenced Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism. Riepe states an example of an influential Ajivika theory was its theory on atomism. Basham suggests Ajivikas may have possibly influenced the medieval era doctrines of Dvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism.\n\nAccording to the 2nd century CE text \"Ashokavadana\", the Mauryan emperor Bindusara and his chief queen Shubhadrangi were believers of this philosophy, that reached its peak of popularity during this time. \"Ashokavadana\" also mentions that after his conversion to Buddhism, Bindusara's son Ashoka issued an order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana, enraged at a picture that depicted Gautama Buddha in a negative light. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.\n\nAn earlier Jaina text, the \"Bhagavati Sutra\", similarly mentions a debate, disagreement and then \"coming to blows\" between factions led by Mahavira and by Gosala.\n\n\n\n"}
