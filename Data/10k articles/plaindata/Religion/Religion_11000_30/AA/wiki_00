{"id": "39480702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39480702", "title": "Adam Kotsko", "text": "Adam Kotsko\n\nAdam Kotsko (born July 19, 1980) is an American writer, theologian, religious scholar, and translator, working chiefly in the field of political theology. He served as an Assistant Professor of Humanities at Shimer College in Chicago, which was absorbed into North Central College in 2017. He is especially known for his interpretative work on Slavoj Žižek and Giorgio Agamben, as well as his writing on American popular culture.\n\nKotsko's better-known works include \"Why We Love Sociopaths\" (2012), \"Awkwardness\" (2010), and \"Žižek and Theology\" (2008). He has published three translations of works by the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Kotsko is also known for his blogging, now in its second decade. He posts chiefly on a group blog titled \"An und für sich\", but continues to maintain his original blog, titled \"The Weblog\". Prior to the rise of blogging, he had maintained a blog-like website titled \"The Homepage\".\n\nAdam Kotsko was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in nearby Davison. He has credited his school experiences in Davison with giving him a love of literature.\n\nKotsko earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais, Illinois, in 2002. From there, he went on to the Chicago Theological Seminary (CTS), where he completed a Master of Arts degree in religious studies in 2005, with a thesis in the form of a translation and commentary on Jacques Derrida's essay \"Literature in Secret: An Impossible Filiation\".\n\nKotsko completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in theology, ethics, and culture at CTS in 2009. His doctoral dissertation was titled \"Atonement and Ontology\" and argued that an understanding of atonement theory requires a social-relational ontology. A modified version of his dissertation was published by Continuum International Publishing Group in 2010 under the title of \"The Politics of Redemption: The Social Logic of Salvation\".\n\nSoon after completing his doctorate in 2009, Kotsko began teaching at Kalamazoo College, a liberal arts college in Michigan. Initially a one-year appointment, it was subsequently extended to two.\nIn 2011, Kotsko was hired by Shimer College, a very small great-books college in Chicago. He was one of three new Shimer professors hired that year, the school's largest intake of new faculty in more than a decade. In his first year, he participated in a major reworking of the school's upper-level core Humanities courses. He also served on numerous committees in Shimer's unusual self-governance body, the Shimer College Assembly; in April 2013 he was additionally elected parliamentarian of the assembly. In 2016, after years of declining enrollment and financial difficulties, Shimer was acquired by North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, with plans to integrate it as the \"Shimer Great Books School\" within the college's academic structure.\n\nKotsko is known for his writings on the interpretation of the philosopher Slavoj Žižek, whom he has credited for causing him to \"break out of one particular intellectual ghetto and into another\" by changing his self-identification from \"non-Republican\" to leftist. His first published book was on Žižek, titled \"Žižek and Theology\" (the first volume of T&T Clark's \"Philosophy and Theology\" series). In a somewhat unusual circumstance for academic writers, it was published in 2008, before he had completed his dissertation. In 2012, Kotsko published a more popular article on \"How to Read Žižek\" in the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\", which was republished in Italian by \"Internazionale\".\n\nKotsko has also published three book-length translations of works by Italian theologian Giorgio Agamben. He has also published and delivered a number of papers on Agamben. He has argued that Agamben's \"Highest Poverty\", his translation of which was published in 2013, is \"ultimately about confronting neoliberalism.\"\n\nKotsko has published three short books on popular culture, \"Awkwardness: An Essay\" (2010), \"Why We Love Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television\" (2012), and \"Creepiness\" (2015). Each book draws out a specific theme found in contemporary U.S. TV shows; \"Awkwardness\" addressing the curious rise of \"awkward humor\" in the 21st century, \"Why We Love Sociopaths\" addressing the trend toward a certain type of deeply antisocial protagonist, and \"Creepiness\" uses a Freudian lens to distinguish a discomfiting strain of popular culture from the topic of the first book. The trilogy was greeted with general acclaim, with the \"Oxonian Review\" declaring that \"\"Awkwardness\" is just what a work of philosophy should be\", and Scott Berkun describing \"Why We Love Sociopaths\" as \"a second cousin to Postman’s classic \"Amusing Ourselves to Death\".\" \"Why We Love Sociopaths\", however, also drew criticism for its admittedly non-technical use of the term sociopathy.\n\nThe success of \"Awkwardness\" has led to Kotsko being cited as an authority on awkwardness in the press, including by \"US News and World Report\".\n\nIn 2015, Kotsko caused a firestorm of controversy when he tweeted that all white people, regardless of their ancestry or whether their ancestors owned slaves, are \"complicit\" in slavery. While the tweets were later deleted, Kotsko has said he stands by his statements. Due to this controversy, Kotsko has been named in an online \"watch list\" of college professors who discriminate against conservative students.\n\nIn 2016, Kotsko published a book about the figure of the Devil in Christianity, \"The Prince of This World\". He had previously presented a paper before the American Academy of Religion on the influence of Agamben's writing on his thinking about the devil.\n\n\n\n"}

A significant portion of the content of \"Bahá'í News\" touched upon worldwide developments in the Bahá'í community and the achievement of pioneering goals, as well as developments in the American Bahá'í community. Digitized issues are available online.\n\n\"American Bahá'í\", a successor periodical which began publication in 1970 and is still in production, carries a particular focus on domestic developments in the American Baha'i community.\n\n\"Bahá'í News\" was founded as part of Shoghi Effendi's strengthening of the administration of the Bahá'í Faith in his role as Guardian. As William Garlington writes in his book \"The Baha'i Faith in America,\"\n\"[E]mphasis was placed on developing positive methods of communication between the various Baha'i administrative institutions. Special attention was given to the proper relationship between local and national assemblies as well as the desired manner of interaction between the National Convention and National Spiritual Assembly. This effort was assisted by the national publication of \"Bahá'í News\" beginning in 1924, which provided all Bahá'í access to the Guardian's correspondence\".\n\nFurther it “should become a great factor in promoting understanding, providing information on Bahá’í activity, both local and foreign, in stimulating interest, in combating evil influences, and in upholding and safeguarding the institutions of the Cause. It should be made as representative as possible, should be replete with news, up-to-date in its information, and should arouse the keenest interest among believers ... in every corner of the globe.”\n\nAnother periodical, \"Star of the West\", was initially named \"Bahá'í News\" as well, and its dates of publication (from 1910 to 1935) overlapped with \"Bahá'í News\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "323286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323286", "title": "Beit She'an", "text": "Beit She'an\n\nBeit She'an ( '; ', \"Beisan\" or \"Bisan\") is a city in the Northern District of Israel which has played an important role in history due to its geographical location at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley. In the Biblical account of the battle of the Israelites against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa, the bodies of King Saul and three of his sons were hung on the walls of Beit She'an (). In Roman times, Beit She'an was the leading city of the Decapolis. In modern times, Beit She'an serves as a regional center for the settlements in the Beit She'an Valley.\n\nThe ancient city ruins are now protected within the Beit She'an National Park.\n\nBeit She'an's location has always been strategically significant, due to its position at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley, essentially controlling access from Jordan and the inland to the coast, as well as from Jerusalem and Jericho to the Galilee.\n\nBeit She'an is situated on Highway 90, the north–south road which runs the length of Israel. The city stretches over an area of 7 square kilometers with a substantial national park in the north of the city. Beit She'an has a population of 20,000.\n\nToday the town is under the administration of the Emek HaMa'ayanot Regional Council.\n\nIn 1933, archaeologist G.M. FitzGerald, under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, carried out a \"deep cut\" on Tell el-Hisn (\"castle hill\"), the large tell, or mound, of Beth She'an, in order to determine the earliest occupation of the site. His results suggest that settlement began in the Late Neolithic or Early Chalcolithic periods (sixth to fifth millennia BCE.) Occupation continued intermittently throughout the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, with a likely gap during the Late Chalcolithic period.\n\nSettlement seems to have resumed at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age I (3200–3000) and continues throughout this period, is then missing during Early Bronze Age II, and then resumes in the Early Bronze Age III.\n\nA large cemetery on the northern mound was in use from the Bronze Age to Byzantine times. Canaanite graves dating from 2000 to 1600 BCE were discovered there in 1926.\n\nAfter the Egyptian conquest of Beit She'an by Pharaoh Thutmose III in the 15th century BCE, as recorded in an inscription at Karnak, the small town on the summit of the mound became the center of the Egyptian administration of the region. The Egyptian newcomers changed the organization of the town and left a great deal of material culture behind. A large Canaanite temple (39 meters in length) excavated by the University of Pennsylvania Museum (Penn Museum) may date from about the same period as Thutmose III's conquest, though the Hebrew University excavations suggest that it dates to a later period. Artifacts of potential cultic significance were found around the temple. Based on a stele found in the temple, inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs, the temple was dedicated to the god Mekal. One of the most important finds near the temple is the Lion and Dog stela, currently in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, which depicts two combat scenes between these two creatures. The Hebrew University excavations determined that this temple was built on the site of an earlier one.\n\nDuring the three hundred years of Egyptian rule (18th to 20th Dynasty), the population of Beit She'an appears to have been primarily Egyptian administrative officials and military personnel. The town was completely rebuilt, following a new layout, during the 19th dynasty. The Penn Museum excavations uncovered two important stelae from the period of Seti I and a monument of Rameses II. Pottery was produced locally, but some was made to mimic Egyptian forms. Other Canaanite goods existed alongside Egyptian imports, or locally made Egyptian-style objects. The 20th Dynasty saw the construction of large administrative buildings in Beit She'an, including \"Building 1500\", a small palace for the Egyptian governor. During the 20th Dynasty, invasions of the \"Sea Peoples\" upset Egypt's control over the Eastern Mediterranean. Though the exact circumstances are unclear, the entire site of Beit She'an was destroyed by fire around 1150 BCE. The Egyptians did not attempt to rebuild their administrative center and finally lost control of the region.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, around 1000 BCE the town became part of the larger Israelite kingdom under the rule of David and Solomon. refers to Beit She'an as part of the kingdom of Solomon, though the historical accuracy of this list is debated.\nAn Iron Age I (1200-1000 BCE) Canaanite city was constructed on the site of the Egyptian center shortly after its destruction.\n\nThe Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel under Tiglath-Pileser III (732 BCE) brought about the destruction of Beit She'an by fire.\n\nMinimal reoccupation occurred until the Hellenistic period.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, around 1100 BCE Canaanite Beit She'an was conquered by the Philistines, who used it as a base of operations for further penetrations into Israel proper. During a subsequent battle against King Saul at nearby Mount Gilboa in 1004 BC, the Philistines prevailed and Saul together with three of his sons, Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua, died in battle (). states that \"the victorious Philistines hung the body of King Saul on the walls of Beit She'an\". King David was able to capture Beit Shea'an in a series of brilliant military campaigns that expelled the Philistines from the area, pushing them back to their southern coastal strongholds.\n\nThe Hellenistic period saw the reoccupation of the site of Beit She'an under the new name \"Scythopolis\" (Ancient Greek: Σκυθόπολις), possibly named after the Scythian mercenaries who settled there as veterans. Little is known about the Hellenistic city, but during the 3rd century BCE a large temple was constructed on the tell. It is unknown which deity was worshipped there, but the temple continued to be used during Roman times. Graves dating from the Hellenistic period are simple, singular rock-cut tombs. From 301 to 198 BCE the area was under the control of the Ptolemies, and Beit She'an is mentioned in 3rd–2nd century BCE written sources describing the Syrian Wars between the Ptolemid and Seleucid dynasties. In 198 BCE the Seleucids finally conquered the region. The town played a role after the Maccabean Revolt: Josephus records that the Jewish High Priest Jonathan was killed there by Demetrius II Nicator. The city was destroyed by fire at the end of the 2nd century BCE.\n\nIn 63 BCE, Pompey made Judea a part of the Roman empire. Beit She'an was refounded and rebuilt by Gabinius. The town center shifted from the summit of the mound, or tell, to its slopes. Scythopolis prospered and became the leading city of the Decapolis, the only one west of the Jordan River. \nThe city flourished under the \"Pax Romana\", as evidenced by high-level urban planning and extensive construction, including the best preserved Roman theatre of ancient Samaria, as well as a hippodrome, a cardo and other trademarks of the Roman influence. Mount Gilboa, away, provided dark basalt blocks, as well as water (via an aqueduct) to the town. Beit She'an is said to have sided with the Romans during the Jewish uprising of 66 CE. Excavations have focused less on the Roman period ruins, so not much is known about this period. The Penn. University Museum excavation of the northern cemetery, however, did uncover significant finds. The Roman period tombs are of the \"loculus\" type: a rectangular rock-cut spacious chamber with smaller chambers (\"loculi\") cut into its side. Bodies were placed directly in the \"loculi\", or inside sarcophagi which were placed in the \"loculi\". A sarcophagus with an inscription identifying its occupant in Greek as \"Antiochus, the son of Phallion\", may have held the cousin of Herod the Great. One of the most interesting Roman grave finds was a bronze incense shovel with the handle in the form of an animal leg, or hoof, now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum.\n\nCopious archaeological remains were found dating to the Byzantine period (330–636 CE) and were excavated by the University of Pennsylvania Museum from 1921–23. A rotunda church was constructed on top of the Tell and the entire city was enclosed in a wall. Textual sources mention several other churches in the town. Beit She'an was primarily Christian, as attested to by the large number of churches, but evidence of Jewish habitation and a Samaritan synagogue indicate established communities of these minorities. The pagan temple in the city centre was destroyed, but the nymphaeum and Roman baths were restored. Many of the buildings of Scythopolis were damaged in the Galilee earthquake of 363, and in 409 it became the capital of the northern district, Palaestina Secunda. As such, Scythopolis (v.) also became the Metropolitan archdiocese of the province.\n\nDedicatory inscriptions indicate a preference for donations to religious buildings, and many colourful mosaics, such as that featuring the zodiac in the Monastery of Lady Mary, or the one picturing a menorah and shalom in the House of Leontius' Jewish synagogue, were preserved. A Samaritan synagogue's mosaic was unique in abstaining from human or animal images, instead utilising floral and geometrical motifs. Elaborate decorations were also found in the settlement's many luxurious villas, and in the 6th century especially, the city reached its maximum size of 40,000 and spread beyond its period city walls.\n\nThe Byzantine period portion of the northern cemetery was excavated in 1926. The tombs from this period consisted of small rock-cut halls with vaulted graves on three sides. A great variety of objects were found in the tombs, including terracotta figurines possibly depicting the Virgin and Child, many terracotta lamps, glass mirrors, bells, tools, knives, finger rings, iron keys, glass beads, bone hairpins, and many other items.\n\nImportant Christian personalites who lived or passed through Byzantine Scythopolis are St Procopius of Scythopolis (died July 7, 303 AD), Cyril of Scythopolis (ca. 525–559), St Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310/320 – 403) and Joseph of Tiberias (c. 285 – c. 356) who met there around the year 355.\n\nIn 634, Byzantine forces were defeated by the Muslim army of Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab and the city reverted to its Semitic name, being named Baysan in Arabic. The day of victory came to be known in Arabic as \"Yawm Baysan\" or \"the day of Baysan.\" The city was not damaged and the newly arrived Muslims lived together with its Christian population until the 8th century, but the city declined during this period. Structures were built in the streets themselves, narrowing them to mere alleyways, and makeshift shops were opened among the colonnades. The city reached a low point by the 8th century, witnessed by the removal of marble for producing lime, the blocking off of the main street, and the conversion of a main plaza into a cemetery. However, some recently discovered counter-evidence may be offered to this picture of decline. In common with state-directed building work carried out in other towns and cities in the region during the 720s, Baysan's commercial infrastructure was refurbished: its main colonnaded market street, once thought to date to the sixth century, is now known—on the basis of a mosaic inscription—to be a redesign dating from the time of the Umayyad caliph Hisham (r. 724–43). Abu Ubayd al-Andalusi noted that the wine produced there was delicious.\n\nOn January 18, 749, Umayyad Baysan was completely devastated by a catastrophic earthquake. A few residential neighborhoods grew up on the ruins, probably established by the survivors, but the city never recovered its magnificence. The city center moved to the southern hill where later the Crusaders built their castle.\n\nJerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi visited Baysan in 985, during Abbasid rule and wrote that it was \"on the river, with plentiful palm trees, and water, though somewhat heavy (brackish.)\" He further noted that Baysan was notable for its indigo, rice, dates and grape syrup known as \"dibs\". The town formed one of the districts (\"kurah\") of Jund al-Urdunn during this period. Its principal mosque was situated in the center of its marketplace.\n\nIn the Crusader period, the Lordship of Bessan was occupied by Tancred in 1099; it was never part of the Principality of Galilee, despite its location, but became a royal domain of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1101, probably until around 1120. According to the Lignages d'Outremer, the first Crusader lord of Bessan once it became part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was Adam, a younger son of Robert III de Béthune, peer of Flanders and head of the House of Bethune. His descendants were known by the family name \"de Bessan\".\nIt occasionally passed back under royal control until new lords were created, becoming part of the Belvoir fiefdom.\n\nA small Crusader fortress surrounded by a moat was built in the area southeast of the Roman theatre, where the diminished town had relocated after the 749 earthquake. The fortress was destroyed by Saladin in 1183.\n\nDuring the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut, retreating Mongol forces passed in the vicinity but did not enter the town itself.\n\nUnder Mamluk rule, Beit She'an was the principal town in the district of Damascus and a relay station for the postal service between Damascus and Cairo. It was also the capital of sugar cane processing for the region. Jisr al-Maqtu'a, \"the truncated/cut-off bridge\", a bridge consisting of a single arch spanning 25 feet and hung 50 feet above a stream, was built during that period.\n\nDuring this period the inhabitants of Beit She'an were mainly Muslim. There were however some Jews. For example, the 14th century topographer Ishtori Haparchi settled there and completed his work \"Kaftor Vaferach\" in 1322, the first Hebrew book on the geography of Palestine.\n\nDuring the 400 years of Ottoman rule, Baysan lost its regional importance. During the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II when the Jezreel Valley railway, which was part of the Haifa-Damascus extension of the Hejaz railway was constructed, a limited revival took place. The local peasant population was largely impoverished by the Ottoman feudal land system which leased tracts of land to tenants and collected taxes from them for their use.\n\nThe Swiss–German traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt described Beisan in 1812 as \"a village with 70 to 80 houses, whose residents are in a miserable state.\" In the early 1900s, though still a small and obscure village, Beisan was known for its plentiful water supply, fertile soil, and its production of olives, grapes, figs, almonds, apricots, and apples.\n\nUnder the Mandate, the city was the center of the District of Baysan.\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Beit She'an (Baisan) had a population of 1,941, consisting of 1,687 Muslims, 41 Jews and 213 Christians.\n\nIn 1934, Lawrence of Arabia noted that \"Bisan is now a purely Arab village,\" where \"very fine views of the river can be had from the housetops.\" He further noted that \"many nomad and Bedouin encampments, distinguished by their black tents, were scattered about the riverine plain, their flocks and herds grazing round them.\" Beisan was home to a mainly Mizrahi Jewish community of 95 until 1936, when the 1936–1939 Arab revolt saw Beisan serve as a center of Arab attacks on Jews in Palestine. In 1938, after learning of the murder of his close friend and Jewish leader Haim Sturmann, Orde Wingate led his men on an offensive in the Arab section of Baysan, the rebels’ suspected base.\n\nAccording to population surveys conducted in British Mandate Palestine, Beisan consisted of 5,080 Muslim Arabs out of a population of 5,540 (92% of the population), with the remainder being listed as Christians. In 1945, the surrounding District of Baysan consisted of 16,660 Muslims (67%), 7,590 Jews (30%), and 680 Christians (3%); and Arabs owned 44% of land, Jews owned 34%, and 22% constituted public lands. The 1947 UN Partition Plan allocated Beisan and most of its district to the proposed Jewish state.\n\nJewish forces and local Bedouins first clashed during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War in February and March 1948, part of Operation Gideon, which Walid Khalidi argues was part of a wider Plan Dalet. Joseph Weitz, a leading Yishuv figure, wrote in his diary on May 4, 1948 that, \"The Beit Shean Valley is the gate for our state in the Galilee...[I]ts clearing is the need of the hour.\"\n\nBeisan, then an Arab village, fell to the Jewish militias three days before the end of the Mandate.\n\nAfter Israel's Declaration of Independence in May 1948, during intense shelling by Syrian border units, followed by the recapture of the valley by the Haganah, the Arab inhabitants fled across the Jordan River. The property and buildings abandoned after the conflict were then held by the State of Israel. Most Arab Christians relocated to Nazareth. A ma'abarah (refugee camp) inhabited mainly by North African Jewish refugees was erected in Beit She'an, and it later became a development town.\n\nFrom 1969, Beit She'an was a target for Katyusha rockets and mortar attacks from Jordan. In the 1974 Beit She'an attack, militants of the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, took over an apartment building and murdered a family of four.\n\nIn 1999, Beit She'an was incorporated as a city. Geographically, it lies in the middle of the Beit She'an Valley Regional Council.\n\nBeit She'an was the hometown and political power base of David Levy, a prominent figure in Israeli politics.\n\nDuring the Second Intifada, in the 2002 Beit She'an attack, six Israelis were killed and over 30 were injured by two Palestinian militants, who opened fire and threw grenades at a polling station in the center of Bet She'an where party members were voting in the Likud primary.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania carried out excavations of ancient Beit She'an in 1921–1933. Relics from the Egyptian period were discovered, most of them now exhibited in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Some are in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. Excavations at the site were resumed by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983 and then again from 1989 to 1996 under the direction of Amihai Mazar. The excavations have revealed no less than 18 successive ancient towns. Ancient Beit She'an, one of the most spectacular Roman and Byzantine sites in Israel, is a major tourist attraction. The seventh century Mosaic of Rehob was discovered by farmers of Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv. Part of a mosaic floor, it contains details of Jewish religious laws concerning tithes and the Sabbatical Year.\n\nBeit She'an is located above the Dead Sea Transform (a fault system that forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east) and is one of the cities in Israel most at risk to earthquakes (along with Safed, Tiberias, Kiryat Shmona and Eilat). Historically, the city was destroyed in the Golan earthquake of 749.\n\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population of the municipality was at the end of . In 2005, the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.5% Jewish and other non-Arab (97.3% Jewish), with no significant Arab population. See Population groups in Israel. The population breakdown by gender was 8,200 males and 8,100 females.\n\nThe age distribution was as follows:\n\nBeit She'an is a center of cotton-growing, and many of residents are employed in the cotton fields of the surrounding kibbutzim. Other local industries include a textile mill and clothing factory.\n\nWhen the ancient city of Beit She'an was opened to the public in the 1990s and turned into a national park, tourism became a major sector of the economy.\n\nAccording to CBS, there are 16 schools and 3,809 students in the city. They are spread out as 10 elementary schools and 2,008 elementary school students, and 10 high schools and 1,801 high school students. 56.2% of 12th grade students were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001.\n\nBeit She'an had a railway station that opened in 1904 on the Jezreel Valley railway which was an extension of the Hejaz railway. This station closed together with the rest of the Jezreel Valley railway in 1948. In 2011–2016 the valley railway was rebuilt and the new Beit She'an Railway Station, located at the same site as the historical station was opened. Passenger service offered at the station connects the city to Afula, Haifa and destinations in between. In addition to passenger service, the station also includes a freight rail terminal.\n\nThe local football club, Hapoel Beit She'an spent several seasons in the top division in the 1990s, but folded in 2006 after several relegations. Maccabi Beit She'an currently plays in Liga Bet.\n\n\nBeit She'an is twinned with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lumbini is considered to lie in present-day Rupandehi district, Lumbini zone of Nepal. \nBuddhism is the second-largest religion in Nepal. According to 2011 census, the Buddhist population in Nepal is 9% of the country population. It has not been possible to assign with certainty the year in which Prince Siddhartha (the birth name of the Buddha) was born, it is usually placed at around 623 BCE. According to 2001 census, 10.74% of Nepal's population practice Buddhism, consisting mainly of Tibeto-Burman-speaking ethnicities. In Nepal's hill and mountain regions Hinduism has absorbed Buddhist tenets to such an extent that in many cases they have shared deities as well as temples. For instance, the Muktinath Temple is sacred and a common house of worship for both Hindus and Buddhists.\n\nIn Nepal the majority of people identify as Hindu, however, Buddhist influences are pervasive in most aspects of Nepali culture to an extent that Buddhist and Hindu temples are shared places of worship for peoples of both faith so that, unlike, in other countries, the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal is not always clear. During the reign of King Aṃśuvarman, the Nepalese princess Bhrikuti played a significant role in spreading and developing Buddhism in Tibet. Tibetan Buddhist architecture has long been influenced by Nepalese artists and sculptors like Araniko. The sacred Buddhist texts in Mahayana Buddhism are mainly written in the Ranjana alphabet, the script of the Newars, or scripts like Lantsa, which are derived from Ranjana.\n\nIn traditional Nepalese Buddhism, there are nine special texts which are called the \"Nine Dharma Jewels\" (\"Navagrantha\"), and these are considered the nine books of Buddhism par excellence:\n\n\nAmong the Tibeto-Burman-speaking peoples, Tibetan Buddhism is the most widely practised form. Newar Buddhism is a form of Vajrayana influenced by Theravada Buddhism. Many Buddhist groups are also influenced by Hinduism. Buddhism is the dominant religion of the thinly populated northern areas, which are inhabited by Tibetan-related peoples, namely the Sherpa, Lopa, Manangi, Thakali, Lhomi, Dolpa and Nyimba. They constitute a small minority of the country's population.\n\nEthnic groups that live in central Nepal such as the Gurungs, Lepcha, Tamang, Magar, Newars, Yakkha, Thami, Chhantyal and Chepang are also Buddhist. These ethnic groups have larger populations compared to their northern neighbours. They came under the influence of Hinduism due to their close contacts with the Hindu castes. In turn, many of them eventually adopted Hinduism and have been largely integrated into the caste system.\n\nThe Kirati people, especially the Limbu and the Rai people, have also adopted Tibetan Buddhist practises from their Buddhist neighbours. The Jirel people, who are considered a Kirati, have also adopted Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nBuddha was born as Prince Siddhartha in Nepal. He attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree in Bodh Gaya, in present-day Bihar, India. He there preached his teachings and thus Buddhism came into existence.\n\nEmperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire put up a pillar at Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, in the second century BCE. After the Third Buddhist council, Ashoka missionaries to Nepal. It is also believed that Ashoka went to Patan and had four stupas built there. It is believed that his daughter Charumati established the village of Chabahil, which is located between Kathmandu and Boudha..\n\nThe Licchavi period saw the flourishing of both Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal. Excellent examples of Buddhist art of the period are the half-sunken Buddha in Pashupatinath, the sleeping Vishnu in Budhanilkantha, and the statue of Buddha and the various representations of Vishnu in Changu Narayan.\n\nAnother Buddhist text, the Manjushrimula Kalpa, mentioned Manadeva as the King of Nepal Mandala. Researchers believe the Mulasarvastivadavinaya was written in the 2nd century CE, and that the Manjushriulakalpa was written during Manadeva's reign. The Swayambhu Purana, the ancient Buddhist Purana text, and a Licchavi inscription all mentioned Nepal Mandala.\n\nBuddhist inscriptions and chronicles and Tibetan sources also record a few tantric Buddhist deities, namely Akshobhya, Amitabha, Vajrayogini, Vajrabhairava, Usnisavijaya and Samantabhadra. Strong influence from Animism resulted in belief in Buddhist deities such as the Pancaraksas.\n\nReligious tolerance and syncretism were stressed during the Licchavi period. King Manadeva paid homage at both Hindu and Buddhist sites. His family subsequently found expression for their beliefs in various religions.\n\nThe worship of the Caitya and the Rath Jatra cart festival of Avalokitesvara were introduced around this period. Many ancient sites in the Kathmandu Valley were identified with major Buddhist Caityas, such as Swayambhu, Boudhanath, Kathmandu and the four \"Ashoka\" stupas of Patan, and another two hundred stone [Cetiya|Caityas] dating from the Licchavi Period, were testified to the widespread antiquity of [Cetiya|Caitya] worship.\n\nIt is possible that this practice, in its earliest incarnation, was related to the worship of stones, which may have originated in the early, rival Kirata inhabitants of the Valley, prior to the Licchavis. According to one of the earliest Licchavi inscriptions, Caitya worship ordinarily consisted of ritual circumambulation of the caitya and offering standard items such as incense, colored powder, oil lamps and ablutions. At times, the inscriptions indicate, it could even involve resurfacing an existing Caitya and covering the new surface with many elaborate paintings.\n\nCaitya worship was an important factor in bringing more of the proto-Newar tribal inhabitants into the Buddhist fold, as it was a devotional practice designed for the general public. Thus, the masses probably began practicing the cart festival of Avalokitesvara/Matsyendranath (Jana Baha Dyah Jatra and Bunga Dyah Jatra) during the latter half of the seventh century AD.\n\nThis festival was celebrated by hundreds or even thousands of people, who helped to construct and transport a huge, wheeled cart that bore the image of Avalokitesvara for several days or weeks along a specific route. The introduction of this festival must have been an instant success among the majority of the Kathmandu Valley population. This strengthened Buddhism's standing in relation to the other Hindu and Animist faiths of the Valley at the time.\n\nForty stone inscriptions made some mention of Buddhism throughout the Licchavi period. Most of the references are concerned with monasticism. However, almost nothing is known about the day-to-day life in the Vihara monasteries or how they functioned administratively.\n\nThe names of the fifteen Buddhist monasteries are known, and it is clear from the context in which some of these are named that they are among the most important religious sites of that time. It is not known for certain what schools of Buddhism were most prominent at the time. But the strongest early influences (aside from an even earlier probable substratum of Pali Buddhism) probably came from the Mahasanghika, Sammitiya and the Sarvastivada schools. The Makhyamaka and Yogacara schools were thought to be more influential in the later period with the emergence and growth of the Vajrayana school.\n\nInscriptional evidence also proves that there was a string of traditional methods of making religious gifts. These offerings were used for earning blessing and making merit, and the women of the Buddhist seem to have taken the lead in offering these gifts. Strikingly, parallel points within the Buddhist cave contain inscriptions of Maharashtra, which predated the Licchvi Nepal. The references in the Licchavi inscriptions to the Mahayana and Vajrayana will be mentioned below in connection with Buddhist art and notable Buddhist figures of the Licchavi period.\n\nA Licchavi king, Amshuverma, married his daughter Bhrikuti to the ruler of Tibet, King Songtsen Gampo. According to legend, she received the begging bowl of the Buddha as part of her wedding dowry. It is believed that she introduced Buddhism into Tibet. she is also believed as a reincarnation of the Green Tara of Tibetan Buddhism, who is seen in many Buddhist Thangkas. Lichhavi period is known as the golden time for Buddhism.\n\nThe Malla dynasty saw to the golden period of the syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist art forms by the Newar. The Paubha, the Newar counterpart of the Tibetan Buddhist Thangka, flourished in this period.\n\nDuring the reign of Jayasthiti Malla, after implementation of Manudharmasastra, celibate monks were banned from practicing in Nepal. This gave way to the decelibate Newar Buddhism. Because of this, Theravada Buddhism was lost in Nepal only to be revitalized in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe Shah dynasty saw the decline of Buddhism in Nepal where it eventually merged with Hinduism as the Hindu Gurkha rose to prominence. In the north, the Mustang kingdom ruled by the Buddhist Lopa and the Thakali saw to the flourishing of Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism) in the North.\n\nThere is an incorrect assumption that, due to perceived similarity to tantric Hinduism, that Modern Newar Buddhism in Nepal has largely been absorbed into mainstream Hinduism. However, Newar Buddhism has retained a distinct identity, and nearly all practices, art forms and castes remain. In the north, people of Tibetan origin continued to be the much-unchanged practises of Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the case of the Nyimba of Northwest Nepal. On the other hand, the Thakali, who had traditionally played an important role in the Nepali society but yet retained Tibetan Buddhism, have begun to embrace Hinduism as well in the recent years.\n\nIt is significant to note that during the autocratic Rana regime, several Theravada Buddhists were banished from Nepal for preaching Buddhism. The Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal in 1926 and 1944 was prompted by an attempt to suppress the revival of Theravada Buddhism which began in the 1920s. Also, the rediscovery of Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha, occurred in this era with contributions from among others, General Khadga Sumsher Rana.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Rana dynasty in 1951, Buddhism gradually developed in the country. Theravada Buddhists played a greatly significant role for the Buddhist revival campaign in modern Nepal since the 1920s. This revival movement has changed Buddhism from a religion of some ethnic groups and castes to going beyond the caste and ethnic religion in Nepal. Presently, there are three main Buddhist schools; Tibetan Buddhism, Newar Buddhism and Theravada Buddhism.\n\nTourism is an important factor for promoting Nepali Buddhism to the world. Every year, Kathmandu can receive more than 10,000 travellers from all over the world just to visit the Boudha Stupa Boudhanath and the Swyambhu Maha Chaitya Swayambhunath stupas. These are the remarkable and significant architectural sites, which are only found in Nepal. Apart from these two main Buddhist monuments there are hundreds of Buddhist monuments in Kathmandu and in other main cities of Nepal.\n\nNepal officially became a secular state in 2006. All religions in Nepal now have equal opportunities to propagate according to their belief.\n\nAccording to 2001 census, the adherents of Buddhism are as follows:\n\n\n"}

In tribal's life there is a long-standing tradition of chitrakathi's paintings. Wall paintings of Saora, Gaund, Pradhan are extremely popular in India and abroad. It’s an almost extinct art form practised by the Thakkar tribal community of Maharashtra. Chitrakathi artists are a community of migrating story tellers found all over Maharashra and some parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They made a series of single sheets of paintings. All paintings belonging to one story were kept in a bundle called pothi. The Theme of Chitrakathi paintings include stories on local versions of Ramayana and Mahabharata and mythical themes. Use of brownish tones of stone colors gives a remarkable effect. Figures in paintings were generally stylized.\n\n\"Chitra\" means picture and \"katha\" means story and the exponent called Chitrakathi is the person who narrates the story with the aid of some visual support. \"Broadly speaking,Chitrakatha is identified in three forms, Leather shadow puppets, Stringed wooden puppets and Picture stories.

In 44 BC, a temple was consecrated to her by the Roman Senate, possibly at Caesar's instigation as Caesar was keen to demonstrate that he had this virtue.\n\nIn a letter to his friend Atticus, Cicero is discussing Caesar's \"clementia\": \"You will say they are frightened. I dare say they are, but I'll be bound they're more frightened of Pompey than of Caesar. They are delighted with his artful clemency and fear the other's wrath.\" Again in \"Pro rege Deiotaro\" (For King Deiotarus) Cicero discusses Caesar's virtue of \"clementia\".\n\nThere is not much information surrounding Clementia's cult; it would seem that she was merely an abstraction of a particular virtue, one that was revered in conjunction with revering Caesar and the Roman state. Clementia was seen as a good trait within a leader, it also the Latin word for \"humanity\" or \"forbearance\". This is opposed to \"Saevitia\" which was savagery and bloodshed. Yet, she was the Roman counterpart of Eleos, (not to be confused with Soteria), the Greek goddess of mercy and forgiveness who had a shrine in Athens.\n\nIn traditional imagery, she is depicted holding a branch (possibly an olive tree branch) and a scepter and may be leaning on a column.\n\n"}

{"id": "373445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=373445", "title": "Elephanta Caves", "text": "Elephanta Caves\n\nElephanta Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. They are located on Elephanta Island, or \"Gharapuri\" (literally \"the city of caves\") in Mumbai Harbour, to the east of the city of Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra. The island, located offshore about west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, consists of five Shaivite caves and a few Buddhist stupa mounds that may be dating to the 2nd century BCE, as well as a small group of two Buddhist caves with water tanks.\n\nThe Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and iconography. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The main temple's orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern. The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.\n\nThe origins and date when the caves were constructed have attracted considerable speculations and scholarly attention since the 19th century. These date them between 5th and 9th century, and attribute them to various Hindu dynasties. They are more commonly placed between 5th and 7th centuries. Most scholars consider it to have been completed by about 550 CE.\n\nThey were named \"Elefante\" – which morphed to Elephanta – by the colonial Portuguese when they found elephant statues on it. They established a base on the island, and its soldiers damaged the sculpture and caves. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship. The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the Caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s. In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).\n\nElephanta Island, or Gharapuri, is about east of the Gateway of India in the Mumbai Harbour and less than west of Jawaharlal Nehru Port. The island covers about at high tide and about at low tide. Gharapuri is a small village on the south side of the island. The Elephanta Caves is connected by ferry services from the Gateway of India, Mumbai between 9AM and 2PM daily, except Monday when the Caves are closed. Mumbai has a major domestic and international airport, as well as is connected to the Indian Railways.\nThe island is in length with two hills that rise to a height of about . A narrow deep ravine separates the two hills, and runs from north to south. On the west, the hill rises gently from the sea and stretches east across the ravine and rises gradually to the extreme east to a height of . Forest growth with clusters of mango, tamarind, and karanj trees cover the hills with scattered palm trees. The fore shore is made up of sand and mud with mangrove bushes on the fringe. Landing quays sit near three small hamlets known as Set Bunder in the north-west, Mora Bunder in the northeast, and Gharapuri or Raj Bunder in the south.\n\nThere are five rock-cut caves in the western hill and a brick stupa on the eastern hill. The eastern hill has two Buddhist mounds, and is called the Stupa hill. Close to the five western hill caves, are Cave 6 and 7 on the eastern hill. The most visited and significant cave is on the western hill and is called Cave 1 or the Great Cave, located about a kilometer walk up a steep graded uphill. The Elephanta island is a protected monument area as per the requirements of UNESCO, A notification was issued by the Government of India in 1985 declaring a buffer zone that includes \"a prohibited area\" that stretches from the shoreline.\n\nThe ancient history of the island is unknown in either Hindu or Buddhist records. Archeological studies have uncovered many remains that suggest the small island had a rich cultural past, with evidence of human settlement by possibly the 2nd century BC. The Elephanta site was first occupied by Hinayana Buddhists, before the arrival of the Brahmans to the island, to raise a large stupa to the Buddha with seven smaller stupas around it, probably around the 2nd century BCE. Coins of the Kshatrapas (Western Satraps) dating to the 4th century CE were found on the island. The regional history is first recorded in the Gupta Empire era, but these do not explicitly mention these caves. This has made the origins and the century in which Elephanta caves were built a subject of a historic dispute. They have been variously dated, mostly between from late 5th to late 8th century AD, largely based on the dating of other cave temples in the Deccan region. Colonial era historians suggested that the caves were built by the Rashtrakutas in 7th century or after, a hypothesis primarily based on some similarities with the Ellora Caves. This theory has been discredited by later findings.\nAccording to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO, the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century. Contemporary scholars generally place the completion of the temples to the second quarter of the 6th century and as a continuation of the period of artistic flowering in the Gupta Empire era. These scholars attribute these Cave temples to king Krishnaraja of the Kalachuri dynasty. The dating to a mid 6th century completion and it being a predominantly Shiva monument built by a Hindu Kalachuri king is based on numismatic evidence, inscriptions, construction style and better dating of other Deccan cave temples including the Ajanta Caves, and the more firm dating of Dandin's \"Dasakumaracarita\".\n\nAccording to Charles Collins, the significance of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, as well as in the context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.\n\nAfter the Caves completion in the 6th century, Elephanta became popular regionally as Gharapuri (village of caves). The name is still used in the local Marathi language. It became a part of the Gujarat Sultanate rulers, who ceded it to the Portuguese merchants in 1534. The Portuguese named the island \"Elephanta Island\" for the huge rock-cut stone statue of an elephant, the spot they used for docking their boats and as a landmark to distinguish it from other islands near Mumbai. The elephant statue was damaged in attempts to relocate it to England, was moved to the Victoria Gardens in 1864, was reassembled in 1914 by Cadell and Hewett, and now sits in the Jijamata Udyaan in Mumbai.\nScholars are divided who most defaced and damaged the Elephanta Caves. According to Macneil, the monuments and caves were already desecrated during the Sultanate rule, basing his findings on the Persian inscription on a door the leads to the grand cave. In contrast, others such as Ovington and Pyke, link the greater damage to be from the Christian Portuguese soldiers and their texts which state they used the caves and statues as a firing range and for target practice. Macneil concurs that Elephanta Caves were defaced and damaged during the colonial period, but assigns the responsibility not to the soldiers but the Portuguese authorities. The colonial era British publications state they were \"defaced by the zeal of Mahommedans and Portuguese\". Yet a third theory suggests that neither Muslim rulers nor Portuguese Christians damaged the site, because they both plastered the artwork and caves. It was the Marathas who tried to remove that plaster, according to this theory which Wendy Doniger states is \"possibly true\", and it was therefore the Marathas that caused damage to the artwork in the 17th century.\n\nThe Portuguese ceded the island in 1661 to the colonial British, but by then the Caves had seen considerable damage. The Portuguese had also removed and then lost an inscription stone from the caves. During the British rule, many Europeans visited the caves during their visit to Bombay, then published their impressions and memoirs. Some criticized it as having \"nothing of beauty or art\", while some called it \"enormous art work, of extraordinary genius\". The British relied on the port city of Bombay (now Mumbai), which led to it becoming a major urban center and migration of Hindus looking for economic opportunities. The Elephanta caves re-emerged as a center of Hindu worship, and according to British administration records, the government charged the pilgrims a temple tax at least since 1872. In 1903, the Hindus petitioned the government to waive this fee, which the British agreed to on three Shiva festival days if Hindus agreed. The Elephants Caves were, otherwise, left in its ruinous condition.\n\nIn late 1970s, the Government of India restored the main cave in its attempt to make it a tourist and heritage site. The caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 as per the cultural criteria of UNESCO: the caves \"represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\" and \"bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared\".\n\nThe island has two groups of caves in the rock-cut architectural style. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. The larger group of caves, which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures. The primary cave, numbered as Cave 1, is about up a hillside, facing the Mumbai harbour. Caves 2 through 5 are next to Cave 1 further southeast, arranged in a row. Cave 6 and 7 are about northeast of Cave 1 and 2, but geologically on the edge of the eastern hill.\n\nThe two hills are connected by a walkway. The eastern hill is also called the Stupa hill, while the western hill is called the Canon hill, reflecting their historic colonial era names, the ancient Stupa and the Portuguese era firing Canons they host respectively.\n\nAll Caves are a rock-cut temples that cover an area of , and they include a main chamber, two lateral chambers, courtyards, and subsidiary shrines. Cave 1 is the largest and is deep from the front entrance to the back. The temple complex is primarily the abode of Shiva, depicted in widely celebrated carvings which narrate legends and mythologies of Shaivism. However, the artwork reverentially displays themes from Shaktism and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism as well.\n\nThe main cave, also called Cave 1, Grand Cave or the Great Cave, is square in plan with a hall (mandapa). The basic plan of the cave can be traced back to the plan of the ancient Buddhist viharas, consisting of a square court surrounded by cells, built from about 500 to 600 years before in India. The Cave has several entrances, the main entrance is unassumingly small and hides the grand hall inside. The main entrance faces north, while two side entrances face east and west. The cave's main entrance is aligned with the north–south axis, unusual for a Shiva shrine (normally east–west). However, inside is an integrated square plan Linga shrine (\"garbha-griya\") that is aligned east-west, opening to the sunrise.\n\nLayout (3D Google Arts & Culture tour): \n1. Ravananugraha<br>\n2.

Nataraja\nTo reach the main cave, a visitor or pilgrim has to walk up 120 steep steps from the shore beach, or take the tourist toy train. At the main entrance are four pillars, with three open porticoes and an aisle at the back. Pillars, six in each row, divide the hall into a series of smaller chambers. The roof of the hall has concealed beams supported by stone columns joined together by capitals.\nThe temple is enclosed in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create the space and symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (\"ardha-mandapa\") on the south side, while a pillared portico (\"mukha-mandapa\") connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest of which is the square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square \"garbha-griya\" (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the \"mulavigraha\" style. Each doorway is guarded by a \"dvarapala\" on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (\"pradakshina-patha\") as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.\n\nThe northern entrance to the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the \"\" concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap out of the cave walls towards the spectator as if trying to greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.\n\nEach wall has large carvings of Shiva-related legends, each more than in height. The central Shiva relief \"Trimurti\" is located on the south wall opposite the main entrance. Also called the Sadashiva, it is the iconic form of a \"pancamukha linga\" is set in a mandala pattern with the abstract linga form of Shiva. The Sadashiva is a colossal carving, a bit over , depicting Tatpurusha (Mahadeva), Aghora (Bhairava), Vamadeva (Uma) and Sadyojata (Nandin). The carving is unusual because the standard ancient Hindu texts for murti design state that the Tatpursha should face east, but in Elephanta it is the north face (pointing towards the main entrance).\n\nSmaller shrines are located at the east and west ends of the caves. The eastern sanctuary serves as a ceremonial entrance, and its shrine shows iconography of Shaktism tradition.\n\nThe Trimurti is considered a masterpiece and the most important sculpture in the caves. It is carved in relief on the south wall of the cave facing the north entrance, along the north-south axis. It is also known as \"Sadashiva\" and \"Maheshmurti\". The image, in height, depicts a three-headed Shiva, representing Panchamukha Shiva.\n\nThe three heads represent three essential aspects of Shiva: creation, protection, and destruction. As per another version, the three heads symbolize compassion and wisdom. The right half-face (west face) shows him holding a lotus bud, depicting the promise of life and creativity. This face is symbolism for Brahma, the creator or Uma or Vamadeva, the feminine side of Shiva and creator. The left half-face (east face) is that of a moustached young man. This is Shiva as the terrifying Aghora or Bhairava, the chaos creator and destroyer. This is also known as Rudra-Shiva, the Destroyer. The central face, benign and meditative Tatpurusha, resembles the preserver Vishnu. This is the Shiva form as the \"master of positive and negative principles of existence and preserver of their harmony\". The three headed Shiva are his creator, preserver and destroyer aspects in Shaivism. They are equivalently symbolism for Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, they being equivalent of the three aspects found in Shaivism.\n\nThe Trimurti Shiva is flanked on its left by \"Ardhanarisvara\" (a half-Shiva, half-Parvati composite) and \"Gangadhara\" legend to its right. The \"Gangadhara\" image to the right of the \"Trimurti\" show Shiva and Parvati standing. Shiva brings the River Ganges down from the heavens to serve man, and her immense power is contained effortlessly in Shiva's hair as she descends from heaven. The artists carved a small three bodied goddess up high, a symbolism for Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati. The mother goddess Parvati stands tall next to Shiva, smiling. The carving is wide and high.\n\nThe Gangadhara image is highly damaged, particularly the lower half of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (with broken arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternate interpretation of the three bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is that it represents the regenerative powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the \"vahana\" (vehicle) and icons, and they include Brahma (left), Indra (left), Vishnu (right), Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others.\n\nWrapped on one of the arms of Shiva is his iconic coiling serpent whose hood is seen near his left shoulder. Another hand (partly broken) gives the semblance of Shiva hugging Parvati, with a head of matted hair. A damaged ornamented drapery covers his lower torso, below the waist. Parvati is carved to the left of Shiva with a coiffured hair dress, fully bedecked with ornaments and jewellery. Between them stands a \"gana\" (dwarf jester) expressing confused panic as to whether Shiva will be able to contain the mighty river goddess. In the lower left of the panel is a kneeling devout figure in \"namaste\" posture representing the heroic mythical king Bhagiratha who worked hard to bring the river of prosperity to his earthly kingdom, but unaware of the potentially destructive forces that came with it.\n\nOn the wall to the east of the \"Trimurti\" is a damaged four-armed \"Ardhanarishvara\" carving. This image, which is in height. It represents the ancient Hindu concept of essential interdependence of the feminine and the masculine aspects in the universe, for its creation, its sustenance and its destruction. It is represented as half woman shown as half of Parvati in this Elephanta panel on the right side, with breast, waist, feminine hair and items such as a mirror in the upper hand. The second half man side is Shiva with male characteristics and items iconographically his symbol. In Shaivism, the concept pictorially symbolizes the transcendence of all duality including gender, with the spiritual lacking any distinctions, where energy and power (Shakti, Parvati) is unified and is inseparable with the soul and awareness (Brahman, Shiva).\n\nIn the panel, the relief shows a headdress (double-folded) with two pleats draped towards the female head (Parvati) and the right side (Shiva) depicting curled hair and a crescent. The female figure has all the ornamentation (broad armlets and long bracelets, a large ring in the ear, jewelled rings on the fingers) but the right male figure has drooping hair, armlets and wristlets. One of his hands rests on Nandi bull’s left horn, Shiva's mount, which is fairly well preserved. The pair of hands at the back is also bejewelled; the right hand of the male side holds a serpent, while the left hand of the female side holds a mirror. The front left hand is broken, while a large part of the lower half of the panel was damaged at some point. Around the Ardhanarishwara are three layers of symbolic characters. The lowest or at the same level as the viewer are human figures oriented reverentially towards the androgyne image. Above them are gods and goddesses such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and others who are seated on their \"vahanas\". Above them are flying \"apsaras\" approaching the fused divinity with garlands, music and celebratory offerings.\n\nThe panel in the northwest side of the cave, on the wall near west entrance and the Linga shrine (see 7 in plan), is an uncommon sculpture about the \"Andhakasura-vadha\" legend. It shows Bhairava, or Virabhadra, a ferocious form of Shiva killing the demon \"Andhaka\" (literally, \"blind, darkness\"). The relief is much ruined below the waist, is high and posed in action. Though a relief, it is carved to give it a three dimensional form, as if the ferocious Shiva is coming out of the rocks and impaling Andhaka with his trident.\n\nBhairava's headgear has a ruff on the back, a skull and cobra over the forehead, and the crescent high on the right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, and one in the middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.\n\nThe niche image carved on the southwest wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness to the wedding. Vishnu is witness to the marriage, standing tall behind the sitting Brahma on the right side of the panel. Just above the main images rishi (sages) and a few characters hanging from the ceiling are seen blessing the wedding.\n\nThe groom Shiva is shown calm and young, while Parvati is depicted as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (\"kalash\"). Brahma, the priest, is squatting on the floor to the right tending the \"yajna\" fire (agni mandapa).\n\nThe panel in the east side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 9 on plan) is Shiva in Yoga. This form of Shiva is called Yogishvara, Mahayogi, Lakulisa.\n\nShiva, states Stella Kramrisch, is the \"primordial yogi\" in this panel. He is the master of discipline, the teacher of Yoga arts, the master who shows how yoga and meditation leads to the realization of ultimate reality.\n\nThe relief is in a dilapidated condition with most of the arms and legs broken. He is seated in padmasana lost in his meditation. His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.\n\nIn some ways, the yogi artwork shown in this Hindu cave are similar to those found in Buddhist caves, but there are differences. Yogi Shiva, or Lakulisa, wears a crown here, his chest is shown vaulting forward as if in breathing exercises found in Hindu yoga texts, the face and body expresses a different energy. This Shiva yogi comes across as the \"lord of the caves\" or \"Guhesvara\" in medieval Indian poetry, states Kramrisch. According to Charles Collins, the depiction of Shiva as Yogi in Elephanta Cave 1 is harmonious with those found in the Puranas dated to early and mid 1st millennium CE.\n\nThe panel facing the Yogishvara, on the west side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 8 on plan) is Shiva as the Nataraja, \"cosmic dancer\" and \"the lord of dancers\". It is also called the \"Nrittamurti\".\n\nThe badly damaged relief panel is wide and high and set low on the wall. His body and arms are shown as wildly gyrating in the \"lalita\" mudra, a symbolism for occupying all of space, soaring energy and full bodied weightlessness. His face here resembles the Tatpurusha, or the manifested form of Shiva that preserves and sustains all of creation, all of creative activity. This is an eight armed depiction of Nataraja. The parts of the panel that have survived suggest that he is holding an axe, a coiled serpent is wrapped around its top. In another he holds a folded cloth, possibly symbolic veil of \"maya\".\n\nThere are fewer gods, goddesses and observers in this panel than others in this cave, with Brahma, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati are visible and have a facial expression of being spellbound. Also present are his sons leaping Ganesha and Kartikeya holding Shiva's staff, as well as an ascetic and a rishi, thus weaving the family life and the ascetic monastic life, the secular and the spiritual tied in through metaphorical symbolism of dance within the same panel. The dancer and destroyer aspects of Shiva are clustered in the northwest part of the cave, in contrast to yoga and creator aspects that are found in the northeast parts. This 6th-century Nataraja shares architectural elements with those found in temples in the western parts of South Asia such as in Gujarat, and in upper Deccan region.\n\nThe carvings at the east entrance are battered and blurry. One in the southeast corner of the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the \"Umamaheshvara\" story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.\n\nThe panel facing the Mount Kailash panel towards the northeast corner (see 1 on plan) depicts demon king Ravana trying to lift Kailash and bother Shiva, a legend called \"Ravananugraha\". The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. Shiva is recognizable with a crown, and other characters are badly damaged. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives and he is seated near Shiva's feet. Near Shiva an outline of what may have been Ganesha and Kartikeya are visible. Below the mountain surface is shown the demon-king Ravana is seen with a few arms, trying to unsuccessfully shake Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. The rest of the details are blurry and speculative. According to Charles Collins, the discernible elements of this panel are generally consistent with those in medieval era Puranas, though there is a lack in literal correspondence with any single text.\n\nThe central shrine of the Great Cave temple is a free-standing square stone cella, with entrances on each of its sides. Each door is flanked by two \"dvarapalas\" (gate guardians), for a total of eight around the shrine. The height of the eight \"dvarapalas\" is about . All are in a damaged condition except those at the southern door to the shrine. The Shaiva guardians carry weapons and flank the doors.\n\nSix steps lead to the inside of the cella from the floor level. In the center is the \"mulavigraha\" Linga, is set on a raised platform above the floor of the shrine by . It is the abstract unmanifest symbol of Shiva in union with the Yoni, and the symbol of Parvati together symbolising the creative source and the regenerative nature of existence. The temple and all the pillars are laid out to lead the pilgrim's view towards it, the cella is visible from any point inside the cave and its most significant progression.\n\nOn the east side of the main hall is a separate shrine. It is a -wide courtyard with a circular pedestal. It once had a seated Nandi facing the Linga shrine, but its ruins have not been restored. To the south side of this eastern courtyard is the Shaktism shrine, with a lion, each seated with a raised forepaw as guardian. Inside the west face of this small shrine (see 10-12 of plan) are \"Sapta Matrikas\", or the \"seven mothers\" along with Parvati, Kartikeya (Skanda) and Ganesha. The smaller shrine's sanctum features a linga and has a circumambulatory path around it. The sanctum door has Shaiva \"dvarapalas\".\n\nThe Shakti panel in the east shrine is unusual in that counting Parvati, it features eight mothers (\"Asta matrikas\") in an era when \"Sapta matrikas\" were more common such as at Samalaji and Jogeswari caves. Additionally, the mothers are flanked on one side with Ganesha and the other with Skanda (Kartikeya) when typical artwork from mid 1st millennium show the Shakta mothers with Ganesha and Shiva. According to Sara L. Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, just like the one found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddeses. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya, and by showing him so prominently centered the artists are likely communicating the unity of Skanda-Shiva, that all these divinities are in essence the same spiritual concept, \"all emanations of the \"lingam\" at the very heart of Elephanta\", according to Schastok.\n\nOn the west side of the main hall is another attached shrine, though in much more ruined state. The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and is bigger than the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved to museums and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.\n\nThis Yogi Shiva panel is damaged, but unlike the other Yogi depiction, here the leg position in Yoga asana have survived. The Yogishvara is seated on a lotus, and near him are two badly defaced characters, possibly one of parvati and another ascetic. Above him are ruin remains of celestial gods or goddesses or apasaras. The Yogi Shiva is wearing a crown, and once again there is a space of isolation around the meditating yogi in which no other character enters. Below him, under the lotus, are Nagas and several badly damaged figures two of whom are in \"namaste\" reverence posture. The Nataraja shown in the west shrine is similar in style to one inside the main mandapa. However, states Collins, its depth of carving appears inferior and it seems more eroded being more open to rains and water damage.\n\nTo the south-east of the Great Cave is . The cave is unfinished. The front of this cave was completely destroyed and restored in the 1970s with four square pillars. It has two small cells in the back.\n\nAcross the ravine from Cave 1 on the hill on the other side are two Buddhist caves, together with the remains of a stupa and water tanks. It seems the Buddhists were the first occupants of the island.\n\nOne is a large hall known as , or Sitabai's temple cave (). The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 chambers at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The hall is devoid of any decoration, except for the door of the central shrine, which has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no remaining image. Cave 6 is historically significant because it was converted and used as a Christian church by the Portuguese in the later years when the island was a part of their colony (at some point between 1534 and 1682).\n\nNext, along the face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is Cave 7 (), another small excavation with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock.\n\nPast Cave 7, to the east is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and several Buddhist cisterns along its banks. Near the cistern, now at the end of the north spur of the hill, is a mound that was identitied as the remains of a Buddhist stupa (). This stupa, state Michell and Dhavalikar, was originally much taller and dates to about the 2nd century BCE.\n\nMany artworks from the Elephanta Caves ruins are now held in major museums around the world. These include an almost completely destroyed Durga Mahishasuramardini statue with only the buffalo demon with Durga's legs and some waist surviving. Other scholarly studied museum held Elephanta sculpture include a part of Brahma head, several ruins of Vishnus from different statues, a range of panels and free standing stone carvings. According to Schastok, some of these are \"surely not part of the Great Cave\", but it is unclear where they were found when they were moved elsewhere, or when ruins were cleared and restoration process initiated.\n\nThe significant statues of Vishnu are difficult to explain and to position inside other surviving caves. One theory states that some of the caves must have represented the Vaishnavism tradition. Another theory by some scholars such as Moti Chandra suggests that the island once had open air structural Hindu temples in addition to the caves, but these were the first victims of art destruction.\n\nThe Vishnu sculptures found among the Elephanta ruins express different styles. One wears a \"dhoti\" and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a \"gada\" (mace) on side, and someone standing next to him of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a \"dhoti\".\n\nThe island also had a stone horse according to 18th century records, just like the stone elephant that made colonial Portuguese call it \"Ilha Elefante\". However, this horse was removed to an unknown location before 1764.\n\nThe convenient location of these caves near Mumbai, the Western curiosity for the historic Indian culture, and the difficulty in reaching sites in infrastructure poor Indian subcontinent, made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope. This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins.\n\nMore specific legislation to preserve the Elephanta Island monuments were enacted with the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 and Rules (1959); The Elephanta Island (Protected Monument) Rules of 1957, which prohibits mining, quarrying, blasting, excavation and other operations near the monument; the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act promulgated in 1972 with its Rules promulgated in 1973; a Notification issued in 1985 declaring the entire island and a area from the shore as \"a prohibited area\"; a series of Maharashtra State Government environmental acts protecting the site; the 1966 Regional and Town Planning Act; and the 1995 Heritage Regulations for Greater Bombay. However, it was in 1970s that the site received active conservation and restoration efforts. These efforts put back the ruins of Cave 1 and select parts of broken pillars in other caves, along with developing the island as a heritage site.\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Aurangabad Circle maintains and manages the Elephanta Caves. It is responsible for monitoring and stabilisation of the rock face, construction of supports to the cave structures where pillars have collapsed, and consolidation of cave floors and construction of a parapet wall surrounding the site. In addition, it maintains the visitor facilities and an on-site museum. The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week between 19 and 25 November for special events.\n\nAfter declaring the caves a World Heritage Site, UNESCO and the ASI have worked together to monitor the site and implement conservation methods on a routine basis. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) is also involved with the Archaeological Survey of India in improving the local conditions at the cave site.\n\n\n\n \n"}

It is estimated that some reached northern areas of Colombia, which at the time was known as New Granada. Most if not all of these people assimilated into Colombian society. Some continue to practice traces of Sephardic Jewish rituals as family traditions.\n\nIn the 18th century, practicing Spanish and Portuguese Jews came from Jamaica and Curaçao, where they had flourished under English and Dutch rule. These Jews started practicing their religion openly in Colombia at the end of the 18th century, although it was not officially legal to do so, given the established Catholic Church. After independence, Judaism was recognized as a legal religion. The government granted the Jews land for a cemetery.\n\nMany Jews who came during the 18th and 19th centuries achieved prominent positions in Colombian society. Some married local women and felt they had to abandon or diminish their Jewish identity. These included author Jorge Isaacs of English Jewish ancestry, the industrialist James Martin Eder (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the Latvian Jewish community, as well as the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families of Antillean Sephardim. Coincidentally, these persons and their families settled in the Cauca Valley region of Colombia. They have continued to be influential members of society in cities such as Cali. Over the generations most of their descendants converted or were raised as secular Catholics.\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, numerous Sephardic Jewish immigrants came from Greece, Turkey, North Africa and Syria. Shortly after, Jewish immigrants began to arrive from Eastern Europe. A wave of Ashkenazi immigrants came after the rise of Nazism in 1933 and the imposition of anti-Semitic laws and practices, including more than 7,000 German Jews. From 1939 until the end of World War II, immigration was put to a halt by anti-immigrant feelings in the country and restrictions on immigration from Germany. \n\nColombia asked Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave and allowed Jewish refugees in the country illegally to stay. The Jewish population increased dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s, and institutions such as synagogues, schools and social clubs were established throughout the largest cities in the country.\n\nThe changing economy and wave of kidnappings during the last decade of the 20th century led many members of Colombia's Jewish community to emigrate. Most settled in Miami and other parts of the United States. Successes in the nation's Democratic Security Policy has encouraged citizens to return; it has drastically reduced violence in the rural areas and criminality rates in urban areas, as well as in spurring the economy. The situation in Colombia has improved to the extent that many Venezuelan Jews are now seeking refuge in Colombia.\n\nIn the early 21st century, most of the Jews in Colombia are concentrated in Bogotá, with about 20,000 members, and Barranquilla, with about 7,000 members. Large communities are found in Cali and Medellín, but very few practicing Jews. Smaller communities are found in Cartagena and the island of San Andres.There are 14 official synagogues throughout the country. In Bogotá, the Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and German Jews each run their own religious and cultural institutions.

A \"Hua Tou\" can be a short phrase that is used as a subject of meditation to focus the mind.\n\n\"Hua Tou\" are based on the encounter-dialogues and koans of the interactions between past masters and students, but are shorter phrases than koans. The Hua Tou method was invented by the Chinese Zen master Dahui Zonggao (1089 – 1163) who was a member of the Linji school. Dahui was interested in teaching the lay community, particularly the educated Chinese scholar-officials. Support of those \"literati\" was essential for the survival of the individual lineages, since appointments as abbot of public monasteries were determined by this ruling class. Providing accessible methods of training for layman was a means to gather this necessary support. \"Hua Tou\" practice does not use regular interviews and question and answer sessions between student and teacher (dokusan). According to Dahui, \"Hua Tou\" is also a form of meditation that \"can be carried out by laymen in the midst of their daily activities.\"\n\nDahui was also against the intellectualism and literary commentary that had begun to enter into Koan practice with the Blue Cliff Record of his master Yuan-wu. In fact, Dahui burned his copy of the Blue Cliff Record.\n\nFormal Hua Tou practice was promoted in Korea by Seon master Chinul. He was extremely successful in popularizing Hua Tou. According to Robert Buswell: \nAccording to Bhikkhu Analayo, a similar practice is found in the Pali commentaries relating to mindfulness of bodily postures. Analayo writes that according to the Papañcasudani \"the difference between simple walking and walking meditation as a Satipatthana is that a meditator keeps in mind the question: \"Who goes? Whose is this going?\" (Ps I 251).\n\nDahui emphasised that initial insight is essential for Zen-training. Dahui stressed that it was possible for laymen to achieve enlightenment through this practice. He often gave instructions through letters to his pupils.\n\nChinul described Hwadu (Hua Tou) in his treatise \"Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record\" () as a practice that leads to the very limits of speech and acts as a purification device. Because the practice leads students beyond conceptual understanding, Chinul considered an advanced practice for those of particular talent, or those who had already advanced through other practices first.\n\nTo practice \"Hua Tou\", one concentrates on the phrase, initially repeating it silently with a questioning and open mind and then thinking about \"Who\" or \"What\" is generating the Hua Tou, this brings about \"Great Doubt\". Hua Tou can be practiced during sitting meditation, after the mind has been calmed through an initial period of breath meditation. \n\nHsu Yun said of practicing Hua Tou: \nAccording to Chan master Sheng Yen, there are three stages of Hua Tou practice: reciting the Hua Tou, asking the Hua Tou and investigating the Hua Tou. Through these stages it is important not to try to answer the Hua Tou intellectually, but to persistently ask the question mindfully with genuine interest and sincere desire to know. It is through this constant practice that great doubt and then insight arises.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1275197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1275197", "title": "Islam in Ghana", "text": "Islam in Ghana\n\nIslam is one of the major religions practiced widely in Ghana. Its presence in Ghana dates back to the 10th century. The population of Muslims in Ghana is about 20%.\n\nThe majority of Muslims in Ghana are followers of Sunni Islam, with approximately 20% belonging to the Ahmadiyya movement and approximately 8% belonging to Shia Islam. The Maliki school of jurisprudence was the most common until Afa Ajura's reformist activities in the 1960s saw an overwhelming shift toward Hanbali doctrine. Sufism, once widespread, has waned considerably over the years; the Tijaniyah and the Qadiriyah brotherhoods, however, are still represented among Ghana's traditionalist Muslims.\n\nDespite tensions in the Middle East and North Africa since the mid-1970s, Muslims and Christians in Ghana have had excellent relations. Guided by the authority of the Muslim Representative Council, religious, social, and economic matters affecting Muslims have often been redressed through negotiations. The National Hajj Council observes the responsibility of arranging pilgrimages to Mecca for believers who can afford the journey. The National Chief Imam of Ghana is the highest authority on Muslim affairs in Ghana.\n\nSome metropolitan areas and cities, especially in areas with a significant Muslim population, have Islamic or Arabic schools offering primary, junior secondary, senior secondary and tertiary education.\n\nIslam made a momentous entry into the Northern Territories of Ghana at the beginning of the fifteenth century, mainly due to commercial (trading) activities of sahelian tribes of West Africa. Prior to that, Da'wah workers had made contact and written extensively about the people including inhabitants of Bonoman states located in the hinterlands of contemporary Ghana.\nThe introduction of Islam into Ghana was mainly the result of the commercial activities of Mande and Hausa Speaking traders.\nThe arrival and spread of Islam in Ghana followed several and different pathways; the Mandens came through the North and North-Western corridors of Ghana while the Borno and Hausa peoples came through the North-East. Islam is thought to have successfully penetrated southern Ghana following the \"collapse of the Bono and the Begho states, and its increase was encouraged by the fact that the slave trade became more lucrative and competitive\". Furthermore, the British colonial government in the nineteenth century enlisted people from various northern predominantly Muslim communities into the colonial army. Finally, the mass exodus of immigrants into forest areas of Ghana following the \"1892 Sack of Salaga\" by joint forces of Dagomba, Namumba and Gonja Kingdoms significantly depleted Muslim populations in the North while boosting that of the South.\n\nMuslim population is concentrated in Northern Ghana and in Zongo communities scattered across the country. Zongo communities are settlements predominated by immigrants from Sahelian areas of West Africa who have adopted Hausa language as a lingua franca. Members of the Zongo community are mistakenly but commonly regarded as Northerners. However, the two communities are distinct, having different cultures and languages.\n\nThe official Ghana Statistical Service census reports 30% as being Muslims although that figure is being protested by independent organizations. The Coalition of Muslim Organizations maintain that the final figures released in 2002 \"contained serious flaws and as a result could not be used as reliable data for planning and projecting the country’s development agenda\". The call came at the same time groups mainly from the North petitioned the government to withdraw the results, expressing concern that some ethnic groups were underrepresented in the population count and that the service should open up their procedures for public scrutiny. CIA statistics put the population of Muslims in Ghana at 30 percent. Other accounts place the figure at 35 percent. The government of Ghana's allocation of funds for national development is heavily influenced by population demographics.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Muslims constitute about 17.6 percent of the population of Ghana, up from 15.9 percent according to the census of 2000. \nMuslims constitute a majority in Northern Region and a large minority in Upper West Region and Upper East Region. There a slightly less Muslims in the southern parts of Ghana.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim community, formally established in 1921, is the oldest continuous Muslim community in Ghana. Ahmadi Muslims were among the earliest Muslim missionaries in Ghana, and by 1957, they had converted over 100,000 (mostly Christian) people to Islam. The first Ahmadi missionary to Ghana, Maulvi Abdul Rahim Nayyar, came upon invitation from Muslims in Saltpond. At 16%, Ghana hosts the largest proportion of Ahmadi Muslims to the wider Muslim population by country.\n\nSufism is the most traditional form of Islam in Ghana because of its long presence, close association and tolerance for the culture of the indigenous peoples even though they have never come together to form an establishment or a unified community. Prominent Sufi orders represented in Ghana are the Tijaniyya and Qadiriyya. Sufism is common among the immigrant Muslim population of Ghana, also known as the Zongos. Sufis make up 27 percent of Muslims in Ghana.\n\nSunni Islam was introduced into Ghana as part of the 1940s reformist activities of late Ghanaian Mujaddid, Afa Ajura. Afa Ajura's campaign challenged the status quo of the Sufi doctrine and pitted him against the already establish Sufi social structures. It was not until the 1970s that his message gained wide acceptance, resulting in a majority of Muslims, 51 percent (2014), now affiliating with the Anbariyya Sunni Community. For most of its established time in Ghana, Sunni Islam was propagated across the country in Dagbanli - the mother tongue of Afa Ajura. Recently Sunni adherents in Zongo communities in southern Ghana (18% of Muslims) have formed the \"Ahlusunnah wal Jamaa\" (ASWaJ) organization in order to reach the Hausa-speaking population. ASWaJ still draws inspiration from their parent Anbariyya leadership, headed by Afa Seidu in Tamale.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "636083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=636083", "title": "Josh Homme", "text": "Josh Homme\n\nJoshua Michael Homme ( ; born May 17, 1973) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. He is the founder and only continuous member of the rock band Queens of the Stone Age, in which he sings, plays guitar, as well as occasionally playing piano, drums, and bass. He also serves as the band's primary songwriter.\n\nHomme was formerly a guitarist and founder of the stoner rock band Kyuss. He co-founded and occasionally performs with Eagles of Death Metal, playing drums and bass for their studio recordings, and produces a musical improv series with other musicians, mostly from the Palm Desert Scene, known as The Desert Sessions. In 2009, he formed a new project called Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones, who released their debut album that same year. In 2016, he released \"Post Pop Depression\", an album with Iggy Pop. He has been involved with numerous other projects, including Arctic Monkeys and Biffy Clyro.\n\nJoshua Michael Homme was born in Joshua Tree, California on May 17, 1973. He grew up in an affluent family in Palm Desert, California. His paternal grandfather, Cap, moved to the area from North Dakota. Homme's surname is of Norwegian origin and is believed to come from the town of Valle. His additional ancestry includes English, French-Canadian, German, Jewish, and Swedish. The Homme family have a local street named after them in a golfing community, and Cap has a park named after him in an exclusive enclave of the Coachella Valley. In 2011, Homme discussed having to \"create your own fun\" as a child growing up in the desert, stating that he did not start playing music to \"get girls or make money\" and that he assumed that he would grow up to be \"a good contractor like [his] dad\".\n\nHomme also has ties in Idaho and has talked in the past about spending summers there, including shaping experiences such as seeing Carl Perkins perform at the Sandpoint Music Festival and buying his first electric guitar (his Ovation Ultra GP) in a Sandpoint music store. He began playing guitar at the age of nine, after his parents denied his wishes for a drum kit. He took polka lessons on guitar from ages nine to eleven, during which he supposedly did not learn of a barre chord for the first two years, nor of a pick until his third year, lending to his unique playing style. Homme joined his first band, Autocracy, in 1985, at the age of 12.\n\nIn 1987, when he was 14 years old, Homme formed a punk rock-influenced heavy metal band with schoolmates John Garcia and Brant Bjork in Palm Desert called Katzenjammer; he was the band's guitarist. After changing their name a few times, first to Sons of Kyuss (they released an EP of the same name), they finally shortened it to Kyuss. The band garnered a cult following by the early 1990s, often driving for hours to isolated locations in the desert and plugging into generators to perform. These events, known as \"generator parties\", became urban legend among rock subculture. The band became both famous for their heavy, down tuned, groove oriented music, and infamous for their backstage fights with local LA bands when they traveled into town to play gigs. This soon brought the attention of Chris Goss, who became the band's mentor, helping the band sign to a label and producing them exclusively in an effort to preserve their sound. Due to Homme being younger than 18 at the time of the band's signing, his parents had to sign on his behalf. Kyuss released three major label albums, \"Blues for the Red Sun\", \"Welcome to Sky Valley\", and \"...And the Circus Leaves Town\", all of which are often cited as cornerstones to the development of the stoner rock genre in the 1990s. Kyuss partially reformed in 2010 (now known as Vista Chino), but Homme opted out of the reunion.\n\nWhen Kyuss split up in 1995, Homme joined the Screaming Trees as a rhythm guitarist, touring but not recording with the band. He and vocalist Mark Lanegan became close friends during this time. Disliking the band's continual disharmony, Homme left after just over one year with them. He founded Gamma Ray, a group more centered to his unique style and tastes, which later became Queens of the Stone Age in 1997. The first release under this name would be the \"Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age\" compilation EP featuring tracks from both Kyuss and songs recorded from the Gamma Ray sessions. Shortly thereafter, Queens of the Stone Age released their eponymous debut album in 1998. Originally, Homme had asked a number of singers, including Lanegan, to perform as lead vocalist for Queens of the Stone Age, but ended up singing for the first time in his career.\n\nFollowing their debut album, Queens of the Stone Age released the next album, \"Rated R\", during which the band used a wider range of instruments to achieve a more relaxed, spacious and psychedelic sound. Though it differed from the band's debut, \"Rated R\" became Queens of the Stone Age's first mainstream hit. The next release, 2002's \"Songs for the Deaf\", however, would gain even more buzz from the music community and fans alike. In \"Songs for the Deaf\", Homme continued his filtering of stoner rock and hard rock. The album centers on Homme's memories of uncomfortable rides through the California desert, where he had performed in his days with Kyuss, and where there was little to do but listen to Spanish radio stations.\n\nDuring this time, Homme had a falling out with bassist and friend Nick Oliveri. Following the release of \"Songs for the Deaf\", their relationship deteriorated until Homme fired Oliveri from the band in 2004. Homme began writing their next album, \"Lullabies to Paralyze\", named after a lyric from the \"Songs for the Deaf\" hidden track \"Mosquito Song\". \"Lullabies to Paralyze\" debuted at number five on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was QOTSA's best charting album on the \"Billboard\" 200 to date.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age's fifth album, \"Era Vulgaris\", was released in early June 2007 and received generally positive reviews from critics. Following the album's touring cycle, the band took a break to focus on individual projects, during which Homme continued to produce and create more records outside the band. This break would unintentionally turn into a six-year gap between albums.\n\nIn 2010, following his work with rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures, Homme began performing more live shows with QOTSA. Following a deluxe reissue of \"Rated R\", a 2011 re-release of their debut album and corresponding tour followed, featuring the album played front to back in the style in which it was recorded. This was the first time many of the songs had been performed live since the album's original release.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, after a tumultuous writing and recording process, Queens of the Stone Age released their sixth album, \"...Like Clockwork\", receiving high praise from critics as well as topping the Billboard 200 charts. \"...Like Clockwork\" highlights Homme's collaborative recording process and features guests such as Sir Elton John, Dave Grohl, Alex Turner, Jake Shears, Trent Reznor, Mark Lanegan, Nick Oliveri, and Homme's wife Brody Dalle.\n\nTheir seventh album, \"Villains\", was released on August 25, 2017.\n\nHomme founded The Desert Sessions in 1997 at the Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, describing it as a musical collective series \"that cannot be defined\". He stated:\n\nThe recordings are done \"on the spot\" in a matter of hours, and the line-up constantly changes, with new contributors being added for each new recording. Artists such as PJ Harvey, Twiggy Ramirez, Dave Catching, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, Ben Shepherd, John McBain, Josh Freese, Chris Goss, Alain Johannes, Dean Ween, and many others from the Palm Desert Scene have contributed to The Desert Sessions recordings.\n\nSo far, ten volumes from The Desert Sessions have been released. Homme has stated to \"NME\", among others, that he would record more material with The Desert Sessions.\n\nIn 1998, Homme formed Eagles of Death Metal with friend Jesse Hughes. Recordings from this project first appeared on Homme's \"The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 & 4\", released that year. Over the next few years, Homme became distracted from EoDM due to the success of Queens of the Stone Age. However, in an October 2008 interview, he re-affirmed his commitment to the band saying, \"This isn't a side project for me. I'm in two bands. I have musical schizophrenia, and this is one of those personalities.\n\nSo far the band has released four albums: \"Peace, Love, Death Metal\" in 2004, \"Death by Sexy\" in 2006, \"Heart On\" in 2008 and most recently \"Zipper Down\" in 2015. Due to his commitments with Queens of the Stone Age and other projects, Homme does not regularly tour with Eagles of Death Metal, but occasionally makes appearances during live performances.\n\nIn July 2009, it was revealed that Homme, Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones were recording together for a musical project named Them Crooked Vultures.\nThe trio performed their first show together on August 9, 2009 in Chicago at The Metro to a crowd of approximately 1,100 ticketholders. The band has been steadily touring with live rhythm guitarist/auxiliary man Alain Johannes. Their album, \"Them Crooked Vultures\", was released by Interscope Records in the United States on November 17, 2009, and by Sony Music internationally. They performed on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest on February 6, 2010, and at Austin City Limits on October 2, 2009. Them Crooked Vultures won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011.\n\nOther acts with which Homme has collaborated include Mondo Generator, Foo Fighters, PJ Harvey, Fatso Jetson, Mark Lanegan Band, Trent Reznor, Masters of Reality, Millionaire, Wellwater Conspiracy, U.N.K.L.E., Primal Scream, Melissa Auf der Maur, Paz Lenchantin, Death from Above 1979, Earthlings?, Mastodon, Peaches, The Strokes, Local H, Biffy Clyro, and Arctic Monkeys. He also collaborated with The Prodigy's Liam Howlett for a remix of The Prodigy track \"Take Me to the Hospital\" in August 2009. It was re-titled \"Take Me to the Hospital (Josh Homme and Liam H.'s wreckage remix)\".\n\nHomme contributed (along with Nick Oliveri and Brad Wilk) to the soundtrack for the 2002 film \"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys\". He and Alain Johannes were originally meant to develop a score for the video game \"Spec Ops\" in 2005, however the project was cancelled (before it would become \"\" in 2012) and any work done on the game would go unused. Homme was also to provide music including a cover of Joe Walsh's In the City for the 2005 video game adaption of the classic film \"The Warriors\", which also went unused.\n\nHomme was notably featured on the compilations \"\" on the song \"Stone Cold Crazy\" alongside Eleven, \"\", as well as the Turbonegro tribute \"Alpha Motherfuckers\" as part of QOTSA covering the song \"Back To Dungaree High\". The very first use of the QOTSA name was on the compilation album \"Burn One Up! Music For Stoners\" featuring a one off lineup of Homme and Dave Catching with Beaver rhythm section Milo Beenhakker and Eva Nahon recording the Catching-penned \"18 A.D.\".\n\nHomme, along with friend and Kyuss/QOTSA contributor/producer Chris Goss, performed as \"The 5:15ers\" at the inaugural ArthurBall (an offshoot of the ArthurFest festival) in Los Angeles on January 26, 2006. The two were credited as \"The Fififf Teeners\" when they co-produced QOTSA's second album, \"Rated R\", and 2007 album, \"Era Vulgaris\".\n\nHomme produced most of the Arctic Monkeys album \"Humbug\" as well as providing backing vocals to \"All My Own Stunts\" on their album \"Suck It and See\". He also appears on their 5th album \"AM\", providing vocals for the tracks, \"One For the Road\" and \"Knee Socks\".\n\nIn June 2010, Homme appeared on the Comedy Central series \"Tosh.0\" to do an unplugged duet version of the hit viral song \"What What\" with Internet celebrity Samwell. He also provided the theme song to \"Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1\", the show formerly known as \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\". Homme also collaborated with Mark Lanegan to provide the theme music for Anthony Bourdain's travel show \"\".\n\nIn May 2012, it was revealed on Dean Delray's comedy podcast \"Let There Be Talk\" that Homme would make a guest appearance on the release from Nick Oliveri's project Mondo Generator called \"Hell Comes To Your Heart\". The album was recorded over three days at Homme's Pink Duck Studios and features Homme playing guitar on the album's final track, \"The Last Train\"; this is the first music Homme and Oliveri have collaborated with since their public falling out in 2004. \"The Last Train\" also features fellow former Kyuss bandmate John Garcia providing vocals, which was recorded shortly before Homme's lawsuit with Garcia regarding the Kyuss Lives! band name. It was the first time Homme had collaborated with Garcia since 1997.\n\nIn June 2012, it was revealed that Homme would be starring in Glen Campbell's final music video for the song \"A Better Place\". In the video, Homme plays a bartender that shows Campbell a photo album of his life, from his early childhood through his music career to the present day. The video marked the end of Campbell's musical career, a retrospect on his life following his decision to retire following his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHomme made a very brief cameo at the end of Jack White's music video for \"Freedom at 21\", playing a police officer who intercepts White at a roadblock following White's escapades throughout the video.\n\nIn September 2012, he contributed the song \"Nobody to Love\" for the action-drama \"End of Watch\".\n\nIn early 2013, Homme and fellow Queens contributors including Alain Johannes and Chris Goss recorded to the soundtrack of Dave Grohl's \"Sound City: Real to Reel\". Goss, Johannes and Homme were on three tracks each. Josh is notably included in a collaboration with Grohl and Trent Reznor called Mantra, and he was also featured in an interview segment.\n\nHomme has appeared in a number of television comedies. In December 2014, Homme made an appearance on Channel 4 sitcom \"Toast of London\". The star of the show, Matt Berry, had been working alongside Morgana Robinson (the half-sister of Homme's wife, Brody Dalle) in the BBC sitcom \"House of Fools\" (2014–2015), in which both had prominent roles. Earlier in the year, Homme also made appearances on IFC's \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\" and \"Portlandia\".\n\nIn July 2015, Homme began hosting a weekly hour-long show called \"The Alligator Hour with Joshua Homme\" on Apple Music's newly debuted 24-hour streaming internet radio station Beats 1. The show features a highly eclectic selection of songs personally selected by Homme, interspersed with his own (often wry) introductions of, and commentary about, the various tracks on that particular week's playlist. The Alligator Hour's musical selections typically have some sort of thematic, stream-of-consciousness-type relationship to each other.\n\nHomme released a surprise album with Iggy Pop titled \"Post Pop Depression\" in March 2016. The nine-track album was recorded at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, as well as his Homme's Burbank studio Pink Duck. Their backing band included Dean Fertita of QOTSA and Dead Weather on guitar and keyboards, and Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders; the two joined Pop and Homme on tour, along with Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar and Matt Sweeney on bass. The band made their debut on January 21, 2016 on the \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert\", announcing the album, and proceeded on a North American and European theatre tour that March, culminating in a performance at the Royal Albert Hall, filmed and released as a concert DVD. The album's recording was also fimed and compiled into the 2017 documentary \"American Valhalla\".\n\nIn October 2016, the Homme produced debut album from The Strokes' Nick Valensi's new band, CRX, titled \"New Skin\" was released.\n\nIn 2017, he composed the score for Fatih Akin's German-language drama \"In the Fade\", named after the QOTSA song on \"Rated R\".\n\nOn December 3, 2005, Homme married singer and musician Brody Dalle of The Distillers. They reside in Palm Springs, California with their daughter, Camille Harley Joan Homme (born January 17, 2006), and two sons, Orrin Ryder Homme (born August 12, 2011) and Wolf Dillon Reece Homme (born February 13, 2016).\n\nHomme has over 20 tattoos. On his knuckles, he has his grandparents' nicknames (\"Cam\" for \"Camille\" on the left and \"Cap\" on the right) with hearts and his two sons' names (\"ORH\" for \"Orrin Ryder Homme\" and \"Wolf\"). He has his daughter's name, also Camille, tattooed over his heart. His left arm has a switchblade with \"Stay Sharp\" underneath, while his inner right arm has a straight-edge razor with \"Born to Win\" inscribed; underneath, his nickname, \"Baby Duck\", is a shared tattoo with his Eagles of Death Metal bandmate Jesse Hughes, who has his nickname \"Boots Electric\" in the same location. Homme also shares a tattoo that says \"Freitag 4:15\" with former Queens of the Stone Age bandmates Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan and their sound engineer Hutch, commemorating their \"worst show ever\" at the Rock Am Ring Festival in Germany on Friday, June 1, 2001, at 4:15 pm. They all got the tattoo on their ribs so that it would hurt the most and serve as a reminder.\n\nHomme has described himself as \"very politically conservative\" and \"very socially liberal\", considering himself a \"fallen libertarian\". He owns several guns, including a classic Winchester rifle, a sawed-off shotgun, and a Beretta 9 mm target pistol. He has only ever owned one car, a silver 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, which he has owned since he was 14.\n\nHomme said that he \"died\" of asphyxiation for a short time in 2010, following unexpected complications during knee surgery. He contracted a MRSA infection, which his immune system could not fight due to stress. Doctors eventually used a defibrillator to revive him following the asphyxiation. The experience left him weakened and unable to produce music for almost two years. Following this, he was confined to his bed for three months and plunged into a deep depression, considering giving up his music career. He has said that this experience greatly contributed to the making of the Queens of the Stone Age album \"...Like Clockwork\". He credits Transcendental Meditation with helping him recover.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 10/13\"></ref> In June 2016, he alluded that the story about his knee surgery may have been created by \"somebody else\", adding that he went \"in too deep\" involving drugs and sank into a depression.\n\nHomme adopted the pseudonym \"Carlo Von Sexron\" to credit his playing of bass, keyboard, piano, and drums on such albums as \"The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 & 4\", Queens of the Stone Age, and \"Peace, Love, Death Metal\" from Eagles of Death Metal. Homme is known as \"(King) Baby Duck\" to Dalle and the members of Eagles of Death Metal. He is also referred to as \"J.Ho.\", \"Joe's Hoe\" and \"The Ginger Elvis\".\nIn an interview, Nick Oliveri refers to Homme as \"Mr. Lucky\".\n\nIn 2004, Homme was arrested for assaulting Dwarves frontman Blag Dahlia and Karl Doyle, at Los Angeles' Dragonfly club. Pleading no contest, Homme was ordered to remain at least 100 yards (91.44 meters) away from Dahlia and the club, was sentenced to 3 years probation with community service, and was forced to enter a rehab program for 60 days.\n\nAt the 2008 Norwegian Wood festival in Oslo, Homme drew criticism for his reaction to an audience member who had thrown a shoe at him during the song \"3's & 7's\". Homme called the audience member a \"chicken-shit fucking faggot\" and \"a 12-year-old dickless fucking turd\". The incident drew accusations of homophobia from several blogs, which were then picked up by the mainstream media. Homme replied with a lengthy public letter denying all accusations of homophobia, and stated that the tirade was aggravated by food poisoning and a high fever.\n\nFollowing a 2013 performance by QOTSA at Jay-Z's Made in America Festival, Homme made comments about Jay-Z during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2's \"Strombo Show\". He explained that his band was frisked by the event's security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay-Z's personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt:\n\nIn 2016, Homme was involved in a verbal altercation with autograph seller Jason Leckrone, who eyewitnesses said was taunting Homme for not signing autographs. Homme began to argue with Leckrone and called him an \"entitled, spoiled motherfucker\". In 2017, Leckrone filed a lawsuit against Homme for assault and battery.\n\nIn December 2017, Homme was captured on video kicking the camera of Shutterstock photographer Chelsea Lauren into her face during KROQ's Almost Christmas concert in Los Angeles. After staying through the show and photographing subsequent bands, Lauren went to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for treatment. In a statement, Homme claimed that he had been kicking over lighting equipment and was unaware that he had kicked Lauren until he was informed of it the next day. Lauren disputed this, stating that Homme had made eye contact with her before kicking her. The day after the incident, Homme issued a video response, in which he admitted to kicking Lauren and apologized to her.\n\n"}

There Leo joined a Zionist group and studied Jewish history at a Jewish primary school, and then studied at a Russian secondary school. When Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, he went to Shanghai where attended a British school, and also served in the Jewish Shanghai Volunteer Corps. He was a leader of Shanghai Betar, the Revisionist Zionist youth organization.\n\nIn 1937, he moved to Kobe, Japan, to work in a textile firm. The small Jewish community there elected him its honorary secretary. From August 1940 to November 1941 two thousand Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugees, who were saved from the Holocaust by the Japanese viceconsul in Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara, arrived into Kobe. The Jewish community helped them by finding homes, donating medical supplies and clothing, and arranging, by the Polish ambassador to Japan Tadeusz Romer, their visas so they could stay on in Japan.\n\nIn 1942 he returned to Shanghai and spent the rest of the war working there. He emigrated to Israel in 1948 and next moved to the United States in 1972.\n\nHe described the Jewish community in Kobe and its activities in a special interview in 1999.\n"}
{"id": "504583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504583", "title": "Maggie Gallagher", "text": "Maggie Gallagher\n\nMargaret Gallagher (born September 14, 1960) is an American writer and socially conservative commentator. She wrote a syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate from 1995 to 2013 and has written books. She serves as president of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, a nonprofit organization which lobbies on issues of marriage law. She is an executive committee member, former president and former chairman of the board of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage and other legal recognition of same-sex partnerships.\n\nMaggie Gallagher was born on September 14, 1960 to William Walter Gallagher Sr. and the former Darrilyn Doris Stenz. She is originally from Lake Oswego, Oregon, where she attended Lakeridge High School. She has three siblings: Kathleen, William Jr., and Colleen. Her parents were initially active in their local Catholic parish, but her mother left the Church when she was 8, but remained interested in spirituality, while Maggie became what she later described as a \"pro-life atheist\" and a reader of Ayn Rand and Robert A. Heinlein.\n\nIn 1982, she earned a B.A. in Religious Studies from Yale University, where she belonged to the Party of the Right in the Yale Political Union. While at Yale she tried marijuana once but did not like it.\n\nOn October 6, 2010, she returned to the Union to debate against same-sex marriage with opponent Evan Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry and fellow alumnus of the Yale Political Union. Shortly before she was due to graduate, she fell pregnant after a relationship with a fellow party member. She gave birth to a son out of wedlock. She initially planned to put the baby up for adoption but then changed her mind. Neither of the parents thought that they should marry.\n\nShe said that the father eventually abandoned her and became uninterested in their child.\n\nIn her twenties, she reverted to Catholicism because her experience as a single mother made her consider the necessity of fathers and the linkage of sex to procreation.\n\nGallagher married Raman Srivastav, a Hindu, in 1993 and they have one son together.\n\nGallagher attended the premiere reading of \"8\", Dustin Lance Black's play about the trial surrounding California's Proposition 8, where a depiction of her was performed by Jayne Houdyshell. She expressed the opinion that most people would find the work \"kind of dull\". In a Los Angeles performance, the Gallagher role was performed by Jane Lynch.\n\nGallagher has written several books, including ones with co-author Linda J. Waite, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. Gallagher serves as president of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, a conservative think tank whose slogan is \"strengthening marriage for a new generation.\" She was also President of the National Organization for Marriage from its founding until April 16, 2010, when Brian S. Brown took over that role. She maintains a position on NOM's executive committee.\n\nIn late 2011 she founded the Culture War Victory Fund, and serves as the fund's director.\n\nOn January 2, 2013, she announced the retirement of her syndicated column, then distributed by Universal Uclick.\n\nGallagher is a Roman Catholic and a social conservative. She is a signatory of the , a November 2009 ecumenical statement calling on Orthodox, Catholic, and Evangelical Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters against their religious consciences.\n\nGallagher opposes abortion and believes that \"Roe v. Wade\" should be overturned. She believes that most people who support legal abortion do so reluctantly because they think it is a necessary evil.\n\nGallagher is opposed to the legalization of assisted suicide such as the Death with Dignity Act or voluntary euthanasia. Gallagher believes that state-approved suicide diminishes the value of life, especially for the elderly, sick, or vulnerable.\n\nGallagher is a strong opponent of the legal recognition of same-sex unions and has written books toward that end. Gallagher holds that one of the purposes of marriage is always procreation and rearing children exclusively by heterosexual parents, and argues that same-sex unions diminish the value of heterosexual marriages. Gallagher has compared winning the fight to ban same-sex marriage with the fall of communism and believes that if same-sex marriage is made legal, it will mean \"losing American civilization.\"\n\nGallagher advocates litigation against spouses who commit adultery and opposes laws which facilitate no-fault divorce.\n\nGallagher has written that \"[w]e need a social institution, endowed with public authority, that teaches young men and women [...] that they need to come together in love to raise the children their bodies make together. If this is a core purpose of marriage, then same-sex unions are not marriages. If gay unions are marriages, then this is no longer what marriage is about.\"\n\nFurther, Gallagher has written that same-sex marriage is \"rooted in a false equation: Loving a man is not the same as loving a woman; a sexual union that can give rise to children is fundamentally different in kind than a union not so freighted, for good and for ill, with the fact of procreativity.\"\n\nIn October 2006, Gallagher suggested to gay rights groups that they stop promoting same-sex marriage and start vigorously advocating for civil unions. In 2010, she expressed her support for certain kinds of civil unions for same-sex couples but not available for opposite-sex couples. However, she, in 2012, supported North Carolina's Amendment 1, a state constitutional amendment that bans both recognition of same-sex marriages and civil unions.\n\nGallagher believes that many people in the LGBT community, specifically gay men, choose to oppose what they label as the \"heteronormative\" constraints of a monogamous relationship, with reference to Eric Erbelding's assertion that the married gay couples he knows are \"for the most part monogamous, but for maybe a casual three-way\".\n\nGallagher had previously expressed opposition to domestic partnerships and civil unions, and she believes that domestic partner benefits \"erode the status\" of heterosexual marriage. She has stated that same-sex marriage is worse than polygamy, which/\"for all its ugly defects, is an attempt to secure stable mother-father families for children.\"\n\nGallagher has stated that \"[s]exual orientation is almost certainly unchosen\", but that the decision to act on that desire and to incorporate it into one’s identity is a choice that bears moral reflection. She believes that \"sexual desire is not its own justification\" for acceptance or legal recognition of same-sex relationships. She has also written that \"once the principle [of same-sex marriage] is in the law, the next step will be to use the law to stigmatize, marginalize, and repress those who disagree with the government’s new views on marriage and sexual orientation.\" As an example, she has cited efforts by LGBT advocates to revoke the tax-exempt status of churches that oppose same-sex marriage.\n\nGallagher has stated that she will not attend a same-sex wedding if she is ever invited to one.\n\nGallagher believes that teaching abstinence (encouraging celibacy until legally married) should be the sole curriculum. She does not believe in instructing students in birth control or how to prevent STDs through use of condoms or safe-sex techniques and has advocated discontinuing all safer-sex education in public schools.\n\nWhen Dan Quayle criticized the fictional television character Murphy Brown for being an unwed mother, Gallagher wrote an op-ed for \"The New York Times\", \"An Unwed Mother for Quayle\", in his defense.\n\nGallagher's endorsement of candidate Rick Santorum in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries was promoted by the Santorum campaign.\n\nGallagher received tens of thousands of dollars from the Department of Health and Human Services during 2002 and 2003 for helping the George W. Bush administration promote the President's Healthy Marriage Initiative. Gallagher testified before Congress in favor of \"healthy marriage\" programs but never disclosed the payments. When asked about that situation, she replied, \"Did I violate journalistic ethics by not disclosing it? I don't know. You tell me…frankly, it never occurred to me.\"\n\nAfter \"The Washington Post\" revealed this information on January 26, 2005, Gallagher claimed significant differences between her situation and that of conservative columnist Armstrong Williams. She went on to add, \"I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it. My apologies to my readers.\"\n\nGallagher received an additional $20,000 from the Bush administration for writing a report, titled \"Can Government Strengthen Marriage?\", for the National Fatherhood Initiative, a private organization.\n\nOn a February 2012 edition of \"Up with Chris Hayes\" on which Gallagher appeared for a segment on the revival of the \"culture wars\", Gallagher was asked by \"The Nation\" editor Richard Kim about her support of gay reparative therapy. Gallagher denied having ever supported ex-gay therapy and claimed that Kim was \"making stuff up\". Kim subsequently quoted from a 2001 column written by Gallagher praising Robert Spitzer for his research on the possibilities of ex-gay therapy and calling on then-President George W. Bush to support federal funding for research into ex-gay therapy. In 2013, after blogging her support for Chuck Limandri's representation of JONAH (a Jewish organization that offered support to persons with unwanted same-sex attraction), Gallagher made the following comments regarding conversion therapy:\nListed by original publication date:\n\n\n"}

According to statistics, the Orthodox Byzantine tradition in Azerbaijan is 2.3% (209.7 thousand people). The territory of Azerbaijan is in the jurisdiction of the Baku-Azerbaijan Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nSerious changes in the Albanian church occurred under the Arab rule, when the Catholicos Nerses I Bakur (688-704) attempted to convert to Chalcedonism, thus recognizing the spiritual authority of Constantinople. He was deposed by the Grand Duke of Albania Shero and other feudal lords who remained faithful to the Albanian church, and cursed at the national church cathedral. In the second half of the 10th century, the population of the left-bank Albania (Hereti) was included in the sphere of influence of the decision of the Chalcedon Council of the Georgian Church, adopted in the 7th century and got a great impact of Georgia.\n\nWhen the territories of Transcaucasia entered the Russian Empire, the Albanian Catholicos of the church in 1813 by the decree of Tsar Nicholas I passed into the status of the metropolite of the Albanian church.\n\nOrthodoxy became wide spread in Azerbaijan at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nIn 1815, the first Russian Orthodox church appeared in Baku. Later such churches were built in Ganja, Goranboy (Borisi-Russian village, 1842), Shemakha (Alty-Aghadj village, 1834), Lankaran (Vel village, 1838), and Gedabek (Slavyanka village, 1844).\n\nThere were 21 sectarian villages in Baku during 1868.\n\nIn 1905, the Baku Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. During the Soviet era, the authorities repressed the priests of the Baku diocese, but in 1944 two churches were opened.\n\nIn 1998, the Baku-Caspian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. On March 22, 2011, the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was changed to the Baku-Caspian diocese in Baku-Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 2011 there were six Christian Orthodox churches in the country. Five of them belong to the Russian Orthodox church (ROC): three of them are located in Baku one in Ganja and one in Khachmaz.\n\nAnother temple belongs to the jurisdiction of the Georgian Orthodox Church - the church of St. George in the village of Gakh-Inguila in the Qakh district, where the Ingiloi Georgians live compactly (about 7,500 people).\n\nIn 2013, November, President Ilham Aliyev participated in the opening ceremony of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy. Firstly The President visited the Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral.\n\nThere is also the Michael Archangel’s Temple in the capital city Baku.\n\nIn 2001, during his visit to Azerbaijan, Patriarch Alexe II met with representatives of the Udin community who expressed the desire of their people to join the ROC. However, this did not lead to any real results, and the community of Udin remained outside the church's nourishment.\n\nIn May 28, 2003, the Albanian-Udin Christian community was established in Azerbaijan. The Chairman of the community was Robert Mobilea. This was due to the restoration of the ancient Kish temple in Shaki (according to legend, the foundation was laid by the apostle Eliseus). In 2006, the restoration of the second Udin temple, the church in the village of Nijgabalinsky district, was completed. Restoration works are also continued in the village of Gum of the Gakh region and the basilica in the village of Gyumriuk with the intention of restoration of the Albanian basilica which is related to the 5th century.\n\nIn 2006, the bishop of Baku and the Caspian Sea, Alexander (Ishchein), reported that Orthodox worship will be performed in Udin churches, and priests for them are trained in Russian religious schools. The Baku diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church took part in some solemn events, and even held baptisms, but there is no general progress on the involving of Udin into the ROC. Meanwhile, the Albanian-Udin Christian community exists in the form of a separate ethno-religious group with its own ideas about the \"Udin Church\", in which rituals are conducted not by canonical clergymen, but by the members of the community. In particular, the right to baptize was taken over by the Chairman of the AUHO Robert Mobilea and the self-styled \"spiritual figure\" Rafik Danakari.\n\n\n\n"}

(Yang 2005:4) The Panhu myth is an important origin myth for various ethnic groups.\n\nThe basic Panhu myth is about a dog (or dragon-dog) who transforms into a man and married a princess. The emperor of China in the course of losing a war which he was waging with a neighbor to the west, offered to marry his daughter to anybody that would present him with the head of his enemy. This was accomplished by the dog. Accounts vary, but eventually the dog and princess procreated copiously, producing many descendants.\n\nThere are also various variant versions. In some the dog became transformed into a human, except for his head. (Christie 1968: 121-122)\n\nIn the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which tradition which presents a more historicized and one which presents a more mythological version.

The park borders the Hin Namno Nature Reserve in Khammouane Province, Laos to the west and 42 km east of the South China Sea from its borderline point. Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park is situated in a limestone zone of 2,000 km in Vietnamese territory and borders another limestone zone of 2,000 km of Hin Namno in Laotian territory. The core zone of this national park covers 857.54 km and a buffer zone of 1,954 km.\n\nThe park was created to protect one of the world's two largest karst regions with 300 caves and grottoes and also protects the ecosystem of limestone forest of the Annamite Range region in North Central Coast of Vietnam.\n\nPhong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is noted for its cave and grotto systems as it is composed of 300 caves and grottos. A 2009 survey brought the total discovered length of the cave system to about 126 km, with many areas still not well explored. The Sơn Đoòng Cave, which was discovered in the 2009 survey by British and Vietnamese explorers, is considered the largest cave in the world. Even before this discovery, Phong Nha held several world cave records, including the longest river as well as the largest combined caverns and passageways.\n\nThe park derives its name from Phong Nha Cave, containing many fascinating rock formations, and Kẻ Bàng forest. The plateau on which the park is situated is probably one of the finest and most distinctive examples of a complex karst landform in Southeast Asia. This national park was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites in 2003 for its geological values as defined in its criteria viii. In April 2009, the world's largest cave, was re-discovered by a team of British cave explorers of the British Caving Association led by a local farmer named Ho Khanh.\n\nChampa inscriptions carved on steles and altars in the cave demonstrate that people had inhabited the cave long before the area was annexed by Vietnam in the Nam tiến or southward expansion. In 1550, Dương Văn An was the first Vietnamese man to write about Phong Nha cave. This cave was depicted in 9 urns in the Citadel of the Nguyễn Dynasty in Huế. In 1824, The cave was conferred the title \"Diệu ứng chi thần\" () by King Minh Mạng. It was also conferred by Nguyen kings as \"Thần Hiển Linh\" ().\n\nIn the late 19th century, Léopold Michel Cadière, a French Roman Catholic priest, conducted an expedition to explore Phong Nha cave, where he discovered Champa scripts. He proclaimed Phong Nha cave \"The number one cave of Indochina\". In July 1924, an English expeditionist (surnamed Barton) stated that Phong Nha cave is second to none of famous caves of Padirac (France), Cuevas del Drach (Spain). In 1935, a local inhabitant accidentally discovered a beautiful cave 1 km from the mouth of Phong Nha cave, at an elevation of 200 meters. It was called Tien Son cave (lit.: \"Fairy-tale cave\"), or Dry cave because its inside landscape is similar to fairy-tales and it has no underground river.\n\nIn 1937, the Bureau of Tourism of French Resident Superior (in Huế) issued a brochure to introduce tourism in Quảng Bình and Phong Nha Cave was included in this introduction. This tour site is ranked second in French Indochina. Before 1990, several explorations were conducted by Vietnamese and foreign groups but the mystery of this area still remained. From 1990 on, there marked a turning point in discovering activities, from exploration to research, thus full documents for submission to UNESCO for World Natural Heritage nomination were made available.\n\nIN 1990, for the first time, Hanoi University accepted the cooperation proposal of the British Cave Research Association. They combined efforts in exploring and researching caves and grottoes in the area comprehensively. The first exploration was conducted in 1990 by a group from the British Cave Research Association and Faculty for Geology and Geography of Hanoi University, led by Howard Limbert. They completed research of a large part of Vom Cave. In 1992, the second exploration was conducted by a group of 12 British scientists, six professors from Hanoi University. This time, this group completed their exploration of 7,729 m of Phong Nha Cave and 13,690 m of Vom Cave and adjacent caves and grottos. In 1994, a third exploration was carried out by a group of 11 British scientists and five Vietnamese professors of Hanoi University. In 1999 scientists from the Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre also conducted zoological and botanical surveys in the Kẻ Bàng area. Based on the results of these three explorations, more information about the caves and grottoes made available to the Vietnamese and local government for the protection, planning, and tourism development of this park.\n\nIn 2005, scientists from the British Cave Research Association discovered a new cave and named it Paradise Cave (\"động Thiên Đường\"). The newly discovered cave was acclaimed by the British scientists as \"the largest and the most beautiful cave in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area\".\n\nOn June 1, 2006, the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam issued a stamp collection of depicting various landscapes found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng.\n\nIn April 2009, a group of cave explorers from British Caving Association conducted survey in this park and adjacent areas. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is more than five (5) kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide. With these dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtakes Deer Cave in Malaysia to take the title of the world's largest cave. At the same time they found new caves and grottoes in the park and adjacent area. In this survey, the cave British explorers discovered 20 new caves with total length of 56 km, including world's largest cave, Sơn Đoòng.\n\nPhong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park is located in the territories of communes (Vietnamese: \"xã\"): Tan Trach, Thuong Trach, Phuc Trach, Xuan Trach and Son Trach of Bố Trạch District and a small part of Minh Hóa District in the center of Quảng Bình Province, around 40 km north-west of the provincial capital city of Đồng Hới. The park is bordered by the Hin Namno karst area of Khammouane Province of Laos in the west. Road distances are about 500 km south of the capital Hanoi and 260 km north of the port city of Đà Nẵng. The geographical coordinates are .\n\nThe park is situated around 30 km west of the South China Sea and National Route 1A, near Hồ Chí Minh Highway and 28 km west of the Hanoi–Saigon Railway, and is accessible by road or waterway through an estuary in the South China Sea. There is a small airport near the park accessible by helicopter or small aircraft (Khe Gat Airbase), an airbase used by the North Vietnamese Air Force during the Vietnam War, notably in the Battle of Đồng Hới.\n\nBefore becoming a national park, this area had been a nature reserve. The Phong Nha Nature Reserve with an area of 50 km was officially declared by the Vietnamese government on 9 August 1986 and was extended to 411.32 km by 1991. On 12 December 2001, the Vietnamese Prime Minister by Decision 189/2001 189/2001/QĐ-TTG turning then a nature reserve into a national park. The purpose of this protected area is to protect forest resources, biodiversity within the boundary of this national park and to preserve scientific values of fauna and flora in Bắc Trung Bộ region, especially rare species native to this region. The park covers a total area of 857.54 km which are divided into three zones, a \"strictly protected zone\" (648.94 km), an \"ecological recovery zone\" (174.49 km), and an \"administrative service zone\" (34.11 km).\n\nLike North Central Coast in general, and Quảng Bình Province in particular, the climate in Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng national park is tropically hot and humid. The annual mean temperature is 23-25 °C (73-77 °F), with a maximum of 41 °C (106 °F) in the summer and a minimum of 6 °C (43 °F) in the winter. The hottest months in this region fall from June to August, with an average temperature of 28 °C (82 °F), and the coldest months from December to February with an average temperature of 18 °C (64 °F). Annual rainfall is about 2,000 mm to 2,500 mm (80-100 in). 88% of the rainfall falls during the monsoon, from July to December, however, there is more than 160 rainy days per year, and some rain still falls throughout the dry season. Mean annual relative humidity is 84%.\n\nThe Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng karst has evolved since the Paleozoic (some 400 million years ago), making it the oldest major karst area in Asia. It has been subject to massive tectonic changes, and comprises a multitude of rock types that are interbedded in complex ways. As many as seven different major levels of karst development have occurred as a result of tectonic uplift and changing sea levels, thus the karst landscape of PNKB is extremely complex with high geodiversity and many geomorphic features of considerable significance. There is also strong evidence that sulphurous solution and hydrothermal action have played an important role in shaping the broad-scale landscape and the caves, though this has not yet been properly assessed. The Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area today is the result of five stages of Earth's crust development and movement:\n\nPhong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is one of the world's two largest limestone regions. In comparison with 41 other world heritage sites which have karsts, Phong Nha has dissimilar geomorphic, geologic and biotic conditions. The karsts of Phong Nha can be traced back to Palaeozoic era, 400 million years ago. This makes Phong Nha the oldest major karst in Asia. If the Hin Namno, bordering Phong Nha on the west (in Laotian territory) was to be combined with the national park in a continuous reserve, the combined reserve would be the largest surviving karst forest in southeastern Asia (317,754 ha).\n\nIn general, there are two groups of landforms in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area, namely non-karstic and karstic landforms. Non-karstic landforms includes three types: The middle and low dome-block mountains developed in intrusive magmatic massifs; The middle denudation-structural mountain belts developed in terrigenous rocks of Cretaceous age; and The low block-denudational mountain belts developed in other terrigenous rocks. Karstic landforms in this area are of typical tropical karst which are divided into two groups of forms: The karstic forms on the surface including cone and tower karst, karrens, valleys and dolines, border polje, etc.; The underground karst consisting of caves.\n\nIn comparison with three other national parks listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia, namely Gunung Mulu National Park in Malaysia, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan of the Philippines and Lorentz National Park in West Irian of Indonesia and some other karst regions in Thailand, China, Papua New Guinea, karst in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is older, has more complicated geological structure; diverse and complex underground rivers.\n\nPhong Nha-Kẻ Bàng contains two dozens of mountain peaks with over 1,000 metres in height. Noteworthy peaks are the Peak Co Rilata with a height of 1,128 m and the Peak Co Preu with a height of 1,213 m. Mounts in karstic area of the park rise at typical height of above 800 m constitute a continuous range along Laotian-Vietnamese borderline, of which notable summits above 1000 m are: Phu Tạo (1174 m), Co Unet (1150 m), Phu Canh (1095 m), Phu Mun (1078 m), Phu Tu En (1078 m), Phu On Chinh (1068 m), Phu Dung (1064 m), Phu Tu Ôc (1053 m), Phu Long (1015 m), Phu Ôc (1015 m), Phu Dong (1002 m). Inserting into these summits are 800–1000 m high summits of Phu Sinh (965 m), Phu Co Tri (949 m), Phu On Boi (933 m), Phu Tu (956 m), Phu Toan (905 m), Phu Phong (902 m) and núi Ma Ma (835 m).\n\nNon-karstic topographical area accounts for a low percentage, distributing mainly in outer circle of limestone in the north, northeast and southeast of this national park. The height of these summits varies from 500-1000  m with the deep divisions and high sloping level from 25-30°. There are some narrow valleys along streams such as Am creek, Cha Lo creek, Chua Ngút creek and a valley along Rao Thuong river in the southernmost edge. In the north-south direction, there exists notable summits: Phu Toc Vu (1000 m), Mã Tác (1068 m), Cổ Khu (886 m), U Bò (1009 m), Co Rilata (1128 m); The highest summit in the non-karstic area and also the highest summt of this national park is Co Preu (1213 m), a summit in the southernmost edge of the park.\n\nBesides the grotto and cave systems, Phong Nha has the longest underground river. The Sơn and Chay are the main rivers in this national park. Most of caves here have been shaped by Son and Chay Rivers. The Son River flows into the mouth of the Phong Nha cave and keeps on underground, where it is called the Nam Aki River. It emerges 20 km to the south near Pu-Pha-Dam Mountain. There are spectacular streams, springs and waterfalls in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng, namely: Gió waterfall, Madame Loan waterfall, Mọc stream erupting from a limestone mount range, and Trạ Ang stream.\n\nPhong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is home to the largest cave in the world and covers 300 different grottoes and caves. Before Sơn Đoòng Cave was found, Phong Nha Cave was regarded by British Caving Association as the top cave in the world due to its top four records: the longest underground river, the highest and longest cave, broadest and most beautiful fine sand beaches inside the caves, and the most spectacular stalagmites and stalactites. In the survey conducted in April 2009, the British cave explorers discovered 20 new caves with total length of 56 km, including world's largest cave Son Doong. According to the assessment of UNESCO, \"The karst formation of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park has evolved since the Palaeozoic (some 400 million years ago) and so is the oldest major karst area in Asia\" and \"Phong Nha displays an impressive amount of evidence of earth's history. It is a site of very great importance for increasing our understanding of the geologic, geomorphic and geo-chronological history of the region.\"\n\nThe name \"Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng\" is composed of \"Phong Nha\" (cave) and \"Kẻ Bàng\" (limestone forest). Phong Nha is widely explained as originating from Hán Nôm 风 牙, which means wind-tooth (wind flowing from the cave and stalactites and stalagmites inside the cave looking like teeth).\n\nAnother possibility is that Phong Nha, unrelated to the meanings \"wind\" and \"teeth\", was the former name of a nearby village.\n\nA third hypothesis suggests that Phong Nha derived its name from the imagination that mounts in this region standing in line looks similar to the scene of mandarins in front of the king in royal courts, therefore, it was named Phong Nha. \"Phong\" (峰) means \"summit\" and \"nha\" (衙) means \"mandarin\".\nOther names for the Phong Nha cave include: Thầy Tiên cave, Thầy Mount, and Troóc cave.\n\nThis cave, from which the name to the whole system and the park is derived, is famous for its rock formations which have been given names such as the \"Lion\", the \"Fairy Caves\", the \"Royal Court\", and the \"Buddha\". This cave is 7729 m long, contains 14 grottos, with a 13,969 m-long underground river. The scientists have surveyed 44.5 km of grottos in this cave so far, but tourists can only penetrate to a distance of 1500 m.\n\nPhong Nha Cave, like most of the caves in this area, has been continuously shaped by the Chay River. As one gets farther into the cave, the more illusory the stalactites and stalagmites look as they glitter when bright light is shone on them. The Son River flows into the mouth of the cave and keeps flowing underground, where it is referred to as the Nam Aki River, then this river emerges at a site 20 km to the south near Pu Pha Dam Mountain. The main Phong Nha cave includes 14 chambers, connected by an underwater river that runs for 1.5 km. Secondary corridors branch off in all directions. The Outer Cave and some of the Inner Caves have roofs that tower between 25 and 40 meters above the water level. From the 14th chamber there may be other corridors leading to similarly large chambers, but this area proves more dangerous for explorers because of the ongoing erosion of the limestone of the cavern. The Shallow Cave is located 800 meters from the cave mouth, where there is a spectacular landscape of sand and rock. Stalactites and stalagmites jut out like strange trees, exciting visitor's imaginations.\n\nNotable caves and grottoes in the Phong Nha Cave system include:\n\n\nTiên Sơn cave is located in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was discovered by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935. It is located in Sơn Trach Commune in Bố Trạch. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1 km from Phong Nha cave, at an altitude of 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m deep hole is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists only. Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was levered or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.\n\nThiên Đường \"Paradise\" Cave is a newly found cave in this area. Prior to the discovery of Sơn Đoòng cave, it was regarded as the largest and longest cave in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng. Some of the most beautiful and spectacular stalactites and stalagmites in the park are found within Thiên Đường. The cave was discovered by a local man in 2005. The first 5 km of this cave was explored by explorers from the British Cave Research Association in 2005; later they in 2010 the whole 31 km was explored and announced by the association.\n\nAt 31 km long, Thiên Đường cave is longer than Phong Nha cave, previously considered the longest cave in this national park. The height can reach to 100 m and 150 wide. The limestone formation is also more spectacular than that of Phong Nha Cave. The British cave explorers was impressed by the beauty of the rock formation inside the cave, they named it \"Paradise Cave\" (\"Thiên Đường\" in Vietnamese). Access road and tourist facilities was built by Truong Thinh Group, it was opened up to tourists on 3 September 2010 with a 1.1 km path to see the formations.\n\nSơn Đoòng Cave (in Vietnamese: Hang Sơn Đoòng, meaning Mountain River Cave) is a relatively recently discovered cave in the national park. Found by a local man and explored and publicly announced by the British cave scientists of the British Cave Research Association, it is regarded as the largest cave in the world. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is over five kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide. With these tremendous dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtakes Deer Cave of Malaysia to take the title of world's largest cave. Because the fast flowing underground river in the cave deterred the explorers from going farther, they were only able to estimate the length of the cave using a flashlight.\n\nThe cave was found by a man named Hồ Khanh in 1991. The local jungle men were afraid of the cave for the whistling sound it makes from the underground river. However, not until 2009 was it made known to the public when a group of British scientists from the British Cave Research Association, led by Howard and Deb Limbert, conducted a survey in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng from 10–14 April 2009. Their progress was stopped by a large calcite wall.\n\nAccording to the Limberts, this cave is five times larger than the Phong Nha Cave, previously considered the biggest cave in Vietnam. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is over five kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide. With these dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtook Deer Cave in Malaysia to take the title of the world's largest cave.\n\nRuc Mon Cave, named after the indigenous people who made a home at the entrance until the 80s, was discovered in 2016 by a local man. The cave is 17km in length, with one entrance in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park and the other at the border of Laos. This cave has the potential to be the second biggest cave in the world, following the first biggest cave also located in a Phong Nha. In 2017, the first tourists explored the cave, guided by the man who found it. One of over 300 caves in Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park, this cave is probably the least-explored of the many caves open to tourists. Greenland Tour company is the only company that offers access to the cave. The tours are led by the man who discovered the cave.\n\nThe park is part of the Annamites eco-region. By far the largest vegetation type is tropical dense moist evergreen forest on limestone under 800 m above sea level. 96.2% of this national park is covered with forest, 92.2% of which is intact primary forest. 74.7% (1104.76 km) of the park is covered with evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at the elevation of under 800 m; 8.5% (126 km) is evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at an elevation higher than 800 m; 8.3% (122.2 km) evergreen tropical wet forest on soil mounts at the elevation of under 800 m; evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at the elevation of under 800 m; 0.7% (10.7 km) evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks at the elevation of above 800; 1.1% impacted evergreen tropical wet forest on limestone rocks; 2.8% (42.12 km) impacted evergreen tropical wet forest on soil mounts; 1.3% (1,925) grass, bush on limestone rocks; 2% (29.5 km) grass, bush on soil mounts; permanent wetland forest: 1.8 km; rattan and bamboo forest: 1.5 km; and agricultural plants: 5.21 km or 0.3%. According to the results of initial surveys, the primary tropical forest in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng consists of 140 families, 427 genera, and 751 species of vascular plants, of which 36 species are endangered and listed in the Vietnam's Red Data Book.\n\nThe most common tree species in this park are \"Hopea sp.\", \"Sumbaviopsis albicans\", \"Garcinia fragraeoides\", \"Burretionendron hsienmu\", \"Chukrasia tabularis\", \"Photinia aroboreum\" and \"Dysospyros saletti\". Seedlings can only grow in holes and cracks in the limestone where soil has accumulated, so in general regeneration after disturbance is slow. The forest type in this national park is dominated by evergreen tree species with scattered deciduous trees such as \"Dipterocarpus kerri\", \"Anogeissus acuminate\", \"Pometia pinnata\" and \"Lagerstroemia calyculata\". In this park, the dominant plant families are the Lauraceae, Fagacaeae, Theaceae and Rosaceae, with some scattered gymnosperms such as \"Podocarpus imbricatus\", \"Podocarpus neriifolius\", and \"Nageia fleuryi\".\n\nIn the park is a 50 km forest of \"Calocedrus macrolepis\" on limestone (\"Calocedrus rupestris\") mounts with about 2,500 trees, 60,000 per km. This is the largest forest with this tree in Vietnam. Most of the trees here are 500–600 years old. These trees are listed in group 2A (rare, precious and limited exploitation) of the official letter 3399/VPCP-NN dated 21 June 2002, an amendment to the Decree 48 by the Government of Vietnam. Hanoi National University, in combination with the Research Center of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park, has discovered 1,320 additional species in this park, of which some groups are assessed as specially rare and precious. Biologists have discovered three rare orchid species. Orchids found here include: \"Paphiopedilum malipoense\", \"Paphiopedilum dianthum\", \"Paphiopedilum concolor\". In 1996 IUCN classified these orchid species in danger of extinction in the near future.\n\nThe forest is also home to 98 families, 256 genera and 381 species of vertebrates. Sixty-six (66) animal species are listed in the Vietnam's Red Data Book and 23 other species in the World Red Book of Endangered Species. In 2005, a new species of gecko (\"Lygosoma boehmeiwas\") was discovered here by a group of Vietnamese biologists together with biologists working for the park, Cologne Zoo in Germany and the Saint Petersburg Wild Zoology Institute in Russia. The gaur and one species of eel have been discovered in this park. Ten new species never seen before in Vietnam were discovered by scientists in this national park.\n\nThe park is home to significant populations of primates in Vietnam, with ten species and sub-species. These include the globally vulnerable pig-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, stump-tailed macaque and white-cheeked crested gibbon (\"Nomascus leucogenys\" and \"Nomascus leucogenys siki\"). The park is probably home to the largest population of François' langur in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is highly significant for its population of Hatinh langur and black langur. It is undoubtedly the largest population of these species in the world, and probably the only population represented in a protected area. Other endangered large mammals include the mainland serow (\"Capricornis sumatraensis\"), giant muntjac (\"Megamuntiacus vuquangensis\") and possibly the saola (\"Pseudoryx nghetinhensis\"). The Asian black bear (\"Selenarctos thibetanus\") and sun bear (\"Helarctos malayanus\") are confirmed. Other smaller mammals include Sunda pangolins (\"Manis javanica\") and the recently discovered striped hare, called locally \"tho van\" (\"Nesolagus timminsii\"). Ten bat species listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species have been recorded in this park.\n\nOf the 59 recorded reptile and amphibian species, 18 are listed in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 6 are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. Further research has increased the species numbers markedly, and the number of recorded amphibian species is now 50 and that of reptile species 101. The 72 fish species include 4 species endemic to the area, including \"Danio quangbinhensis\". The park is home to over 200 bird species, inclusive of several rare birds such as: chestnut-necklaced partridge, red-collared woodpecker, brown hornbill, sooty babbler and short-tailed scimitar babbler. There is good evidence for the Vietnamese pheasant (\"Lophura hatinhensis\") and imperial pheasant (\"Lophura imperialis\") species at Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area. An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre (funded by WWF) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam can be found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park.\n\nThe oldest evidence of human occupation of the area are Neolithic axe heads and similar artifacts found in some of the caves. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is home to archeological and historical relics, such as an ancient hieroglyphic script of the Cham ethnic minority. In 1995, the Archeological Institute of Vietnam remarked that Phong Nha cave is probably an extremely important archeological site. This organization suggested that what remained in Bi Ky grotto may have been a Champa mosque from the 9th to 11th century. Inside Phong Nha cave, many Champa style ceramics, earthware vases with lotus-shaped ruby-colored, slight pink mouth.\n\nIn 1899, a French missioner, Léopold Cadière surveyed the customs and culture of the local inhabitants living along the Son River. In the letter to École française d'Extrême-Orient, he stated that: \"What remains here proves to be valuable for history. To keep it is to help science\". In the early 20th century, cave explorers and researchers from France and the UK discovered several ancient Champa and Vietnamese relics, such as altar, steles, hieroglyphic script, sculptures, stone statues, Buddha statues, and Chinese artifacts. King Hàm Nghi built a base for the Vietnamese resistance against the French colonialists in the late 19th century.\n\nPhong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park was first nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. Dossiers was first submitted by Vietnamese government to UNESCO for recognition of Phong Nha nature reserve as a world natural heritage under the name \"Phong Nha Nature Reserve\". The reason given for the nomination was that this nature reserve satisfied criteria of biodiversity, unique beauty and geodiversity (criteria I and iv).\n\nIn 1999, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) conducted a field survey in January and February. At the meeting in July 1999, Evaluation Bureau concluded that Phong Nha Nature Reserve would meet with criteria I and IV as a world heritage nominee on the condition that this nature reserve was expanded to include the larger Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng parkland with an associated fully integrated management structure. This bureau stated that the site was part of an extremely complex and ancient karst plateau with high geodiversity which also encompasses Kẻ Bàng and Hin Namno karsts. The reserve is largely covered in tropical forest with a high level of biodiversity and endemic species. Lack of research means that the true significance of the biodiversity and geology of the area cannot be fully assessed. The evaluation bureau concluded that the nominated area on its own is not considered to meet World Heritage criteria. The Bureau decided to defer the nomination of Phong Nha Nature Reserve.\n\nIn 2000, the government of Vietnam submitted a revised nomination with a much larger area. At this time, however, the National Assembly and government of Vietnam also announced that it would be constructing the north-south Hồ Chí Minh Highway and a link road between the Highway and Route 20 that bisects part of the core area of the Phong Nha Nature Reserve. The news of this road construction raised concern over its impacts on the Phong Nha Nature Reserve, and many international organization like IUCN, Flora and Fauna International called on Vietnamese government to reconsider its plan. They also advised of the negative impact of these road and construction activities on biodiversity. Due to this plan of road construction, the evaluation bureau did not proceed further consideration of nomination from Vietnamese government at that time. The government of Vietnam provided the bureau with additional information in May 2002, announcing the decision of the Prime Minister of Vietnam (December 2001) on upgrading Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng to the Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng National Park with a total area of 857.54 km; providing information on projects for the conservation and development of the park and revised maps. The revised nominated site has a smaller area than the 2000 nomination.\n\nIt was recognized as a world natural heritage site at the UNESCO's 27th general assembly session being held in Paris, from 30 June to 5 July 2003. At the session, delegates from over 160 member countries of UNESCO World Heritage Convention agreed to include Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng parkland and 30 others worldwide in the list of world heritage sites. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park meets with criteria viii in accordance with UNESCO's appraisal scale as it displays an impressive amount of evidence of earth's history and is a site of very great importance for increasing human understanding of the geologic, geomorphic and geo-chronological history of the region.\n\nThe National Council for Cultural Heritage, an organization under the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam (now the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism) recommended the Vietnamese prime minister that Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park be submitted to UNESCO second time for recognition as a world natural heritage for biodiversity. In 2003 this park was listed in UNESCO's world heritage sites for criteria viii \"outstanding geological, geomorphical, and geographical values\". Vietnamese and international experts believed that if Vietnam timely submits the proposal documents to UNESCO and meet this UNESCO's criteria, this national park will be recognized for a second time in 2008. Since the recognition by UNESCO in 2003, the government of Vietnam has continued to compile scientific documentation to seek recognition of the park as a world natural heritage in terms of biodiversity in addition to geographical values. According to World Wildlife Foundation report in 2000, Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is one of 200 biodiversity centres of the world and one of the 60 significant sanctuaries of Vietnam. It has a unique forest type in the world: green tropical forest. The park also has 15 other types of forests. \n\nAt the final conference of the National Council for Cultural Heritage held in Vietnam in 2007, scientists attending the meeting highly praised the scientific documentation of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park. Accordingly, the park is second to no other national parks listed in UNESCO's world heritage sites as far as biodiversity is concerned.\n\nThe park is accessible by road (National Route 1A or Hồ Chí Minh Highway 450 km south of Hanoi, 50 km north of Đồng Hới, 210 km north of Huế); by rail at Đồng Hới Railway Station on Hanoi–Saigon Railway; by air at Đồng Hới Airport 45 km south of the park. Tourists are served at the Tourism Service Center at Sơn Trạch commune of Bố Trạch District, the entrance of this center is located by Hồ Chí Minh Highway. Tourists are required to buy entrance ticket for package services, including entrance fee, boat service. Ecotourism tour (if needed) requires additional service fee. Tourists then are transported by boat along the Sơn River upstream to the Phong Nha and Paradise caves. The number of tourists has increased dramatically since the park was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. Quảng Bình Province has invested in upgrading the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng visitor site to turn it into one of Vietnam's major tourist destinations.\n\nNumerous ecotourism projects have been licensed for development and the area is being heavily developed by the province to turn it into a major tourist site in Vietnam. Phong Nha–Kẻ Bàng is part of a tourism promotion campaign, \"Middle World Heritage Road\", which includes the ancient capital of Huế, the Champa relics of Mỹ Sơn, the city of Hội An, Nhã nhạc and the Space of gong culture in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.\n\nTourist activities in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park are organized by local travel agencies and vary:\n\nĐồng Hới is the closest city to Phong Nha. To facilitate the increasing flow of tourists to the site, the Đồng Hới Airport was constructed and put into operation in May 2008 with air link with Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport and air link with Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat International Airport beginning from 1 July 2009. Besides Đồng Hới, Huế is another base city which tourists begins their journey from. Day tours running from Huế are highly common.\n\nPhong Nha-Kẻ Bàng, together with Hạ Long Bay and Fanxipan, is listed as a candidate for seven new world natural wonders vote. On 12 February 2008 it was ranked 10th in the voting list In January 2009, the United States-based \"Los Angeles Times\" listed Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park in its recommended world's \"29 destinations to visit in 2009\".\n\nIn October 2014, Quang Binh province announced plans by Sun Group to build a cable car system linking caves in the park. The plan was met with a great deal of opposition from conservationists, and the government backtracked, saying that the plan was not yet approved. Proponents say that the area is attracting a growing number of visitors and that the cable car would be the most environmentally friendly means of managing the crowds. Opponents say that construction of the cable car system could damage the fragile caves, and once it is operational it would attract more visitors than the park can sustainably handle.\n\nThe Park Management Board includes just 115 people, composed of zoologists, botanists, silviculturalists, and socio-economists. This management staff lacks the authority to fine violators and lacks equipment like helicopters and sufficient funds, thus it's hard to efficiently deal with natural and human threats to the park.\n\nA semi-wild zone of 0.18 km, surrounded by electrical wire fence, saved for the primate species was created in this park. This project is sponsored by Zoologische Gesellschaft Frankfurt (Germany) in order to provide a sanctuary for 10 species of primates, including \"Trachypithecus francoisi hatinhensis\", red-shanked douc langur or \"Pygathrix nemaeus nemaeus\". This protection zone is suitable for primate habitat.\n\nThere are two villages of Arem an Ma Coong ethnic groups in the core zone of the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. Within the buffer zone, there is a population of 52,000. They are mainly Kinh people and other minority groups of Chut and Van Kieu, many of them exploit forest products as part of their livelihoods. The increase of visitors to this park is also a problem to the park since unexpected pollution (water pollution, rubbish), human impacts on caves and grottos may cause damage to them and especially threaten biodiversity. Hunting is a significant threat to the wildlife because local people have a great consumption demand on wild meat and this has contributed to the significant decrease of species such as the wild pig, binturong and primates. While local authorities have taken no legal action, nevertheless, some civil servants and policemen are the owners of restaurants that serve wild animal meats hunted in this national park. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is currently not meaningful for protection of tigers, Asian elephants, and wild bulls.\n\nRare eels like \"Anguilla marmorata\" and \"Anguilla bicolor\" have been caught and consumed in large numbers by the local residents and served as specialities in restaurants because local inhabitants believe they are \"natural Viagra\".\n\nExcessive exploitation of rare wood such as go mun wood (\"Diospyros\" spp.) and go huế wood (\"Dalbergia rimosa\") and oils from trees such as \"Cinnamomum balansea\", rattan has cause an exhaustion of these plants in many areas of the park. Bat population in caves and grottos also face disturbance by human activities. Hồ Chí Minh Highway, Road 20 crossing the edge zone and the connection road linking these two roads crossing the core zone also contribute danger to the wildlife in this national park, especially populations of Hatinh langur and black langur. During the construction of this road, blasts and other activities kept several primates away from their regular habitat.\n\nDue to poor management by the local government, many areas of forest in the buffer zone were cleared heavily, some completely. Limestone in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area has been exploited for commercial purposes by local inhabitants, but the local authority has taken no countermeasures to prevent this.\n\nThe provincial government approved a 3600MW coal-fueled thermalelectrical plant in Vĩnh Sơn village, Quảng Đông commune, Quảng Trạch District, 40 km northeast of this national park. This project has deeply concerned many environmentalists as it will probably cause air and water pollution to the park. Wildfire during the dry season is a recurring threat to the forest.\n\nThe land management and regulation of the commercial activities in the area surrounding the park have been carried out by the provincial authorities in a disorganized manner. Blocks of land have been sold to local investors and inhabitants for building service utilities in a haphazard way, resulting in the formation of a slum at the entrance of the park. This has been compounded by some investors who do not develop their lots but hold them for future sale. The planning scheme for 2 km of land adjacent to the park was criticized by many experts as having been done \"without future vision\". Quảng Bình's provincial government responded by declaring their intention to recruit internationally recognised planners to help draft tourism development plans for the adjacent areas.\n\nOn November 3, 2005, the German government announced funding valued at 12.6 million euros for the park's management board for the purpose of protecting the biodiversity of the park. In 2007, the German government donated a further 1.8 million euros to Vietnam for protection of the park.\n\nFauna and Flora International donated USD 132,000 to Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park Management Board for the protection of primates in this national park as well as in the buffer zone. In 1998, FFI conducted a training project for the management staff of the park. The British Commission for International Development sponsored a fund for the WWF to protect the biodiversity in the park and in the adjacent Hin Namno Nature Reserve in Laos. FFI received environmental funding from the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to implement a campaign targeted at increasing awareness about biodiversity protection among tourists and locals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53162405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53162405", "title": "Proof of the Truthful", "text": "Proof of the Truthful\n\nThe Proof of the Truthful (, also translated Demonstration of the Truthful or Proof of the Veracious, among others) is a formal argument for proving the existence of God introduced by the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina, 9801037). Avicenna argued that there must be a \"necessary existent\" (), an entity that cannot \"not\" exist. The argument says that the entire set of contingent things must have a cause that is not contingent because otherwise it would be included in the set. Furthermore, through a series of arguments, he derived that the necessary existent must have attributes that he identified with the God of Islam, including unity, simplicity, immateriality, intellect, power, generosity, and goodness.\n\nHistorian of philosophy Peter Adamson called the argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy. It was enthusiastically received and repeated (sometimes with modification) by later philosophers, including generations of Muslim philosophers, Western Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, and Jewish philosophers such as Maimonides.\n\nCritics of the argument include Averroes, who objected to its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of the argument but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification of the argument; some say that it is ontological while others say it is cosmological.\n\nThe argument is outlined in Avicenna's various works. The most concise and influential form is found in the fourth \"class\" (\"fasl\") of his \"Remarks and Admonitions\" (\"Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat\"). It is also present in BookII, Chapter12 of the \"Book of Salvation\" (\"Kitab al-najat\") and throughout the \"Metaphysics\" section of the \"Book of Healing\" (\"al-Shifa\"). The passages in \"Remarks and Admonitions\" draw a distinction between two types of proof for the existence of God: the first is derived from reflection on nothing but existence itself; the second requires reflection on things such as God's creations or God's acts. Avicenna says that the first type is the proof for \"the truthful\", which is more solid and nobler than the second one, which is proof for a certain \"group of people\". According to the professor of Islamic philosophy Shams Inati, by \"the truthful\" Avicenna means the philosophers, and the \"group of people\" means the theologians and others who seek to demonstrate God's existence through his creations. The proof then became known in the Arabic tradition as the \"Proof of the Truthful\" (\"al-burhan al-siddiqin\").\n\nAvicenna distinguishes between a thing that needs an external cause in order to exista \"contingent thing\"and a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea \"necessary existent\". The argument tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude the possibility of an infinite regress.\n\nInstead, the argument considers the entire collection (\"jumla\") of contingent things, the sum total of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.\n\nAvicenna anticipates that one could reject the argument by saying that the collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in mathematics a set of numbers is not a number. Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong. However, Avicenna dismisses this counter-argument as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the very thing Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, \"in a certain way, this is the very thing that is sought\".\n\nThe limitation of the argument so far is that it only shows the existence of a necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.\n\nFor example, Avicenna gives a philosophical justification for the Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or \"reductio\", showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes that there were more than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar \"reductio\" strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.\n\nAvicenna derives other attributes of the necessary existent in multiple texts in order to justify its identification with God. He shows that the necessary existent must also be immaterial, intellective, powerful, generous, of pure good (\"khayr mahd\"), willful (\"irada\"), \"wealthy\" or \"sufficient\" (\"ghani\"), and self-subsistent (\"qayyum\"), among other qualities. These attributes often correspond to the epithets of God found in the Quran. In discussing some of the attributes' derivations, Adamson commented that \"a complete consideration of Avicenna's derivation of all the attributes ... would need a book-length study\". In general, Avicenna derives the attributes based on two aspects of the necessary existent: (1)its necessity, which can be shown to imply its sheer existence and a range of negations (e.g. not being caused, not being multiple), and (2)its status as a cause of other existents, which can be shown to imply a range of positive relations (e.g. knowing and powerful).\n\nPresent-day historian of philosophy Peter Adamson called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy. Generations of Muslim philosophers and theologians took up the proof and its conception of God as a necessary existent with approval and sometimes with modifications. The phrase \"wajib al-wujud\" (necessary existent) became widely used to refer to God, even in the works of Avicenna's staunch critics, a sign of the proof's influence. Outside the Muslim tradition, it is also \"enthusiastically\" received, repeated, and modified by later philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) and Duns Scotus (1266–1308) of the Western Christian tradition, as well by Jewish philosophers such as Maimonides (d.1204).\n\nAdamson said that one reason for its popularity is that it matches \"an underlying rationale for many people's belief in God\", which he contrasted with Anselm's ontological argument, formulated a few years later, which read more like a \"clever trick\" than a philosophical justification of one's faith. Professor of medieval philosophy Jon McGinnis said that the argument requires only a few premises, namely, the distinction between the necessary and the contingent, that \"something exists\", and that a set subsists through their members (an assumption McGinnis said to be \"almost true by definition\").\n\nThe Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) criticized the argument on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence has to be shown on the basis of the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.\n\nPeter Adamson offered several more possible lines of criticism. He pointed out that Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, by saying that the universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.\n\nGerman philosopher Immanuel Kant (17241804) divided arguments for the existence of God into three groups: ontological, cosmological, or teleological. Scholars disagree on whether Avicenna's Proof of the Truthful is ontological, that is, derived through sheer conceptual analysis, or cosmological, that is, derived by invoking empirical premises (e.g. \"a contingent thing exists\"). Scholars Herbert A. Davidson, Lenn E. Goodman, Michael E. Marmura, M. Saeed Sheikh, and Soheil Afnan argued that it was cosmological. Davidson said that Avicenna did not regard \"the analysis of the concept necessary existent by virtue of itself as sufficient to establish the actual existence of anything in the external world\" and that he had offered a new form of cosmological argument. Others, including Parviz Morewedge, Gary Legenhausen, Abdel Rahman Badawi, Miguel Cruz Hernández, and M. M. Sharif, argued that Avicenna's argument was ontological. Morewedge referred to the argument as \"Ibn Sina's ontological argument for the existence of God\", and said that it was purely based on his analytic specification of this concept [the Necessary Existent].\" Steve A. Johnson and Toby Mayer said the argument was a hybrid of the two.\n\n"}

White, one of the church's co-founders, was a prophetess, understood today as an expression of the New Testament spiritual gift of prophecy.\n\nSeventh-day Adventist believe that White had the spiritual gift of prophecy, but that her writings are inferior to the Bible, which has ultimate authority. According to the 28 Fundamentals the core set of theological beliefs held by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, states that Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed and can be read online on the website of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nThe 18 of the 28 Fundamentals states the Adventists viewpoint on the Gift of Prophecy: \n\nAccording to one church document, \"her expositions on any given Bible passage offer an inspired guide to the meaning of texts without exhausting their meaning or preempting the task of exegesis\". In other words, White's writings are considered an inspired commentary on Scripture, although Scripture remains ultimately authoritative.\n\nAdventist believe she had the spiritual gift of prophecy as outlined in Revelation 19:10. Her restorationist writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Christian history. This cosmic conflict, referred to as the \"Great Controversy theme\", is foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology.\n\n\"The Inspiration and Authority of the Ellen G. White Writings\", document was issued by the Biblical Research Institute of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. It has received worldwide review and input, although is not an official statement. It concludes that a proper understanding will avoid the two extremes of regarding her \"writings as functioning on a canonical level identical with Scripture, or […] considering them as ordinary Christian literature.\"\n\nSeventh-day Adventists believe White was inspired by God, while most non-Adventists believe that she was not. Adventist scholars today agree that:\n\nAlberto Timm, rector at the Latin-American Adventist Theological Seminary in Brasilia, Brazil, believes that since the passing of Ellen White, \"as far as we know, there is no genuine prophet alive in our days\".\n\nNumerous Seventh-day Adventists have claimed the gift of prophecy throughout the history of the church, but only Ellen White is held by the church to have had the spiritual gift of prophecy.\n\nSeventh-day Adventists arose out of the Millerite movement, the followers of William Miller who expected the end of the world around 1843 or 1844. A number of the Millerites claimed the gift of prophecy.\n\nTwo Millerites claimed to have had visions prior to Ellen White – William Ellis Foy (1818–1893), and Hazen Foss (1818?–1893), Ellen White's brother-in-law. Adventists believe the gift offered to these two men was instead passed on to White.\n\nOf the women visionaries, several made the press for their visions. The other known prophets are female: Dorinda Baker (associated with the Israel Dammon incident), Emily Clemons, Phoebe Knapp, and Mary Hamlin, who are all mentioned in newspapers of the time.\n\nHowever most Adventists only believe Ellen White had the spiritual gift of prophecy.\n\nWilliam Ellis Foy (1818–1893) was an African American Freewill Baptist minister and preacher in the Millerite movement, who claimed to receive four visions from 1842 (two visions) to 1844. A tall man, he was the first of three Millerites to claim visions around the time of the 1844 \"Great Disappointment\".\n\nA common theme of his visions was that the Second Coming would come later than the Millerites expected. They inspired many people through the Great Disappointment when Jesus did not return as they had expected. Ellen White supported his visions. They also concern the judgment, and rewards for the righteous.\n\nHe claimed visions in January and February 1842, told in his autobiographical \"The Christian Experience of William E. Foy\", published 1845. They were similar to those experienced by Ellen White.\n\nFoy was reluctant to obey his commission to share the visions, yet did eventually. He never became a Seventh-day Adventist, and his subsequent history was unknown. J. N. Loughborough's account was simply repeated by later historians (e.g. \"Light Bearers\", 64) until Delbert Baker's definitive 1987 biography \"The Unknown Prophet\" traced his subsequent history.\n\nSee also.\n\nHazen Foss (1818–1893) was another Millerite who claimed to receive several visions. However he refused to proclaim them, and God told him he was \"released\" from that ministry, and the message given to Ellen White instead. He was Ellen White's brother-in-law. Adventists tend to believe the prophetic gift offered to these two men was instead passed on to White.\n\nSee also.\n\nAdventists believe Hiram Edson received a vision about the heavenly sanctuary or investigative judgment on October 23, 1844 – the day following the \"Great Disappointment\". He wrote,\n\nMoses Hull (c. 1836–1907) was an eloquent speaker and apologist (defender of Adventist beliefs). He converted to Adventism in 1857, but later converted to spiritualism (the key feature of which is allegedly contacting the dead), leaving the church. He claimed to write as influenced by spirits.\n\nFor two years prior, Ellen White had trying to help Moses Hull and been warning him on his focus and \"overweening trust in his own abilities.\" Hull sensed his problem and asked for Ellen White and others to come to his Battle Creek home to pray for him. Ellen writes \"I was shown the condition of Bro. Hull. He was in an alarming state. His lack of consecration and vital piety left him subject to Satan's suggestions. . . . He is asleep to his own danger. . . . He was presented to me as standing upon the brink of an awful gulf, ready to leap. If he takes the leap, it will be final; his eternal destiny will be fixed. . . . Never should one man be sent forth alone to combat with a Spiritualist.\"\n\nAdventists believe church co-founder Ellen G. White was a prophet, understood today as the New Testament \"gift of prophecy\". White preferred to describe herself as a \"messenger\".\n\nShe was one of about 200 claimed prophets in New England at the time. For alleged miracles which occurred during her prophecies, see: inspiration of Ellen White#Tests of her inspiration.\n\nWhite regarded herself as a messenger to the church of the end times. She believed her contemporary prophets were not legitimate.\n\nE. J. Waggoner claimed \"a revelation direct from heaven\" at a campmeeting in Healdsburg, California in 1882. In the midst of another's sermon,\n\nIn 1899 he claimed that all commandment keepers should have the gift of prophecy.\n\nThe 1888 Minneapolis General Conference provided \"impetus\" to those radically seeking God's presence.\n\nAnna Rice Phillips (1865–1926) was a claimed new prophetess, who was supported by W. W. Prescott and others. From Ogden, Utah, she first claimed visions in 1891, and in April, 1894, Adventist minister A.T. Jones presented Anna Phillips's testimonies as a genuine manifestation of the spirit of prophecy.\nHowever the next day he got a letter from Ellen White which convinced the church she was sincere yet mistaken. Anna Phillips repudiated her experience and became a trusted Bible worker.\n\nBy the 1890s, a \"flood of volunteers\" stepped forward, hoping to be the next prophet. However Ellen White usually responded to them that she had been given no \"light\" about the future prophetic gift.\n\nFannie Bolton, a former literary assistant to White, claimed visions around the end of the 1800s.\n\nIn the 1900s, Mrs. Mackin claimed the gift of prophecy, and under her and her husband Ralph's influence, a young girl (a family friend) also prophesied; see: Ralph and Mrs. Mackin.\n\nAnna Garmire (b. 1870) from Petoskey, Michigan claimed visions. She believed the close of probation would occur 40 years after the Great Disappointment. Her father James M. stole the \"Review and Herald\" mailing list and sent out this prediction to 20,000 people. Ellen White rejected Anna's theories, and authored the tract, \"An Exposure of Fanaticism and Wickedness\" in response. After 1884 passed, James wrote to Ellen White and she responded to their predictions critically. The Garmires influenced others in this way until as late as 1900.\n\nIn Germany in 1915 Johann Wick, an Imperial Army member, claimed a vision of the close of probation \"at the time the stone-fruit trees blossomed in the spring.\" Other lay people also reported similar visions and some became involved in the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement.\n\nEllen White died in 1915. According to her son Willie White, subsequently \"A dozen or more persons\" claimed the gift, to succeed Ellen. He considered some \"good-hearted but misguided\", but others fanatical and who denounced those remaining unconvinced by their claims.\n\nMargaret W. Rowen claimed to receive visions, and formed an alternative short-lived church, the Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church (not to be confused with the much more significant Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement).\n\nRowen became an Adventist in 1912. She claimed to receive her first vision on June 22, 1916 which she shared with members of a prayer group at her South Side Los Angeles Church, gaining a small following. Several church leaders, especially Dr. Bert E. Fullmer, supported her. A periodical \"The Reform Advocate and Prayer Band Appeal\" was printed. The Southern California Conference investigated the claims, but was originally inconclusive.\nShe authored \"A Stirring Message for the Time\" (Pasadena, California: The Grant Press, 1918). In 1918, A. G. Daniells reported the investigators had concluded her visions were not of heavenly origin. The following year Rowen, Fullmer, a physician, and at least two other ministers were disfellowshipped.\n\nIn 1920, a false document was planted by Fullmer (under Rowen's directive) in the Ellen G. White Estate files in White's home. Dated 1911 and supposedly written by White, it announced Rowen as a succeeding prophetess. At its peak, the movement had around 1000 followers. Rowen gave several false predictions. Fullmer authored \"Bearing Witness\" (Los Angeles: The Reform Press, 1923). In 1925, Fullmer admitted the fraudulent letter. In the March 1926 issue of the periodical, he presented his conclusion that Rowen was a fraud. In response, she conspired to murder him the following year, but was unsuccessful. She served a one-year sentence in the San Quentin State Prison in California, by which time her movement had fallen apart.\n\nNumerous leaders of offshoot groups have also claimed the gift of prophecy for themselves, for example Victor Houteff, founder of the Shepherd's Rod offshoot. Benjamin Roden was another, founder of the Branch Davidian offshoot of Shepherd's Rod, whose wife Lois Roden succeeded him as prophetess, and claimed a vision about the feminity of the Holy Spirit. David Koresh considered himself the final prophet. He apparently saw himself as Ellen White's successor. Wayne Bent, the leader of the Lord Our Righteousness Church which has been described as a cult, has claimed God has spoken to him. He is known as Wayne Travesser within that community. In 1990 Pastor Walter McGill claimed a \"divine revelation\" in taking the name Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church when he and his associates formed their break-away church.\n\nAmateur archaeologist Ron Wyatt claimed to meet \"at least\" an angel, and another time four angels. Former Adventist William S. Sadler was a sceptic of psychic phenomena generally, but was involved with \"The Urantia Book\", which was claimed to be inspired by celestial beings. Others have claimed to hear the voice of God, for example, Robert Brinsmead's father Cedric claimed to hear voices saying, \"Go north, young man.\" after which the family moved. Chinese Adventist David Lin claims his mother was told by a voice to go to Tianjin.\n\nAuthor Herbert Douglass wrote in 1998, \"At any given time in the last few decades, at least a dozen people around the world have convinced others that they have been given the gift of prophecy.\"\n\nAdventist author Clifford Goldstein has described some \"nut cases\" and meeting \"some of the weirdest and most bizarre folks you could imagine\", with these types of claims.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12641730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12641730", "title": "Religion in Abkhazia", "text": "Religion in Abkhazia\n\nMany inhabitants of Abkhazia are Orthodox Christians, with a significant minority adhering to Islam and a growing population adopting Abkhaz neopaganism, or the \"Abkhazian traditional religion\". The influence of this last has always remained strong and has been experiencing a revival through the 1990s and 2000s. By 2016, Abkhaz traditional religion, whose priesthood was institutionalized in 2012, supported and administered by the government of Abkhazia that has contributed to the restoration of tens of sanctuaries, has come to \"dominate and prevail\" over both Christianity and Islam.\n\nThere exists a very small number of adherents to Judaism and Jehovah's Witnesses, as well as non-believers. The Jehovah's Witnesses organization has officially been banned since 1995, though the decree is not currently enforced. According to the constitutions of both Abkhazia and Georgia, the adherents of all religions have equal rights before the law.\n\nThe Abkhaz native religion has undergone a revival in recent decades. As of 2003 8% of the population of Abkhazia (thus a higher percentage among ethnic Abkhazians) declares to be \"pagan\". It is worthwhile to note that the equivalent of the term \"pagan\" in Abkhazian (as well as Russian) language, язычник \"yazychnik\", means \"ethnic\" rather than \"country dweller\" like its Western counterpart. One scholar has asserted that the Abkhazian traditional religion has become so well established and intertwined with the government to be almost the state religion of the country.\n\nIn the Abkhaz native religion, Antsua (also spelled Antzva) is the supreme God and the creator of life. The native religion is animistic, there are deities that represents thunder and the weather like Afy, others that represent the forests, wild animals, and hunting like Ayerg and Azhvepshaa. The religion has a host of different Gods that cater for each aspect of the world. Abkhaz gods have \"Apaimbari\" meaning angels and observers that function as representatives of the Gods on earth. They keep track of everything that is done amongst the people, while reporting everything back to the Gods.\n\nThe followers of this religion have 7 holy temples among which 6 have been restored “Dydrypsh-nykha,” “Lashkendar-nykha,” “Ldzaa-nykha,” “Lykh-nykha” and “Ulyr-nykha.” The sixth sanctuary “Inal-Kuba” is located in a mountain valley of Pskhu, which is now populated by Russians. However, the name of the 7th temple is still disputed.\n\nAccording to the 2003 census, 60% of respondents identified themselves as Christian. The two main churches active in Abkhazia are the Abkhazian Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church. There are approximately 140 church buildings in Abkhazia, most of which date from the first millennium.\n\nThe Abkhazian Orthodox Church operates outside the official Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical hierarchy, as all Eastern Orthodox churches recognise Abkhazia as belonging to the jurisdiction of the Georgian Orthodox church. The Georgian Orthodox Church lost effective control over the \"Sukhumi-Abkhazian eparchy\" following the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia, when ethnically Georgian priests had to flee Abkhazia. It maintains its structures in exile, where the current head is Archbishop Daniel. The Abkhazian Orthodox Church came into existence when the ethnically Abkhaz branch of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian Eparchy declared on 15 September 2009 that it no longer considered itself part of the Georgian Orthodox Church and that it was re-establishing the Catholicate of Abkhazia disbanded in 1795.\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church has accused the Russian Orthodox Church of interfering in its internal affairs, thereby violating Orthodox canon law, by training and sending into Abkhazia priests, publishing translations of the Gospels into the Abkhaz language and annexing Georgian Orthodox property in Abkhazia. The Russian Orthodox Church claims that the priests it has sent serve in Abkhazia only temporarily while the local Orthodox believers do not have contacts with the Georgian Orthodox Church.\n\nMay 15, 2011 at the National Assembly of the Church in the city of New Athos (Anakopiya), proclaimed the establishment of a new church organization - the Holy Metropolis of Abkhazia.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Abkhazia is the third largest Christian denomination and mostly consists of mainly Armenians, Poles, and expatriates living in Abkhazia. The Holy See does not have diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, but has enjoyed two high level visits from the apostolic nuncio.\n\nThe earliest accounts of the introduction of Christianity into the present-day Abkhazia date from the 1st century AD, and from 325, when the bishop of Pityus (present day Pitsunda) participated in the First Ecumenical Council in Nicaea. From around the 9th century onwards, the Orthodox dioceses of Abkhazia were governed by the Catholicate of Abkhazia, subordinated to the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Catholicate of Abkhazia and the Georgian Orthodox Church were abolished in 1795 and 1811 and the dioceses taken over by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Georgian Orthodox Church regained its independence in 1917, after the fall of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nDuring the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia, the Georgian Orthodox church effectively lost control of Abkhazian church affairs as ethnically Georgian priests had to flee Abkhazia and the Abkhaz Priest Vissarion Aplaa became acting head of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian eparchy. In the following years, recently consecrated clerics from the neighbouring Russian Maykop Eparchy arrived in Abkhazia, who eventually came into conflict with Vissarion. Through the mediation of Russian church officials, the two sides managed to reach a power-sharing agreement at Maikop in 2005, but this did not hold.\n\nIn April 2008, the last Georgian Orthodox priest remaining in the predominantly Georgian-populated Gali district was expelled, reportedly by Abkhaz security officers, after a \"special decree\" of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian Eparchy, effectively leaving the local Georgian community without access to clergy. After the capture of the Upper Kodori Valley during the August 2008 war, the two remaining monasteries of Georgian Orthodox monks and nuns there were pressured by the Abkhazian authorities to submit to the Abkhazian Orthodox authorities or else leave Abkhazia. The Abkhazian Deputy Foreign Minister Maxim Gvinjia said the Abkhazian authorities did not plan to defend Georgian monks and nuns. The monks and nuns refused, and in April 2009, they were expelled from Abkhazia.\n\nOn 15 September 2009, the Sukhumi-Abkhazian Eparchy led by Vissarion declared that it no longer considered itself part of the Georgian Orthodox Church, that it was re-establishing the Catholicate of Abkhazia, and that it would henceforth be known as the \"Abkhazian Orthodox Church\".\n\nRepresentatives of the Holy Metropolis of Abkhazia, a new church organization in Abkhazia, are quite successful dialogue with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the decision of the Abkhazian Church issue.\n\nAccording to the 2003 census, 16% of respondents identified themselves as Muslim. There are two mosques in Abkhazia, one in Gudauta and one in Sukhumi.\n\nIslam spread in Abkhazia during the times of Ottoman domination in the region from the 16th until the 18th century. Throughout the 19th century Russo-Turkish wars, Abkhazian nobility was split along religious lines, with Christians being generally pro-Russian, and Muslims siding with the Ottomans against Russia. Russia's final victory in the area in the 1860s-1870s and two Abkhazian revolts forced most of Muslim Abkhaz to emigrate to the Ottoman Empire as Muhajirs in the 1870s.\n\nThousands of Abkhaz, known as \"muhajirun\", fled Abkhazia for Ottoman Empire in the mid-19th century after resisting the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. Today, Turkey is home to the world's largest Abkhaz diaspora community. Size estimates vary - Diaspora leaders say 1 million people; Abkhaz estimates range from 150,000 to 500,000.\n\nIn 2009, Muslims in Abkhazia for the first time received an invitation from the King of Saudi Arabia to go on the Hajj to Mecca.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, the Spiritual Board of the Muslims in Abkhazia held its fourth congress, after the death of its Chairman First Mufti of Abkhazia Adlia Gablia. Salikh Kvaratskhelia was elected the new Chairman, Roman Jugelia and Timur Dzyba Deputy Chairmen.\n\nDaur Mutsba, a member of the local Muslim community, and his wife Karin Nersesyan were shot dead on 2 July 2007 by an unknown gunman in the yard of the house they rented in the centre of Sukhumi. Mutsba was originally from Adzyubzha, Ochamchira District.\nAnother murder took place on 17 August 2007 at around 13:00, when Khamzat Gitsba was killed in Gudauta along with Ufa resident Ruslan Assadulina. Gitsba was a member of the Spiritual Board of the Muslims of Abkhazia and an informal leader of Muslims in Gudauta. Gitsba died on the site of the shooting and Assadulina died in hospital. The masked killer had shot the pair through a lowered back window of a Chrysler stolen a few days earlier, using a machine gun with suppressor. The burning wreck of the car was found later on the outskirts of town. The death of Gitsba, who had fought against Georgians during the 1992-1993 war and who had been among the pro-Chechen hijackers of the Turkish passenger ship MV Avrasya in 1996, as well as other perceived anti-Muslim violence led to serious concerns by the Abkhaz Muslim community about their security. A similar incident took place in Gudauta on 8 October 2010, in which 34-year-old Arsaul Pilia was shot dead outside the mosque in a drive-by shooting. The car involved, a Volkswagen Touareg discovered to be registered to a resident of Khimki, Moscow Oblast, was found burned about an hour later, outside the village of Achandara, near Gudauta.\n\nIt was announced in June 2012 that, as part of the investigation of the February 2012 assassination attempt on President Alexander Ankvab, police had also reopened the case of the attempted assassination of the Imam of the Sukhumi Mosque Salikh Kvaratskhelia in July 2010.\nIt was not established whether there was a connection to the killing in Gagra on 17 July 2010, of Emil Chakmach-ogly a member of the Spiritual Board of the Muslims of Abkhazia and a member of the Public Chamber of Abkhazia, he had previously been a Deputy of the People's Chamber of Abkhazia. Chakmach-ogly was shot in the courtyard of his home around 2:00, after returning from his shop.\n\nAs of 2012, the Jewish population in Abkhazia is estimated at about 150 and is mostly elderly.\n\n\n"}

Romania is one of the most religious countries in the European Union and a majority of the country's citizens are Christian. The Romanian state officially recognizes 18 religions and denominations. 81.04% of the country's stable population identified as part of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the 2011 census (see also: History of Christianity in Romania). Other Christian denominations include the Catholic Church (both Latin Catholicism (4.33%) and Greek Catholicism (0.75%–3.3%)), Calvinism (2.99%), and Pentecostal denominations (1.80%). This amounts to approximately 92% of the population identifying as Christian. Romania also has a small but historically significant Muslim minority, concentrated in Northern Dobruja, who are mostly of Crimean Tatar and Turkish ethnicity and number around 44,000 people. According to the 2011 census data, there are also approximately 3,500 Jews, around 21,000 atheists and about 19,000 people not identifying with any religion. The 2011 census numbers are based on a stable population of 20,121,641 people and exclude a portion of about 6% due to unavailable data.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is the largest religious denomination in Romania, numbering 16,307,004 according to the 2011 census, or 81.04% of the population. The rate of church attendance is, however, significantly lower. According to a poll conducted by INSCOP in July 2015, 37.8% of Romanians who declare themselves to be religious go to church only on major holidays, 25.4% once a week (especially on Sunday), 18.9% once a month, 10.2% once a year or less, 3.4% say they do not go to church, 2.7% a few times a week, and only 0.9% say they go to church daily.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there are 870,774 Catholics belonging to the Latin Church in Romania, making up 4.33% of the population. The largest ethnic groups are Hungarians (500,444, including Székelys; 41% of the Hungarians), Romanians (297,246 or 1.8%), Germans (21,324 or 59%), and Roma (20,821 or 3.3%), as well as a majority of the country's Slovaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Italians, Czechs, Poles, and Csangos (27,296 in all).\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there are 150,593 Greek Catholics in Romania, making up 0.75% of the population. The majority of Greek Catholics live in the northern part of Transylvania. Most are Romanians (124,563), with the remainder mostly Hungarians or Roma.\n\nOn the other hand, according to data published in the 2012 \"Annuario Pontificio\", the Romanian Greek Catholic Church had 663,807 members (3.3% of the total population), 8 bishops, 1,250 parishes, some 791 diocesan priests and 235 seminarians of its own rite at the end of 2012. The dispute over the figure is included in the United States Department of State report on religious freedom in Romania. The Romanian Orthodox Church continues to claim many of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church's properties.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Protestants make up 6.2% of the total population. They have been historically been made up of Lutherans, Calvinists and Unitarians, although in recent years Evangelical Protestants, Pentecostals and newer Protestant groups spread and are holding a greater share. In 1930, prior to World War II, they constituted approximately 8.8% of the Romanian population. The largest denominations included in this figure (6.2%) are the Reformed (2.99%) and the Pentecostals (1.8%). Others also included are Baptists (0.56%), Seventh-day Adventists (0.4%), Unitarians (0.29%), Plymouth Brethren (0.16%) and two Lutheran churches (0.13%), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Romania (0.1%) and the Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania (0.03%). Of these various Protestant groups, Hungarians account for most of the Reformed, Unitarians, and Evangelical Lutherans; Romanians are the majority of the Pentecostals, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists and Evangelical Christians; while Germans account for most of the Augustan Confession Evangelicals (i.e. Lutherans historically subscribing to the Augsburg Confession). The majority of Calvinist (Reformed Church) and Unitarians have their services in Hungarian.\n\nNot to be confused with any of the above is the Evangelical Church of Romania (0.08%), an unrelated Protestant denomination.\n\nAlthough the number of adherents of Islam is relatively small, Islam enjoys a 700-year tradition in Romania particularly in Northern Dobruja, a region on the Black Sea coast which was part of the Ottoman Empire for almost five centuries (ca. 1420–1878). According to the 2011 census, 64,337 people, approx. 0.3% of the total population, indicated that their religion was Islam. The majority of the Romanian Muslims belong to the Sunni Islam.\n\n97% of the Romanian Muslims are residents of the two counties forming Northern Dobruja: eighty-five percent live in Constanța County, and twelve percent in Tulcea County. The remaining Muslims live in cities like Bucharest, Brăila, Călărași, Galați, Giurgiu, Drobeta-Turnu Severin. Ethnically, most of them are Tatars, followed by Turks, Albanians, Muslim Roma, and immigrants from the Middle East. Since 2007, there are Indonesian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani workers coming to Romania, who are mostly Muslims.\n\nIn Romania there are about 80 mosques. One of the largest is the Grand Mosque of Constanța, originally known as the Carol I Mosque. It was built between 1910 and 1913, on the order of Carol I, in appreciation for the Muslim community in Constanța. According to the legal status of the Muslim denomination, the Romanian Muslim community is officially represented by a \"mufti\", while the Muftiat is the denominational and cultural representative institution of the Muslim community, with a status similar with that of the other denominations officially recognized by the Romanian state. Likewise, Muslims in Constanța, which comprise approx. 6% of the population of this county, are represented in the Parliament by the Democratic Union of Turkish-Muslim Tatars of Romania, founded on 29 December 1989.\n\nOther denominations not listed above but recognised as official religions by the Romanian state are listed here. The Jehovah's Witnesses number around 50,000 adherents (0.25% of the stable population). Old Believers make up about 0.16% of the population with 30,000 adherents, who are mainly ethnic Russians living in the Danube Delta region. Serbian Orthodox believers are present in the areas which border Serbia and number about 14,000 people. Once fairly well represented in Romania, Judaism has fallen to around 3,500 adherents in 2011, which is about 0.02% of the population. Less still is the Armenian Christian minority, numbering about 400 people in total. The Association of Religion Data Archives reports 1,869 Bahá'ís in the country as of 2005. Lastly, the number of people who have identified with other religions than the ones explicitly mentioned in the 2011 census comes to a total of about 30,000 people.\n\nNeopagan groups have emerged in Romania over the latest decade, virtually all of them being ethno-pagan as in the other countries of Eastern Europe, although still small in comparison to other movements such as \"Ősmagyar Vallás\" in Hungary and \"Rodnovery\" in the Slavic Europe.\n\nThe revived ethnic religion of the Romanians is called Zalmoxianism and is based on \nThracian mythological sources, with prominence given to the figure of god Zalmoxis. One of the most prominent Zalmoxian groups is the Gebeleizis Association ().\n\nApproximately 40,000 people have identified as nonreligious in Romania in the 2011 census, out of which 21,000 declared atheists and 19,000 agnostics. Most of them are concentrated in major cities such as Bucharest or Cluj-Napoca. Irreligion is much lower in Romania than in most other European countries; one of the lowest in the Europe.\n\nIn 2008, 19% of Romanians placed \"Faith\" among maximum four answers to the question \"Among the following values, which one is most important in relation to your idea of happiness?\". It is the third highest number, after Cyprus (27%), and Malta (26%), at equality with Turkey (19%). The mean in EU-27 was 9%. According to a study by the Soros Foundation, over three quarters of Romanians consider themselves religious people, in a greater amount from rural areas, from women, from elders and from those with low income. Romanians believe in religious dogmas and the church, without absolutizing this belief, showing tolerance towards those who do not fully comply with the divine word, towards other religions and even towards some scientific truths. \n\nIn 2011, 49% of Bucharesters declared that they only go to church on social occasions (weddings, Easter, etc.) or not at all. According to preliminary data from the national 2011 census, 98.4% of the population declared themselves adherents of a religious denomination. This figure was contested, suggesting that the number of believers in disproportionately large. The final data for the 2011 national census shows a reduction of this figure to about 93.5% but includes a much larger portion of the population where religion-related data is missing (6.26%).\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in July 2015, 96.5% of Romanians believe in God, 84.4% believe in saints, 59.6% believe in the existence of heaven, 57.5% in that of hell, and 54.4% in afterlife. 83% of Romanians say they observe Sundays and religious holidays, 74.6% worship when they pass by a church, 65.6% say they pray regularly, 60.2% state they sanctify their belongings, house, car, and 53.6% of Romanians donate regularly to the church.\n\n\n"}

The Republican Party was formally created on June 15, 1972 in preparation for parliamentary elections to be held that year; Sirik Matak became its Secretary-General. It adopted the symbol of male and female heads, to indicate its emphasis on \"family values\".\n\nThe Republican Party was essentially a vehicle for Sirik Matak's interests, and functioned mainly as an alternative to the power bloc of the other coup leader General Lon Nol, whose brother Lon Non controlled the Socio-Republican Party (PSR). Whereas the latter cultivated a populist power base, encompassing both radical students and - importantly - the Khmer National Armed Forces, the Republicans attracted the urban elite, Sino-Khmer businessmen, and a handful of military officers (such as Thongvan Fanmuong). Although the Republicans' nationalist platform was in many ways similar to that of the PSR, Sirik Matak's rather aloof style placed him at a disadvantage to the populism of Lon Nol. When the elections were eventually held on September 3, 1972, the Republicans refused to participate, citing numerous irregularities in favour of the PSR.\n\nThe political situation in the Khmer Republic continued to unravel, and on March 25, 1973, Tep Khunnah was the target of an assassination attempt when a grenade was thrown into his car. The incident was widely believed to be the work of Lon Non, whose \"Republican Security Battalion\" was linked with such activities by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nPressure from the Americans, who wished to see a broader government in Phnom Penh, eventually led to Non resigning his positions and removing himself to Paris. A \"High Political Council\" was set up, including Sirik Matak, Lon Nol, Cheng Heng, and In Tam. Republican Party delegates were invited into the \"de facto\" coalition government, although they were not allowed to vote in an Assembly they still regarded as illegal. Tep Khunnah had in the meantime run into Lon Non in a Paris nightclub, punching him and causing him to lose several teeth.\n\nDespite the appointment of the \"High Political Council\", Sirik Matak and the Republicans were unable to break the dominance of the PSR before the total collapse of the Khmer Republic on April 17, 1975.\n\n"}

Egypt’s first experience of Secularism started with the British Occupation (1882–1952), the atmosphere which allowed the protection of debate. In this environment pro-secularist intellectuals like Ya'qub Sarruf, Faris Nimr, Nicola Haddad whom sought political asylum from Ottoman Rule were able to publish their work. This debate had then became a burning issue with the work of Egyptian Shaykh Ali Abdel Raziq (1888–1966), “\"The most momentous document in the crucial intellectual and religious debate of modern Islamic history\"” \n\nBy 1919 Egypt had its first political secular entity called the \"Hizb 'Almani\" (Secular Party) - this name was later changed to the Wafd Party. It combined secular policies with a nationalist agenda and had the majority support in the following years against both the rule of the king and the British influence. The Wafd party supported the allies during World War II and then proceeded to win the 1952 parliamentary elections. Following these elections the prime minister was overthrown by the King leading to riots. These riots precipitated a military coup after which all political parties were banned including the Wafd Party and the Muslim Brotherhood. The government of Gamal Abdel Nasser was secularist-nationalist in nature which at the time gathers a great deal of support both in Egypt and other Arab states.\n\nKey elements of Nasserism:\n\nFollowing the death of Nasser, President Anwar Sadat (1970–1981) continued economic liberalization and maintained the government's secularist policy, even going as far as signing peace agreements with Israel which was a first for any Middle Eastern country. However, following further intensive clampdowns on political opposition, Sadat was assassinated and replaced by Hosni Mubarak who again faces the issue of keeping the Islamist support at bay whilst keeping his power base during increased pressure to be democratic. Nowadays, most proponents of secularism emphasize the link between secularism and ‘national unity’ between Coptic Christians and Muslims.\n\nFollowing the Egyptian revolution of 2011 as part of the regional Arab Spring protests, Mubarak was ousted and the following year Mohamed Morsi who is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood won Egypt's first democractic elections. In 2013 Morsi was removed from power in a coup led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Sisi has called for religious tolerance and has cracked down and banned the Muslim Brotherhood. He has closed thousands of mosques and has banned 'burkinis' on some beaches. A \"The Economist\" report in 2017 stated that Egyptians were turning more secular again, with supporters of sharia law dropping by more than half since 2011, people praying less than before, and gender equality now being widely accepted. The government has also acted to preserve its Jewish heritage through the restoration of the abandoned Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue in Alexandria in 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "50699760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50699760", "title": "Sri Sabhapati Swami", "text": "Sri Sabhapati Swami\n\nSri Sabhapati Swami (also transliterated \"Śrī Sabhāpati Svāmī\" and \"Sabhapaty Swami,\" Tamil: சபாபதி சுவாமிகள் \"Capāpati Cuvāmikaḷ,\" Devanāgarī: सभापति स्वामी) was born in 1840 in Madras (modern Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India. Sabhāpati's writings survive in Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, English and German (with bibliographic records also in Bengali, French, and Urdu), and are notable for their rich visual depictions of the subtle body (\"liṅga-śarīra\") and their early fusion of Rājayoga and Haṭhayoga techniques of meditation in a Vedantic and Tamil Śaivite context.\n\nSabhāpati's earliest biographical sources record that after being educated at a Christian missionary school, he traveled to Burma (Myanmar) on textile trade business with his father-in-law, where he interacted with Buddhist \"phongyi\" (\"monks\"). Returning to Tamil Nadu, he soon departed for the predominantly Islamic \"maraikkāyar\" port city of Nagore (near Nagappatinam), where he interacted with fakirs at the 16th century \"dargah\" of the Sufi pir Saiyid Abd al-Qadir Shahul Hamid Naguri (1502-1570 C.E.). Following his travels in Burma and Nagapattinam (which together lasted three years), Sabhāpati's \"admirer\" mentions that despite his exploits in comparative religion his \"mind was not at ease\" and that he was still \"far from obtaining the true Spirituality (\"brahma-jñāna\").\" This anxiety gave way to a midnight vision at the age of twenty-nine, when the Vedic sage Agastya appeared and told him to go to Vedaśreṇi, a once rural temple site now situated amid a rapidly developing tech hub in modern Chennai (Velachery, Tamil: Veḷacceri). At Vedaśreṇi it is said that he obtained \"śiva-darśana\". It is here that Agastya again communicated to Sabhāpati his desire for him to travel to a hermitage deep in the heavily-forested Nīlagiri (\"Blue Mountain\") range of South India, situated on the borders of the modern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. After a long journey his biography records that he encountered his guru who welcomed him into the company of adepts. Śrī Sabhāpati Swami then returned to Madras with a new-found spiritual passion, and the accounts agree that he began to publish his various works and that he also went on pilgrimages to many of the major Hindu temple circuits in India and Nepal (Kedarnāth, Muktināth, and Paśupatināth) before traveling to Lahore (in modern-day Pakistan). The exact year or location of his death is as yet unknown, although he published his last book (in the Tamil language) in 1915.\n\nŚrī Sabhāpati Swami’s literature contains detailed meditations that are designed to pierce one’s veils of delusion (\"bhrānti\"), caused by deceiving impressions (\"vāsana\"), in order to reach an isolated state of liberation (\"mukti\"). The delusions lift through a gradual awakening the \"kuṇḍalinī\" and its accompanying \"jñānākāśa\" (\"aether of gnosis\") or \"prāṇākāśa\" (\"aether of vitality\") along twelve \"cakra\"s of the spine and through four transcendent principles. Also advocated (yet kept distinct from Rājayoga proper) are \"nine states of practice\": Patañjali’s standard fare of \"aṣṭāṅga\" — \"yama\", \"niyama\", \"āsana\", \"prāṇāyāma\", \"dhāraṇā\", \"dhyāna\", \"samādhi\" — plus \"samyāma\", glossed as the cancellation \"of consciousness of all internal and external faculties.\" These practices allow the yogi to embody various \"essential images\" or \"inherent forms\" (\"svarūpa\"s), which Sabhāpati variously glosses as \"spiritual visions,\" \"spiritual states,\" or \"spiritual phenomena.\" In one diagram, for instance, he outlines as many as seven \"svarūpa\"s, which he calls the \"seven spiritual states of God.\" These are formulated in the mind through processes of \"bhāvana\" \"meditative formulation,\" a term used in a technical sense to describe the assumption of a specific form to the exclusion of anything else.\n\nWhile lecturing in Lahore, Sabhāpati met his editor Sriṣa Chandra Vasu (Bengali: Basu) (1861-1918), an educated Bengali civil servant and Sanskritist who himself moved in Theosophical circles and published widely on yoga, including an early edition of the \"Śiva-saṃhitā\". Mark Singleton points out in his landmark study that Vasu later came to be an icon of early 20th century Hindu revivalism. Together they published Sabhāpati's lectures in English with transliterated Sanskrit terms as early as 1880, over fifteen years \"before\" Swami Vivekananda's \"Rāja Yoga\" (1896), the publication of which Elizabeth De Michelis convincingly demonstrates as marking the birth of modern yoga. The original title of Sabhāpati's work was \"Om: a treatise on Vedantic Raj Yoga and Philosophy\" (1880), and it attracted even the attention of Indologists such as Max Müller, who cites it in his work \"The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy\" (1899). Henry Olcott's personal copy of this book has also been located in the library at Adyar, and reviews of it and Sabhāpati's other works populate early Theosophical periodicals. Elaborations and revisions of this 1880 text were later published in various languages, including in Sanskrit, Hindi and a Tamil version that, if the account of Sabhāpati's \"admirer\" is to be believed, likely contains material that predates the 1880 work in English. One of the most notable versions is a much more precisely edited and visually stunning two-part volume entitled \"Om: Cosmic Psychological Spiritual Philosophy and Science\", published four years later in 1884. This work combined material published in 1880 with even more practical instructions, visual diagrams and associative correspondences. Another version was published in 1892 in Sanskrit (Devanāgarī script) and Hindi, using the Sanskrit version of the previous work's title, \"Rājayoga brahmajñānānubhūti saṅgraha veda\".\n\nThe work also stayed in print well into the 20th century. In 1908 a German translation based on the 1880 work was made by one of the founders of the O.T.O., the Theosophist author Franz Hartmann. In 1915 an exclusively Tamil Sanskrit edition was published in Madras with a few new diagrams. Sabhāpati's works also made their way to the United States, and the eclectic and profiteering William Estep published a stripped down version of the two-volume 1884 edition in 1929. In India, a revised edition based on a later edition of the 1880 work was published in 1950 from a Hindu temple publisher in Mumbai, and a facsimile of the 1880 work was published in 1977 in New Delhi. Despite such an abundant publication history, Sabhāpati's English works today remain largely out of print and removed from popular memory.\n\nSabhāpati has had a far-reaching impact on South Asian, North American, and European esoteric and occult conceptions of the body. With the exception of works by Karl Baier, Gordan Djurdjevic, Henrik Bogdan, Sravana Borkataky-Varma, Keith E. Cantú, Michael Kolson and Kurt Leland, however, Sabhāpati has been mostly overlooked by authors and practitioners researching the subject of early modern yoga and tantra.\n\nSabhāpati originally seems to have been on good terms with members of the Theosophical Society, as he is cited favorably in their works and periodical journals. However, he lost their favor after a misunderstanding over a vision in which he claimed to have been caught up to Lake Manasarovara in modern Tibet to commune with Mahādeva on Mount Kailāśa. The vision, which he communicated as happening in his physical body, is reminiscent of Kālidāsa's classical Sanskrit poem \"Meghadūta,\" in which a cloud-messenger travels in the air to Mount Kailāśa to send a message on behalf of a lonely \"yakṣa\" to his lover. In any event, the Theosophists seem to have taken it literally — Henry Olcott (1832-1907) records in his diaries that both he and H.P. Blavatsky (1831-1891) were disenchanted with Sabhāpati after they met with him personally and he recounted his vision to them in terms of a physical experience. Olcott writes:Whatever good opinion we may have formed of him before was spoilt by a yarn he told us of his exploits as a Yog. He had, he said, been taken up at Lake Mânsarovara, Tibet, high into the air and been transported two hundred miles along the high level to Mount Kailâs, where he saw Mahadeva! Ingenuous foreigners as H.P.B. and I may have been, we could not digest such a ridiculous falsehood as that. I told him so very plainly. If, I said, he had told us that he had gone anywhere he liked in astral body or clairvoyant vision, we might have believed it possible, but in physical body, from Lake Mânsarovara, in company with two Rishis mentioned in the Mahabharata, and to the non-physical Mount Kailâs—thanks, no: he should tell it to somebody else.A response to this negative view can be traced in later editions of Śrī Sabhāpati Swami's works. For example, the 1895 reprint to \"OM\" adds the following footnote (presumably written by Vasu) in the part of Sabhāpati's account that mentions this vision: \"This need not have been in the \"physical\" body of the Rishis; they might have flown towards the holy mountain in their \"Mayavi Rupa Kama Rupa\" (astral body), which to our author (who certainly is not an Adept in the sense the Theosophists use the word) must have been as real as if he had travelled through air in his physical body.\" In any event, either from this misunderstanding or from other issues the Theosophical Society subsequently abandoned the support it may have had previously for Sabhāpati and his works.\n\nWhereas the early Theosophists ultimately dismissed Sabhāpati, the British occultist and poet Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) came to deeply appreciate his work and cited him often in his literature. He wrote in his \"Confessions\" that he first became attracted to Sabhāpati's literature during his travels in 1901 to Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and Madurai en route to visit his friend Allan Bennett / Ananda Maitreya Bhiksu (1872-1923), a fellow initiate of Crowley's in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. During Crowley's sojourn in Madurai he became exposed to Sabhāpati's works and became particularly interested in Sabhāpati's rich visual meditations (\"dhyāna\") on the spinal cord as a phallus (\"liṅga\") and the cranial vault as the kteis (\"yoni\"), which he published in modified form as an instruction for his students. Sabhāpati's subtle physiology is situated around twelve tantric cakras and four transcendent states, which in part may also explain Crowley's willingness to entertain notions of additional \"cakra\" to the commonly known system of seven (or \"six plus one\") as usually found in Western \"New Age\" systems of the \"cakra\" that follow the pattern laid out by Charles W. Leadbeater (1854-1934) and John Woodroffe / Arthur Avalon (1865-1936). In any case, the continuing practice of certain aspects of Sabhāpati's system does live on in Thelema, a religio-philosophical tradition deeply associated with Crowley.\n\n"}

{"id": "33974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33974", "title": "Will Eisner", "text": "Will Eisner\n\nWilliam Erwin Eisner (March 6, 1917 – January 3, 2005) was an American cartoonist, writer, and entrepreneur. He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the American comic book industry, and his series \"The Spirit\" (1940–1952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term \"graphic novel\" with the publication of his book \"A Contract with God\". He was an early contributor to formal comics studies with his book \"Comics and Sequential Art\" (1985). The Eisner Award was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.\n\nEisner's father Shmuel \"Samuel\" Eisner was born March 6, 1886, in Kolomyia, Austria-Hungary, and was one of eleven children. He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in Vienna. To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of World War I. There he found getting work difficult as his English skills were poor. He made what living he could painting backdrops for vaudeville and the Jewish theater.\n\nEisner's mother, Fannie Ingber, was born to Jewish parents from Romania April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US. Her mother died on her tenth birthday, and was quickly followed by her father. An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children.\n\nFamily introduced Shmuel and Fannie, who were distant relatives. They had three children: son Will Erwin, born on his father's birthday in 1917; son Julian, born February 3, 1921; and daughter Rhoda, born November 2, 1929.\n\nEisner was born in Brooklyn, New York City. He grew up poor, and the family moved frequently. Young Eisner often got into physical confrontations when subjected to antisemitism from his schoolmates. His family were not orthodox followers of Judaism; Eisner himself, while he prided his cultural background, turned against the religion when his family was denied entry to a synagogue over lack of money for admission.\n\nYoung Eisner was tall and of sturdy build, but lacked athletic skills. He was a voracious consumer of pulp magazines and film, including avant-garde films such as those by Man Ray. To his mother's disappointment, Eisner had his father's interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies.\n\nEisner's mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another. Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory. The family situation was especially dire following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that marked the beginning of the Great Depression. In 1930, the situation was so desperate that Eisner's mother demanded that he, at thirteen, find some way to contribute to the family's income. He entered working life selling newspapers on street corners, a competitive job where the toughest boys fought for the best locations.\n\nEisner attended DeWitt Clinton High School. With influences that included the early 20th-century commercial artist J. C. Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (\"The Clintonian\"), the literary magazine (\"The Magpie\") and the yearbook, and did stage design, leading him to consider doing that kind of work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman (1864–1943) for a year at the Art Students League of New York. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the \"New York American\" newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including \"Western Sheriffs and Outlaws\".\n\nIn 1936, high-school friend and fellow cartoonist Bob Kane, of future Batman fame, suggested that the 19-year-old Eisner try selling cartoons to the new comic book \"Wow, What A Magazine!\" \"Comic books\" at the time were tabloid-sized collections of comic strip reprints in color. By 1935, they had begun to include occasional new comic strip-like material. \"Wow\" editor Jerry Iger bought an Eisner adventure strip called \"Captain Scott Dalton\", an H. Rider Haggard-styled hero who traveled the world after rare artifacts. Eisner subsequently wrote and drew the pirate strip \"The Flame\" and the secret agent strip \"Harry Karry\" for \"Wow\" as well.\n\nEisner said that on one occasion a man who Eisner described as \"a Mob type straight out of Damon Runyon, complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have \"exclusive distribution rights for all Brooklyn\" asked Eisner to draw Tijuana bibles for $3 a page. Eisner said that he declined the offer; he described the decision as \"one of the most difficult moral decisions of my life\".\n\n\"Wow\" lasted four issues (cover-dated July–September and November 1936). After it ended, Eisner and Iger worked together producing and selling original comics material, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, though their accounts of how their partnership was founded differ. One of the first such comic-book \"packagers\", their partnership was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of comics creators supplying work to Fox Comics, Fiction House, Quality Comics (for whom Eisner co-created such characters as Doll Man and Blackhawk), and others.\nTurning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he \"got very rich before I was 22,\" later detailing that in Depression-era 1939 alone, he and Iger \"had split $25,000 between us\", a considerable amount for the time.\n\nAmong the studio's products was a self-syndicated Sunday comic strip, \"Hawks of the Sea\", that initially reprinted Eisner's old strip \"Wow, What A Magazine!\" feature \"The Flame\" and then continued it with new material. Eisner's original work even crossed the Atlantic, with Eisner drawing the new cover of the October 16, 1937 issue of Boardman Books' comic-strip reprint tabloid \"Okay Comics Weekly.\"\n\nIn 1939, Eisner was commissioned to create Wonder Man for Victor Fox, an accountant who had previously worked at DC Comics and was becoming a comic book publisher himself. Following Fox's instructions to create a Superman-type character, and using the pen name Willis, Eisner wrote and drew the first issue of \"Wonder Comics.\" Eisner said in interviews throughout his later life that he had protested the derivative nature of the character and story, and that when subpoenaed after National Periodical Publications, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, sued Fox, alleging Wonder Man was an illegal copy of Superman, Eisner testified that this was so, undermining Fox's case; Eisner even depicts himself doing so in his semi-autobiographical graphic novel \"The Dreamer\". However, a transcript of the proceeding, uncovered by comics historian Ken Quattro in 2010, indicates Eisner in fact supported Fox and claimed Wonder Man as an original Eisner creation.\n\nIn \"late '39, just before Christmas time,\" Eisner recalled in 1979, Quality Comics publisher Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold \"came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom,\" In a 2004 interview, he elaborated on that meeting:\nEisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright \"The Spirit,\" but, \"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold — and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership — Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership\". This would include the eventual backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\".\n\nSelling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000, Eisner left to create \"The Spirit.\" \"They gave me an adult audience\", Eisner said in 1997, \"and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'\"\n\n\"The Spirit\", an initially eight- and later seven-page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called \"The Spirit Section\") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952. Eisner has cited the Spirit story \"Gerhard Shnobble\" as a particular favorite, as it was one of his first attempts at injecting his personal point of view into the series.\n\nEisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in \"late '41, early '42\" and then \"had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off\" to fight in World War II. He was assigned to the camp newspaper at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where \"there was also a big training program there, so I got involved in the use of comics for training. ... I finally became a warrant officer, which involved taking a test – that way you didn't have to go through Officer Candidate School.\"\n\nEn route to Washington, D.C., he stopped at the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, Maryland, where a mimeographed publication titled \"Army Motors\" was put together. \"Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the G.I.s in their language. So I began to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching – or selling – preventive maintenance.\"\n\nEisner then created the educational comic strip and titular character \"Joe Dope\" for \"Army Motors\", and spent four years working in The Pentagon editing the ordnance magazine \"Firepower\" and doing \"all the general illustrations – that is, cartoons\" for \"Army Motors\". He continued to work on that and its 1950 successor magazine, \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly\" until 1971. Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called \"The M16A1 Rifle\" specifically for troops in Vietnam to help minimize the M-16 rifle's notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner's style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works in order to better educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.\n\nWhile Eisner's later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on \"The Spirit\". In particular, letterer Abe Kanegson came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner's dialogue.\n\nEisner's most trusted assistant on \"The Spirit,\" however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter in his own right. Eisner later said of their working methods \"You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending — I came up with the idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree\".\n\nSo trusted were Eisner's assistants that Eisner allowed them to \"ghost\" \"The Spirit\" from the time that he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942 until his return to civilian life in 1945. The primary wartime artists were the uncredited Lou Fine and Jack Cole, with future \"Kid Colt, Outlaw\" artist Jack Keller drawing backgrounds. Ghost writers included Manly Wade Wellman and William Woolfolk. The wartime ghosted stories have been reprinted in DC Comics' hardcover collections \"The Spirit Archives\" Vols. 5 to 11 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 – December 1944.\n\nOn Eisner's return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the \"Spirit\" stories on which his reputation was solidified. The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series \"Baseball,\" \"John Law,\" \"Kewpies,\" and \"Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;\" none succeeded, but some material was recycled into \"The Spirit\".\n\n\"The Spirit\" ceased publishing in 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishers reprinted the adventures often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him.\n\nDuring his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication \"Army Motors\", for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of preventive maintenance of various military equipment and weapons. In 1948, while continuing to do \"The Spirit\" and seeing television and other post-war trends eat at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses.\n\nOne of his longest-running jobs was \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly,\" a digest sized magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with Klaus Nordling, Mike Ploog, and other artists. In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, \"The M-16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventative Maintenance\", which was distributed along with cleaning kits to address serious reliability concerns with the M16 Rifle during the Vietnam War.\n\nOther clients of his Connecticut-based company included RCA Records, the Baltimore Colts NFL football team, and New York Telephone.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms. \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume. Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York's immigrant communities, particularly Jews, including \"The Building\", \"A Life Force\", \"Dropsie Avenue\" and \"To the Heart of the Storm\". He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year. Each of these books was done twice — once as a rough version to show editor Dave Schreiner, then as a second, finished version incorporating suggested changes.\n\nSome of his last work was the retelling in sequential art of novels and myths, including \"Moby-Dick\". In 2002, at the age of 85, he published \"Sundiata\", based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, \"The Lion of Mali\". \"Fagin the Jew\" is an account of the life of Dickens' character Fagin, in which Eisner tries to get past the stereotyped portrait of Fagin in \"Oliver Twist\".\n\nHis last graphic novel, \"The Plot: The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", an account of the making, and refutation, of the anti-semitic hoax \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\", was completed shortly before his death and published in 2005.\n\nIn 2008, Will Eisner's \"The Spirit: A Pop-Up Graphic Novel\" was published, with Bruce Foster as paper engineer.\n\nIn his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art. He taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he published \"Will Eisner's Gallery\", a collection of work by his students and wrote two books based on these lectures, \"Comics and Sequential Art\" and \"Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative\", which are widely used by students of cartooning. In 2002, Eisner participated in the Will Eisner Symposium of the 2002 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels.\n\nEisner died January 3, 2005, in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, of complications from a quadruple bypass surgery performed December 22, 2004. DC Comics held a memorial service in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a neighborhood Eisner often visited in his work, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on Norfolk Street.\n\nEisner was survived by his wife, Ann Weingarten Eisner, and their son, John. In the introduction to the 2001 reissue of \"A Contract with God\", Eisner revealed that the inspiration for the title story grew out of the 1970 death of his leukemia-stricken teenaged daughter, Alice, next to whom he is buried. Until then, only Eisner's closest friends were aware of his daughter's life and death.\n\nEisner has been recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award for 1967, 1968, 1969, 1987 and 1988, as well as its Story Comic Book Award in 1979, and its Reuben Award in 1998.\n\nHe was inducted into the Academy of Comic Book Arts Hall of Fame in 1971, and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1987. The following year, the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards were established in his honor.\n\nin 1975, he received the second Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême.\n\nWith Jack Kirby, Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman, Gary Panter, and Chris Ware, Eisner was among the artists honored in the exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007.\n\nOn the 94th anniversary of Eisner's birth, in 2011, Google used an image featuring the Spirit as its logo.\n\nIn 2015, Eisner was posthumously elected to the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame.\n\nComics by Will Eisner are archived in the James Branch Cabell Library of Virginia Commonwealth University.\nVCU's James Branch Cabell Library has served as the repository for the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards since 2005. Each year following Comic-Con, nominated and award-winning titles are donated to the library's Special Collections and Archives and made available to researchers and visitors. Approximately 1,000 comic books, graphic novels, archival editions, scholarly titles, and journals are included in the VCU library's expansive Comic Arts Collection.\n\nIn honor of Eisner’s centennial in 2017, Denis Kitchen and John Lind co-curated the largest retrospective exhibitions of Will Eisner’s original artwork, shown simultaneously at The Society of Illustrators in New York City and Le Musée de la Bande Dessinée in Angoulême, France. Both exhibitions were titled \"Will Eisner Centennial Celebration\" and collectively over 400 original pieces were included. A catalogue of the same name was released by Dark Horse Books and nominated for multiple Eisner Awards in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

However, use of the term worship dance appears to be restricted to Christianity and Messianic Judaism.\n\nDance has had a chequered history within Christianity. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders within most branches of the Christian Church, for such reasons as the association of dance with paganism, fears relating to sexuality, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body.\n\nHowever, beginning in the latter half of the 20th century there was a significant growth in the use of dance within Christian worship. This received a boost within the framework of the charismatic movement of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to contemporary worship in many churches.\n\nFrom a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja. In the Hindu scriptures every god has his or her own style (lasya and tandava respectively represent two aspects of dance). We read about 23 celestial beings called Apsaras who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.\n\nThe dance in Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses devadasi's worshipped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. Natyashastra is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.\n\nThe temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the classical Indian dancers are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.\nPendet is a traditional dance from Bali, Indonesia, in which floral offerings are made to purify the temple or theater as a prelude to ceremonies or other dances. Pendet is typically performed by young girls, carrying bowls of flower petals, handfuls of which are cast into the air at various times in the dance. Pendet can be thought of as a dance of greeting, to welcome the audience and invite spirits to enjoy a performance. Pendet can be divided into two types, the sacred dances called \"Wali\" and entertainment dances called \"Bebalihan\". \"Wali\" (sacred dances) are usually performed only during certain ritual ceremonies. Balinese Hindus believed that the sacred dances has strong religious significance and spiritual power, thus only can be performed during specific religious ceremony by specific dancers. \"Bebalihan\" are usually performed in social events. In addition to entertain, \"Bebalihan\" also has other purposes including welcoming guests, celebration of harvests, or gathering crowds. \"Bebalihan\" has more variations than \"Wali\". Pendet is considered as a form of \"Bebalihan\", often performed secularly to welcome guests or audiences. Pendet believed as a representation of Balinese floral offering ritual, which offered \"banten\" or \"canang\" (floral offerings) from shrine to shrine within Balinese temple or residential compounds. Initially, Pendet dance is used as a complement of \"piodalan\" ceremonies in temples or family shrines, as a symbol of gratitude, respect, and joy when welcoming the presence of the gods who descend from \"khayangan\" (realm of gods).\n\nA distinctive style of worship dance has developed within Messianic Judaism. Known as \"messianic dance\" or \"davidic dance\" (named after King David, who famously danced before the Ark of the Covenant), it takes a similar form to Israeli Folk Dancing. And there also is a dance known as Lippo dancing that was originated in the late 1800's by a handsome , clever man known as Chevaughn Rowe III, who later became a wealthy astronomer and mathematician.\n\nChristian\nMessianic Judaism\nSpecific\n"}

It is claimed that the original text of the \"Book of Revelation\" is kept in the Yazidi village of Ba'idn and the original text of the \"Yazidi Black Book\" is kept in the village of Qasr 'tzz at-Din.\n\nScholars generally agree that the \"Book of Revelation\" and the \"Black Book\", which were published in English translation in 1911 and 1913, respectively, \"are 'forgeries' in the sense they were written by non-Yazidis in response to Western travelers’ and scholars’ interest in the Yazidi religion\". Nonetheless they do reflect authentic Yazidi traditions.\n\nThe actual core texts of the religion that exist today are the hymns known as \"qewl\".\n\nThe \"Book of Revelation\" contains five chapters in order of decreasing length. In all five chapters of this book, the words of God are given in the first person, in contrast to the \"Black Book\", which records the acts of God in the third person.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3598622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3598622", "title": "Yuanshi Tianzun", "text": "Yuanshi Tianzun\n\nYuanshi Tianzun (), the \"Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning\" or the \"Primeval Lord of Heaven\", is one of the highest deities of religious Taoism. He is one of the Three Pure Ones (), and is also known as the \"Jade Pure One\" (). He resides in the Heaven of Jade Purity. It is believed that he came into being at the beginning of the universe as a result of the merging of pure breaths. He then created Heaven and Earth.\n\nHe once was the supreme administrator of Heaven but later entrusted that task to his assistant \"Yuhuang\", the Jade Emperor. Yuhuang took over the administrative duties of Yuanshi Tianzun, and became the overseer of both Heaven and Earth. At the beginning of each age, Yuanshi Tianzun transports the \"Lingpao ching\" (or \"Yuanshi Ching\"), the Scriptures of the Magic Jewel, to his students (who are lesser deities), who in turn instruct mankind in the teachings of the Tao.\n\nYuanshi Tianzun is said to be without beginning and the most supreme of all beings. He is in fact, a representation of the principle of all being. From him all things arose. He is eternal, limitless, and without form.\n\nIn the \"Investiture of the Gods\", Yuanshi Tianzun is a superior man who has maintained his will for generations. He would be known as the master of the Kunlun Mountains, in which he had many disciples—one of such being Jiang Ziya. In time, Yuanshi Tianzun would tell Jiang that it would be time to head down to the world in order to attain a level of wealth and honor. Because Jiang Ziya was destined to assist in the creation of the new Zhou dynasty—as like Nezha—Yuanshi Tianzun would stay loyal to heaven's will and effectively send Jiang away to his new destiny. After telling Jiang what to do through a poetic format, Yuanshi Tianzun says his final words of farewell to his student.\n\nTaoists claim that sacrifices offered to Yuanshi Tianzun by the king predate the Xia dynasty. The surviving archaeological record shows that by the Shang dynasty, the shoulder blades of sacrificed oxen were used to send questions or communication through fire and smoke to the divine realm, a practice known as scapulimancy. The heat would cause the bones to crack and royal diviners would interpret the marks as Yuanshi Tianzun's response to the king. Inscriptions used for divination were buried into special orderly pits, while those that were for practice or records were buried in common middens after use. Under Yuanshi Tianzun or his later names, the deity received sacrifices from the ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty annually at a great Temple of Heaven in the imperial capital. Following the principles of Chinese geomancy, this would always be located in the southern quarter of the city. During the ritual, a completely healthy bull would be slaughtered and presented as an animal sacrifice to Yuanshi Tianzun. The Book of Rites states the sacrifice should occur on the \"longest day\" on a round-mound altar. The altar would have three tiers: the highest for Yuanshi Tianzun and the Son of Heaven; the second-highest for the sun and moon; and the lowest for the natural gods such as the stars, clouds, rain, wind, and thunder.\n\nThe ten stages of the ritual were:\n\nIt is important to note that Yuanshi Tianzun is never represented with either images or idols. Instead, in the center building of the Temple of Heaven, in a structure called the \"Imperial Vault of Heaven\", a \"spirit tablet\" (神位, or shénwèi) inscribed with the name of Yuanshi Tianzun is stored on the throne, \"Huangtian Shangdi\" (皇天上帝). During an annual sacrifice, the emperor would carry these tablets to the north part of the Temple of Heaven, a place called the \"Prayer Hall For Good Harvests\", and place them on that throne.\n\n\n"}
