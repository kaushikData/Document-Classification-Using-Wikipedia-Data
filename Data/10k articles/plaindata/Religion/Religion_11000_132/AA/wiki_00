Unlike in Stoicism, the term has no specific connection to morality.\n\nIn Stoicism \"adiaphora\" indicates actions that morality neither mandates nor forbids. In the context of Stoicism \"adiaphora\" is usually translated as \"indifferents.\"\n\nIn Christianity, \"adiaphora\" are matters not regarded as essential to faith, but nevertheless as permissible for Christians or allowed in church. What is specifically considered adiaphora depends on the specific theology in view.\n\nThe Cynics cultivate adiaphora, by which they meant indifference to the vicissitudes of life, through ascetic practices which help one become free from influences – such as wealth, fame, and power – that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.\n\nPyrrho claimed that all \"pragmata\" (matters, affairs, questions, topics) are \"adiaphora\" (not differentiable, not clearly definable, negating Aristotle's use of \"diaphora\"), \"astathmēta\" (unstable, unbalanced, unmeasurable), and \"anepikrita\" (unjudgeable, undecidable). Therefore, neither our senses nor our beliefs and theories are able to identify truth or falsehood.\n\nThe Stoics distinguish all the objects of human pursuit into three classes: good, bad, and adiaphora (indifferent). Virtue, wisdom, justice, temperance, and the like, are denominated good; their opposites were bad. Besides these there are many other objects of pursuit such as wealth, fame, etc. of themselves neither good nor bad. These are thought therefore in ethics to occupy neutral territory, and are denominated \"adiaphora\". This distinction amounts practically to an exclusion of the adiaphora from the field of morals.\n\nThe issue of what constituted \"adiaphora\" became a major dispute during the Protestant Reformation. In 1548, two years after the death of Martin Luther, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V tried to unite Catholics and Protestants in his realm with a law called the Augsburg Interim. This law was rejected by Philipp Melanchthon, on the account that it did not ensure justification by faith as a fundamental doctrine. Later he was persuaded to accept a compromise known as the Leipzig Interim, deciding that doctrinal differences not related to justification by faith were \"adiaphora\" or matters of indifference. Melanchthon's compromise was vehemently opposed by Matthias Flacius and his followers in Magdeburg, who went to the opposite extreme by claiming that adiaphora cease to be adiaphora in a case of scandal and confession. By 1576 both extremes were rejected by the majority of Lutherans led by Martin Chemnitz and the formulators of the Formula of Concord.\n\nIn 1577, the Formula of Concord was crafted to settle the question of the nature of genuine \"adiaphora\", which it defined as church rites that are \"...neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of God.\" However, the Concord added believers should not yield even in matters of \"adiaphora\" when these are being forced upon them by the \"enemies of God's Word\".\n\nThe Lutheran Augsburg Confession states that the true unity of the Church it is enough to agree concerning the doctrine of the Gospel and the administration of the Sacraments. Nor is it necessary that human traditions, that is, rites or ceremonies, instituted by men, should be everywhere alike.\n\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith, a confession of faith written by the Puritans, which after the English Civil War was rejected by the Anglicans, distinguishes between elements or acts of worship (worship proper) and the circumstances of worship. The elements of worship must be limited to what has positive warrant in Scripture, a doctrine known as the regulative principle of worship. In this framework, the elements of worship have included praise (the words and manner of music), prayer, preaching and teaching from the Bible, the taking of vows, and the two sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper, while the circumstances of worship have included the building and its necessary furniture and the time of day for worship.\n\nThe circumstances of worship are considered adiaphora, although they must be done for edification and to promote peace and order (compare ; ). According to the Westminster Confession 20.2, the conscience is left free in general belief and behavior within the realm of whatever is not \"contrary to the Word.\" However, specifically concerning worship and religious faith, the conscience is free from whatever is \"besides\" Scripture; that is, it is free to worship and believe only according to whatever has positive warrant in Scripture.\n\nPresbyterians who have subscribed to the Westminster Confession, for instance, sometimes considered the questions of musical instruments and of the singing of hymns (as opposed to exclusive psalmody) not drawn directly from the Bible as related to the elements of worship, not optional circumstances, and for this reason they rejected musical instruments and hymns because they believed they were neither commanded by scripture nor deduced by good and necessary consequence from it. Adherence to such a position is rare among modern Presbyterians, however.\n\nThe Puritan position on worship is thus in line with the common saying regarding adiaphora: \"In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, liberty; in all things, charity\".\n\nLatitudinarianism was initially a pejorative term applied to a group of 17th-century English theologians who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Good examples of the latitudinarian philosophy were found among the Cambridge Platonists. The latitudinarian Anglicans of the seventeenth century built on Richard Hooker's position, in \"Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity\", that God cares about the moral state of the individual soul and that such things as church leadership are \"things indifferent\". However, they took the position far beyond Hooker's own and extended it to doctrinal matters.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a former officer in The Salvation Army.\n\nBorn in Brighouse, England, Ballington Booth was the second child of William and Catherine Booth, founders of The Salvation Army in 1878. As a teenager, he began preaching at Salvation Army open-air meetings, where he would often end by singing and playing his concertina. He became a Colonel in The Salvation Army at the age of 23, when he was positioned as a Training Officer. He was later moved to Australia, followed by the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 1886, he married Maud Charlesworth, who changed her name to Maud Ballington Booth, and they were assigned to the United States in April of the following year. The two became American citizens in 1895. In 1891, during a great depression, Ballington Booth instituted men's shelters similar to one begun in San Francisco.\n\nAlthough Ballington and Maud Booth played a great part in organizing and structuring The Salvation Army in the United States, the couple left The Salvation Army when the organization reassigned them to positions outside the United States. In addition, Ballington Booth began to be in open conflict with his brother Bramwell, who served as Chief of the Staff of The Salvation Army. They went on to form their own organization to reach out to the poor and the marginalized of American society. On March 8, 1896, they started God's American Volunteers, which was soon renamed Volunteers of America.\n\nWhen the Booths left The Salvation Army they took with them many of the Army's officers and soldiers as well as many of the Army's wealthy American supporters. In fact, in the first year of the Volunteers of America's operation two-thirds of the Volunteer forces were former Salvationists. Many simply replaced the 'S' on their collars with the American flag. Salvation Army songs were adopted with Volunteer words. Their insignia and flag also were loosely based on that of The Salvation Army.\nAs William Booth was called the 'General' of The Salvation Army, so Ballington Booth became the General of Volunteers of America. In this capacity, he spoke with Woodrow Wilson about the effect of World War I on society, but when Booth offered the services of the Volunteers of America to President Wilson, he was politely turned down. At the same time The Salvation Army was allowed to send its personnel with the American Expeditionary Force. He also spoke with Franklin Roosevelt about charity efforts throughout the Depression.\n\nBallington Booth led Volunteers of America for 43 years, and on his death in 1940 he was replaced by his wife Maud Booth as General. He was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in New York.\n\n\"The Cross Is Not Greater\" was written by Ballington Booth, both lyric and music, in 1892.\n\n"}

The most recent of the three Barbar temples was rediscovered by a Danish archaeological team in 1954. A further two temples were discovered on the site with the oldest dating back to 3000 BC. The temples were built of limestone blocks, believed to have been carved out from Jidda Island.\n\nThe three temples were built atop one another with the second built approximately 500 years later and the third added between 2100 BC and 2000 BC.\n\nIt is thought that the temples were constructed to worship the god \"Enki\", the god of wisdom and freshwater, and his wife \"Nankhur Sak\" (Ninhursag). The temple contains two altars and a natural water spring that is thought to have held spiritual significance for the worshipers. During the excavation of the site many tools, weapons, pottery and small pieces of gold were found which are now on display in the Bahrain National Museum. The most famous find was a bronze bull's head\n\nThe site is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage\n\nThe site was discovered by P.V. Glob in 1954. Excavations, by a Danish team\nled by Hellmuth Andersen and Peder Mortensen, began that year and \nextended until 1962.\nWork at the site resumed in 2004.\n\nTemple I, the earliest temple was built on a rectangular platform approximately 25m long and 16 to 18m wide. This was originally constructed on a bed of clean sand, which appears to have been consolidated by a layer of blue clay. The temple was covered by a second layer of clean sand.\n\nAt the foundation of Temple I offerings were deposited in the clay core of the temple terrace and they consisted of dozens of clay goblets found in separate groups each containing seven beakers which were broken and buried within the foundations of the terrace. Also copper objects were deposited in small heaps or singly. In the south-western corner of this early temple, steps led down to a square-built well. The central terrace was preserved in its full height, 2 metres, with the remains of trapezoid shrine in the center and adjoining rooms. This first one was built from local Bahraini stone. The cult features the subterranean shrine, the temple well and the oval sacrificial court.\n\nTemple II is most liveable still with retaining walls and terraces stiffs, first stage the oval terrace was built in local stone, but after an enlargement it was built in limestone which must have been carried by boat from nearby Jidda island where stone was hewn out by hand and carefully dressed into remarkably neat masonry blocks. The skill with which this task was carried out may be clearly seen in the temple walls and especially around the sacred well. A double circular altar and an offering table stood in the center of the shrine. To the south were three cult stones shaped like the anchors of the merchant ships. Although the central one bore a protruding animal head, like the altars depicted on the seals. A temple treasure lay in the stone frame pit in the north-east comer.The central terrace was crowned by a shrine built of cut stone with stone paving. Smaller buildings clustered around it covering the rest of the terrace. There were no buildings on the outer oval terrace but altars and cult symbols were visible. A plinth with recessed stone cylinder lay to the south and a plinth with three pillars was situated near the north-west wall. A double row of plinths for cult objects lined both sides of the stairs from the upper terrace. On each of these plinths were two square holes lined with bitumen and sheet copper nailed to wood.Here may have stood copper mounted poles with the emblems of gods, so often seen on the stamp seals, or, perhaps, wooden statues. From the central terrace a ceremonial stairway led to the subterranean shrine where water cult ceremonies took place. Halfway down the stair was a portal, and from there the stair was roofed. The rich natural spring which filled the pool probably accounts for the siting of the temple at Barbar. Water poured from a perforated stone jar beside a semicircular stone font at the threshold of a dry chamber near the basin. From the comers of the shrine deep stone built channels led the water to the surrounding fields and gardens\n\nThis remarkable underground shrine is interpreted as a symbolic abzu the abode of Enki, the god of wisdom and of all freshwater. The abzu was believed to be the abyss or freshwater ocean upon which the whole world rests. Such temple abzus are mentioned in cuneiform texts in Mesopotamia. East of the temple lay an oval sacrificial court, connected with a central temple platform by a paved ramp and a staircase. The floor of the court was covered with ashes and the bones of cattle and sheep, presumably sacrificed animals\n\nTemple III in use until the early centuries of the second millennium, was larger than its predecessors. Two circular offering tables of finely cut stone with a low altar between them still stand in the middle of the courtyard. Note the three standing stone blocks pierced with a round hold. It is thought that these were tethering points for the sacrificial animals. To give you some idea of size, the third temple's terrace was probably about .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794046", "title": "Burkhanism", "text": "Burkhanism\n\nBurkhanism or Ak Jang () is a new religious movement that flourished among the indigenous people of Russia's Gorno Altai region (\"okrug\") between 1904 and the 1930s. Czarist Russia was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers. The Soviet authorities ultimately suppressed it for fear of its potential to unify Siberian Turkic peoples under a common nationalism.\n\nOriginally millenarian, charismatic and anti-shamanic, the Burkhanist movement gradually lost most of these qualities—becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized (around a hierarchy of oral epic singers), and accommodating itself to the pre-existing Altaian folk religion. It exists today in several revival forms.\n\nOn the whole, the Burkhanist movement was shown to be a syncretistic phenomenon combining elements of ancient pre-Shamanist, Shamanist, Lamaist and Orthodox Christian beliefs. According to a Professor of Tomsk State University L. Sherstova, it emerged in response to the needs of a new people - the Altai-kizhi or Altaians who sought to distinguish themselves from the neighboring and related tribes and for whom Burkhanism became a religious form of their ethnic identity.\n\n\"Burkhanism\" is the usual English-language scholarly name, which has its origin in the Russian academic usage. One of the Burkhanist deities is Ak-Burkhan, or \"White Burkhan.\" \"Burkhan\" means \"god\" or \"buddha\" in Mongolic languages, yet Burkhanism is not considered Buddhist, as the term is also used in shamanistic nomenclature. For example, in Mongolian Shamanism, the name of the most sacred mountain, the rumored birthplace and final resting spot of Genghis Khan, is also Burkhan Khaldun. Ak-Burkhan is only one of a pantheon of deities worshiped by Burkhanists (see list below), but Ak-Burkhan nevertheless provides the name of the religion in Russian, and thence into other languages.\n\nThe Altaian name for the religion is \"Ak Jang\" (\"White Faith\"). \"White\" refers to its emphasis on the upper world (in the three-world cosmology of the Turkic and Mongolian Tengriism). Alternatively, the name may also allude to Ak Jang's rejection of animal sacrifices in favor of offerings of horse milk or horse-milk alcohol. \"Jang\" means authority; faith; custom; law or principle; and canon or rules of ensemble. In more colloquial settings, the term may also be used as a \"way of doing things\" and is used in reference to religions as well as political systems.\n\nIn April 1904 Chet Chelpan (or, Chot Chelpanov) and his adopted daughter Chugul Sarok Chandyk reported visions of a rider dressed in white, and riding a white horse. This figure, whom they called Ak-Burkhan (\"White Burkhan\"), announced the imminent arrival of the mythical messianic hero Oirat Khan who was actually a real historical figureKhoit-Oirat prince Amursana. The central figure in the research of Burkhanism in the past forty years, however, has demonstrated that Oirot-khan is a mythologized image of the Dzungar past of the people of Altai-kizhi.\nChet and Chugul gathered thousands of Altaians for prayer meetings, initially in the Tereng Valley. These were violently suppressed by mobs of Russians, instigated by the Altaian Spiritual Mission, who were afraid of the potential of the competing religion to decrease the Orthodox Christian flock in Altai. Chet and Chugul were arrested, Chugul was released, and after a prolonged trial Chet was fully exonerated by court and released in 1906.\n\nResearcher Andrei A. Znamenski (see article below) compares the Burkanist movement to other indigenous revitalizing movements around the world, such as the Native American Ghost Dance or the Melanesian Cargo Cult. An excruciatingly detailed treatment of the comparisons and comparability of Burkhanism with the Melanesian Cargo Cult, the Mennonites, the Dukhobors of Georgia, the Mariitsy of Nizhnii Novgorod, and many other movements, is provided in Sherstova's dissertation from the 1980s.\n\nZnamenski says, the prime motivating factor was Altaians' fear of displacement by Russian colonists, Russification, and subjection to taxation and conscription on the same basis as Russian peasants.\n\nAndrei Vinogradov (thesis linked below) sees Burkhanism as a typical nomadic Turko-Mongolian mobilization pattern—aiming to link families and clans (\"seok\") into a steppe empire (which in this case never materialized). The Burkhanists' veneration of heroes from oral epics, he says, serves much the same cultural centralizing function as the veneration of other divine heroes such as Gesar, Manas, or Genghis Khan. As such it constitutes a major aspect of Turko-Mongolic religion, distinct from shamanism.\n\nAfter the arrest of Chet and Chugul, Tyryi Akemchi arose to become the most prominent \"iarlikchi\", and helped organize the movement. Having been exposed to Buddhism through his years as a translator in Mongolia, Tyryi added a number of Buddhist trappings to Burkhanist ritual, such as bells. Within a decade, most of the Altaian population had joined the new faith.\n\nIn 1918 Gregorii Choros-Gurkin and other Altaian leaders declared the formation of something called the \"Karakorum Regional Committee\" (\"Karakorumkaia Okruzhnaia Uprava\"), with the object of establishing an \"Oirat Republic\". This was intended to include not only Altai but also neighboring republics of Tuva and Khakassia. It was forcibly dissolved with arrival of Bolshevik power in 1921.\n\nBurkhanism accepts the \"three worlds\" of Mongolic and Turkic tradition. (These are the upper, middle, and lower worlds—in other words heaven, earth, and the underworld.) However, it rejects worship of traditional deities associated with the underworld. In addition, it imports into worship many figures from Altaian oral epic lore, which were not worshipped in the \"shamanic\" part of the Altaian religion.\n\nUch Kurbustan--\"Uch\" means \"three,\" while \"Kurbustan\" comes from the Soghdian \"Khormazta\" (and thence from the Avestan \"Ahura Mazda\"). Thus, a triune God. Though imported from oral epics, Uch Kurbustan is a generalized spirit rather than a hero of stories with a personality. He may be analogous with the Turko-Mongolian High God \"Tengri\" (\"Heaven\").\n\nRather than an import from Buddhism, Christianity, or Turkic Islam, this particular trinity is likely to have been inspired by other triune gods and heroes from Turkic culture (sometimes in the form of a god with three sons). Uch Kurbustan is connected with the following three messianic heroes, also from Altaian oral epic lore:\n\nThe gods of the upper world, or \"aru tos\" (\"pure ancestors\"), are considered fragments or eminations of Uch Kurbustan. Burkhanism calls these Burkhans. Among them are:\n\nGods of the \"middle world\"—i.e. the familiar spheres of nature and human affairs—include numerous local spirits, such as spirits associated with mountains (\"taika-eezi\") or springs (\"arzhans\"), or \"masters of the game\". They may also be associated with particular clans (\"seok\"). More generalized ones include:\n\nHistorically, Burkhanism rejected the traditional gods of the underworld, notably Erlik (Yerlik), its chief. This rejection is closely related to Burkhanism's rejection of Altaian shamanism, and corresponding elevation of oral epic singers (\"yarlikchi\"). (By \"shaman\" is here meant \"manjaktu kam\"s, i.e. the \"costume-wearing\" specialists who communicate with the underworld gods.) Both rejections are likely to have been inspired by oral epic lore, which regularly features shamans as villains.\n\n\nSome sources speak of a list of \"Twenty Commandments\" for Burkhanism. The evidence for this is sparse. Alcohol and tobacco were proscribed in the early years.\n\nChugul came to be venerated as the main recipient of the original message. This was much less true of Chet, although both were addressed with honorific titles.\n\nGrigorii Choros-Gurkin, a Soviet landscape artist and leader of the Karakorum Executive Committee.\n\nRussian painter Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena Roerich passed through Altai in 1926. Nicholas painted \"Oirat—Messenger of the White Burkhan\" based on his understanding of the movement.\n\n(Note that the painting's title apparently gets the theology backward—it was rather White Burkhan who was the messenger for Oirat.) Followers of Agni Yoga, an esoteric movement founded by the Roerichs, have encouraged a recent revival of interest in Burkhanism among non-Altaians. At the same time they have insisted on a link with Tibetan Buddhism and a veneration of Mount Belukha, elements not found in traditional Burkhanism.\n\nA number of Burkhanist revival organizations emerged during the 1990s, mostly as attempts to formulate or preserve an Altaian ethno-nationalist identity. To that end many of them have been persuaded to reconsider earlier Burkhanism's vexed relationship with shamanism and / or Buddhism. A list of movements follows, with the name of a founder or leading supporter in parenthesis. For more information see Agniezka Halemba's article (linked below).\n\n\n"}

He studied Spiritism at an early age and was introduced to the writings of Allan Kardec. As a teenager he worked in a shoe shop and claimed to have experienced poltergeist activity where shoe boxes would literally fly off the shelves. He was placed in an lunatic asylum for observation and psychologists said there was something wrong with him, but he was not physically sick. Mirabelli later became a medium and it was alleged he could produce automatic handwriting, materializations of objects and people (ectoplasm), levitations and movement of objects.\n\nIn the 1920s, Mirabelli was tested by the Academia de Estudos Psychicos Cesare Lombroso in São Paulo and a report published in 1926 wrote that in more than 300 sittings genuine materializations had been observed. When the report was published in English, it was challenged by various psychical researchers. In 1928, the German scientist Hans Driesch investigated Mirabelli and found that some objects had been moved in the séance room but that there was no evidence for his supposed abilities of materialization or apportation. Mirabelli later began giving public mediumship demonstrations which were described as theatrical displays. Throughout his life Mirabelli had been involved with 15 lawsuits for the illegal practice of witchcraft. He was suspected of utilizing tricks.\n\nIt was alleged that Mirabelli could move bottles of magnetized water on a table without contact with them. This was disputed by Antônio da Silva Mello who noted that such a trick could have been performed \"by means of a thread led to the table or by several other means, principally by the help of a partner who in this particular case was suspected by several persons present to be the medium's wife.\"\n\nIn 1934, Theodore Besterman a research officer for the Society for Psychical Research visited Brazil to investigate Mirabelli. He discovered that some of the witness reports from the Academia de Estudos Psychicos Cesare Lombroso were unreliable and it was not an independent organization but one that was associated with Mirabelli and his personal friends. Whilst investigating the séances, Besterman claimed to have detected trickery.\n\nIn 1990, Dr. Gordon Stein found a levitation photograph of Mirabelli in the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) collection at the Cambridge University Library. It was inscribed by Mirabelli to Besterman from his visit in 1934. The levitation in the photograph was discovered to be a trick as there were signs of chemical retouching under Mirabelli's feet. The retouching showed that Mirabelli was not levitating but was standing on a ladder which was erased from the photograph.\n\nAccording to Stein:\n\n"}

While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.\n\nIn the \"Dialogues\", Hume's characters debate a number of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the argument from design—for which Hume uses a house—and whether there is more suffering or good in the world (argument from evil).\n\nHume started writing the \"Dialogues\" in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on Cicero's \"De Natura Deorum\". The \"Dialogues\" were published posthumously in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name.\n\n\n"}

Four constituent nations compose the United Kingdom, resulting in an inconsistent religious character, and there is no state church for the whole kingdom. \n\nThe ECHR guarantees in Article 9 that subjects will have:\n\nThe right is given in the United Kingdom by s. 1 ss. (1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), as the \"right and fundamental freedom\".\n\nIn Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 2200A (XXI) on 16 December 1966, the UN resolved that:\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee, a sub-body of the General Assembly, also resolved in General comment 22 on 30 July 1993 that the right to freedom of religion applies to unconventional or extra-institutional religions, as well as atheist or anti-clerical beliefs:\n\nThe Act of Settlement 1701 decrees that the monarch of Great Britain (later the United Kingdom) \"shall join in communion with the Church of England\". This act was specifically designed to prevent a Catholic monarch from ascending to the throne, but in effect discriminates against all religions other than Protestantism. Members of the Royal family in line of succession who married a Roman Catholic (though not adherents of other denominations or faiths) were excluded from the succession. Under the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, marrying a Roman Catholic no longer disqualifies a person from succeeding to the Crown; however, the provision of the Act of Settlement requiring the monarch to be a Protestant continues unrepealed.\n\nIn England, the state church is the Church of England, and the Supreme Governor of the church is the British Monarch. As already mentioned, the monarch is required to \"join in communion with the Church of England\". As part of the coronation ceremony, the monarch swears an oath to \"maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in England\" before being crowned by the senior cleric of the Church, the Archbishop of Canterbury. All clergy of the Church swear an oath of allegiance to the monarch before taking office.\n\nParliament has authority to govern the Church of England, but, since 1919 has generally delegated this authority to that Church's General Synod (earlier called the Church Assembly). Parliament retains the ability to veto measures of the General Synod or Church Assembly; this rarely invoked power was used in 1927 and 1928 to prevent adoption of a revised prayer book. Measures also require royal assent.\n\nThe appointment of bishops and archbishops of the Church falls within the royal prerogative. In current practice, the Prime Minister makes the choice from two candidates submitted by a commission of prominent Church members, then passes his choice on to the monarch. The Prime Minister plays this role even though he himself is not required to be a member of the Church of England or even a Christian—for example Clement Attlee was an agnostic who described himself as \"incapable of religious feeling\".\n\nAlthough it is an established church, the Church of England receives no state funding. Instead, the Church relies on donations, land and investments.\n\nSince the Church of Scotland Act 1921, the Church of Scotland has been independent from the state. The monarch does, however, take an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland at the meeting of the Privy Council immediately following his or her accession. The monarch also has the right to attend the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but usually sends a High Commissioner in his or her place.\n\nSince 1920, the Church in Wales has been independent of the state. The church is, however, legally required to perform opposite-sex marriages where at least one of those being married has resided in the parish for six months (a similar requirement applies to the Church of England).\n\nThe Equality Act 2006 is applied equally to religious-based and secular adoption agencies. The Catholic adoption agencies unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a compromise that would include an exemption for religious-based agencies, which would have allowed them to continue to facilitate adoption for opposite-sex parents only.\n\nSeveral university student associations have implemented rules that require affiliated groups to allow \"anybody, regardless of faith, ethnicity or sexuality, to sit on their ruling committees and to address their meetings.\" However some Christian Unions say they should be allowed to require that their ruling committees share their beliefs.\n\nIn May 2008, Lillian Ladele, a registrar from Islington, London, took her employer, Islington London Borough Council, to the London Central Employment Tribunal, with the financial backing of the Christian Institute. Ladele had refused to conduct civil partnerships on religious grounds, and following complaints from other staff she was disciplined under the Council's \"Fairness for All\" policy. Ladele claimed she had been subject to direct and indirect discrimination, and harassment in the workplace, on grounds of her religion. In July 2008, the tribunal found in Ladele's favour, however this ruling was overturned by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in December, 2008.\n\nIn 2011 a judge ruling on a bed and breakfast refusing to accommodate unmarried couples found in favour of a gay couple under the Equality Act 2010 but allowed an appeal, commenting that the ruling: 'does affect the human rights of the defendants to manifest their religion'.\n\nDue to the United Kingdom having been formed by the union of previously independent states from 1707, most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures.\n\nThe common law offence of blasphemy was repealed in 2008. The last person to be imprisoned for blasphemy in the UK was John William Gott in 1922, for comparing Jesus Christ to a clown. The next blasphemy case was in 1977, when Mary Whitehouse brought a private prosecution (Whitehouse v. Lemon) against the editor of \"Gay News\" for blasphemous libel after he published a poem by James Kirkup called \"The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name\". Denis Lemon was given a nine-month suspended sentence and a £500 fine for publishing the \"most scurrilous profanity\" which portrayed the sexual love of a Roman centurion for the body of Christ on the cross. The sentence was upheld on appeal.\n\nIn this appeal case, Lord Scarman held that the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in Article 214 of \"Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law\", 9th edition (1950). This states as follows:\n\nIn 1996 the European Court of Human Rights (case #19/1995/525/611) upheld a ban on \"Visions of Ecstasy\", an erotic video about a 16th-century nun, based on the video infringing on the blasphemy law. The Court estimated that a limited ban on vulgar or obscene publications that would be offensive to believers, while keeping legal the criticism of religion, was compatible with the principles of a democratic society.\n\nOn May 8, 2008 the offence of blasphemy was abolished. However, some acts that were once viewed as blasphemous may now be prosecutable under other legislation, such as the Public Order Act 1986 as amended by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006.\n"}
{"id": "18769019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18769019", "title": "Gender of God in Christianity", "text": "Gender of God in Christianity\n\nGod in Christianity is represented by the Trinity of three hypostases or \"persons\" described as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. \nWhile \"Father\" and \"Son\" implicitly invoke masculine sex, the gender of the Holy Spirit from earliest times was also represented as including feminine aspects (partly due to grammatical gender, especially in the Syriac church). Furthermore, the (feminine) concept of Holy Wisdom was identified with Christ the Logos and thus with God the Son from earliest times. \nEven the ostensibly masculine terms \"Father\" and \"Son\" were explicitly stated to be taken as metaphorical, and not as representing divine essence, \nby Gregory of Nazianzus (4th century). \nThe same position is still held in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church.\nThe first words of the Old Testament are \"B'reshit bara Elohim\"—\"In the beginning God created.\" The verb \"bara\" (created) agrees with a masculine singular subject. \"Elohim\" is used to refer to both genders and is plural; it has been used to refer to both Goddess (in 1 Kings 11:33), and God (1 Kings 11:31; https://sites.google.com/site/yahwehelohiym/yahweh/yahweh-the-elohim-of-israel). The masculine gender in Hebrew can be used for objects with no inherent gender, as well as objects with masculine natural gender, and so it is widely used, attributing the masculine gender to most things. However, the noun used for the Spirit of God in Genesis—\"Ruach\"—is distinctly feminine, as is the verb used to describe Her activity during creation—\"rachaph\"—translated as \"fluttereth\". This verb is used only one other place in the Bible (Deuteronomy 32:11) where it describes the action of a mother eagle towards her nest. The consistent use of feminine nouns and verbs to refer to the Spirit of God in the Torah, as well as the rest of the Jewish Scriptures, indicates that at least this aspect of Elohim was consistently perceived as Feminine.\nGenesis 1:26-27 says that the \"elohim\" were male and female, and humans were made in their image.\n\nTwo of the most common phrases in the Tanakh are \"vayomer Elohim\" and \"vayomer YHWH\"—\"and God said\". Again, the verb \"vayomer\" (he said) is masculine; it is never \"vatomer\", the feminine of the same verb form. The personal name of God, \"YHWH\", is presented in Exodus 3 as if the \"Y\" (Hebrew \"yod\") is the masculine subjective prefix to the verb \"to be\".\n\nIn Psalms 89:26 God is referred to as Father.\n\"He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.\"\n\nSome literary approaches to the Old Testament have argued that parallels between Biblical stories and earlier Sumerian, Akkadian and Canaanite creation myths show a matriarchal substratum that has been overlaid by a patriarchal approach. \"In the Bible, the earth is the feminine complement of God: the two combined to form man, who articulates their relationship, for example, in sacrifice.\"\n\nThe New Testament also refers to the Holy Spirit in masculine terminology, most clearly in the Gospel of John 14-16.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) #239 states, in reference to the Father: \"God transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God.\" The CCC discusses the traditional imagery and language of God as Father. It notes, however, that God is not limited to this role alone—maternal imagery are also used in the Bible. It also notes that human fatherhood only imperfectly reflects God's archetypal fatherhood.\nGod is referred to as masculine in Catholic teaching and practice.\n\nThough Church teaching, in line with its Doctors, holds that God has no literal sex because he has no body (a prerequisite of sex), classical and scriptural understanding states that God should be referred to (in most contexts) as masculine by analogy. It justifies this by pointing to God's relationship with the world as begetter of the world and revelation (i.e. analogous to an active instead of feminine receptive role in sexual intercourse).\n\nThe Inclusive Language Lectionary published by the American National Council of Churches, to which many Protestant churches belong, states in its introduction \"The God worshiped by the biblical authors and worshiped in the Church today cannot be regarded as having gender, race, or color.\"\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) differs from most churches in that they believe that the Father, the Son and the Spirit are separate and male as well as masculine. The LDS Church also teaches that God the Father is married to a divine woman, referred to as \"Heavenly Mother\". Humans are considered to be spirit children of these heavenly parents.\n\nA common source of confusion on this issue is the continued use of masculine language to describe God by many Christian groups. Such language does not necessarily imply a belief in the masculinity of God, although it is sometimes taken as such. For example the Catholic Church continues to describe God using masculine terms, in spite of the clear doctrinal statement that God \"transcends gender\". For most groups this language is traditional, though it also reflects a belief that some gender-neutral language (such as referring to God as \"it\") does not adequately reflect the personhood of God. Devices such as invented gender-neutral terms and alternating masculine/feminine terms are seen as clumsy.\n\nMany churches have however adopted inclusive language in the description of God. In recent history, many liberal and mainline Protestant denominations have adopted or encouraged the use of inclusive language (such as both feminine and masculine language, or non-gendered language) when referring to God; these include the United Church of Christ, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and the Metropolitan Community Church.\n\nThe New Century Hymnal, the hymnal of the United Church of Christ (UCC), uses inclusive language; one of its concerns while being authored was reducing the solely-masculine use of language for God, and/or balancing masculine images with feminine and non-gendered images, while retaining masculine imagery for Jesus regarding his earthly life.\n\nAt least two UCC conferences (Massachusetts and Ohio) have adopted guidelines for using inclusive language, and the majority of clergy and laity in the UCC report using inclusive language when referring to God during worship.\n\nThe Metropolitan Community Church encourages inclusive language and uses \"God—our Parent-Creator\", \"Jesus Christ the only begotten son of God\", and \"the Holy Spirit\" in its Statement of Faith to refer to the three persons of the Trinity.\n"}

During this period the ruling family of the Funj Sultanate of Sennar continued to reign, while actual power was exercised by the regents.\n\nThe Shankalla were people of the upper Blue Nile, between Sennar and Ethiopia. They predate the arrival of the Arabs in that part of Sudan, and are considered by some to be part of the Shilluk group of peoples. Their language is part of the Koman branch of the Sudan linguistic family. They were often the targets of Funj slave raids, and the term 'hamaj' was a derogatory term (meaning 'riffraff') used by the Funj to describe them. The Hamaj were incorporated into the Funj Sultanate of Sennar in the seventeenth century. Funj society was strictly divided by skin colour and other physical characteristics. The Funj classified themselves as 'blue' ( ') and they described the Hamaj as 'red' ( '). According to 'The Funj Chronicle', a slave called Hamaj settled in Sennar along with his extended family, where the prospered and 'increased greatly until they had the power and the prestige in the kingdom.\n\nThe Hamaj came to power during the reign of Sultan Badi IV. He made himself unpopular among the ruling elite by distributing lands of old established families to his new non-Funj followers — Nuba and others. This continued a policy advanced by some of his predecessors, of relying less on the traditional Funj military aristocracy and more on slave armies. Badi placed his military forces under the command of the Hamaj general Muhammad Abu Likaylik, whom he had appointed as shaykh (possibly, governor) of Kordofan in 1747. When news of Badi's increasingly arbitrary rule reached the Funj armies in Kordofan, they agreed to depose him under the leadership of Abu Likaylik. They crossed the White Nile back into core Funj territory at Alays, where they were joined by Badi's son Nasir. They advanced on Sennar and surrounded it, but agreed to allow Badi to leave under an amnesty. Abu Likaylik then installed Nasir as sultan, and the regency began.\n\nThe sixty years of the Hamaj regency were characterised by constant internal strife, both between the Hamaj and the Funj sultans, and between different members of Abu Likaylik's family.\n\nEight years after he had installed Nasir as sultan, Abu Likaylik removed him and banished him. When he learned that Nasir was conspiring to regain his throne, he had him executed. When Abu Likaylik died in 1776 or 77 he was replaced as regent by his brother, Badi wad Rajab. Once again the ruling Funj sultan, now Ismail, conspired unsuccessfully to remove the regent. Ismail was banished to Suakin and his son Adlan II made sultan in his place.\n\nThen some of the sons of Abu Likaylik rebelled against Badi wad Rajab, in alliance with Adlan II, and killed him. One of the sons, Rajab, then assumed the regency himself. During his regency the Hamaj faced their greatest crisis when the Funj nearly succeeded in overthrowing them. While Rajab was on campaign in Kordofan in 1784-5, the sultan Adlan II carried out a coup against Rajab's brother who was ruling as his deputy in Sennar. Returning from the west, Rajab was killed in the battle of Taras with Funj forces in November 1785, and the Hamaj forces retired in disarray. Adlan's restoration was short-lived however. Ih 1788-9 the Hamaj defeated him again, restored their regency, and he died soon after. Rajab's campaign in 1785 marked the end of attempts by the Hamaj to control Kordofan, which was soon after (1787) conquered by the Keira Sultanate of Darfur, which thereafter exercised effective control over all of the territory west of the White Nile. the beginning of the loss of territory to the Funj state which culminated, in 1821, with the sultans and regents controlling little outside the city of Sennar itself.\n\nInternecine warfare continued however as the new regent Nasir found his position challenged by two of his brothers, Idris and Adlan. After several months of fighting he was killed in 1798, in an act of revenge, by the son of regent Badi wad Rajab, to avenge his father. Both Idris and Adlan became co-regents. Idris was distinguished by his reputation for justice and kindness, and after his death Adlan ruled on his own. His nephew Muhammad, then apparently also as co-regent, conspired against him, overthrew him and held power until 1808, when he was killed by Muhammad, son of the regent Adlan, in revenge for his father's murder. Muhammad wad Adlan managed to retain power until 1821, on the eve of the Egyptian invasion, when he was overthrown by his cousin Hasan wad Rajab.\n\n\nAs the Egyptian army advanced south through Sudan in 1821, taking the submission of various tribes and towns as it went, the Hamaj regent Muhammad wad Adlan had sent a defiant message to its commander Ismail Pasha but early in April he was overthrown and killed by his cousin Hasan wad Rajab. By the time Hasan had suppressed all opposition, it was too late to mount any kind of opposition to the Egyptians. Hasan fled to the Ethiopian border, leaving the murdered regent's brother Ali wad Adlan to lead negotiations for capitulation. Probably on 12 June, the last Funj sultan Badi VI offered his submission to Ismail in person, and the following day the Egyptian army entered Sennar unopposed. The descriptions of the town they found are a sad testament to the ruin to which the endless wars and strife of the Hamaj had reduced Sennar - the royal palace was derelict, and the mosque covered in graffiti.\n\nShortly after taking Sennar Ismail Pasha suspected Ali wad Adlan of disloyalty, and had him hanged. Ismail also hunted down Hasan wad Rajab and the killers of the regent Muhammad wad Adlan. Hasan was imprisoned but treated with leniency - many of his confederates however were executed by impalement. Ismail released Hasan wad Rajab from prison and Hasan accompanied him on an expedition to Fazughli, near the Ethiopian border, raiding for slaves with force of Hamaj cavalry alongside the Egyptians. In 1822, Ismail Pasha was killed by the Jaaliyyin at Shendi. Rebellions broke out all over central Sudan, but were steadily suppressed by the Egyptian garrisons along the Nile. Hasan wad Rajab led one rebellion but was killed fighting them at the battle of Abu Shawka, south of Sennar.\n\nIdris Muhammad Adlan Abu Likaylik was a Hamaj chieftain who was lord of the Funj mountains near the Ethiopian border. He had never submitted to Egyptian rule until 1826, when Ali Khurshid Bey, Egyptian governor of Sennar, brought about his reconciliation with the new regime. He was then appointed shaykh of the Funj mountains, where he remained in office until 1851 when the Governor-General Abdul Latif Pasha removed him and replaced him with his nephew Adlan. Thereafter, as the Egyptians steadily modernised local government, Hamaj clan members played little influence in Sudanese public life.\n"}
{"id": "249524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249524", "title": "Harrowing of Hell", "text": "Harrowing of Hell\n\nIn Christian theology, the Harrowing of Hell (Latin: \"Descensus Christi ad Inferos\", \"the descent of Christ into hell\") is the triumphant descent of Christ into Hell (or Hades) between the time of his Crucifixion and his Resurrection when he brought salvation to all of the righteous who had died since the beginning of the world. After his death, the soul of Jesus descended into the realm of the dead.\n\nThe Harrowing of Hell is referred to in the Apostles' Creed and the Athanasian Creed (\"Quicumque vult\") which state that Jesus Christ \"descended into Hell\". Christ having descended to the underworld is alluded to in the New Testament in , which states that the \"good tidings were proclaimed to the dead\". The Catholic Catechism interprets Ephesians 4:9, which states that \"[Christ] descended into the lower parts of the earth\", as also supporting this interpretation. This near-absence in Scripture has given rise to controversy and differing interpretations. The Harrowing of Hell is commemorated in the liturgical calendar on Holy Saturday.\n\nAccording to \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\", the story first appears clearly in the Gospel of Nicodemus in the section called the Acts of Pilate, which also appears separately at earlier dates within the Acts of Peter and Paul. The descent into hell had been related in Old English poems connected with the names of Cædmon and Cynewulf. It is subsequently repeated in Ælfric of Eynsham's homilies c. 1000 AD, which is the first known inclusion of the word \"harrowing\". Middle English dramatic literature contains the fullest and most dramatic development of the subject.\n\nAs an image in Christian art, the harrowing is also known as the Anastasis (a Greek word for \"resurrection\"), considered a creation of Byzantine culture and first appearing in the West in the early 8th century.\n\nThe Greek wording in the \"Apostles' Creed\" is , (\"katelthonta eis ta katôtata\"), and in Latin \"descendit ad inferos\". The Greek (\"ta katôtata\",\"the lowest\") and the Latin \"inferos\" (\"those below\") may also be translated as \"underworld\", \"netherworld\", or \"abode of the dead.\"\n\nThe realm into which Jesus descended is called Hell, in long-established English usage, but Sheol or Limbo by some Christian theologians to distinguish it from the hell of the damned.\n\nThe word \"harrow\" comes from the Old English \"hergian\" meaning to harry or despoil and is seen in the homilies of Aelfric, c. 1000. The term \"Harrowing of Hell\" refers not merely to the idea that Christ descended into Hell, as in the Creed, but to the rich tradition that developed later, asserting that he triumphed over \"inferos\", releasing Hell's captives, particularly Adam and Eve, and the righteous men and women of the Old Testament period.\n\nIn Classical mythology Hades is the underworld inhabited by departed souls and the god Pluto is its ruler. The New Testament uses the term \"Hades\" to refer to the abode or state of the dead. In some places it seems to represent a neutral place where the dead awaited the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Several passages from the New Testament have been taken by some to imply that Christ descended into this realm of the dead to bring the righteous ones to Heaven. Other New Testament passages imply it is a place of torment for the unrighteous, leading to speculation that it may be divided into two very different sections.\n\nIn the New King James version of the New Testament, there are 10 references to Hades:\n\n\nAlthough these verses do not contain the word \"Hades\", theologians have concluded that comparable terms are used as synonyms:\n\n\nThe Harrowing of Hell was taught by theologians of the early church: St Melito of Sardis (died c. 180) in his \"Homily on the Passover\" and more explicitly in his \"Homily for Holy Saturday\"; Tertullian (\"A Treatise on the Soul\", 55), Hippolytus (\"Treatise on Christ and Anti-Christ\") Origen (\"Against Celsus\", 2:43), and, later, St Ambrose (died 397) all wrote of the Harrowing of Hell. The early heretic Marcion and his followers also discussed the Harrowing of Hell, as mentioned by Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Epiphanius. The 6th-century Christolytes, as recorded by John of Damascus, believed that Jesus left his soul and body in hell, and only rose with his divinity to heaven.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew relates that immediately after Christ died, the earth shook, there was darkness, the veil in the Temple was torn in two, and many people rose from the dead and walked about in Jerusalem and were seen by many people there. According to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, the Harrowing of Hell was foreshadowed by Christ's raising of Lazarus from the dead prior to his own crucifixion. The hymns proper to the weekend suggest that as he did on earth, John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus in Hell by prophesying to the spirits held there that Christ would soon save them.\n\nIn the \"Acts of Pilate\"—usually incorporated with the widely read medieval \"Gospel of Nicodemus\"—texts built around an original that might have been as old as the 3rd century AD with many improvements and embroidered interpolations, chapters 17 to 27 are called the \"Decensus Christi ad Inferos.\" They contain a dramatic dialogue between Hades and prince Satan, and the entry of the King of Glory, imagined as from within Tartarus. \n\nThe richest, most circumstantial accounts of the Harrowing of Hell are found in medieval dramatic literature, such as the four great cycles of English mystery plays which each devote a separate scene to depict it, or in passing references in Dante's \"Inferno\". The subject is found also in the Cornish mystery plays and the York and Wakefield cycles. These medieval versions of the story do not derive from the bare suggestion made in the Epistle ascribed to Peter, but come from the \"Gospel of Nicodemus.\"\n\nThe Old Testament view of the afterlife was that all people, whether righteous or unrighteous, went to Sheol when they died. No Hebrew figure ever descended into Sheol and returned, although an apparition of the recently deceased Samuel briefly appeared to Saul when summoned by the Witch of Endor. Several works from the Second Temple period elaborate the concept of Sheol, dividing it into sections based on the righteousness or unrighteousness of those who have died.\n\nThe New Testament maintains a distinction between Sheol, the common \"place of the dead\", and the eternal destiny of those condemned at the Final Judgment, variously described as Gehenna, \"the outer darkness,\" or a lake of eternal fire. Modern English translations of the Bible maintain this distinction (e.g. by translating \"Sheol\" as \"the Pit\" and \"Gehenna\" as \"Hell\"), but the influential King James Version used the word \"hell\" to translate both concepts.\n\nThe Hellenistic views of heroic descent into the Underworld and successful return follow traditions that are far older than the mystery religions popular at the time of Christ. The Epic of Gilgamesh includes such a scene, and it appears also in \"Odyssey\" XI. Writing shortly before the birth of Jesus, Vergil included it in the \"Aeneid\". What little we know of the worship in mystery religions such as the Eleusinian Mysteries and Mithraism suggests that a ritual death and rebirth of the initiate was an important part of their liturgy. Again, this has earlier parallels, in particular with the worship of Osiris. The ancient homily on \"The Lord's Descent into Hell\" may mirror these traditions by referring to baptism as a symbolic death and rebirth. (\"cf.\" ) Or, these traditions of Mithraism may be drawn from early Christian homilies.\n\nThere is an ancient homily on the subject, of unknown authorship, usually entitled \"The Lord's Descent into Hell\" that is the second reading at Office of Readings on Holy Saturday in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" states: \"By the expression 'He descended into Hell', the Apostles' Creed confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us conquered death and the devil 'who has the power of death' (). In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ went down to the realm of the dead. He opened Heaven's gates for the just who had gone before him.\"\n\nAs the Catechism says, the word \"Hell\"—from the Norse, \"Hel\"; in Latin, \"infernus, infernum, inferi\"; in Greek, (Hades); in Hebrew, \"שאול\" (Sheol)—is used in Scripture and the Apostles' Creed to refer to the abode of all the dead, whether righteous or evil, unless or until they are admitted to Heaven (CCC 633). This abode of the dead is the \"Hell\" into which the Creed says Christ descended. His death freed from exclusion from Heaven the just who had gone before him: \"It is precisely these holy souls who awaited their Savior in Abraham's bosom whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended into Hell\", the Catechism states (CCC 633), echoing the words of the Roman Catechism, 1,6,3. His death was of no avail to the damned.\n\nConceptualization of the abode of the dead as a place, though possible and customary, is not obligatory (Church documents, such as catechisms, speak of a \"state or place\"). Some maintain that Christ did not go to the place of the damned, which is what is generally understood today by the word \"Hell\". For instance, Thomas Aquinas taught that Christ did not descend into the \"Hell of the lost\" in his essence, but only by the effect of his death, through which \"he put them to shame for their unbelief and wickedness: but to them who were detained in Purgatory he gave hope of attaining to glory: while upon the holy Fathers detained in Hell solely on account of original sin, he shed the light of glory everlasting.\"\n\nWhile some maintain that Christ merely descended into the \"limbo of the fathers\", others, notably theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (inspired by the visions of Adrienne von Speyr), maintain that it was more than this and that the descent involved suffering by Jesus. Some maintain that this is a matter on which differences and theological speculation are permissible without transgressing the limits of orthodoxy. However, Balthasar's point here has been forcefully condemned by conservative Catholic outlets.\n\nSaint John Chrysostom's Paschal Homily also addresses the Harrowing of Hades, and is typically read during the Paschal Vigil, the climactic service of the Orthodox celebration of Pascha (Easter).\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Harrowing of Hades is celebrated annually on Holy and Great Saturday, during the Vesperal Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil as is normative for the Byzantine Rite. At the beginning of the service, the hangings in the church and the vestments worn by the clergy are all somber Lenten colours (usually purple or black). Then, just before the Gospel reading, the liturgical colors are changed white and the deacon performs a censing, and the priest strews laurel leaves around the church, symbolizing the broken gates of hell; this is done in celebration of the harrowing of Hades then taking place, and in anticipation of Christ's imminent resurrection.\n\nThe Harrowing of Hades is generally more common and prominent in Orthodox iconography compared to the Western tradition. It is the traditional icon for Holy Saturday, and is used during the Paschal season and on Sundays throughout the year.\n\nThe traditional Orthodox icon of the Resurrection of Jesus, partially inspired by the apocryphal \"Acts of Pilate\" (4th c.), does not depict simply the physical act of Jesus's coming out of the Tomb, but rather it reveals what Orthodox Christians believe to be the spiritual reality of what his Death and Resurrection accomplished.\n\nThe icon depicts Jesus, vested in white and gold to symbolize his divine majesty, standing on the brazen gates of Hades (also called the \"Doors of Death\"), which are broken and have fallen in the form of a cross, illustrating the belief that by his death on the cross, Jesus \"trampled down death by death\" (see Paschal troparion). He is holding Adam and Eve and pulling them up out of Hades. Traditionally, he is not shown holding them by the hands, but by their wrists, to illustrate the theological teaching that mankind could not pull himself out of his original or ancestral sin, but that it could come about only by the work (\"energia\") of God. Jesus is surrounded by various righteous figures from the Old Testament (Abraham, David, etc.); the bottom of the icon depicts Hades as a chasm of darkness, often with various pieces of broken locks and chains strewn about. Quite frequently, one or two figures are shown in the darkness, bound in chains, who are generally identified as personifications of Death or the Devil.\n\nMartin Luther, in a sermon delivered in Torgau in 1533, stated that Christ descended into Hell.\n\nThe Formula of Concord (a Lutheran confession) states, \"we believe simply that the entire person, God and human being, descended to Hell after his burial, conquered the devil, destroyed the power of Hell, and took from the devil all his power.\" (Solid Declaration, Art. IX)\n\nMany attempts were made following Luther's death to systematize his theology of the descensus, whether Christ descended in victory or humiliation. For Luther, however, the defeat or \"humiliation\" of Christ is never fully separable from His victorious glorification. Some argued that Christ's suffering was completed with His words from the cross, \"It is finished.\" Luther himself, when pressed to elaborate on the question of whether Christ descended to Hell in humiliation or victory responded, \"It is enough to preach the article to the laypeople as they have learned to know it in the past from the stained glass and other sources.\"\n\nJohn Calvin expressed his concern that many Christians \"have never earnestly considered what it is or means that we have been redeemed from God's judgment. Yet this is our wisdom: duly to feel how much our salvation cost the Son of God.\" \n\nCalvin's conclusion is that \"If any persons have scruples about admitting this article into the Creed, it will soon be made plain how important it is to the sum of our redemption: if it is left out, much of the benefit of Christ’s death will be lost.\" Calvin strongly opposed the notion that Christ freed prisoners, as opposed to traveling to Hell as part of completing his sufferings (Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 2, chapter 16, sections 8-10),\n\nThe Reformed interpret the phrase \"he descended into Hell\" as referring to Christ's pain and humiliation \"prior\" to his death, and that this humiliation had a spiritual dimension as part of God's judgement upon the sin which he bore on behalf of Christians. The doctrine of Christ's humiliation is also meant to assure believers that Christ has redeemed them from the pain and suffering of God's judgment on sin.\n\nThe Harrowing of Hell has been a unique and important doctrine among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since its founding in 1830 by Joseph Smith, although members of the church (\"Mormons\") usually call it by other terms, such as \"Christ's visit to the spirit world.\" Like Christian exegetes distinguishing between Sheol and Gehenna, Latter-day Saints distinguish between the realm of departed spirits (the \"spirit world\") and the portion (or state) of the wicked (\"spirit prison\"). The portion or state of the righteous is often referred to as \"paradise\".\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of Latter-day Saint beliefs regarding the Harrowing of Hell is their view on the purpose of it, both for the just and the wicked. Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the Church, explained in what is now a canonized revelation, that when Christ died, \"there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, ... rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand. They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death\" (D&C ).\n\nIn the LDS view, while Christ announced freedom from physical death to the just, he had another purpose in descending to Hell regarding the wicked. \"The Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them; but behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces…and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead ... to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets\" (). From the Latter-day Saint viewpoint, the rescue of spirits was not a one-time event but an ongoing process that still continues (; ). This concept goes hand-in-hand with the doctrine of baptism for the dead, which is based on the LDS belief that those who choose to accept the gospel in the spirit world must still receive the saving ordinances in order to dwell in the kingdom of God (; ; ). These baptisms and other ordinances are performed in LDS temples, wherein a church member is baptized vicariously, or in behalf of, those who died without being baptized by proper authority. The recipients in the spirit world then have the opportunity to accept or reject this baptism.\n\nA number of Christians reject the doctrine of the \"harrowing of hell\", claiming that \"there is scant scriptural evidence for [it], and that Jesus's own words contradict it\". John Piper, for example, says \"there is no textual [i.e. Biblical] basis for believing that Christ descended into hell\", and, therefore, Piper does not recite the \"he descended into hell\" phrase when saying the Apostles' Creed. Wayne Grudem also skips the phrase when reciting the Creed; he says that the \"single argument in ... favor [of the \"harrowing of hell\" clause in the Creed] seems to be that it has been around so long. ... But an old mistake is still a mistake\". In his book \"Raised with Christ\", Pentecostal Adrian Warnock agrees with Grudem, commenting, \"Despite some translations of an ancient creed [i.e. the Apostles' Creed], which suggest that Jesus ... 'descended into hell', there is no biblical evidence to suggest that he actually did so.\"\n\nAugustine (354–430) argued that 1 Peter 3:19–20, the chief passage used to support the doctrine of the \"harrowing of hell\", is \"more allegory than history\".\n\nThe above views share the traditional Christian belief in the immortality of the soul. The mortalist view of the intermediate state requires an alternative view of the and , taking a view of the New Testament use of Hell as equivalent to use of Hades in the Septuagint and therefore to Sheol in the Old Testament. William Tyndale and Martin Bucer of Strassburg argued that Hades in Acts 2 was merely a metaphor for the grave. Other reformers Christopher Carlisle and Walter Deloenus in London, argued for the article to be dropped from the creed. The Harrowing of Hell was a major scene in traditional depictions of Christ's life avoided by John Milton due to his mortalist views. Mortalist interpretations of the Acts 2 statements of Christ being in Hades are also found among later Anglicans such as E. W. Bullinger.\n\nWhile those holding mortalist views on the soul would agree on the \"harrowing of hell\" concerning souls, that there were no conscious dead for Christ to literally visit, the question of whether Christ himself was also dead, unconscious, brings different answers:\n\nOf the three days, Christ says \"I was dead\" (Greek \"egenomen nekros\" ἐγενόμην νεκρὸς, Latin \"fui mortuus\").\n\n\nParallels in Jewish literature reference legends of Enoch and Abraham's harrowings of the Underworld, unrelated to Christian themes. These have been updated in Isaac Leib Peretz's short story \"Neilah in Gehenna\", in which a Jewish hazzan descends to Hell and uses his unique voice to bring about the repentance and liberation of the souls imprisoned there.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47947027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47947027", "title": "Horace Brodzky", "text": "Horace Brodzky\n\nHorace Ascher Brodzky (30 January 1885 – 11 February 1969) was an Australian-born artist and writer most of whose work was created in London and New York. His work included paintings, drawings and linocuts, of which he was an early pioneer. An associate in his early career of many leading artists working in Britain of his period, including Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Mark Gertler, and members of the Vorticism movement, he ended his life relatively neglected.\n\nBrodzky was born in Kew, Melbourne in 1885 to the Australian journalist Maurice Brodzky (a Jewish immigrant to Australia from Poland), and his wife Flora, née Leon. In his youth he assisted his father in the production of the magazine \"Table Talk\".\n\nBrodzky studied initially at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. In 1904 his father was bankrupted after exposing corruption, and Horace moved with his family to San Francisco.\n\nIn 1908, Brodzky went to London where he studied during 1911 at the City and Guilds South London Technical Art School. He became an acquaintance and follower of Walter Sickert. Amongst his friends was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who created in 1913 a portrait bust of Brodzky (now in the Tate Gallery, London), and whose biography he wrote in 1933. Brodzky is said to have been so engrossed in talk when he visited Gaudier-Brzeska's studio in the King's Road, that he missed the last bus to Herne Hill where he lived. Brodzky travelled to Italy with the poet John Gould Fletcher and this led to his first London exhibition, \"Paintings and Sketches of Italian and Sicilian Scenes\" (c. 1911), of which one painting was selected for the 1912 Venice Biennale. He was in fact the first Australian to be exhibited at the Biennale. In 1914 his work was exhibited along with that of other Jewish artists, including Mark Gertler and David Bomberg, in the Whitechapel Gallery. Brodzky became a member of The London Group. During this period he was a pioneer of the technique of linocut, in which medium he has been said to have \"excelled\". His early oils reveal the influence of both Gertler and Bomberg. Among his works of this period are portraits of Jacob Epstein and Jacob Kramer.\n\nIn 1915 Brodzky moved to New York, with an introduction to the art patron John Quinn. There he worked as a poster artist and an arts journalist, and in 1917 helped Quinn organize a New York exhibition of Vorticist artists. In 1919 he married Bertha Greenfield; they were to have three sons. In 1920 Egmont Arens published in New York a collection of 21 of Brodzky's linoprints. Brodzky also designed book jackets for writers including Eugene O'Neill and Theodore Dreiser, and painted a portrait of O'Neill.\n\nReturning to London in 1923 he became a professional artist. His work featured in the first-ever exhibition of linocuts, organized by Claude Flight at the Redfern Gallery in 1929. Initial success however withered in the 1930s, when his marriage broke up, and from then on he lived in financial straits. In 1935 James Laver published a study \"Forty Drawings by Horace Brodzky\". Laver described Brodzky's drawing technique as follows:Brodzky prefers the ordinary 'dip-in' steel nib, for this enables the hand, by varying its pressure on the paper, to broaden the line at will, or rather in obedience to the obscure subconscious or half-conscious promptings which guide the hand to its task. He makes no preliminary studies, draws no pencil outline, carefully rubbed out afterwards to give a false impression of spontaneity. There are no erasures or alterations. Each drawing is made 'au premier coup'. It is made very quickly, as a unity, and when finished the artist cannot remember at what point it was started. The drawing has been thrown on the paper, as it were, with a single gesture.\n\nIn 1946 Brodzky published his own study of the French-Romanian-Jewish artist Jules Pascin. In London he lived for most of the rest of his life in the Kilburn and Willesden areas, continuing to produce paintings, drawings and linocuts. He supported himself by teaching and painting stage-decor and from 1948 to 1962 he was art-editor of the \"Antique Dealer and Collector's Guide\", (founded by his brother Adrian).\n\nIn 1963, Brodzky wrote to the collector Ruth Borchard, who had just purchased from him a self-portrait for the sum of 12 guineas (₤12.60):\nSince 1911 I have been connected with the London art world & have exhibited at all important exhibitions…and have worked for modern art... For a long time I have sold none of my work & have had to rely on selling items by other artists that I have collected…This letter is not an angry complaint but just the plain facts that I thought you might like to know.\n\nIn 1965 80th anniversary exhibitions were organized for Brodzky at the Ben Uri Gallery and the Oxford Union Cellars. In 1967 some of his early linocuts were reissued in London in a signed edition of 60 prints. Brodzky died in Kilburn in 1969, when his estate was valued for probate at £7977. Exhibitions of Brodzky's work were held in the Jewish Museum of Australia (1988) and at the Boundary Gallery, London (1989).\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "22631843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22631843", "title": "Interfaith marriage in Islam", "text": "Interfaith marriage in Islam\n\nAccording to all four schools of Sunni law and Shia law, interfaith marriages are condoned only between a Muslim male and a non-Muslim female from the People of the Book (that is, Christians and Jews) and not vice versa. In many Muslim majority countries, interfaith marriages (apart from marriages of Muslim men to Jewish-or-Christian women) are prohibited, and/or regarded as socially taboo. \n\nIn some diaspora societies, interfaith marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims take place at substantial rates, including marriages that contradict the \nsharia consensus. For example, in the United States, about one in ten Muslim women are married to non-Muslims, including about one in six Muslim women under 40 and about 20% of Muslim women who describe themselves as less devoutly religious.\n\nIslamic marriage rules between Muslim men and non-Muslim women are regulated by Islamic principles. There are restrictions to whom a Muslim man can marry which are further explained below.\nAccording to Qur'an (5:5),\n\"\"This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers\". From this verse, it can be understood that Muslim men are allowed to marry non-Muslim women from the People of the Book (i.e. the Jews and Christians).\nHowever, the Quran (2:221) also states,\n\"'And do not marry Polytheist women until they believe, And a believing slave woman is better than a Polytheist women, even though she might please you. And do not marry Polytheist men [to your women] until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a Polytheist men, even though he might please you. Those invite [you] to the Fire, but Allah invites to Paradise and to forgiveness, by His permission. And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they may remember\". From this verse, it can be understood that Muslim men are not allowed to marry women who associate or similarise Allah with anything.\nHaving all the above verses taken into account, it can be concluded that Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women with following conditions:\n\nInterfaith marriage between Muslim women and non-Muslim men has been a highly sensitive topic across the Muslim world for centuries, as it is considered to be a violation of Islamic law by the consensus of scholars. Although there are changes, it is still banned in many Muslim societies. While the law permits a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman, it does not allow a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man without proof of his conversion to Islam. Almost all Islamic nations prohibit it. Tunisia is one of the few Muslim majority countries where Muslim women are allowed to marry non-Muslims.\n\nIn parts of the diaspora, interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslims take place at substantial rates, in contradiction to the sharia consensus. For example, in the United States, about 10% of Muslim women are married to non-Muslims.\n\nUnder Islamic law, if a non-Muslim woman is married to a non-Muslim, and she converts to Islam, the marriage is suspended until her husband converts to Islam. She could, in theory, leave the non-Muslim husband and marry a Muslim one. If the non-Muslim husband does convert a new marriage is not needed. In the Quran, it is said,\n\nIn practice, many Arab countries allowed interfaith marriage to Christian or Jewish women but not to non-Muslim men. In Lebanon for example there is no civil personal status law and marriages are performed according to the religion of the spouses. There, Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men, whereas this is possible vice versa, at least if the spouse is a Christian or Jewish woman. Turkey allows marriages to non-Muslim men through secular laws. In Tunisia since 16 September 2017, Muslim women can lawfully marry any man of any faith, or of none. In Malaysia a non-Muslim must convert to Islam in order to marry a Muslim. The offspring of such unions are automatically Muslims and all Malaysian Muslims are legally prohibited from leaving Islam (\"Riddah\").\n\nInterfaith marriage especially between Hindus and Muslims often have been the bone of contention and have resulted in communal riots in India. \"Love Jihad\", also called Romeo Jihad, widely regarded as a conspiracy theory, is an alleged activity under which young Muslim boys and men are said to reportedly target young girls belonging to non-Muslim communities for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Official investigations in Uttar Pradesh had found no credence in allegations of Love Jihad that had been brought before them, with state police chief A.L. Banerjee stating that, \"In most cases we found that a Hindu girl and Muslim boy were in love and had married against their parents' will. There are also instances where Muslim girls marry Hindu \nboys under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.\n\n"}
{"id": "59925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59925", "title": "J. F. C. Fuller", "text": "J. F. C. Fuller\n\nMajor-General John Frederick Charles \"Boney\" Fuller, CB, CBE, DSO (1 September 1878 – 10 February 1966) was a senior British Army officer, military historian, and strategist, notable as an early theorist of modern armoured warfare, including categorizing principles of warfare. With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public. He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasized the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.\n\nFuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organized fascist movement. He was also an occultist and Thelemite who wrote a number of works on esotericism and mysticism.\n\nFuller was born in Chichester, West Sussex and is the son of an Anglican clergyman. After moving to Lausanne with his parents as a boy, he returned to England at the age of 11 without them; three years later, at \"the somewhat advanced age of 14\", he began attending Malvern College and, later trained for an army career at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from 1897 to 1898. His nickname of \"Boney\", which he was to retain, is said to have come either from an admiration for Napoleon Bonaparte, or from an imperious manner combined with military brilliance which resembled Napoleon's.\n\nFuller was commissioned into the 1st Battalion of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry (the old 43rd Foot), and served in South Africa from 1899 to 1902. In the spring of 1904 Fuller was sent with his unit to India, where he contracted typhoid fever in autumn of 1905; he returned to England the next year on sick-leave, where he met the woman he married in December 1906. Instead of returning to India, he was reassigned to units in England, serving as an adjutant to the 2nd South Middlesex Volunteers (amalgamated into the 7th Middlesex during the Haldane Reforms) and helping form the 10th Middlesex, until he was accepted into the Staff College at Camberley in 1913, starting work there in January 1914.\n\nDuring the First World War, Fuller was a staff officer with the Home Forces and with 7 Corps in France, and from 1916 in the Headquarters of the Machine-Gun Corps' Heavy Branch which was later to become the Tank Corps. He helped plan the tank attack at the 20 November 1917 Battle of Cambrai and the tank operations for the Autumn offensives of 1918. His Plan 1919 for a fully mechanised offensive against the German army was never implemented. After 1918 he held various leading positions, notably as a commander of an experimental brigade at Aldershot.\n\nAfter the war Fuller collaborated with his junior B. H. Liddell Hart in developing new ideas for the mechanisation of armies, \nlaunching a crusade for the mechanization and modernization of the British Army. Chief instructor of Camberley Staff College from 1923, he became military assistant to the chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1926. \nIn what came to be known as the \"Tidworth Incident\", Fuller turned down the command of the Experimental Mechanized Force, which was formed on August 27, 1927. The appointment also carried responsibility for a regular infantry brigade and the garrison of Tidworth Camp on Salisbury Plain. Fuller believed he would be unable to devote himself to the Experimental Mechanized Force and the development of mechanized warfare techniques without extra staff to assist him with the additional extraneous duties, which the War Office refused to allocate.\nHe was promoted to Major-General in 1930 and retired three years later to devote himself entirely to writing.\n\nAfter retirement, Fuller served as a reporter during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935) and the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). On his retirement in 1933, impatient with what he considered the inability of democracy to adopt military reforms, Fuller became involved with Sir Oswald Mosley and the British Fascist movement. As a member of the British Union of Fascists he sat on the party's Policy Directorate and was considered one of Mosley's closest allies. He was also a member of the clandestine far right group the Nordic League.\n\nFuller's ideas on mechanized warfare continued to be influential in the lead-up to the Second World War, ironically less with his countrymen than with the Nazis, notably Heinz Guderian who spent his own money to have Fuller's \"Provisional Instructions for Tank and Armoured Car Training\" translated. In the 1930s the German Army implemented tactics similar in many ways to Fuller's analysis, which became known as Blitzkrieg. Like Fuller, theorists of Blitzkrieg partly based their approach on the theory that areas of large enemy activity should be bypassed to be eventually surrounded and destroyed. Blitzkrieg-style tactics were used by several nations throughout the Second World War, predominantly by the Germans in the invasion of Poland (1939), Western Europe (1940), and the Soviet Union (1941). While Germany and to some degree the Western Allies adopted Blitzkrieg ideas, they were not much used by the Red Army, which developed its armored warfare doctrine based on deep operations, which were developed by Soviet military theorists Marshal M. N. Tukhachevsky et al. in the 1920s based on their experiences in the First World War and the Russian Civil War.\n\nFuller was the only foreigner present at Nazi Germany's first armed manoeuvres in 1935. Fuller frequently praised Adolf Hitler in his speeches and articles, once describing him as \"that realistic idealist who has awakened the common sense of the British people by setting out to create a new Germany\". On April 20, 1939 Fuller was an honoured guest at Hitler's 50th birthday parade, watching as \"for three hours a completely mechanised and motorised army roared past the Führer.\" Afterwards Hitler asked, \"I hope you were pleased with your children?\" Fuller replied, \"Your Excellency, they have grown up so quickly that I no longer recognise them.\"\n\nDuring the Second World War, 1939–45, Fuller was under suspicion for his Nazi sympathies. He continued to speak out in favour of a peaceful settlement with Germany. Alan Brooke (in his war diaries, p. 201) comments that \"the Director of Security called on him to discuss Boney Fuller and his Nazi activities\", though Alan Brooke commented that he did not think Fuller \"had any unpatriotic intentions\". Although he was not interned or arrested, he was the only officer of his rank not invited to return to service during the war. There was some suspicion that he was not incarcerated in May 1940 along with other leading officials of the BUF because of his association with General Edmund Ironside and other senior officers. Mosley himself admitted to \"a little puzzlement\" as to why Fuller had not been imprisoned.\n\nFuller spent his last years a deeply embittered man feeling that the wrong side had won the Second World War, a thesis most fully announced in the 1961 edition of \"The Reformation of War\" where he announced his belief that Hitler was the savior of the West against the Soviet Union, and denounced Churchill and Roosevelt for being too stupid to see this. Fuller died in Falmouth, Cornwall in 1966.\n\nFuller was a vigorous, expressive, and opinionated writer of military history and of controversial predictions of the future of war, publishing \"On Future Warfare\" in 1928. Seeing his teachings largely vindicated by the Second World War, he published \"Machine Warfare: An Enquiry into the Influence of Mechanics on the Art of War\" in 1942.\n\nFuller is perhaps best known today for his \"Nine Principles of War\" which have formed the foundation of much of modern military theory since the 1930s, and which were originally derived from a convergence of Fuller's mystical and military interests. The Nine Principles went through several iterations; Fuller stated that \n\"...the system evolved from six principles in 1912, rose to eight in 1915, to, virtually, nineteen in 1923, and then descended to nine in 1925...\" For example, notice how his analysis of General Ulysses S. Grant was presented in 1929.\n\nThe United States Army modified Fuller's list and issued its first list of the principles of war in 1921, making it the basis of advanced training for officers into the 1990s, when it finally reconceptualized its training.\n\nThe Nine Principles involve the uses of Force (combat power). They have been expressed in various ways, but Fuller's 1925 arrangement is as follows:\n\n\nCabalistic influences on his theories can be evidenced by his use of the \"Law of Threes\" throughout his work. Fuller didn't believe the Principles stood alone as is thought today, but that they complemented and overlapped each other as part of a whole, forming the Law of Economy of Force.\n\nThese Principles were further grouped into the categories of \"Control\" (command / co-operation), \"Pressure\" (attack / activity) and \"Resistance\" (protection / stability). The Principles of Control guides the dual Principles of Pressure and of Resistance, which in turn create the Principles of Control.\n\nThey were also grouped into Cosmic (\"Spiritual\"), Mental (\"Mind / Thought / Reason\"), Moral (\"Soul / Sensations / Emotions\"), and Physical (\"Body / Musculature / Action\") Spheres, in which two Principles (like the double-edged point of an arrowhead) combine to create or manifest a third, which in turn guides the first and second Principles (like the fletches on an arrow's tail). Each Sphere leads to the creation of the next until it returns to the beginning and repeats the circular cycle with reassessments of the \"Object\" and \"Objective\" to redefine the uses of \"Force\". The Cosmic Sphere is seen as outside the other three Spheres, like the Heavens are outside the Realm of Man. They influence it indirectly in ways that cannot be controlled by the commander, but they are a factor in the use of Force. Force resides in the center of the pattern, as all of these elements revolve around it. \n\nThese Principles of War have been adopted and further refined by the military forces of several nations, most notably within NATO, and continue to be applied widely to modern strategic thinking. Recently they have also been applied to business tactics and hobby wargaming.\n\nFuller also developed the idea of the \"Constant Tactical Factor\". This states that every improvement in warfare is checked by a counter-improvement, causing the advantage to shift back and forth between the offensive and the defensive. Fuller's firsthand experience in the First World War saw a shift from the defensive power of the machine gun to the offensive power of the tank.\n\nFuller had an occultist side that oddly mixed with his military side. He was an early disciple of English poet and magician Aleister Crowley, and was very familiar with his and other forms of magick and mysticism. While serving in the First Oxfordshire Light Infantry he had entered and won a contest to write the best review of Crowley's poetic works, after which it turned out that he was the only entrant. This essay was later published in book form in 1907 as \"The Star in the West\". After this he became an enthusiastic supporter of Crowley, joining his magical order, the A∴A∴., within which he became a leading member, editing order documents and its journal, \"The Equinox\". During this period he wrote \"The Treasure House of Images\", edited early sections of Crowley's magical autobiography \"The Temple of Solomon the King\" and produced highly regarded paintings dealing with A∴A∴ teachings: these paintings have been used in recent years as the covers of the journal's revival, \"The Equinox, Volume IV\".\n\nAfter the \"Jones vs. The Looking Glass\" case, in which a great deal was made of Aleister Crowley's bisexuality (although Crowley himself was not a party to the case), Fuller became worried that his association with Crowley might be a hindrance to his career. Crowley writes in chapter 67 of his book, \"The Confessions of Aleister Crowley\":\n\nAfter this, contact between the two men faded rapidly. The front pages of the 1913 issues of the \"Equinox\" (Volume 1, nos. 9 and 10), which gave general directions to A∴A∴ members, included a notice on the subject of Fuller, who was described as a \"former Probationer\"; the notice disparaged Fuller's magical accomplishments and warned A∴A∴ members to accept no magical training from him. However, Fuller continued to be fascinated with occult subjects and in later years he would write about topics such as the Qabalah and yoga.\n\nFuller was a prolific writer and published 45+ books.\n\n\n\nFor examples of the use of Fuller's campaign theories in the business world see:\n"}

The practice continues to some degree today, although where modern facilities are available it may take the form of female foeticide.\n\n\n"}

This book includes chapters on tzedakah, poverty, health care, housing, labor, criminal justice, and environmental justice in America, seen through a Jewish viewpoint. She has served as the Rabbi in Residence of Jewish Funds for Justice and as the Director of Outreach and Education for Jewish Council on Urban Affairs.\n\nJacobs is also the author of a teshuvah (legal position), passed by the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards that says that Jews should pay their workers a living wage, create dignified workplaces, and hire union workers when possible. She was named to \"Newsweek\"'s list of the fifty most influential rabbis in 2009 and 2010; to \"The Forward\" newspaper's list of fifty influential American Jews in 2006, 2008, and 2011; and to \"The Jewish Week\"s list of \"thirty-six under thirty-six\" in 2008. She was also named to \"Newsweek\"s list of the 50 Most Influential Rabbis in America in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. \n\nRabbi Jacobs has been accused of spreading false accusations of anti-Semitism against Palestinian scholar Steven Salaita. \n\nShe has written many articles on issues relating to Judaism and social justice. She has covered topics including Jewish social justice, education, and tzedakah. Since March 2010, she has been a columnist for \"The Forward\".\n\nJacobs was born in Boston and grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts, where she attended Framingham public schools. She was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 2003 and also earned an MA in Talmud at the same time. She earned an MS in Urban Affairs from Hunter College, CUNY, in 2003, and a BA in Comparative Literature from Columbia University in 1997. She is married to Rabbi Guy Austrian and has two daughters. She spent the 2009–2010 academic year as a Jerusalem Fellow at Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Mandel Institute.\n\nIn 2003, Jacobs, then a rabbinical student at the Jewish Theological Seminary, got into a public debate with Rabbi Daniel Gordis. She wrote an article for the JTS student bulletin in which she critiqued Israel's policies toward Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. The JTS administration censored the article, and David Freidenreich, the student editor of the bulletin, quit in protest. Jacobs and Freidenreich distributed around the school a copy of the censored article along with Freidenreich's letter of resignation. Gordis heard about the article and sent an e-mail excoriating Jacobs to his list of several thousand correspondents. Jacobs responded with a public plea for civil dialogue. Gordis sent a follow-up e-mail apologizing for any personal embarrassment he caused, without retracting any of his earlier comments.\n\nJacobs's approach to Judaism and social justice is driven by a belief that Jews should be involved in the public square as Jews. In \"There Shall be No Needy\" she writes:\n\nWhen Jews engage in the public discourse as Jews, we should bring Jewish law and principles into the conversation in such a way as to enrich, rather than shut down, the discourse. We should also bring into this dialogue Jews and others who are engaged in public life; the conversation among rabbis, public policy experts, grassroots activists, and Jewish communal professionals should generate a nuanced understanding of how the Jewish community might approach individual issues. \nThis approach precludes quoting a simplified version of Jewish law or text in order to prove a point, or asserting that Jewish law unequivocally demands a certain approach to an issue. Rather, Jewish sources should help us to see various sides of an issue, challenge our assumptions, and help us to formulate a response that takes multiple factors into account. The commitment to living our Judaism publicly should then push us to take public action on these principles, both as individuals and as a community. If we succeed in facilitating this rich conversation, she says, we will create a new kind of Jewish politics in America. Rather than trade sound bites, we will continue the talmudic tradition of dialogue, in which various questioners and commentary engage in an often messy conversation that eventually leads to a fuller understanding of the situation at hand. Jews who now exercise their commitments to public life outside of the Jewish community, she says, will find a place within this community, as they contribute their own wisdom and observations to the conversation. She claims Individual Jews and Jewish institutions will strengthen their commitment to public life, as the question of how to address current issues becomes part of the general Jewish conversation, rather than something separate from it or as an add-on to discussion of Shabbat, kashrut, and other aspects of Jewish practice. We will witness the emergence of a Judaism that views ritual observance, study, and engagement in the world as an integrated whole, rather than as separate and distinct practices. The Jewish community’s deepened involvement in public life will change the face of religious politics in America, as other communities will recognize the Jewish community as an important and authentic religious voice in the public square of America.\nThroughout her work, she integrates Jewish legal and narrative text, social science research, and stories of people she has met and with whom she has worked.\n\nThere Shall Be No Needy: Pursuing Social Justice through Jewish Law and Tradition (Jewish Lights, 2009)\n“Bread, roses, and chutzpah: Jewish women in American social movements,” in The New Jewish Feminism, Jewish Lights, 2008 \n“Health Care in Judaism,” in Jewish Choices, Jewish Voices: Social Justice, Jewish Publication Society, 2008 \n“Living Wage,” in Jewish Choices, Jewish Voices: Money, Jewish Publication Society, 2008 \n“From Pumbedita to Washington: Rabbinic text, urban policy and social reality,” \"\", Summer 2008 \n\"Work, Workers, and the Jewish Owner,\" Teshuvah passed by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, 2008\n“A Jewish Vision for Economic Justice,” in Righteous Indignation, Jewish Lights 2007 \n“The History of Tikkun Olam” in Zeek, July 2007 \n“Reclaiming Talmudic Judaism: An Aggadic Approach to Halakhah,” Conservative Judaism, Winter 2006 \n“Steps toward a Jewish Urban Theology,” Tikkun, September/October 2006\n“Toward a Halakhic Definition of Poverty,” Conservative Judaism, Fall 2004 \n“The defense has become the prosecution: Ezrat HaNashim, a thirteenth-century response to misogyny,” Women in Judaism: A Multidisciplinary Journal, Fall 2003 \n“The Living Wage: A Jewish Approach,” Conservative Judaism, Spring 2003 \n“When the Rabbis Cry: Talmudic Responses to Injustice in the Biblical Text,” The Reconstructionist, Summer 2002 \n“From Sukkah to Ma'akeh: The Halakhah of Housing,” Tikkun, September/October 2000 \n“The Sacrifice of Shelah,” Living Text, Summer 1999 \n“The Yetziah Ceremony: Rethinking the Jewish Coming of Age,” The Reconstructionist, Fall 1998 (with Mik Moore)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "957067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=957067", "title": "King Zhou of Shang", "text": "King Zhou of Shang\n\nKing Zhou (; ) was the pejorative posthumous name given to Di Xin (), the last king of the Shang dynasty of ancient China. He is also called Zhou Xin (; Zhòu Xīn). He may also be referred to by adding \"Shang\" (商 Shāng) in front of any of his names. In Chinese, his name Zhòu (紂) also refers to a horse crupper, the part of a saddle or harness that is most likely to be soiled by the horse. It is not to be confused with the name of the succeeding dynasty which has a different character and pronunciation.\n\nIn the \"Records of the Grand Historian\", Sima Qian wrote that Di Xin, in the early part of his reign, had abilities which surpassed those of the ordinary man, and was quick-witted and quick-tempered. According to legend, he was intelligent enough to win all of his arguments, and he was strong enough to hunt wild beasts with his bare hands. He was the younger brother of Zi Qi (子启) and Zi Yan (子衍) (later rulers of Zhou's vassal state Song) and father of Wu Geng. His father Di Yi had two brothers, Ji Zi and Bi Gan. Di Xin added to the territory of Shang by battling the tribes surrounding it, including the Dongyi to the east.\n\nIn his later years, Di Xin gave himself over to drinking, women and abandoned morals, preferring these to the proper governance of the country, and ignored almost all affairs of state. According to Sima Qian, he even hosted festive orgies where many people engaged in immoral things at the same time with his concubines and created songs with crude (erotic) lyrics and poor rhythm. In legends, he is depicted as having come under the influence of his wicked wife Daji, and committing all manner of evil and cruel deeds with her. In fictionalizations, including the novel \"Fengshen Yanyi\", she was said to be possessed by a malevolent fox spirit.\n\nOne of the most famous forms of entertainment Zhou enjoyed was the \"Alcohol Pool and Meat Forest\" (酒池肉林). A large pool, big enough for several canoes, was constructed on the Palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the seashores. This allowed for the entire pool to be filled with alcohol. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had branches made of roasted meat skewers hanging over the pool. This allowed Zhou and his friends and concubines to drift on canoes in the pool. When they thirsted, they reached down into the pool with their hands and drank the wine. When they hungered, they reached up with their hands to eat the roasted meat. This was considered one of the most famous examples of decadence and corruption of a ruler in Chinese history.\n\nIn order to please Daji, he created the \"Cannon Burning Punishment\" (炮烙之刑). One large hollow bronze cylinder was stuffed with burning charcoal and allowed to burn until red-hot, then prisoners were made to literally hug the cylinder, which resulted in a painful and unsightly death.\n\nZhou and Daji were known to get highly aroused after watching such torture. Victims ranged from ordinary people and prisoners to high government officials, such as Mei Bo.\n\nIn order to fund Zhou's heavy daily expenses, extremely heavy taxes were implemented. The people suffered greatly, and lost all hope for the Shang dynasty. Zhou's brother Wei Zi tried to persuade him to change, but was rebuked. His uncle Bi Gan similarly remonstrated with him, but Di Xin had his heart ripped out so he could see what the heart of a sage looked like. When his other uncle Ji Zi heard this, he went to remonstrate with the kingly nephew and, feigning madness, was imprisoned.\n\nWhen Zhou dynasty's army, led by the famous Jiang Ziya, defeated the Shang dynasty at the Battle of Muye in 1046 BC, Di Xin gathered all his treasures around himself in the Palace, and then set fire to his palace and committed suicide.\n\nThe name \"Zhou\" actually appeared after the death of King Zhou, a posthumous name (although perhaps used furtively by his contemporaries). This name was a representation of his actions, both dishonorable and cold-hearted. King Zhou would go down in history as one of the worst examples of a corrupted king in China.\n\nZhou is mentioned in the Confucian Analects (19 \"子張\"); and also in the Three Character Classic. Zhou is also one of the main subjects of \"Fengshen Yanyi\" and its various derivations in popular media. Thus, Di Xin, also known as Zhou, has served as a (negative) exemplar of Confucian principles (presented as the wicked ruler who justifies regime change according to the Mandate of Heaven), as well as becoming an icon of popular culture. This makes for a biographically interesting figure, but one challenging a clear distinction between history, legend, and philosophical point-making.\n\nIn \"Fengshen Yanyi\", Zhou visited the Goddess Nüwa's temple and offended the Goddess with his lustful comments towards her beauty. In response, Nüwa decided that the Shang dynasty should end and sent her three subordinates to become three beautiful women (including Daji) to bewitch Zhou. Under the influence of these women, Zhou becomes a ruthless king, losing the support of people and triggering his downfall. Until now, nobody knows most of his lifestyle from the reduced amount of artifacts found regarding to him.\n\nAccording to the \"Investiture of the Gods\", Jiang Ziya recognized that King Zhou was a well-versed and well-trained individual that became an incapable ruler only because of having fallen victim to seduction. After his death, Jiang Ziya deified King Zhou as the Tianxi Xing (天喜星 \"Star of Heavenly Happiness\"). As the Tianxi Xing, he had the responsibility of managing the marriage affairs of humans.\n\n"}

The book is 185 pages long and is about what is written about women in the Bible. The book also provides advice about marriage. Elliot gave the book to Valerie, her only child, as a gift on the day of her wedding. Elliot used the phrase \"Let me be a woman\" in response to Christian egalitarianism, which she said was \"not a goal to be desired [because] it is a dehumanizing distortion.\" Her use of the phrase in this manner in 1977 at the National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas evoked considerable applause. The book contains several stories, the first of which telling about how God brought two people together from across the world into a romantic relationship with each other because of their obedience to God's leading. Another story is about the murder of John and Betty Stam, Christian martyrs. A prayer by Betty Stam is also included in the book. The prayer asks that the full will of God be done in her life, irrespective of the cost to herself. In 2003, Andrew Farmer of Crosswalk.com quoted a portion of the book in support of his argument that singleness is a spiritual gift that God gives to single people for the period in which they are single.\n"}
{"id": "9357769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9357769", "title": "List of Roman deities", "text": "List of Roman deities\n\nThe Roman deities most familiar today are those the Romans identified with Greek counterparts (see \"interpretatio graeca\"), integrating Greek myths, iconography, and sometimes religious practices into Roman culture, including Latin literature, Roman art, and religious life as it was experienced throughout the Empire. Many of the Romans' own gods remain obscure, known only by name and sometimes function, through inscriptions and texts that are often fragmentary. This is particularly true of those gods belonging to the archaic religion of the Romans dating back to the era of kings, the so-called \"religion of Numa\", which was perpetuated or revived over the centuries. Some archaic deities have Italic or Etruscan counterparts, as identified both by ancient sources and by modern scholars. Throughout the Empire, the deities of peoples in the provinces were given new theological interpretations in light of functions or attributes they shared with Roman deities.\n\nAn extensive alphabetical list follows a survey of theological groups as constructed by the Romans themselves. For the cult pertaining to deified Roman emperors \"(divi)\", see Imperial cult.\n\n\nA lectisternium is a banquet for the gods, at which they appear as images seated on couches, as if present and participating. In describing the lectisternium of the Twelve Great gods in 217 BC, the Augustan historian Livy places the deities in gender-balanced pairs:\nDivine male-female complements such as these, as well as the anthropomorphic influence of Greek mythology, contributed to a tendency in Latin literature to represent the gods as \"married\" couples or (as in the case of Venus and Mars) lovers.\n\nVarro uses the name \"Dii Consentes\" for twelve deities whose gilded images stood in the forum. These were also placed in six male-female pairs. Although individual names are not listed, they are assumed to be the deities of the lectisternium. A fragment from Ennius, within whose lifetime the lectisternium occurred, lists the same twelve deities by name, though in a different order from that of Livy: \"Juno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jove, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo.\"\n\nThe \"Dii Consentes\" are sometimes seen as the Roman equivalent of the Greek Olympians. The meaning of \"Consentes\" is subject to interpretation, but is usually taken to mean that they form a council or consensus of deities.\n\n\nVarro gives a list of twenty principal gods of Roman religion:\n\nVarro, who was himself of Sabine origin, gives a list of Sabine gods who were adopted by the Romans:\nElsewhere, Varro claims Sol Indiges, who had a sacred grove at Lavinium, as Sabine but at the same time equates him with Apollo. Of those listed, he writes, \"several names have their roots in both languages, as trees that grow on a property line creep into both fields. Saturn, for instance, can be said to have another origin here, and so too Diana.\" Varro makes various claims for Sabine origins throughout his works, some more plausible than others, and his list should not be taken at face value. But the importance of the Sabines in the early cultural formation of Rome is evidenced, for instance, by the bride abduction of the Sabine women by Romulus's men, and in the Sabine ethnicity of Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, to whom are attributed many of Rome's religious and legal institutions. Varro, however, says that the altars to most of these gods were established at Rome by King Tatius as the result of a vow (\"votum\").\n\nEven in invocations, which generally required precise naming, the Romans sometimes spoke of gods as groups or collectives rather than naming them as individuals. Some groups, such as the Camenae and Parcae, were thought of as a limited number of individual deities, even though the number of these might not be given consistently in all periods and all texts. The following groups, however, are numberless collectives.\n\nVarro grouped the gods broadly into three divisions of heaven, earth, and underworld:\n\nMore common is a dualistic contrast between \"superi\" and \"inferi\".\n\nThe \"di indigetes\" were thought by Georg Wissowa to be Rome's indigenous deities, in contrast to the \"di novensides\" or \"novensiles\", \"newcomer gods\". No ancient source, however, poses this dichotomy, which is not generally accepted among scholars of the 21st century. The meaning of the epithet \"indiges\" (singular) has no scholarly consensus, and \"noven\" may mean \"nine\" \"(novem)\" rather than \"new\".\n\nCertain honorifics and titles could be shared by different gods, divine personifications, demi-gods and \"divi\" (deified mortals).\n\n\"Augustus\", \"the elevated or august one\" (masculine form) is an honorific and title awarded to Octavian in recognition of his unique status, the extraordinary range of his powers, and the apparent divine approval of his principate. After his death and deification, the title was awarded to each of his successors. It also became a near ubiquitous title or honour for various minor local deities, including the \"Lares Augusti\" of local communities, and obscure provincial deities such as the North African \"Marazgu Augustus\". This extension of an Imperial honorific to major and minor deities of Rome and her provinces is considered a ground-level feature of Imperial cult.\n\n\"Augusta\", the feminine form, is an honorific and title associated with the development and dissemination of Imperial cult as applied to Roman Empresses, whether living, deceased or deified as \"divae\". The first Augusta was Livia, wife of Octavian, and the title is then shared by various state goddesses including Bona Dea, Ceres, Juno, Minerva, and Ops; by many minor or local goddesses; and by the female personifications of Imperial virtues such as Pax and Victoria.\n\nThe epithet \"Bonus\", \"the Good,\" is used in Imperial ideology with abstract deities such as \"Bona Fortuna\" (\"Good Fortune\"), \"Bona Mens\" (\"Good Thinking\" or \"Sound Mind\"), and \"Bona Spes\" (\"Valid Hope,\" perhaps to be translated as \"Optimism\"). During the Republic, the epithet may be most prominent with Bona Dea, \"the Good Goddess\" whose rites were celebrated by women. Bonus Eventus, \"Good Outcome\", was one of Varro's twelve agricultural deities, and later represented success in general.\n\nFrom the middle Imperial period, the title \"Caelestis\", \"Heavenly\" or \"Celestial\" is attached to several goddesses embodying aspects of a single, supreme Heavenly Goddess. The \"Dea Caelestis\" was identified with the constellation Virgo (\"The Virgin\"), who holds the divine balance of justice. In the \"Metamorphoses\" of Apuleius, the protagonist Lucius prays to the Hellenistic Egyptian goddess Isis as \"Regina Caeli\", \"Queen of Heaven\", who is said to manifest also as Ceres, \"the original nurturing parent\"; Heavenly Venus \"(Venus Caelestis)\"; the \"sister of Phoebus\", that is, Diana or Artemis as she is worshipped at Ephesus; or Proserpina as the triple goddess of the underworld. Juno Caelestis was the Romanised form of the Carthaginian Tanit.\n\nGrammatically, the form \"Caelestis\" can also be a masculine word, but the equivalent function for a male deity is usually expressed through syncretization with Caelus, as in \"Caelus Aeternus Iuppiter,\" \"Jupiter the Eternal Sky.\"\n\n\"Invictus\" (\"Unconquered, Invincible\") was in use as a divine epithet by the early 3rd century BC. In the Imperial period, it expressed the invincibility of deities embraced officially, such as Jupiter, Mars, Hercules, and Sol. On coins, calendars, and other inscriptions, Mercury, Saturn, Silvanus, Fons, Serapis, Sabazius, Apollo, and the Genius are also found as \"Invictus.\" Cicero considers it a normal epithet for Jupiter, in regard to whom it is probably a synonym for \"Omnipotens\". It is also used in the Mithraic mysteries.\n\n\"Mater\" (\"Mother\") was an honorific that respected a goddess's maternal authority and functions, and not necessarily \"motherhood\" per se. Early examples included Terra Mater (Mother Earth) and the Mater Larum (Mother of the Lares). Vesta, a goddess of chastity usually conceived of as a virgin, was honored as \"Mater\". A goddess known as Stata Mater was a compital deity credited with preventing fires in the city.\n\nFrom the middle Imperial era, the reigning Empress becomes \"Mater castrorum et senatus et patriae\", the symbolic Mother of military camps, the senate, and the fatherland. The Gallic and Germanic cavalry \"(auxilia)\" of the Roman Imperial army regularly set up altars to the \"Mothers of the Field\" (\"Campestres\", from \"campus\", \"field,\" with the title \"Matres\" or \"Matronae\"). See also Magna Mater (Great Mother) following.\n\nGods were called \"Pater\" (\"Father\") to signify their preeminence and paternal care, and the filial respect owed to them. \"Pater\" was found as an epithet of Dis, Jupiter, Mars, and Liber, among others.\n\n\"The Great Mother\" was a title given to Cybele in her Roman cult. Some Roman literary sources accord the same title to Maia and other goddesses.\n\nThe \"indigitamenta\" are deities known only or primarily as a name; they may be minor entities, or epithets of major gods. Lists of deities were kept by the College of Pontiffs to assure that the correct names were invoked for public prayers. The books of the Pontiffs are lost, known only through scattered passages in Latin literature. The most extensive lists are provided by the Church Fathers who sought systematically to debunk Roman religion while drawing on the theological works of Varro, also surviving only in quoted or referenced fragments. W.H. Roscher collated the standard modern list of \"indigitamenta\", though other scholars may differ with him on some points.\nFor minor deities known for a single function or by a single name, see:\n\nA number of figures from Greek mythology who were not part of Roman religious practice appear in Latin mythological narratives and as poetic allusions; for these names, see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Voltaire described the play as \"written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect\".\n\nThe story of \"Mahomet\" unfolds during Muhammad's post exile siege of Mecca in 629 AD, when the opposing forces are under a short term truce called to discuss the terms and course of the war.\n\nIn the first act the audience is introduced to a fictional leader of the Meccans, Zopir, an ardent and defiant advocate of free will and liberty who rejects Mahomet. Mahomet is presented through his conversations with his second in command Omar and with his opponent Zopir and with two of Zopir's long lost children (Seid and Palmira) whom, unbeknownst to Zopir, Mahomet had abducted and enslaved in their infancy, fifteen years earlier.\n\nThe now young and beautiful captive Palmira has become the object of Mahomet's desires and jealousy. Having observed a growing affection between Palmira and Seid, Mahomet devises a plan to steer Seid away from her heart by indoctrinating young Seid in religious fanaticism and sending him on a suicide attack to assassinate Zopir in Mecca, an event which he hopes will rid him of both Zopir and Seid and free Palmira's affections for his own conquest. Mahomet invokes divine authority to justify his conduct.\n\nSeid, still respectful of Zopir's nobility of character, hesitates at first about carrying out his assignment, but eventually his fanatical loyalty to Mahomet overtakes him and he slays Zopir. Phanor arrives and reveals to Seid and Palmira to their disbelief that Zopir was their father. Omar arrives and deceptively orders Seid arrested for Zopir's murder, despite knowing that it was Mahomet who had ordered the assassination. Mahomet decides to cover up the whole event so as to not be seen as the deceitful impostor and tyrant that he is.\n\nHaving now uncovered Mahomet's vile deception, Palmira renounces Mahomet's god and commits suicide rather than fall into the clutches of Mahomet.\n\nThe play is a direct assault on the moral character of Muhammad. Omar is a known historical figure who became second caliph; the characters of Seid and Palmira represent Muhammad's adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah and his wife Zaynab bint Jahsh.\n\nPierre Milza posits that it may have been \"the intolerance of the Catholic Church and its crimes done on behalf of the Christ\" that were targeted by the philosopher. Voltaire's own statement about it in a letter in 1742 was quite vague: \"I tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism, led by an impostor, can plunge weak minds.\" It is only in another letter dated from the same year that he explains that this plot is an implicit reference to Jacques Clément, the monk who assassinated Henri III in 1589. However, Milza considers that Islam wasn't the only focus of the plot and that the author's aim when writing the text was to condemn \"the intolerance of the Church and the crimes that have been committed in the name of the Christ\".\n\nNapoleon, during his captivity on Saint Helena, criticised Voltaire's \"Mahomet\", and said Voltaire had made him merely an impostor and a tyrant, without representing him as a \"great man\":\n\n\"Mahomet\" was the subject of deep criticism. 'Voltaire', said the Emperor, 'in the character and conduct of his hero, has departed both from nature and history. He has degraded Mahomet, by making him descend to the lowest intrigues. He has represented a great man, who changed the face of the world, acting like a scoundrel, worthy of the gallows. He has no less absurdly travestied the character of Omar, which he has drawn like that of a cut-throat in a melo-drama.'\n\nIn \"Human, All Too Human\", Friedrich Nietzsche holds up \"Mahomet\" as exemplary of Voltaire's dramatic genius and of the brilliance of classical French theatre as a whole.\n\nIn 2005, a production of the play in Saint-Genis-Pouilly, Ain, France, resulted in demands for cancellation and street disturbances outside the performance itself. Under pressure to cancel the play, the Mayor allowed the play to continue despite \"street disturbances\" from Muslim groups. \"Mayor Bertrand says he is proud his town took a stand by refusing to cave in under pressure to call off the reading. Free speech is modern Europe's 'foundation stone', he says. 'For a long time we have not confirmed our convictions, so lots of people think they can contest them.'\"\n\nThere are four known translations of the play into English:\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Hercle, the Etruscan equivalent of Heracles. On two bronze mirrors, Maris appears in scenes depicting an immersion rite to ensure his immortality, possibly connected to stories about the centaur Mares, the ancestor of the Ausones, who underwent a triple death and resurrection. \n\nSome scholars think he influenced Roman conceptions of the god Mars, but this is not universally held.\n"}

Judge said that he had no memory of the incident.\n\nJudge was born in 1964. His father, Joseph Judge, graduated from Catholic University of America in 1950 and subsequently became a journalist for \"Life\" and then for \"National Geographic\". Judge is the grandson of Joe Judge, a Major League Baseball player for the Washington Senators for the period 1915–1932; he later wrote a book about his grandfather. \n\nJudge grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland. He describes his parents as often inattentive and recounts that he observed his father's heavy drinking of alcohol. Judge started drinking at 14. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, graduating in 1983. Judge was friends with classmate Brett Kavanaugh; both were in the same class there with Maryland State Senate member Richard Madaleno. The period became the subject of scrutiny in 2018 when Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme Court, and allegations were made that in 1982 Judge witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford, then a student from a local girls' school. Judge received his bachelor of arts degree from Catholic University of America (CUA) in 1990.\n\nJudge was a freelance writer in 1989 in the Washington, D.C. area. By 1990 he had become a contributor to \"The Progressive\", \"In These Times\", and \"Sojourners\". Judge briefly taught at Georgetown University but left in the 1990s. In 1997 Judge wrote \"\", a memoir about his youthful alcoholism. \"The New York Times\" review called it a \"naive and earnest\" book. Judge resided in Potomac, Maryland in 1998. Judge was a contributing writer to the \"New York Press,\" an alternative weekly, in 1999.\n\nJudge published \"If It Ain't Got That Swing: The Rebirth of Grown-Up Culture\" in 2000. The book chronicled the author's transition from support of liberalism towards right-wing politics. Judge writes that he was influenced by the writings of Christopher Lasch, especially his work \"The Culture of Narcissism\". By February 2001, Judge's book \"If It Ain't Got That Swing\" had become a bestseller in the United States; The book received largely negative reviews.\n\nJudge's book \"Damn Senators\", about his Major League Baseball player grandfather Joe Judge, was published in 2003 to favorable reviews.\"The Weekly Standard\" wrote of the author's description of 1924: \"Mark Gauvreau Judge, has beautifully captured the excitement and intensity of that season.\" On \"Weekend Edition\", journalist Michael Kranish highlighted Judge's book \"Damn Senators\" among his favorite summer reading picks in 2004. \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that Judge \"so nicely captured\" the \"glory of Washington baseball\" in \"Damn Senators\". \n\nIn \"God and Man at Georgetown Prep\" (2005,) Judge wrote that the faculty at Georgetown Prep contained a multitude of homosexual priests, and heavy drinking and wild parties were rampant among the students. Biographer Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in his 2015 book \"RFK Jr.: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Dark Side of the Dream,\" that Judge's book \"caused quite a storm, especially among the alumni and administration going back decades, because Judge, a conservative Catholic, had alleged that 'alcoholism was rampant' among the 'left-wing Jesuits' and claimed that the school had been a hotbed of 'rampant homosexuality.' Half of the faculty, he asserted, 'was gay.'\" \"Publishers Weekly\" called the book \"a humorous, edgy look at his experiences in three prestigious U.S. Catholic schools.\" \"National Catholic Register\" found Judge's writing to be too vague, commenting, \"There are too many theories and too little space.\" \n\n\"The Wichita Eagle\" recommended a piece by Judge for \"Christianity Today\" in 2006, commenting it evidenced the ability of religious believers to appreciate the good that musical culture can bring to society. Judge's book, \"A Tremor of Bliss: Sex, Catholicism, and Rock 'n' Roll\", was published in 2010. \"First Things\" wrote, \"An insightful history of the rise of contraception in the last century provides the most valuable material in \"A Tremor of Bliss\".\" The publication recommended Judge's work, concluding, \"A Tremor of Bliss is a book well worth reading from an author unafraid of showing some 'attitude.'\" Jeremy Lott of \"The Washington Times\" reviewed the book, concluding, \"Judge proposes a Catholic sexual counterrevolution, though he doesn't want to call it that. What he clearly does want is U.S. Catholic education to play a vital role in countering the current almost-anything-goes culture.\" In addition to writing books, Judge has contributed to \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Weekly Standard\", and \"First Things\".\n\nRegarding LGBT people, Judge wrote in \"The Daily Caller\", \"We simply are not allowed to talk about certain things at the risk of our jobs and reputations. One is human anatomy, another is the problem of promiscuity in the gay community.\" Judge wrote a piece titled \"Hard Case Crime: the Beauty of Male Passion\" on \"Splice Today\" lamenting that \"today’s social justice warriors don’t like a sexy damsel in distress\". Judge elaborated that \"Of course ... no means no and yes means yes. But there’s also that ambiguous middle ground, where the woman seems interested and indicates, whether verbally or not, that the man needs to prove himself to her. And if that man is any kind of man, he’ll allow himself to feel the awesome power, the wonderful beauty, of uncontrollable male passion.\"\n\nIn 2018, Judge was implicated in an alleged sexual assault that surfaced after his high school classmate Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States. On September 27, Christine Blasey Ford testified under oath before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary that when all three were in high school at a party in 1982, Judge and Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom where Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothing against her will while Judge watched and laughed. Judge told \"The New Yorker\" that he had \"no recollection\" of the alleged incident. In a follow-up interview with \"The Weekly Standard\", Judge called the allegations \"just absolutely nuts. I never saw Brett act that way.\" Asked if there was \"rough-housing\" with female peers that the \"Weekly Standard\" interviewer suggested \"might have been interpreted differently by parties involved\", Judge said he only recollected it taking place among the male students of the all-boys school: \"I don't remember any of that stuff going on with girls.\" He subsequently sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying, \"I have no memory of this alleged incident.\" Judge also stated he did not wish to speak publicly about the incident. Following the announcement of the allegations, Judge temporarily moved to a beach house in Bethany Beach, Delaware under recommendation of his lawyer. He was found a week later by a \"Washington Post\" reporter outside the home, along with his car, which was filled with his belongings.\n\nMultiple U.S. senators acquired copies of Judge's books about his time with Kavanaugh at Georgetown Preparatory School, to prepare for questioning Kavanaugh and Ford before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. In a subsequent \"New Yorker\" article, Elizabeth Rasor, who was once in a relationship with Judge for three years, stated that \"Mark told me a very different story.\" She said he told her of taking turns having sex with drunk women at Georgetown Prep. Another woman also disputed Judge's account of the social scene at the time, sending a letter to Ford's lawyers saying that she had witnessed boys at parties, that included Georgetown Prep students, engaging in sexual misconduct.\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Senator Richard Blumenthal made a motion before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary to subpoena Judge to testify about Kavanaugh. Blumenthal said before calling his motion, \"He has never been questioned by any member of our committee. He has never submitted a detailed account of what he knows and so I move ... that we subpoena Mark Judge.\" Blumenthal noted, \"The third person in the room was Mark Judge, who was never questioned by the FBI or interviewed by the committee.\" Republicans defeated the motion for a subpoena on a party-line vote. US Congressman Ted Lieu of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and Congressman Elijah Cummings of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform stated their intentions to subpoena Judge and call him for testimony before the US Congress, after the 2018 US midterm elections. After Republican US Senator Jeff Flake called for an FBI investigation, Judge released a statement that he would cooperate with all law enforcement authorities regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh. After a request from Flake, followed by a request from the US Senate Judiciary Committee, President Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46295878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46295878", "title": "May God have mercy upon your soul", "text": "May God have mercy upon your soul\n\n\"May God have mercy upon your soul\" or \"may God have mercy on your soul\" is a phrase used within courts in various legal systems by judges pronouncing a sentence of death upon a person found guilty of a crime that requires a death sentence. The phrase originated in beth din courts in the Kingdom of Israel as a way to attribute God as the highest authority in law. The usage of the phrase later spread to England and Wales' legal system and from there to usage throughout the colonies of the British Empire whenever a death sentence was passed.\n\nDepending on where it is used, the phrase has had different emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer for the soul of the condemned. However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.\n\nThe phrase is used by the presiding judge pronouncing the sentence of death after putting on a black cap and black gloves. In England, the black gloves were a deliberate contrast with the white gloves normally worn at the end of an Assize sitting, which indicated there had been no death sentence passed during the Assize. The wording of the traditional phrase has changed over time. In England, the wording in the 18th century was \"and the Lord have mercy upon thy soul\". This later developed into \"may God have mercy upon your soul\", which was used as the traditional closing sentence by judges passing the death sentence in England and Wales, Canada and Australia. The phrase is treated as a prayer and would traditionally be followed by \"amen\". Newspaper reports would cite the usage of the phrase as \"the usual words had been said\".\n\nIn the 18th century, the common wording of the phrase in England was \"the law is that thou shalt return to the place whence thou camest and from thence to a place of execution where thou shalt hang by the neck 'til the body be dead. Dead. Dead. And the Lord have mercy upon thy soul\". This phrase later developed over time until the 1940s when the phrase in Dominions of the British Empire was: \n\nThe phrase is likely to have originated in the Kingdom of Israel following the Law of Moses in beth din courts as a way of giving credence to the authority of God as the author of all law. It is likely to have come from Deuteronomy 16:18 where it stated: \"Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment\". This gave rise to the theory that judges had been given authority from God to exercise judgment on matters of the law and would use the phrase to attribute this fact to God. The phrase continued to be used in courts, passing from Jewish to Christian context as a way to continue to affirm God as the highest authority in law. Clarence Darrow, Oliver O'Donovan and the Chicago Law Journal have stated that the phrase's continual usage may have come about as a result of judges feeling that while they could pass a sentence of death upon a person, they personally did not have the authority to destroy souls and that only God had the authority to do that. As a result, some judges would cross their fingers whenever they said the phrase as a result of concern for the criminal's soul as they said it as a prayer. While the phrase is intended to be said by judges with conviction, it is also said because of legal tradition and not necessarily due to belief in its meaning. During the 17th century in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Puritan majority of judges at the time did not believe that stating \"may God have mercy on your soul\" had any meaning unless the accused had made a confession of the crime in open court. They, and other Puritan office holders, would also regularly press the condemned up until the point of execution to make a confession of the crime they had been convicted of to ensure that the phrase satisfactorily had meaning according to their views.\n\nIn the United States, following independence from Great Britain, the phrase was not commonly used. However, when the first death sentence was passed in Taos County, New Mexico, the judge used the phrase but immediately followed it with a statement that the court would not be responsible for asking \"an all wise providence\" to do something the jury could not do due to the American principle of separation of church and state. In the 19th century, due to American law moving away from moral judgments based on Christian principles towards the principle of a judgment that was \"beyond reasonable doubt\", the phrases \"not having the fear of God before your eyes\" and \"may God have mercy upon your soul\" were the very few remainders within the American court system of the British colonial morality-based trials. Despite this, \"may God have mercy on your soul\" has been used as a closing statement in modern times by American judges when passing a sentence of death. Sometimes as it is mandated by state law, other times as a result of legal tradition. For example, in 2011, it was used when a judge sentenced a murderer to death in South Dakota. A version of the phrase was used by a Florida judge when Aileen Wuornos was sentenced to death, the judge in this case stated \"and may God have mercy on your corpse\".\n\nThe phrase has been used in a number of books and films. The phrase was used in the film \"Let Him Have It\" by the character of Lord Goddard, however \"may The Lord have mercy upon your soul\" was used instead of the regular phrase. It was also written in Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\". The phrase \"may God have mercy on your soul\" was also used in the 1995 film, \"Billy Madison\" as part of an insult. In the classic \"The Green Mile\", guards Paul Edgecomb, Brutus Howell and Percy Wetmore use this phrase before they conduct an execution.\n"}

In English use it is a title before the name of a French prelate, a member of a royal family or other dignitary. \n\nMonsignor is both a title and an honorific in the Roman Catholic Church. In francophone countries, it is rendered \"Monseigneur\", and this spelling is also commonly encountered in Canadian English practice. \n\nIn France, monsignori are not usually addressed as \"monseigneur\", but by the more common term \"monsieur l'abbé\", as are priests. The plural form is \"Messeigneurs\".\n\nPrior to the overthrow of the French monarchy in 1792, Monseigneur equated to His Royal Highness or His Serene Highness when used as part of the title of a royal prince, as in \"Monseigneur le comte de Provence\". King Louis XIV promoted the use of \"Monseigneur\" without the title as a style for the dauphin de France but this use lapsed in the 18th century. French royalists commonly style the current pretender \"Monseigneur\". In his book \"A Tale of Two Cities\" Charles Dickens uses this honorific as a collective noun denoting the great nobility as a class.\n\nThis form of formal address is currently still in use at courts in Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, and France. Royal princes are formally addressed in the old French style. By tradition a Belgian or Luxembourgian prince is addressed as \"Monseigneur\" rather than \"Your Royal Highness\". The word \"Monseigneur\" is used when addressing a prince in any of Belgium's official languages, there being no Dutch or German equivalent. In France, it is also sometimes used when addressing pretenders to the French throne Henri d'Orléans, Count of Paris and Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, and when addressing Albert II, Sovereign of Monaco (French style always is used in Monaco). The spouse of the prince is addressed as Madame.\n"}
{"id": "19101165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19101165", "title": "Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching", "text": "Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has often held mortification of the flesh (literally, \"putting the flesh to death\"), as a worthy spiritual discipline. The practice is rooted in the Bible: in the asceticism of the Old and New Testament saints, and in its theology, such as the remark by Saint Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, where he states: \"If you live a life of nature, you are marked out for death; if you mortify the ways of nature through the power of the Spirit, you will have life.\" (Romans 8:13, DRC). It is intimately connected with Christ's complete sacrifice of himself on the Cross: \"those who belong to Christ have crucified nature, with all its passions, all its impulses\" (Gal 5:24, DRC). Christ himself enjoined his disciples to mortify themselves when he said: \"If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me\" (Matt 16:24, DRC). According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \"[t]he way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes: ‘He who climbs never stops going from beginning to beginning, through beginnings that have no end. He never stops desiring what he already knows.’\". The purpose of mortification is to train \"the soul to virtuous and holy living\" (The Catholic Encyclopedia, article on Mortification). It achieves this through conforming ones passions to reason and faith. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, internal mortification, such as the struggle against pride and self-love, is essential, but external mortification, such as fasting can also be good if they conform with a spirit of internal mortification.\n\nThroughout the Old Testament, persons fast and wear sackcloth to appease God. Furthermore, the nazirites were persons who took special vows to, among other things, abstain from alcohol.\n\nIn the New Testament, Saint John the Baptist is the most clear example of a person practising corporal mortification. According to Mark 1:6, \"John was clothed with a garment of camel’s hair, and had a leather girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey\" (DRC).\n\nThe rule of St. Augustine of Hippo says: \"Subdue your flesh by fasting from meat and drink, so far as your health permits. But if anyone is not able to fast, at least let him take no food out of meal time, unless he is sick.\"\n\nSt. Dominic Loricatus (995–1060) is said to have performed \"One Hundred Years Penance\" by chanting 20 psalters accompanied by 300,000 lashes over six days.\n\nLater, Saint Francis of Assisi, who is said to have received the \"stigmata\", painful wounds like those of Jesus Christ, is said to have asked pardon to his body, whom he called Brother Ass, for the severe self-afflicted penances he has done: vigils, fasts, frequent flagellations and the use of a hairshirt.\n\nA Doctor of the Church, St. Catherine of Siena (died 1380), was a tertiary Dominican who lived at home rather than in a convent, and who practiced austerities which a prioress would probably not have permitted. She is notable for fasting and subsisting for long periods of time on nothing but the Blessed Sacrament. St. Catherine of Siena wore sackcloth and scourged herself three times daily in imitation of St. Dominic.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Saint Thomas More, the Lord Chancellor of England, wore a hairshirt, deliberately mortifying his body. He also used the 'discipline.'\n\nSaint Ignatius of Loyola while in Manresa in 1522 is known to have practiced severe mortifications. In the Litany prayers to Saint Ignatius he is praised as being “constant in the practice of corporal penance.” He was in the habit of wearing a cord tied below the knee.\n\nSt. Teresa of Ávila, a Doctor of the Church, undertook severe mortification once it was suggested by friends that her supernatural ecstasies were of diabolical origin. She continued until Francis Borgia reassured her. She believed she was goaded by angels and had a passion to conform her life to the sufferings of Jesus, with a motto associated with her: \"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\"\nSt. Marguerite Marie Alacoque (22 July 1647 October-17 October 1690), the promoter of the devotion to the Sacred Heart, practised in secret severe corporal mortification after her First Communion at the age of nine, until becoming paralyzed, which confined her to bed for four years. Having been cured of her paralysis by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, she changed her name to Marie (French: Mary) and vowed to devote her life to the service of Mary.\n\nSt. Junípero Serra (November 24, 1713 – August 28, 1784) was a Franciscan friar who founded the mission chain in Alta California. A statue of Fr. Junipero Serra rests in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building, representing the state of California. He was known for his love for mortification, self-denial and absolute trust in God.\n\nA notable saint in the nineteenth century was St. Jean Vianney who converted hundreds of people in laicist France. Pope John XXIII said of him: \"You cannot begin to speak of St. John Mary Vianney without automatically calling to mind the picture of a priest who was outstanding in a unique way in voluntary affliction of his body; his only motives were the love of God and the desire for the salvation of the souls of his neighbors, and this led him to abstain almost completely from food and from sleep, to carry out the harshest kinds of penances, and to deny himself with great strength of soul...[T]his way of life is particularly successful in bringing many men who have been drawn away by the allurement of error and vice back to the path of good living.\"\n\nDuring the later part of the nineteenth century, Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus, another Doctor of the Church, at three years of age was described by her mother: \"Even Thérèse is anxious to practice mortification.” Thérèse later wrote: \"My God, I will not be a saint by halves. I am not afraid of suffering for Thee.” The \"Little Flower\", famous for her \"little way\" and love of God, fasted and used the \"discipline\" vigorously, \"scourging herself with all the strength and speed of which she was capable, smiling at the crucifix through the tears which bedewed her eyelashes\", according to one of her biographers.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the child seers of Fatima said they had initially seen an angel, who said: \"In every way you can offer sacrifice to God in reparation for the sins by which He is offended, and in supplication for sinners. In this way you will bring peace to our country, for I am its guardian angel, the Angel of Portugal. Above all, \"bear and accept with patience the sufferings God will send you\".\" Lucia Santos later reported that the idea of making sacrifices was repeated several times by the Virgin Mary and that she had shown them a vision of hell which prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lucia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Lucia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.\n\nAt the latter half of the twentieth century, Saint Josemaría Escrivá practiced self-flagellation and used the cilice, a modern-day version of the hairshirt. Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, a saint who received the \"stigmata\" wrote in one of his letters: \"Let us now consider what we must do to ensure that the Holy Spirit may dwell in our souls. It can all be summed up in mortification of the flesh with its vices and concupiscences, and in guarding against a selfish spirit... The mortification must be constant and steady, not intermittent, and it must last for one's whole life. Moreover, the perfect Christian must not be satisfied with a kind of mortification which merely appears to be severe. He must make sure that it hurts.\" Like St. Josemaria, Padre Pio and Mother Teresa of Calcutta used the cilice and discipline regularly as means of doing penance.\n\nSome branches of Christianity have also institutionalized the practice of self-inflicted penance and corporal mortification through their mandate on fasting and abstinence for specific days of the year. Christian communities in some parts of the world still practice processions of public flagellation during Lent and Holy Week.\n\nRecent theology affirms the practice of mortification. The catechism of the Catholic Church states: “The way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes” (n. 2015).\n\n\"Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, \"sackcloth and ashes,\" fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; however, \"interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures and works of penance.\"\" (\"CCC\" 1430)\n\nPope John XXIII, who convened the Second Vatican Council, taught in \"Paenitentiam Agere,\"\nan encyclical he wrote on July 1, 1962:\n\nPope Paul VI also stated:\n\nTheologians also state that the Son, the second person of the Trinity, united himself, as a person (through the hypostatic union), to everything human (except sin), including pain.\n\nCatholics believe that God, who in their view by his divine nature cannot change, has united with changing human nature, and therefore with human pain. The \"I\" of the Second Person suffers and feels pain. He is one with pain through Jesus Christ. Thus Christ's experience of pain (like all the human acts of Christ like sleeping, crying, speaking) whose subject is the divine Person is an \"infinite act\". This is based on the classic dictum that the acts belong to the Person (\"actiones sunt suppositorum\"). It is the Person who acts: It is God who walks, God who talks, God who is killed, and God who is in pain. Thus a Christian who is united to Jesus Christ through pain is one with his infinite act of saving the world.\n\nThis also goes together with another dictum in theology: whatever is not united (to the Divine Person) is not saved. Thus, his intellect, his will, his feelings, are all united with the Person, and are all sanctified and redeemed, including pain. Pain is therefore a sanctified and redeeming human experience.\n\nJohn Paul II, who according to a recently released book on his sainthood cause practiced self-flagellation and fasting before important events, wrote an entire apostolic letter on the topic of suffering, specifically the salvific meaning of suffering: \"Salvifici Doloris\". It is considered a major contribution to the theology of pain and suffering.\n\nHe wrote this after suffering from a bullet wound due to the assassination attempt of Ali Agca. Six weeks after meeting his attacker, he wrote about suffering in Christianity.\n\"Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: \"If any man would come after me... let him take up his cross daily, and \"before his disciples he placed demands of a moral nature that can only be fulfilled on condition that they should \"deny themselves\"\". The way that leads to the Kingdom of heaven is \"hard and narrow\", and Christ contrasts it to the \"wide and easy\" way that \"leads to destruction.\"\n\nChrist does not explain in the abstract the reasons for suffering, but he states: \"Follow me!\". Come! \"Take part through your suffering in this work of saving the world, a salvation achieved through my suffering!\" Through my Cross.\n\nGradually, as the individual takes up his cross, spiritually uniting himself to the Cross of Christ, the salvific meaning of suffering is revealed before him. ...It is then that man finds in his suffering interior peace and even spiritual joy.\"\n\nSaint Paul speaks of joy in suffering in Colossians: \"I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake\". He had found a source of joy in overcoming the sense of the uselessness of suffering.\n\nHe states that it is suffering, more than anything else, which clears the way for the grace which transforms human souls. \"Suffering, more than anything else, makes present in the history of humanity the powers of the Redemption\".\n\nSt. Louis de Montfort's prayer to the Virgin Mary includes, in his request to become more like Mary, the clauses \"to suffer joyfully without human consolation; to die continually to myself without respite\". Louis de Montfort was a strong advocate of finding joy and holiness in suffering. Those who have completed his 33-day Total Consecration to Jesus to Mary often wear a metal chain around their wrist or ankle. While this is not necessarily mortification, it represents a constant reminder of one's voluntary spiritual enslavement to Jesus through Mary, and the desire to accept suffering as a gift and offer it to God.\n\nThe Desert Fathers emphasize that mortification is a means, not an end. They generally recommended prudence when practising mortification, with severe mortifications done only under the guidance of an experienced spiritual director. Consequently, practising mortification for physical pleasure is seen as a sin. Likewise, mortification for reasons of scrupulosity (which is similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder) is considered very harmful: a contemporary example is fasting due to anorexia nervosa. Catholic moral theologians recommend that the scrupulous not practice mortification, avoid persons and materials of an ascetical nature, and receive frequent spiritual direction and psychological help.\nNot all forms of self-mortification are approved of by the Catholic Church. Practices such as the nonlethal crucifixions performed on Good Friday in the Philippines are generally frowned upon by Catholic officials. Participants imitate various parts of the Passion of Christ, including his crucifixion. The spectacle draws a large amount of tourism every year.\n\n"}

Muslims use the term prominently before or after referring to them as a sign of respect. The term \"Mothers of the Believers\" is applied to them which is derived from : \"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are (as) their mothers.\"\n\nMuhammad was monogamous for 25 years. After his first wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid died, he proceeded to marry the wives listed below, and most of them were widows. Muhammad's life is traditionally delineated as two epochs: pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca, a city in western Arabia, from the year 570 to 622, and post-hijra in Medina, from 622 until his death in 632. All but two of his marriages were contracted after the Hijra (migration to Medina). Of Muhammad's thirteen wives, at least two, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, were actually wives from his servants, however, there is debate among Muslims as to whether these two became his wives.\n\nIn Arabian culture, marriage was contracted in accordance with the larger needs of the tribe and was based on the need to form alliances within the tribe and with other tribes. Virginity at the time of marriage was emphasized as a tribal honor. Watt states that all of Muhammad's marriages had the political aspect of strengthening friendly relationships and were based on the Arabian custom. Esposito points out that some of Muhammad's marriages were aimed at providing a livelihood for widows. He noted that remarriage was difficult for widows in a society that emphasized virgin marriages. Francis Edward Peters says that it is hard to make generalizations about Muhammad's marriages: many of them were political, some compassionate, and some perhaps affairs of the heart. Muhammad's first marriage lasted 25 years.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAccording to Islamic belief, the main objectives of Muhammad's marriages can be divided into four.\n\n\nMuhammad's first marriage was at the age of 25 to the 40-year-old Khadijah. He was married to one woman until the age of 50, after which he is believed to have had multiple wives for the four reasons explained above. With the exception of Aisha, Muhammad only married widows and divorced women or captives.\n\nAt the age of 25, Muhammad wed his wealthy employer, the 40-year-old merchant Khadija. In another narration, it is reported that she was only 28 years old, given that she had four children with Muhammad after their marriage. This marriage, his first, would be both happy and monogamous; Muhammad would rely on Khadija in many ways, until her death 25 years later. They had two sons, Qasim and Abd-Allah (nicknamed \"al-Ṭāhir\" and \"al-Ṭayyib\" respectively), both died young, and four daughters—Zaynab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah. Shia scholars dispute the paternity of Khadija's daughters, as they view the first three of them as the daughters from previous marriages and only Fatimah as the daughter of Muhammad and Khadija. During their marriage, Khadija purchased the slave Zayd ibn Harithah, then adopted the young man as her son at Muhammad's request. According to Shia scholars Khadija was a virgin when she married Muhammad and she was not a widow. Abu Talib and Khadija passed away in the same year after living in Shaeb e Abi Talib with Muhammad. He declared the year as Aam ul Huzn (year of sorrow).\n\nBefore he left for Medina, it was suggested by Khawlah bint Hakim that he marry Sawda bint Zamʿa, who had suffered many hardships after she became a Muslim. Prior to that, Sawda was married to a paternal cousin of hers named As-Sakran bin ‘Amr, and had five or six sons from her previous marriage. There are disagreements in Muslim tradition whether Muhammad first married Sawda or Aisha. In one account, he married Sawda in Shawwal, when Sawda was about 55 years old, in the tenth year of Prophethood, after the death of Khadija. At about the same period, Aisha was betrothed to him. As Sawda got older, and some time after Muhammad's marriage to Umm Salama, some sources claim that Muhammad wished to divorce Sawda. Still other traditions maintain that Muhammad did not intend to divorce her, but only Sawda feared or thought that he would. As a compromise, or because of her old age, Sawda offered to give her turn of Muhammad's conjugal visits to Aisha, stating that she \"was old, and cared not for men; her only desire was to rise on the Day of Judgment as one of his wives\". While some Muslim historians cite this story as a reason of revelation for , others like Rashid Rida dispute this whole account as \"poorly supported\", or mursal.\n\nAisha was the daughter of Muhammad's close friend Abu Bakr. She was initially betrothed to Jubayr ibn Mut'im, a Muslim whose father, though pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. When Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that Muhammad marry Aisha after the death of Muhammad's first wife (Khadija), the previous agreement regarding marriage of Aisha with ibn Mut'im was put aside by common consent.\n\nThe majority of traditional sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina. This timeline has been challenged by a number of scholars in modern times. Both Aisha and Sawda, his two wives, were given apartments adjoined to the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi mosque.\n\nPer Sunni belief, Aisha was extremely scholarly and inquisitive. Her contribution to the spread of Muhammad's message was extraordinary, and she served the Muslim community for 44 years after his death. She is also known for narrating 2210 hadith, not just on matters related to Muhammad's private life, but also on topics such as inheritance, pilgrimage, eschatology, among other subjects. She was highly regarded for her intellect and knowledge in various fields, including poetry and medicine, which received plenty of praise by early luminaries, such as the historian Al-Zuhri and her student Urwa ibn al-Zubayr.\n\nDuring the Muslim war with Mecca, many men were killed leaving behind widows and orphans. Hafsa bint Umar, daughter of Umar (‘Umar bin Al-Khattab), was widowed at battle of Badr when her husband Khunais ibn Hudhaifa was killed in action. Muhammad married her in 3 A.H./625 C.E. Zaynab bint Khuzayma was also widowed at the battle of Badr. She was the wife of 'Ubaydah b. al-Hārith, a faithful Muslim and from the tribe of al-Muttalib, for which Muhammad had special responsibility. When her husband died, Muhammad aiming to provide for her, married her in 4 A.H. She was nicknamed Umm Al-Masakeen (roughly translates as the mother of the poor), because of her kindness and charity.\n\nClose to Aisha's age, the two younger wives Hafsa and Zaynab were welcomed into the household. Sawda, who was much older, extended her motherly benevolence to the younger women. Aisha and Hafsa had a lasting relationship. As for Zaynab, however, she became ill and died less than eight months after her marriage.\n\nThe death of Zaynab coincided with that of Abu Salamah, a devout Muslim, as a result of his wounds from the Battle of Uhud. Abu Salamah's widow, Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya also a devoted Muslim, had none but her young children. Her manless plight reportedly saddened the Muslims, and after her \"iddah\" some Muslims proposed marriage to her; but she declined. When Muhammad proposed her marriage, she was reluctant for three reasons: she claimed to suffer from jealousy and pointed out the prospect of an unsuccessful marriage, her old age, and her young family that needed support. But Muhammad replied that he would pray to God to free her from jealousy, that he too was of old age, and that her family was like his family. She married Muhammad.\n\nIn 626, Rayhana bint Zayd, was a Jewish woman enslaved along with others after the defeat of the Banu Qurayza tribe. Her relationship with Muhammed is disputed. The sources regarding her status differ as to whether she was a concubine or whether she eventually married him.\n\nAfter Muhammad's final battle against his Meccan enemies, he diverted his attention to stopping the Banu Mustaliq's raid on Medina. During this skirmish, Medinan dissidents, begrudging Muhammad's influence, attempted to attack him in the more sensitive areas of his life, including his marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, and an incident in which Aisha left her camp to search for her lost necklace, and returned with a Companion of Muhammad.\n\nZaynab bint Jahsh was Muhammad's cousin, the daughter of one of his father's sisters. In Medina Muhammad arranged the widowed Zaynab's marriage to his adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. Caesar E. Farah states that Muhammad was determined to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted. Zaynab disapproved of the marriage, and her brothers rejected it, because according to Ibn Sa'd, she was of aristocratic lineage and Zayd was a former slave. Watt states that it is not clear why Zaynab was unwilling to marry Zayd as Muhammad esteemed him highly. He postulates that Zaynab, being an ambitious woman, was already hoping to marry Muhammad; or that she might have wanted to marry someone of whom Muhammad disapproved for political reasons. According to Maududi, after the Qur'anic verse was revealed, Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.\n\nZaynab's marriage was unharmonious. According to Watt, it is almost certain that she was working for marriage with Muhammad before the end of 626. \"Zaynab had dressed in haste when she was told 'the Messenger of God is at the door.' She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: 'Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!'\" Zaynab told Zayd about this, and he offered to divorce her, but Muhammad told him to keep her. The story laid much stress on Zaynab's perceived beauty. Nomani considers this story to be a rumor. Watt doubts the accuracy of this portion of the narrative, since it does not occur in the earliest source. He thinks that even if there is a basis of fact underlying the narrative, it would have been subject to exaggeration in the course of transmission as the later Muslims liked to maintain that there was no celibacy and monkery in Islam. Rodinson disagrees with Watt arguing that the story is stressed in the traditional texts and that it would not have aroused any adverse comment or criticism.\n\nMuhammad, fearing public opinion, was initially reluctant to marry Zaynab. The marriage would seem incestuous to their contemporaries because she was the former wife of his adopted son, and adopted sons were considered the same as biological sons. According to Watt, this \"conception of incest was bound up with old practices belonging to a lower, communalistic level of familial institutions where a child's paternity was not definitely known; and this lower level was in process being eliminated by Islam.\" Muhammad's decision to marry Zaynab was an attempt to break the hold of pre-Islamic ideas over men's conduct in society. The Qur'an, however, indicated that this marriage was a duty imposed upon him by God. It implied that treating adopted sons as real sons was objectionable and that there should now be a complete break with the past. Thus Muhammad, confident that he was strong enough to face public opinion, proceeded to reject these taboos. When Zaynab's waiting period was complete, Muhammad married her. An influential faction in Medina, called \"Hypocrites\" in the Islamic tradition, did indeed criticize the marriage as incestuous. Attempting to divide the Muslim community, they spread rumors as part of a strategy of attacking Muhammad through his wives. According to Ibn Kathir, the relevant Qur'anic verses were a \"divine rejection\" of the Hypocrites' objections. According to Rodinson, doubters argued the verses were in exact conflict with social taboos and favored Muhammad too much. The delivery of these verses, thus, did not end the dissent.\n\nAisha had accompanied Muhammad on his skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq. On the way back, Aisha lost her necklace which she had borrowed from her sister Asma Bint Abu Bakr (a treasured possession), and Muhammad required the army to stop so that it could be found. The necklace was found, but during the same journey, Aisha lost it again. This time, she quietly slipped out in search for it, but by the time she recovered it, the caravan had moved on. She was eventually taken home by Safw'an bin Mu'attal.\n\nRumors spread that something untoward had occurred although there were no witnesses to this. Disputes arose, and the community was split into factions. Meanwhile, Aisha had been ill, and unaware of the stories. At first, Muhammad himself was unsure of what to believe, but eventually trusted Aisha's protestations of innocence. Eventually, verses of surah Nur were revealed, establishing her innocence, and condemning the slanders and the libel. Although the episode was uneasy for both Muhammad and Aisha, in the end, it reinforced their mutual love and trust.\n\nAccording to shia (Allameh Tabataba'), revealing of Nur's verses belongs to Maria al-Qibtiyya, another wife of Muhammad. Also the accuracy of incident free from which wife of Muhammad, isn't confirmed by shia scholar (Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi), because the Ismah of Muhammad is violated.\n\nOne of the captives from the skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq was Juwayriyya bint al-Harith, who was the daughter of the tribe's chieftain. Her husband, Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among the booty of Muhammad's companion Thabit b. Qays b. Al-Shammas. Upon being enslaved, Juwayriyya went to Muhammad requesting that she - as the daughter of the lord of the Mustaliq - be released, however the Prophet refused. Meanwhile, her father approached Muhammad with ransom to secure her release, but Muhammed still refused to release her. Muhammad then offered to marry her, and she accepted. When it became known that tribes persons of Mustaliq were kinsmen of the prophet of Islam through marriage, the Muslims began releasing their captives. Thus, Muhammad's marriage resulted in the freedom of nearly one hundred families whom he had recently enslaved.\n\nSafiyya bint Huyayy was a noblewoman, the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir, who was killed at the Battle of the Trench. She had been married first to the poet Sallam ibn Mishkam, who had divorced her, and second to Kenana ibn al-Rabi, a commander. In 628, at the Battle of Khaybar, Banu Nadir was defeated, her husband was executed and she was taken as a prisoner. Muhammad freed her from her captor Dihya and proposed marriage, which Safiyya accepted. According to Martin Lings, Muhammad had given Safiyyah the choice of returning to the defeated Banu Nadir, or becoming Muslim and marrying him, and Safiyyah opted for the latter choice.\n\nAccording to a hadith, Muhammad's contemporaries believed that due to Safiyya's high status, it was only befitting that she be manumitted and married to Muhammad. Modern scholars believe that Muhammad married Safiyya as part of reconciliation with the Jewish tribe and as a gesture of goodwill. John L. Esposito states that the marriage may have been political or to cement alliances. Haykal opines that Muhammad's manumission of and marriage to Safiyaa was partly in order to alleviate her tragedy and partly to preserve their dignity, and compares these actions to previous conquerors who married the daughters and wives of the kings whom they had defeated. According to some, by marrying Safiyyah, Muhammad aimed at ending the enmity and hostility between Jews and Islam.\n\nMuhammad convinced Safiyya to convert to Islam. According to Al-Bayhaqi, Safiyyah was initially angry at Muhammad as both her father and husband had been killed. Muhammad explained \"Your father charged the Arabs against me and committed heinous acts.\" Eventually, Safiyyah got rid of her bitterness against Muhammad. According to Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Safiyya came to appreciate the love and honor Muhammad gave her, and said, \"I have never seen a good-natured person as the Messenger of Allah\". Safiyyah remained loyal to Muhammad until he died.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Safiyya was beautiful, patient, intelligent, learned and gentle, and she respected Muhammad as \"Allah's Messenger\". Muslim scholars state she had many good moral qualities. She is described as a humble worshiper and a pious believer. Ibn Kathir said, \"she was one of the best women in her worship, piousness, ascetism, devoutness, and charity\". According to Ibn Sa'd, Safiyyah was very charitable and generous. She used to give out and spend whatever she had; she gave away a house that she had when she was still alive.\n\nUpon entering Muhammad's household, Safiyya became friends with Aisha and Hafsa. Also, she offered gifts to Fatima. She gave some of Muhammad's other wives gifts from her jewels that she brought with her from Khaybar. However, some of Muhammad's other wives spoke ill of Safiyya's Jewish descent. Muhammad intervened, pointing out to everyone that Safiyya's \"husband is Muhammad, father is Aaron, and uncle is Moses\", a reference to revered prophets.\n\nMuhammad once went to hajj with all his wives. On the way Safiyya's camel knelt down, as it was the weakest in the caravan, and she started to weep. Muhammad came to her and wiped her tears with his dress and hands, but the more he asked her not to cry, the more she went on weeping. When Muhammad was terminally ill, Safiyya was profoundly upset. She said to him \"I wish it was I who was suffering instead of you.\"\n\nIn the same year, Muhammad signed a peace treaty with his Meccan enemies, the Quraysh effectively ending the state of war between the two parties. He soon married the daughter of the Quraysh leader, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, aimed at further reconciling his opponents. He sent a proposal for marriage to Ramla bint Abi Sufyan, who, was in Abyssinia at the time when he learned her husband had died. She had previously converted to Islam (in Mecca) against her father's will. After her migration to Abyssinia her husband had converted to Christianity. Muhammad dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to the Negus (king), asking him for Umm Habiba’s hand — that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.\n\nMaria al-Qibtiyya was an Egyptian Coptic Christian, sent as a gift to Muhammad from Muqawqis, a Byzantine official. and bore him a son Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, who died in infancy.\n\nAs part of the treaty of Hudaybiyah, Muhammad visited Mecca for the lesser pilgrimage. There Maymuna bint al-Harith proposed marriage to him. Muhammad accepted, and thus married Maymuna, the sister-in-law of Abbas, a longtime ally of his. By marrying her, Muhammad also established kinship ties with the banu Makhzum, his previous opponents. As the Meccans did not allow him to stay any longer, Muhammad left the city, taking Maymuna with him. Her original name was \"Barra\" but the Prophet called her \"Maymuna\", meaning the blessed, as his marriage to her had also marked the first time in seven years when he could enter his hometown Mecca.\n\nAccording to the Qur'an, God forbade anyone to marry the wives of Muhammad, because of their respect and honour, after he died.\n\"Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his wives after him at any time.\"\n\nThe extent of Muhammad's property at the time of his death is unclear. Although Qur'an [2.180] clearly addresses issues of inheritance, Abu Bakr, the new leader of the Muslim ummah, refused to divide Muhammad's property among his widows and heirs, saying that he had heard Muhammad say:\n\nMuhammad's widow Hafsa played a role in the collection of the first Qur'anic manuscript. After Abu Bakr had collected the copy, he gave it to Hafsa, who preserved it until Uthman took it, copied it and distributed it in Muslim lands.\n\nSome of Muhammad's widows were active politically in the Islamic state after Muhammad's death. Safiyya, for example, aided the Caliph Uthman during his siege. During the first fitna, some wives also took sides. Umm Salama, for example, sided with Ali, and sent her son Umar for help. The last of Muhammad's wives, Umm Salama lived to hear about the tragedy of Karbala in 680, dying the same year. The grave of the wives of Muhammed is located at al-Baqīʿ Cemetery, Medina.\n\nThe vertical lines in the graph indicate, in chronological order, the start of prophethood, the Hijra, and the Battle of Badr.\n\nMuhammad and his family lived in small apartments adjacent the mosque at Medina. Each of these were six to seven spans wide (5.5 feet) and ten spans long (7.5 feet). The height of the ceiling was that of an average man standing. The blankets were used as curtains to screen the doors. According to an account by Anas bin Malik, \"The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number.\"\n\nAlthough Muhammad's wives had a special status as \"Mothers of the Believers\", he did not allow them to use his status as a prophet to obtain special treatment in public.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21291901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21291901", "title": "Religion in Hungary", "text": "Religion in Hungary\n\nReligion in Hungary has been dominated by forms of Christianity for centuries. According to the 2011 census, 54.2% of the Hungarians declared to believe in Christianity, of whom 38.9% were Catholics (for the majority following the Roman rite, and a minority the Greek rite), 13.8% were Protestants (11.6% were Calvinists and 2.2% were Lutherans), 0.1% were Orthodox Christians, and 1.3% were members of other Christian groups. At the same time, 27.2% of the Hungarians did not declare a religious affliation, 16.7% declared explicitly to be not religious and 1.5% atheists. Minority religions practised in Hungary include Buddhism (0.1% in 2011), Islam and Judaism (0.1% in 2011).\n\nThe majority of Hungarians became Christian in the 11th century. Hungary's first king, Saint Stephen I, took up Western Christianity, although his mother Sarolt was baptized into Eastern Christianity. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the Reformation took place and, as a result, first Lutheranism and then soon afterwards Calvinism became the religion of almost the entire population. Protestants composed some 85-90% of the entire population, more than a half of the Hungarian population being part of the calvinist confessing Reformed Church and a quarter of lutheran confessing Evangelical Church. \n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, however, the Catholic Habsburg Kings and Jesuits led a successful campaign of Counter-Reformation among the Hungarians. The Jesuits not only founded educational institutions, including Péter Pázmány Catholic University, the oldest university that still exists in Hungary, but also organized so-called missions in order to promote popular piety. \n\nUsing both political and apologetic efforts, most of the High Nobility composing the Diet was already predominantly Catholic by 1640's, a process consolidated as the new reconquered estates were granted to the converted aristocracy, who supported in Counter-Reformation. Despite this, the lower nobility, the town burghers and the common people still retained a largely protestant - specially calvinist - identity, opposing the catholic german-likeness of the Habsburg courtly politics. Allied with the Constitutional Rights enforced by the Nobility and the military pressure of the Protestant Principality of Transylvania on the eastern border, Catholic Counter-Reformation achieved partial results compared to the other Habsburg-controlled possessions, like Bohemia and Austria, were Catholicism was restored to the status of the sole religion of the realm. \n\nSome of the eastern parts of the country, especially around Debrecen (nicknamed \"the Calvinist Rome\"), still have significant Protestant communities. The Reformed Church in Hungary is the second-largest church in Hungary with 1,153,442 adherents as of 2011. The church has 1,249 congregations, 27 presbyteries, and 1,550 ministers. The Reformed Church supports 129 educational institutions and has 4 theological seminaries, located in Debrecen, Sárospatak, Pápa, and Budapest.\n\nLutheranism is the third main historical religion in Hungary. It was introduced by Saxon settlers in the early 16th century, but after its brief efflorescence, the introduction of the Reformed Church and the Counter-Reformation made it almost non-existent amongst Hungarians up to the late 17th century. Later it was re-introduced through inward migration by Saxons and Slovaks. Today, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary is a small minority in Hungary today. Despite its relatively small number of adherents, it had a strong power and influence in internal politics since Hungary's independence from the strongly Catholic Habsburg Empire.\n\nThe proportion of all Protestantism in Hungary has decreased from around 27% in the early 20th century to about 16% in the early 21st century. Eastern Orthodoxy in Hungary has been the religion mainly of certain national minorities in the country, notably Romanians, Rusyns, Ukrainians, and Serbs. Hungary has also been the home of a sizable Armenian Catholic community. They worship according to the Armenian Rite, but they have united with the Catholic Church under the primacy of the Pope. Some of the Armenians in Hungary are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was legally recognized in Hungary in June 1988 and its first meetinghouse in the country was dedicated in October of the following year by President Thomas S. Monson. In June 1990, the Hungary Budapest Mission was created, followed by the first stake in June 2006. The mission, its districts, and the Budapest Hungary Stake together contain twenty-two wards and branches serving approximately 5000 members.\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community, especially when many Jews, persecuted in Russia, found refuge in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 19th century. The census of January 1941 found that 4.3% of the population, or around 400,000 people, were considered religious Jews. In 2011, only 10,965 Jews (0.1% of the population) remained. Some Hungarian Jews were able to escape the Holocaust during World War II, but most (perhaps 550,000) either were deported to concentration camps, from which the majority did not return, or were murdered by the Arrow Cross fascists. Most Jewish people who remain in Hungary live in the centre of Budapest, especially in district VII. The largest synagogue in Europe, the Dohány Street Synagogue, is located in Budapest.\n\nThe influence of Muslims in Hungary was especially pronounced in the 16th century during the time of the Ottoman rule. According to the 2011 census, there were 5,579 Muslims in Hungary, less than 0.1% of the total population. Of these, 4,097 declared themselves as Hungarian and 2,369 as Arab by ethnicity.\n\nIn recent decades Buddhism has spread to Hungary, primarily in its Vajrayana forms through the activity of Tibetan missionary monks. Since in Hungary religions are encouraged to institutionalise into church (\"egyház\") bodies in order to be recognised by the government, various institutions have formed, including the Hungarian Buddhist Church (\"Magyarországi Buddhista Egyházközösség\"), the Gate of Dharma Buddhist Church (\"A Tan Kapuja Buddhista Egyház\"), and others, mostly Vajrayana. A Shaolin temple, the Hungarian Shaolin Temple, was founded in Budapest in 1994.\n\n\"Navayana\" Buddhism or Ambedkarite Buddhism, a recent Buddhist denomination emerged among the Dalits of India, a form of Buddhism socially and politically engaged for the betterment of the conditions of marginalised peoples, has been spread also to the Romani ethnic minority of Hungary.\n\nA rise of Neopagan (\"Újpogányság\") movements has occurred in Hungary over the last decades. Traditional Hungarian paganism, based on Hungarian mythology and shamanism (Táltos tradition), has been revived and is known as \"Ősmagyar Vallás\" (\"Ancient Hungarian Religion\"). The Traditional Church of the Order of Arpad (\"Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház\"), the Ancient Hungarian Church (\"Ősmagyar Egyház\"), the Community of the Hungarian Religion (\"Magyar Vallás Közössége\"), the Ancient Hungarian Táltos Church (\"Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház\"), the \"Yotengrit\", and various Táltos groups are representative of this religion.\n\nSome Hungarians espouse Turanist ideas, and therefore other Táltos are affiliated with Tengrism. The Tengri Community (\"Tengri Közösség\") is one of the Tengrist churches of Hungary. Wicca, a religion of English origin, has spread to Hungary as in the other countries of Western Europe. Zsuzsanna Budapest, a Hungarian who emigrated to the United States, is the founder of the Wiccan denomination known as Dianic Wicca, popular in North America. The Celtic Wiccan Tradition Church (\"Kelta-Wicca Hagyományőrzők Egyháza\") is a Celtic Wiccan church in Hungary.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is also a small population of Baha'is. There has been a proliferation of small, usually Christian-linked schismatic religious groups since the 1994 genocide.\n\nThere are small and secretive communities of Hindus and Buddhists, comprising mostly foreign adherents, typically businessmen from China and India as well as university professors and students. Neither religion seriously attempts conversion in Rwanda or has places of worship.\n\nForeign missionaries and church-linked nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) of various religious groups operate in the country. Foreign missionaries openly promote their religious beliefs, and the Government welcomes their development assistance.\n\nThe Constitution of Rwanda provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Local government officials sometimes detain Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing to participate in security patrols. In 2007, the US government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.\n\nAlthough the ethnic divisions and tensions between Hutu and Tutsi predate the colonial era, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) report on the genocide states,\nIn the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country's Tutsi minority, since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandans…\n\nWhen the Roman Catholic missionaries came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the \"Hamitic\" theory of race origins, which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between Hutu and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu.\n\nAn estimated 800,000 Rwandans died during ethnic violence over a brief span of 100 days between April and July 1994. Most of the dead were Tutsis, and most of those who perpetrated the violence were Hutus.\n\nThe genocide started after the death of the Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in the shooting down of his plane above Kigali airport on 6 April 1994. The full details of that specific incident remain unclear; however, the death of the president was by no means the only cause of the mayhem. (Ethnic tension in Rwanda is not new. Disagreements between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis are common, but the animosity between them grew substantially after the end of the Belgian colonial regime.)\n\nTimothy Longman has provided the most detailed discussion of the role of religion in the Rwandan genocide in \"Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda\", published in 2010.\nLongman argues that both Catholic and Protestant churches helped to make the genocide possible by giving moral sanction to the killing. Churches had longed played ethnic politics themselves, favoring the Tutsi during the colonial period then switching allegiance to the Hutu after 1959, sending a message that ethnic discrimination was consistent with church teaching. The church leaders had close ties with the political leaders, and after the genocide began, the church leaders called on the population to support the new interim government, the very government supporting the genocide.\n\nAt the same time, churches did not uniformly support the genocide. In the period leading up to the genocide, 1990–1994, major splits emerged within most churches between moderates who promoted democratic change and conservatives allied with the Habyarimana regime. Many of the clergy were Tutsi, and they generally supported democratic reform, but many moderate Hutu within the churches supported reform as well. Churches provided major support to the formation of the new human-rights groups that emerged in the early 1990s. When the genocide began in 1994, some clergy and other church leaders opposed the violence,\neven at the risk of their own lives.\n\nSome individual members of the religious community attempted to protect civilians, sometimes at great risk to themselves. For example, Mgr. of Cyangugu preached against the genocide from the pulpit and tried unsuccessfully to rescue three Tutsi religious brothers from an attack, while Sr. Felicitas Niyitegeka of the Auxiliaires de l’Apostolat in Gisenyi smuggled Tutsi across the border into Zaire before a militant militia executed her in retaliation.\n\nIn her book \"Left to Tell: Discovering God in the Rwandan Holocaust\" (2006), Immaculée Ilibagiza, a Tutsi woman, describes hiding with seven other Tutsi women for 91 days in a bathroom in the house of Pastor Murinzi - for the majority of the genocide. At the St Paul Pastoral Centre in Kigali about 2,000 people found refuge and most of them survived, due to the efforts of Fr Célestin Hakizimana. This priest \"intervened at every attempt by the militia to abduct or murder\" the refugees in his centre. In the face of powerful opposition, he tried to hold off the killers with persuasion or bribes.\n\nOn November 20, 2016, the Catholic Church in Rwanda released a statement signed by nine bishops apologizing for the role of its members in the genocide of 1994.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8498156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8498156", "title": "Religion in Switzerland", "text": "Religion in Switzerland\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion of Switzerland, its presence going back to the Roman era. Since the 16th century, Switzerland has been traditionally divided into Roman Catholic and Reformed confessions. \nHowever, adherence to Christian churches has declined considerably since the late 20th century, from close to 94% in 1980 to about 67% as of 2016. Furthermore notable is the significant difference in church adherence between Swiss citizens (72%) and foreign nationals (51%) in 2016.\n\nSwitzerland as a federal state has no state religion, though most of the cantons (except for Geneva and Neuchâtel) recognize official churches (\"Landeskirchen\"), in all cases including the Roman Catholic Church and the Swiss Reformed Church. These churches, and in some cantons also the Old Catholic Church and Jewish congregations, are financed by official taxation of adherents.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office reported the religious demographics as of 2016 as follows (based on the resident population age 15 years and older):\n66.9% Christian (including 36.5% Roman Catholic, 24.5% Reformed, 5.9% other),\n24.9% unaffiliated,\n5.2% Muslim, \n0.3% Jewish,\n1.4% other religions.\n(100%: 6,981,381, registered resident population age 15 years and older).\n\nUntil the 1970s, Protestants made up a majority of the Swiss population, decreasing to about a fourth nowadays. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities have today more Catholics than Protestants, due to a steady rise of the unaffiliated population in general combined with Catholic immigration from countries such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, who mostly immigrated during the second half of the 20th century, and a less important immigration from Croatia during the last 25 years. 31% of all Catholics are foreign nationals versus 5% of Protestants. The unaffiliated form 25% of Switzerland's population in 2016, and are especially strong in the canton of Basel-City, the canton of Neuchâtel, the canton of Geneva, the canton of Vaud, and Zürich. The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholics and Protestants, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, Valais, Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, Jura, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel-Country, St Gallen and the half of Aargau are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, which came after the clashes between Catholic and Protestant cantons that culminated in the \"Sonderbundskrieg\", consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.\n\nRather recent immigration over the last 25 years has brought Islam (accounting for 5.2% in 2016) and Eastern Orthodoxy as sizeable minority religions.\n\nOther Christian minority communities include Neo-Pietism, Pentecostalism (mostly incorporated in the Schweizer Pfingstmission), Methodism, the New Apostolic Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland. Minor non-Christian minority groups are Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions.\n\nA survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2017 found that 75% of Swiss adult population consider themselves Christians when asking about their current religion (irrespective of whether they are officially members of a particular Christian church by paying church tax). Nonetheless the same survey shows that only 27% of Christians in Switzerland attend church at least monthly, while the majority of Christians seldom go to church. 4% of people questioned state they have a non-Christian religion. 21% are of no religion, and nearly half of them consider themselves Atheists.\n\nAs in many other European countries, the major Christian confessions are losing members whereas the numbers of unaffiliated and not religious people are growing fast and Muslims are slightly increasing and came to represent a more or less constant share of the population since 2000.\n\n \n\nThe Swiss constitution of 1848, written by the victorious pro-union Protestant cantons after the Sonderbundskrieg (Catholic-Separatist Civil War of 1847), consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThe settlement restrictions placed on Swiss Jews in various instances between the 14th and 18th centuries were lifted with the revised Swiss Constitution of 1874.\n\nA popular vote in March 1980 on the complete separation of church and state was clearly opposed to such a change, with only 21.1% voting in support, to the effect of the retention of the \"Landeskirchen\" system.\n\nIn November 2009, 57.5% of Swiss voters approved of a popular initiative to ban the construction of minarets in Switzerland. The four existing Swiss minarets, at mosques in Zürich, Geneva, Winterthur and Wangen bei Olten are not affected by the ban.\n\nFull freedom of religion has been guaranteed since the revised Swiss Constitution of 1874 (Article 49). \nDuring the Old Swiss Confederacy, there had been no \"de facto\" freedom of religion, with persecution of Anabaptists in particular well into the 18th century. Swiss Jews had been given full political rights in 1866, although their right to settle freely was implemented as late as 1879 in the canton of Aargau.\nThe current Swiss Constitution of 1999 makes explicit both positive and negative religious freedom in Article 15, paragraph 3--which asserts that every person has the right to adhere to a religious confession and to attend religious education—and paragraph 4, which asserts that nobody can be forced to either adhere to a religious confession or to attend religious education, thus explicitly asserting the right of apostasy from a previously held religious belief.\n\nThe basic right protected by the constitution is that of public confession of adherence to a religious community and the performance of religious cult activities. Article 36 of the constitution introduces a limitation of these rights if they conflict with public interest or if they encroach upon the basic rights of others. Thus, ritual slaughter is prohibited as conflicting with Swiss animal laws. \nPerformance of cultic or missionary activities or religious processions on public ground may be limited. The Jesuit order was banned from all activity on Swiss soil from 1848 to 1973. The use of cantonal taxes to support cantonal churches has been ruled legal by the Federal Supreme Court. Some commentators have argued that the minaret ban introduced by popular vote in 2009 constitutes a breach of religious freedom.\n\nTraces of the pre-Christian religions of the area that is now Switzerland include the Bronze Age \"fire dogs\". The Gaulish Helvetii, who became part of Gallo-Roman culture under the Roman Empire, left only scarce traces of their religion like the statue of \"dea Artio\", a bear goddess, found near Bern. A known Roman sanctuary to Mercury was on a hill north-east of Baar. St. Peter in Zürich was the location of a temple to Jupiter.\n\nThe Bishopric of Basel was established in AD 346; the bishopric of Sion, before 381; the bishopric of Geneva. in \"c\". 400: the bishopric of Vindonissa (now united as the Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg), in 517; and the Diocese of Chur, before 451.\n\nGermanic paganism briefly reached Switzerland with the immigration, from the 6th century, of the Alemanni, who were gradually converted to Christianity during the 6th and 7th centuries, with the establishment of the Bishopric of Constance in \"c\". 585. The Abbey of St. Gall rose as an important center of learning in the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe Old Swiss Confederacy was Roman Catholic as a matter of course until the Reformation of the 1520s, which resulted in a lasting split of the Confederacy into Protestantism and Catholicism. This split lead to numerous violent outbreaks in Early Modern times and included the partitioning of the former canton of Appenzell into the Protestant canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Catholic Appenzell Innerrhoden in 1597. The secular Helvetic Republic was a brief intermezzo and tensions immediately resurfaced after 1815, leading to the formation of the modern confederal state in 1848, which recognizes \"Landeskirchen\" on a cantonal basis: the Roman Catholic and the Reformed Churches in each canton, and since the 1870s (following the controversies triggered by the First Vatican Council) the Christian Catholic Church in some cantons.\n\nGeneva holds a special place in Protestant history as fundamental parts of John Calvin's religious thought originated there, and was further progressed by Theodore Beza, William Farel and other Reformed theologians. It also served as a haven for persecuted Protestants from France, including Calvin, who became the spiritual leader of the city, himself. Zürich is also important for Protestants, as Huldrych Zwingli, Heinrich Bullinger and other Reformed theologians operated there.\n\nThe Jesuits (\"Societas Jesu\") were the subject of a bitter controversy in 19th century Switzerland. \nThe order had been dissolved in 1773 by Clement XIV, but it was re-instated in 1814 by Pius VII.\n\nOver the following years, the Jesuits returned to the Swiss colleges they had owned prior to 1773, in Brig (1814), Sion (1814), Fribourg (1818) and Lucerne (1845), and especially Fribourg became a center of the Council of Trent. The Protestant cantons felt threatened by the re-appearance of the Jesuits and their program of traditionalist Catholicism, which contributed to religious unrest and the formation of the Sonderbund of the Catholic cantons, and at the \"Tagsatzung\" of 1844 in vain demanded the expulsion of the Jesuit order from the territory of the Swiss confederacy.\nThe Protestant victory of the \"Sonderbundskrieg\" of 1847 led to the realization of such a ban in the 1848 Swiss Constitution, expanded even further in the revised constitution of 1874, so that all activity of Jesuits either in clerical or in educational function was outlawed in Switzerland until 1973, when the paragraph was removed from the constitution by a popular vote.\n\n\n\n"}

Although the war was not a religious war, and both patriots and royalists were equally Christian, it was influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. The relation with the Holy See through Spain was cut, until being restored by Juan Manuel de Rosas.\n\nDuring the colonial times, the local clergy was concerned because religious people appointed from Spain were privileged over locals, regardless of their merits. Religious people were more literate and illustrated than the average people in the viceroyalty, and had easier access to restricted books, such as those of the Age of Enlightenment. Those books were not limited to theological ones. This illustration started during the reign of Charles III of Spain.\n\nMost prelates supported the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Friar Ignacio Grela promoted at the cathedral the strengthening of the British influence, as well as the bishop Benito Lué y Riega. On the contrary, they stayed silent after the liberation of the city by Santiago de Liniers. When Ferdinand VII of Spain was overthrown during the Peninsular War, they supported the Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people principle.\n\nTwenty-seven religious people attended the May 22 open cabildo to decide the fate of viceroy Cisneros. Benito Lue y Riega was a vocal opposer of his destitution, but seventeen of them voted for the end of his mandate and a military expedition to the other cities. At the end of it, the priest Manuel Alberti was appointed to the Primera Junta. Lue y Riega accepted the authority of the junta, but the Junta did not trust him completely, and prevented him from taking a trip across the cities in order to watch him in Buenos Aires. The distrust towards him extended to the supporters of the new government, generating incidents. As a result, he was prevented from making public appearances at his church.\n\nThe regular clergy took advantage of the revolution and the cut off relations with Spain, and requested promotions and benefices to the new government. People at lower ranks declared themselves patriots suffering injustices, in order to get government protection. The junta considered some cases, but eventually condemned the clergy that defied their religious authorities. Nevertheless, a violent night incident against Antonio Palavecino forced the military to intervene, and the junta started to monitor more carefully the activities inside convents.\n"}

The set of evil characters is led by the power-hungry Rughal, who seeks to steal the power of the Noor stones and their bearers for his personal benefit. The storyline pits the 99 led by Dr. Ramzi in their pursuit of social justice and peace against the forces of chaos and evil.\n\nThe series was created by Naif Al-Mutawa, founder and C.E.O. of Teshkeel Media Group. The initial creative team for \"The 99\" was composed of comic book industry veterans such as Fabian Nicieza, Stuart Moore, June Brigman, Dan Panosian, John McCrea, Ron Wagner, Sean Parsons and Monica Kubina.\n\nThe 99 was first launched in Kuwait in 2006 after it received approval from the country’s Ministry of Information, following which it was released globally. In September 2006, Unicorn Investment Bank acquired a stake in Teshkeel Media Group. Since the bank has a Sharia board, the investment enabled The 99 to gain approval in Saudi Arabia with its Sharia compliance.\n\nAn \"Origins Preview\" was first published in the Middle East in May 2006, followed by a US reprinting in July 2007. \"The 99\" #1 was printed in September 2006 in the Middle East and was published in the US in August 2007 as \"First Light\". \"The 99\" only ran five issues in printed form, but both Middle East and USA editions continued to be published electronically until September 2013, with the final issue being #35.

All dilemmas faced by The 99 are overcome through the combined powers and capabilities of three or more members. Through this, The 99 series aims to promote values such as cooperation and unity throughout the Islamic world. Although the series is not religious, it aims to communicate Islamic virtues which are, as viewed by series creator Dr. Al-Mutawa, universal in nature.\n\nThe concept of The 99 is based on the 99 attributes of Allah. Many of these names refer to characteristics that can be possessed by human individuals. For example, – generosity, strength, faithfulness, wisdom are all virtues encouraged by a number of faiths.\n\nIn compliance with Islamic tradition, the Arabic version of the aliases of each of the 99 is written without the definite article \"Al-\", because use of this precise form is exclusive to Allah. This serves to remind that The 99 are only mortals, and sets them as human role models, with their qualities and weaknesses.\n\nOne of the characters, Batina The Hidden, wears a burqa, which some reports highlighted.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\"The 99\" was listed by \"Forbes\" as one of the ‘Top 20 Trends Sweeping the Globe’ in January 2008.

The Grand Mufti Abdulaziz al-Sheikh, head of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas, said \"The 99 is a work of the devil that should be condemned and forbidden in respect to Allah's names and attributes.\" The original comic strip version, first released in 2006, had already run into opposition from Muslims not only in Saudi Arabia but also in neighboring Kuwait.\n\nThe fatwa arose when Al-Mutawa was sued by a Kuwaiti civilian for blasphemy in a court of law in Kuwait in 2014. Al-Mutawa fought the case and won. There was an appeal in 2015 which he won as well.\n\nAndrea Peyser, columnist at the \"New York Post\", wrote in October 2010: \"Hide your face and grab the kids. Coming soon to a TV in your child's bedroom is a posse of righteous, Sharia-compliant Muslim superheroes, including one who fights crime hidden head-to-toe by a burqa.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2014, \"The Kuwait Times\" reported that ISIL members had issued death threats and offered unspecified rewards for the assassination of Dr. Al-Mutawa, via Twitter.
