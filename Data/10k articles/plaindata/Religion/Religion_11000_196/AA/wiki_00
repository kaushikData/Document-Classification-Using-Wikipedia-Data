{"id": "1141191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1141191", "title": "Affinity (canon law)", "text": "Affinity (canon law)\n\nIn Catholic canon law, affinity is an impediment to marriage of a couple due to the relationship which either party has as a result of a kinship relationship created by another marriage or as a result of extramarital intercourse. The relationships that give rise to the impediment have varied over time. Marriages and sexual relations between people in an affinity relationship are regarded as incestuous.\n\nToday, the relevant principle within the Catholic Church is that \"affinity does not beget affinity\"—i.e., there is no affinity between one spouse's relatives and the other spouse's relatives. Canon 109 of the \"Code of Canon Law\" of the Catholic Church provides that affinity is an impediment to the marriage of a couple, and is a relationship which \"arises from a valid marriage, even if not consummated, and exists between a man and the blood relatives of the woman and between the woman and the blood relatives of the man.\" Also, affinity \"is reckoned in such a way that the blood relations of the man are related by affinity to the woman in the same line and the same degree, and vice versa.\" \n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, and contain prohibitions of sexual relations between a couple in a consanguineous relationship, as well as a number of prohibitions of certain affinity relationships, e.g., (father’s wife), (father’s brother's wife), (brother’s wife), (wife’s sister), (father’s wife, daughter-in-law), (woman and her mother), (sister of either one's mother or father) and (brother’s wife). Marriage to a brother's widow is prohibited, but not to a deceased wife's sister. However, as an exception, requires a brother to marry his brother's widow if the brother died without issue, in a so-called levirate marriage.\n\nRoman civil law prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinity but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. However, the rule was that, if an issue of affinity arose, at whatever consanguineal level a couple was joined was considered the same level as regarded affinity. Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line \"ad infinitum\". Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an unemancipated daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved. Slaves, as such, could not contract a legal marriage, but if freed were then subject to the general rules. Also a marriage contracted within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity if contracted \"bona fide\", out of ignorance of any impediments, is allowed to stand and any children of this union were considered legitimate.\n\nRegarding itself as not being bound by Old Testament commandments, the early Christian church followed Roman civil law, as the law of the land. The Christian emperors modified the rules from time to time and extended the civil law impediment to the first degree of collateral affinity. The church extended the impediment to relationships created by illicit intercourse. The Council of Elvira (c. 300), prohibited the marriage of a widower with his deceased wife's sister. The prohibition became slowly more extensive. By the early 9th century the Western Church had increased the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from four to seven. The method of calculating relationships was also changed to simply count the number of generations back to a common ancestor. The church also prohibited affinity to the same seven degrees. While the impediment of affinity is close to but not as compelling as that of consanguinity, the reasoning behind the prohibited degrees of affinity being treated the same as that of consanguinity is the nearness to the blood relatives by the very act of sexual intercourse.\n\nPrior to the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), the Church recognized two additional forms of affinity. Firstly, when a man married a widow, her relatives as well as those of her former husband were considered the man's relatives and treated as if they were his blood relatives. Secondly, if the woman's first husband had been a widower then the blood relatives of his first wife became the woman's relatives and by her subsequent marriage, were also the new husband's relatives by affinity. Also, a woman's children by a deceased husband, as well as the children of her husband by a deceased wife, were considered related by affinity. So the subsequent marriages of step-siblings carried the same prohibitions as if they were related by blood. The principle established was \"affinity begot affinity.\" \n\nThe Fourth Lateran Council removed the second type of affinity rule and the new axiom became: \"affinity does not beget affinity\", which is the principle followed in the modern Catholic church. It also limited both affinity and consanguinity prohibitions to the fourth degree, but retained the same method of calculating, counting back to a common ancestor. The Council of Trent (1545-1563) limited the impediment to marriage on account of affinity in cases when the affinity is created out of marriage (e.g., by force or extra-matrimonial intercourse) to the second degree of affinity.\n\nAs the affinity rules have their origin in ecclesiastical and not divine law, impediments can be dispensed by the competent Church authority. The Pope or a bishop may grant a dispensation to a marriage when the affinity rules would be breached.\n\nThe present Catholic church position is that affinity is covered by ecclesiastical law and bishops are permitted to dispense any impediments, short of any order of priesthood or affinity in the direct line, if it stems from lawful sexual relationships. The modern laws of the Anglican Church regarding affinity are found in the \"Book of Common Prayer\", which were revised from time to time. The Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907 removed the impediment to marrying a late wife's sister. Restrictions were also relaxed by the \"Marriage Act 1949\" §1 and the \"Marriage (Prohibited Degrees of Relationship) Act 1986\", §1. The Anglican Communion allows marriages beyond the second degree of affinity.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church relationship prohibitions because of affinity follow (father’s wife), (father’s brother's wife), (brother’s wife), (wife’s sister), (father’s wife, daughter-in-law), (woman and her mother), (sister of either one's mother or father) and (brother’s wife). However, the Greek patriarchs and bishops may grant dispensations with a certain degree of freedom or choose to adhere to the letter of the law. The Nestorian Church has few restrictions on affinity begetting affinity. The Armenian Apostolic Church restricts affinity to the fourth degree, while the policy of Oriental Orthodoxy in general is very close to that of the Roman Catholic canons.\n\n"}

She is the oldest member of her tribe, the Takelma. She is also the Granddaughter of Jack Harney, the first elected Chief of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz. Pilgrim was Elected Chairperson of the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers at its founding in 2004. \"She has been honored as a \"Living Treasure\" by the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, and as a \"Living Cultural Legend\" by the Oregon Council of the Arts.\"\n\nPilgrim was born on September 11, 1924 having been delivered by Elizabeth Juliana Tole Harney, Pilgrim' grandmother who was a midwife. Her family was poor during the Depression and survived with no electricity.\n\nGrandma Aggie, as she is affectionately known, has had a rich and varied working life ranging from working for the Indian Health Service as a physician's assistant, an alcohol and drug counselor, a scrub nurse, a logger, a singer, a bouncer, a barber in a jail and a stock car racing driver.\n\nThrice married, Pilgrim had three daughters and three sons. Pilgrim also has eighteen grandchildren, twenty seven great grandchildren and a great great grandchild.\n\nIn 1982 Pilgrim was seriously ill with cancer. Pilgrim claims that she asked the Creator to let her live as she had lots of friends and family who relied on her, and that, she had a lot left to do in the world. Ever since that time she has had a transformation and gravitated to a very spiritual type of life - even though Pilgrim admits to have initially being reluctant to travel her spiritual path as she doubted her worthiness for this task.\n\nA ceremony to welcome, bless, and thank the returning salmon each year was held by the Takelma tribe, as well as many other Indian tribes in the northwest United States and Canada, . However, for 140 years, due to the loss of traditional ways, the ceremony was not performed publicly by the Takelma tribe. To revive the ceremony, Pilgrim and her late husband Grant Pilgrim (Yurok tribe), visited with area tribes that continued to perform this ceremony. Following numerous visits to ceremonial and spiritual gatherings of northwest tribes, the Pilgrims brought back their version of the ceremony to Southern Oregon. Due to Pilgrim's contribution in returning the Salmon Ceremony to Jackson County, she is known to some locals as the 'Keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony'.\n\nA great deal of interest has since been shown by the National Geographic magazine and the World Wildlife Fund and Martha Stewart due to the unprecedented increase in salmon seen in the river since the ceremony has been performed.\n\nThe ceremony is annually held on the bank of the Applegate River in Southwest Oregon\n\nWhile studying psychology and Native American studies at Southern Oregon University at the age of 50, Pilgrim co-founded the Konanway Nika Tillicum (All My Relations) Native American Summer Youth Academy. She is the Elder-Woman-in-Residence for the Academy.\n\nIn 2004, Pilgrim was approached by The Center for Sacred Studies to serve on the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. Pilgrim is the oldest of the Grandmothers and was elected as the council's Chairperson.\n\nThe Council has been active in protecting indigenous rights and medicines, promoting ancient wisdom.\n\nPilgrim considers the International Council of 13 Grandmothers not to have come together by accident, coming at the eleventh hour to be \"a voice for the voiceless.\"\n\nIn 2008, she traveled with the group on \"a trip to Rome to try to get Pope Benedict XVI to rescind historical papal bulls, which played a role in the genocidal onslaught of indigenous people worldwide,\" according to Indian Country Today Media Network.\n\nPilgrim's likeness is featured in the bronze statue, \"We Are Here\", in downtown Ashland, Oregon. Pilgrim attended the dedication ceremony on May 24, 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26848063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26848063", "title": "Akan religion", "text": "Akan religion\n\nAkan religion comprises the traditional beliefs and religious practices of the Akan people of Ghana and eastern Ivory Coast. Akan religion is referred to as Akom (from the Twi word \"okom\", meaning \"prophecy\"). Although most Akan people have identified as Christians since the early 20th century, Akan religion remains practiced by some, and is often syncretized with Christianity. The Akan have many subgroups (including the Ashanti, the Akuapem, the Wassa, the Abron, the Anyi, and the Baoulé, among others), so the religion varies greatly by region and subgroup.\n\nSimilar to other traditional religions of West and Central Africa such as West African Vodun, Yoruba religion, or Odinani, Akan cosmology consists of a senior god who generally does not interact with humans and many gods who assist humans.\n\nAnansi the Spider is a folk hero, who is prominent in Ashanti folktales, where he is depicted as a trickster.\n\nFollowers of Akan religion believe in a supreme god who created the universe. He is distant and does not interact with humans.\n\nThe creator god takes on different names depending upon the region of worship, including \"Nyame\", \"Nyankopon\", \"Brekyirihunuade\" (\"Almighty\"), \"Odomankoma\" (\"infinite inventor\"), \"Ɔbɔadeɛ\" (\"creator\") and \"Anansi Kokuroku\" (\"the great designer\" or \"the great spider\"). It is occasionally said that the creator god is a part of a triune deity or triad, which consists of Nyame, Nyankopon and Odomankoma.\n\nThe Supreme Creator is an omniscient, omnipotent sky father. His wife is Asase Yaa (also known as Mother Earth), considered second to God. Together they brought forth two children: Bia and Tano.\n\nThe \"abosom\", the lower deities or spirits, assist humans on earth. These are akin to orishas in Yoruba religion, the vodun in West African Vodun and its derivatives, and the alusi in Odinani. Abosom receive their power from the creator god and are most often connected to the world as it appears in its natural state. Priests serve individual abosom and act as mediators between the abosom and mankind. Many of those who believe in these traditions participate in daily prayer, which includes the pouring of libations as an offering to both the ancestors who are buried under the land and to the spirits who are everywhere.\n\nThe \"Nsamanfo \" are the ancestors. They are sometimes referred to as ghost.\n\nAccording to Long, Akan (then referred to as \"Coromantee\") culture obliterated any other African customs and incoming non-Akan Africans had to submit to the culture of the majority Akan population in Jamaica, much like a foreigner learning migrating to a foreign country. Other than Ananse stories, Akan religion made a huge impact. The Akan pantheon of gods referred to as Abosom in Twi were documented. Enslaved Akan would praise Nyankopong (erroneously written by the British as Accompong, not related to the Maroon leader Accompong [Twi: \"Akyeampong\"]); libations would be poured to Asase Yaa (erroneously written as 'Assarci') and Epo the sea god. Bonsam was referred to as the god of evil. Kumfu (from the word \"Akom\" the name of the Akan spiritual system) was documented as \"Myal\" and originally only found in books, while the term Kumfu is still used by Jamaican Maroons. The priest of Kumfu was called a \"Kumfu-man\".\n\nThe Jamaican Maroon spirit-possession language, a creolized form of Akan, is used in religious ceremonies of some Jamaican Maroons.\n\nKumfu evolved into Revival, a syncretic Christian sect. Kumfu followers gravitated to the American Revival of 1800 Seventh Day Adventist movement because it observed Saturday as god's day of rest. This was a shared aboriginal belief of the Akan people as this too was the day that the Akan god, Nyame rested after creating the earth. Jamaicans that were aware of their Ashanti past while wanting to keep hidden, mixed their Kumfu spirituality with the American Adventists to create Jamaican Revival in 1860. Revival has two sects: \"60 order\"(or Zion Revival, the order of the heavens) and \"61 order\"(or Pocomania, the order of the earth). 60 order worships God and spirits of air or the heavens on a Saturday and considers itself to be the more 'clean' sect. 61 order more deals with spirits of the earth. This division of Kumfu clearly shows the dichotomy of Nyame and Asase Yaa's relationship, Nyame representing \"air\" and has his 60 order'; \"Asase Yaa\" having her 61 order of the \"earth\". Also the Ashanti funerary/war colours: red and black have the same meaning in Revival of \"vengeance\". Other Ashanti elements include the use of swords and rings as means to guard the spirit from spiritual attack. The Asantehene like the Mother Woman of Revival, has special two swords used to protect himself from witchcraft called an Akrafena or \"soul sword\" and a Bosomfena or \"spirit sword\" \n\nWinti is an Afro-Surinamese religion which is largely derived from both Akom and Vodun with Vodun gods such as Loco, Ayizu and so on. \n\n"}

The population is predominantly Sunni Muslim.\n\nIt is a traditional town situated on the slopes of the Anti-Lebanon mountains. It is known for its local hand-made carpet industry. The area is known to be one of the few places in the Anti-Lebanon with a good water supply. The Lebanese Ministry of Tourism brochure suggests that the name Arsal or Ersal means \"God's Throne\" in Aramaic. It documents several rock-cut benches (mastabas) in the village, numerous historical monuments in the nearby hills and an ancient fortified structure in the nearby Wadi Al-Toun of unknown date.\n\nAin Choaab or Ain Chaub spring is located in the nearby hills, just of the main road from Arsal to Labweh. There are Natufian rock shelters situated above the wadi bed of the spring that can be accessed via a steep climb up a ridge. Flint tools were collected from the site by Bruce Schroeder in 1970.\n\nOn 17 September 2012, Syrian ground-attack aircraft fired three missiles over the border into Lebanese territory near Arsal. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted Lebanese president Michel Sleiman to launch an investigation, whilst not publicly blaming Syria for the incident.\n\nOn 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being “neutral from the conflicts of others\". He called on border residents to “stand beside their army and assist its members.” Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns.\n\nOne thousand four hundred refugee children from the Syrian civil war have been displaced into the town, where schools only have places for one hundred students. The situation reflects a growing crisis threatening to overwhelm the Beqaa educational system.\n\nOn 2 February 2013, the Lebanese army was the victim of an armed ambush in the town as it was seeking to arrest Khaled Homayed. Two army officers were killed and a number of soldiers were wounded. Homayed is believed to have been involved with the Fatah al-Islam organization that was responsible for many deadly attacks on the Lebanese army as well as the kidnapping of seven Estonians in 2011. He is also believed to be active with the Free Syrian Army. Town residents refused to cooperate with the army to reveal the whereabouts of the gunmen who were responsible for the ambush.\n\nIn August 2014, ISIS and its allies launched a full-scale invasion and the battle with Lebanese troops went on for five days before they were forced back into Syria.\n\nIn January 2016 a local newspaper reported that there were 10,000 Syrian refugees in Arsal itself with a further 100,000 in dozens of camps around the town. A second report estimated that Arsal was host to 50,000 refugees.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, a Syrian Army commander stated that his forces and Hezbollah had launched a joint campaign to recapture the remaining territory under militant control near the Lebanon-Syria border, attacking the outskirts of Arsal. The Lebanese Army meanwhile assumed a defensive position in Arsal.\n\n"}

The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetrapillar-altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural eternal flame went out in 1969, after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.\n\nThe Baku Ateshgah was a pilgrimage and philosophical centre of Zoroastrians from Northwestern Indian Subcontinent, who were involved in trade with the Caspian area via the famous \"Grand Trunk Road\". The four holy elements of their belief were: ateshi (fire), badi (air), abi (water), and heki (earth). The temple ceased to be a place of worship after 1883 with the installation of petroleum plants (industry) at Surakhany. The complex was turned into a museum in 1975. The annual number of visitors to the museum is 15,000.\n\nThe Temple of Fire \"Ateshgah\" was nominated for List of World Heritage Sites, UNESCO in 1998 by Gulnara Mehmandarova. On December 19, 2007, it was declared a state historical-architectural reserve by decree of the President of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Persian toponym Atashgah (with Russian/Azerbaijani pronunciation: \"Atashgyakh\"/\"Ateshgah\") literally means \"home of fire.\" The Persian-origin term \"atesh\" (آتش) means \"fire\", and is a loanword in Azerbaijani. \"Gah\" (گاہ) derives from Middle Persian and means \"throne\" or \"bed\". The name refers to the fact that the site is situated atop a now-exhausted natural gas field, which once caused natural fires to spontaneously burn there as the gas emerged from seven natural surface vents. Today, the fires in the complex are fed by gas piped in from Baku, and are only turned on for the benefit of visitors.\n\n\"Surakhani\", the name of the town where the Ateshgah is located, likely means \"a region of holes\" (سراخ/\"suraakh\" is Persian for \"hole\"), but might perhaps be a reference to the fire glow as well (سرخ/\"sorkh\"/\"surkh\" is Persian for \"red\"). A historic alternative name for Azerbaijan as a whole has been \"Odlar Yurdu\", Azeri for \"land of fires\".\n\n“Surakhany” in Tati (language of Surakhany, close to Persian) means “hole with the fountain”.\n\nSurakhani is located on the Absheron peninsula, which is famous for being a locality where oil oozes naturally from the ground and flames burn perpetually - as at Yanar Dag - fed by natural hydrocarbon vapours issuing from the rock.\n\nIn the 7th century Armenian geography \"Ashkharatsuyts\", attributed to Anania Shirakatsi, a location called “Yotnporakyan Bagink” (“Place with seven worshiped holes”) is mentioned in the Paytakaran province, which is thought to be the Ateshgah. Armenian historian Ghevond (8th century), describing the invasion of the Khazars in the Caucasian Albania in 730 AD, mentioned area “Atshi-Baguan”. Sarah Ashurbeyli notes that the “Atsh” is distorted “Atesh” (“fire”) and “Atshi-Baguan” means “Fires of Baguan” referring to Baku. Word “Baguan” comes from the word “Baga” which means “God” in Old Persian. and \"Bhagawan\" also means God in Sanskrit.\n\n\"Seven holes with eternal fires\" were mentioned by German traveler Engelbert Kaempfer who visited Surakhani in 1683.\n\nEstakhri (10th century) mentioned that not far from Baku (i.e., on the Apsheron Peninsula) lived fire worshippers. This was confirmed by Movses Daskhurantsi in his reference of the province of Bhagavan (“Fields of the Gods” i.e., “Fire Gods”).\n\nIn the 18th century, Atashgah was visited by Zoroastrians. The Persian handwriting Naskh inscription over the entrance aperture of one of the cells, which speaks about the visit of Zoroastrians from Isfahan:\n\nThe 1158 year corresponds to 1745 AD. Bovan (modern Bovanat) is the village near Esfahan. The word Badak is a diminutive of Bad-Kubeh. (The name of Baku in the sources of the 17th and 18th centuries was Bad-e Kube). At the end of the reference is the constellation of Sombole /Virgo (August–September). In the name of the month the master mistakenly shifted the “l” and “h” at the end of the word. According to Zoroastrian calendar Qadimi New Year in 1745 AD was in August.\n\nInteresting information about Zoroastrianism in Baku is given by D. Shapiro in \"A Karaite from Wolhynia meets a Zoroastrian from Baku\". Avraham Firkowicz, a Karaite collector of ancient manuscripts, wrote about his meeting in Darband in 1840 with a fire-worshipper from Baku. Firkowicz asked him “Why do you worship fire?” The fire-worshipper replied that he worshipped not fire, but the Creator symbolised by fire - a “matter” or abstraction (and hence not a person) called \"Q’rţ’ \". Pahlavi \"Q’rţ’ \" (from Avestan \"kirdar\" or Sanskrit \"kṛt\" and \"कर्ता\") signifies “one who does” or “creator”.\n\nSome scholars have speculated that the Ateshgah may have been an ancient Zoroastrian shrine that was decimated by invading Islamic armies during the Muslim conquest of Persia and its neighboring regions. It has also been asserted that, \"according to historical sources, before the construction of the Indian Temple of Fire (Atashgah) in Surakhani at the end of the 17th century, the local people also worshipped at this site because of the 'seven holes with burning flame'.\"\n\nFire is considered sacred in the Indo-Iranian branches of Sikhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism (as Agni and Atar respectively), and there has been debate on whether the Atashgah was originally a Hindu structure, Zoroastrian, or Sikh one. The trident mounted atop the structure is usually a distinctly Hindu sacred symbol (as the \"Trishula\", which is commonly mounted on temples) and has been cited by Zoroastrian scholars as a specific reason for considering the Atashgah as a Hindu and Sikh site. However, an Azeri presentation on the history of Baku, which calls the shrine a \"Hindu temple\", identifies the trident as a Zoroastrian symbol of \"good thoughts, good words and good deeds\".\n\nOne early European commentator, Jonas Hanway, bucketed Zoroastrians, Sikhs, and Hindus together with respect to their religious beliefs: \"These opinions, with a few alterations, are still maintained by some of the posterity of the ancient Indians and Persians, who are called Gebers or Gaurs, and are very zealous in preserving the religion of their ancestors; particularly in regard to their veneration for the element of fire.\" Geber is a Persian term for Zoroastrians, while Gaurs are a priestly Hindu and Sikhcaste. A later scholar, A. V. Williams Jackson, drew a distinction between the two groups. While stating that \"\"the typical features which Hanway mentions are distinctly Indian, not Zoroastrian\" based on the worshipers' attires and tilakas, their strictly vegetarian diets and open veneration for cows, he left open the possibility that a few \"actual Gabrs (i.e. Zoroastrians, or Parsis)\"\" may also have been present at the shrine alongside larger Hindu and Sikh groups.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, there were significant Indian communities throughout Central Asia. In Baku, Indian merchants from the Multan region of Punjab controlled much of the commercial economy, along with the Armenians. Much of the woodwork for ships on the Caspian was also done by Indian craftsmen. Some commentators have theorized that Baku's Indian community may have been responsible for the construction or renovation of the Ateshgah.\n\nAs European academics and explorers began arriving in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, they documented encounters with dozens of Hindus at the shrine as well as Sikh pilgrims en route in the regions between North India and Baku.\n\nSamuel Gottlieb Gmelin's \"Reise durch Russland\" (1771) is cited in Karl Eduard von Eichwald's \"Reise in den Caucasus\" (Stuttgart, 1834) where the naturalist Gmelin is said to have observed Yogi austerities being performed by devotees. Geologist Eichwald restricts himself to a mention of the worship of Rama, Krishna, Hanuman and Agni. In the 1784 account of George Forster of the Bengal Civil Service, the square structure was about 30 yards across, surrounded by a low wall and containing many apartments. Each of these had a small jet of sulphurous fire issuing from a funnel \"constructed in the shape of a Hindu altar.\" The fire was used for worship, cooking and warmth, and would be regularly extinguished.\n\n\"The Ateshgyakh Temple looks not unlike a regular town caravansary - a kind of inn with a large central court, where caravans stopped for the night. As distinct from caravansaries, however, the temple has the altar in its center with tiny cells for the temple's attendants - Indian ascetics who devoted themselves to the cult of fire - and for pilgrims lining the walls.\"\n\nThere are some data that in addition to the Hindus in the temple were present Zoroastrians (Parsis and Guebres) and Sikhs.\nChardin in the 17th century reported about Persian Guebres, which worshiped forever burning fire that was in two days' journey from Shemakha (on the Apsheron).\n\nEngelbert Kaempfer, who visited Surakhany in 1683, wrote that among people who worshiped fire, two men are descendants of Persians who migrated to India.\n\nFrench Jesuit Villotte, who lived in Azerbaijan since 1689, reports that Ateshgah revered by Hindus, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians, the descendants of the ancient Persians.\n\nGerman traveler Lerch who visited the temple in 1733, wrote that here there are 12 Guebres or ancient Persian fire worshipers».\n\nJ. Hanway visited Baku in 1747 and left few records of Ateshgah. People, who worshiped fire in Ateshgah he calls \"Indians\", \"Persians\" and “Guebres”.\n\nS. Gmelin, who visited Ateshgah in 1770, wrote that in the present Ateshgah lived Indians and descendants of the ancient Guebres.\n\nIn 1820 the French consul Gamba visits the temple. According to Gamba here lived Hindus, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians, the followers of Zoroaster.\n\nThe Englishman Ussher visited Ateshgah in September 19, 1863 He calls it \"Atash Jah\" and said that there are pilgrims from India and Persia \nGerman Baron Max Thielmann visited the temple in October 1872 and in his memoirs he wrote that Parsi community of Bombay sent here a priest who after a few years will be replaced. His presence is necessary, because here come the pilgrims from the outskirts of Persia (Yazd, Kerman) and from India and remain in this sacred place for several months or years.\n\nIn 1876 English traveler James Bruce visited Ateshgah. He noted that the Bombay Parsi Punchayat provides a permanent presence in the temple of their priest. Pierre Ponafidine visited the temple at the same time and mentioned about two priests from Bombay.\nE. Orsolle, who visited the temple after Bruce, said that after Parsi priest died in 1864, the Parsi Punchayat of Bombay a few years later sent another priest here, but the pilgrims who came here from India and Iran have already forgotten the sanctuary, and in 1880 there was nobody.\nO'Donovan visited the temple in 1879 and refers about religious worship of Guebres.\n\nIn 1898 in the «Men and Women of India» magazine was published an article entitled \"The ancient Zoroastrian temple in Baku. Author calls Ateshgah as \"Parsi temple,\" and notes that the last Zoroastrian priest was sent there for about 30 years ago (that is, in the 1860s.).\nJ. Henry in 1905, in his book also noted that 25 years ago (i.e. about in 1880) in Surakhani died last Parsi priest.\n\nThere are several inscriptions on the Ateshgah. They are all in either Sanskrit or Punjabi, with the exception of one Persian inscription that occurs below an accompanying Sanskrit invocation to Lord Ganesha and Jwala Ji. Although the Persian inscription contains grammatical errors, both the inscriptions contain the same year date of 1745 Common Era (Samvat/संवत 1802/१८०२ and Hijri 1158/١١٥٨). Taken as a set, the dates on the inscriptions range from \"Samvat\" 1725 to \"Samvat\" 1873, which corresponds to the period from 1668 CE to 1816 CE. This, coupled with the assessment that the structure looks relatively new, has led some scholars to postulate the 17th century as its likely period of construction. One press report asserts that local records exist that state that the structure was built by the Baku Hindu traders community around the time of the fall of the Shirvanshah dynasty and annexation by the Russian Empire following the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723).\n\nThe inscriptions in the temple in Sanskrit (in Nagari Devanagari script) and Punjabi (in Gurmukhi script) identify the site as a place of Hindu and Sikh worship, and state it was built and consecrated for Jwala Ji, the modern Hindu fire deity. \"Jwala\" (जवाला/ज्वाला) means flame in Sanskrit (c.f. Indo-European cognates: proto-Indo-European \"guelh\", English: \"glow\", Lithuanian: \"zvilti\") and \"Ji\" is an honorific used in the Indian subcontinent. There is a famed shrine to Jwala Ji in the Himalayas, in the settlement of Jawalamukhi, in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India to which the Atashgah bears strong resemblance and on which some scholars (such as A. V. Williams Jackson) suggested the current structure may have been modeled. However, other scholars have stated that some Jwala Ji devotees used to refer to the Kangra shrine as the 'smaller Jwala Ji' and the Baku shrine as the 'greater Jwala Ji'. Other deities mentioned in the inscriptions include Ganesha and Shiva. The Punjabi language inscriptions are quotations from the Adi Granth, while some of the Sanskrit ones are drawn from the \"Sat Sri Ganesaya namah\" text.\n\nIn 1876, James Bryce visited the region and found that \"the most remarkable mineral product is naphtha, which bursts forth in many places, but most profusely near Baku, on the coast of the Caspian, in strong springs, some of which are said to always be burning.\" Without referencing the Atashgah by name, he mentioned of the Zoroastrians that \"after they were extirpated from Persia by the Mohammedans, who hate them bitterly, some few occasionally slunk here on pilgrimage\" and that \"under the more tolerant sway of the Czar, a solitary priest of fire is maintained by the Parsee community of Bombay, who inhabits a small temple built over one of the springs\".\n\nThe temple was examined in the late 19th and early 20th century by Parsi dasturs, some of whom had also visited the Jwala Ji at Kangra in the Himalayas. Based on the inscriptions and the structure, their assessment was that the temple was a Hindu and Sikh shrine. In 1925, a Zoroastrian priest and academic Jivanji Jamshedji Modi traveled to Baku to determine if the temple had indeed been once a Zoroastrian place of worship. Until then (and again today), the site was visited by Zoroastrian pilgrims from India. In his \"Travels Outside Bombay\", Modi observed that \"not just me but any Parsee who is a little familiar with our Hindu or Sikh brethren's religion, their temples and their customs, after examining this building with its inscriptions, architecture, etc., would conclude that this is not a [Zoroastrian] Atash Kadeh but is a Hindu Temple and Gurdawa, whose Brahmins (priests) used to worship fire (Sanskrit: Agni).\"\n\nBesides the physical evidence indicating that the complex was a Hindu place of worship, the existing structural features are not consistent with those for any other Zoroastrian or Sikh places of worship (for instance, cells for ascetics, fireplace open to all sides, ossuary pit and no water source. It cannot be ruled out that the site may once have been a Zoroastrian place of worship.\n\nJ. Unvala visited temple in 1935 and noted that its structure is pure Sasanian style.\n\nThe fire was once fed by a vent from a subterranean natural gas field located directly beneath the complex, but heavy exploitation of the natural gas reserves in the area during Soviet rule resulted in the flame going out in 1969. Today, the museum's fire is fed by mains gas piped in from Baku city.\n\nThere were local claims made to a visiting Zoroastrian dastur in the early 20th century that the Russian czar Alexander III had also witnessed Hindu fire prayer rituals at this location. However, this has been rejected as hearsay and of dubious gossip.\n\nAn illustration of the Baku Fire Temple was included on two denominations of Azerbaijan's first issue of postage stamps, released in 1919. Five oil derricks appear in the background.\n\nBy a presidential order issued in December 2007, the shrine complex, which had hitherto been officially associated with the \"Shirvanshah Palace Complex State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve\" (\"Государственного историко-архитектурного музея-заповедника «Комплекс Дворца Ширваншахов»\") was declared as a distinct reserve by the Azeri government (the \"Ateshgah Temple State Historical Architectural Reserve, \"Государственным историко-архитектурным заповедником «Храм Атешгях»\").\n\nIn July 2009, the Azeri President, Ilham Aliyev, announced a grant of AZN 1 million for the upkeep of the shrine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4382952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4382952", "title": "Aztec religion", "text": "Aztec religion\n\nThe Aztec religion is the Mesoamerican religion of the Aztecs. Like other Mesoamerican religions, it had elements of human sacrifice in connection with a large number of religious festivals which were held according to patterns of the Aztec calendar. Polytheistic in its theology, the religion recognized a large and ever increasing pantheon of gods and goddesses; the Aztecs would often incorporate deities whose cults came from other geographic regions or peoples into their own religious practice. \nAztec cosmology divides the world into thirteen heavens and nine earthly layers or netherworlds (the first heaven overlapping with the first terrestrial layer, heaven and earth meeting at the surface of the Earth), each level associated with a specific set of deities and astronomical objects. The most important celestial entities in Aztec religion were the Sun, the Moon, and the planet Venus (both as \"morning star\" and \"evening star\")—all of these bearing different symbolic and religious meanings as well as associations with certain deities and geographical places—whose worship was rooted in a significant reverence for the Sun and Moon, whose natural functions are truly of immense importance to life on Earth. They also believed that the sun is their god, and they battled their way to heaven. So the Aztecs call themselves \"Warriors of the Sun\".\n\nMany leading deities of the Aztec pantheon were worshipped by previous Mesoamerican civilizations, gods such as Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, who were venerated by different names in most cultures throughout the history of Mesoamerica. For the Aztecs especially important deities were the rain god Tlaloc, the god Huitzilopochtli—patron of the Mexica tribe—as well as Quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent, wind god, culture hero, and god of civilization and order, and elusive\nTezcatlipoca, the shrewd god of destiny and fortune, connected with war and sorcery. Each of these gods had their own shrine, side-by-side at the top of the largest pyramid in the Aztec capital Mexico-Tenochtitlan—Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli were both worshipped here at this dual temple, while a third monument in the plaza before the Templo Mayor was devoted to the wind god Ehecatl.\n\nThe concept of \"Teotl\" is central to the Aztecs. \nThe term is often translated as \"god\", but may have held more abstract aspects of divinity or supernatural energy akin to the Polynesian concept of Mana.\n\nThe nature of \"Teotl\" is a key element in the understanding of the fall of the Aztec empire, because it seems that the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II and the Aztecs in general referred to Cortés and the conquistadors as \"Teotl\"—it has been widely believed that this means that they believed them to be gods, but a better understanding of \"Teotl\" might suggest that they were merely seen as \"mysterious\" or \"inexplicable\".\n\nThe many gods of the Aztecs can be grouped into complexes related to different themes. The Aztecs would often adopt gods from different cultures and allow them to be worshiped as part of their pantheon – the fertility god, Xipe Totec, for example, was originally a god of the Yopi (the Nahuatl name of the Tlapanec people) but became an integrated part of the Aztec belief system; sometimes foreign gods would be identified with an already existing god. Other deities, for example Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl, had roots in earlier civilizations of Mesoamerica and were worshiped by many cultures and by many names. Some gods embodied aspects of nature. A large group of gods were related to pulque, drunkenness, excess, fun and games. Other gods were associated with specific trades. Many gods had multiple aspects with different names, where each name highlighted a specific function or trait of the god. Occasionally, two distinct gods were conflated into one, and quite often deities transformed into one another within a single story. Aztec images sometimes combined attributes of several divinities.\n\nAztec scholar H. B. Nicholson (1971) classed the gods into three groups according to their conceptual meaning in general Mesoamerican religion. The first group he called the \"Celestial creativity – Divine Paternalism group\", the second, the Earth-mother gods, the pulque gods and Xipe Totec. The third group, the War-Sacrifice-Sanguinary Nourishment group contained such gods as Ome Tochtli, Huitzilopochtli, Mictlantecutli and Mixcoatl. Instead of Nicholson's subtle classification in the following a more impressionist classification is presented.\n\nCultural Gods\n\nNature gods\n\nGods of creation\n\nGods of pulque and excess\n\nGods of maize and fertility\n\nGods of death and the underworld\n\nTrade gods\n\nReligion was part of all levels of Aztec society. On the state level, religion was controlled by the Tlatoani and the high priests governing the main temples in the ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. This level involved the large monthly festivals and a number of specific rituals centered around the ruler dynasty and attempting to stabilize both the political and cosmic systems, these rituals were the ones that involved a sacrifice of humans. For example, on the feast of Huey Tozoztli, the ruler himself ascended Mount Tlaloc and engaged in autosacrifice in order to petition the rains. Throughout society, each level had their own rituals and deities and played their part in the larger rituals of the community. For example, the class of Pochteca merchants were involved in the feast Tlaxochimaco where the merchant deity would be celebrated and slaves bought on specific slave markets by long-distance traders would be sacrificed. On the feast of Ochpaniztli, all commoners participated in sweeping the streets, and they also undertook ritual bathing. The most spectacular ritual was the New Fire ceremony which took place every 52 years and involved every citizen of the Aztec realm, during this commoners would destroy house utensils, quench all fires and receive new fire from the bonfire on top of Mt. Huixachtlan, lit on the chest of a sacrificed person by the high priests.\n\nIn the Nahuatl language, the word for priest was \"tlamacazqui\" meaning \"giver of things\"—the main responsibility of the priesthood was to make sure that the gods were given their due in the form of offerings, ceremonies and sacrifices.\n\nThe Tlatoani of Tenochtitlan was the head of the cult of Huitzilopochtli and thus of the state religion of the Aztec empire. He had special priestly duties in different rituals on the state level.\n\nHowever, the Aztec religious organization was not entirely under his authority. Sahagun and Duran describe the pairs of high priests (Quetzalcoatls) who were in charge of the major pilgrimage centres (Cholula and Tenochtitlan) as enjoying immense respect from all levels of Aztec society – akin to archbishops – and a level of authority that partly transcended national boundaries. Under these religious heads were many tiers of priests, priestesses, novices, 'nuns' and 'monks' (some part-time) who ran the cults of the various gods and goddesses. Sahagun reports that the priests had a very strict training, and had to live very austere and ethical lives involving prolonged vigils, fasts and penances. For instance, they often had to bleed themselves and undertake prescribed self-mortifications in the buildup to sacrificial rites.\n\nAdditionally, Sahagun refers to classes of religious specialists not affiliated with the established priesthood. This included wandering curers, black magicians and other occultists (of which the Aztecs identified many types, most of which they feared) and hermits. Finally, the military orders, professions (e.g. traders – pochteca) and wards (calpulli) each operated their own lodge dedicated to their specific god. The heads of these lodges, although not full-time religious specialists, had some ritual and moral duties. Duran also describes lodge members as having the responsibility of raising sufficient goods to host the festivals of their specific patron deity. This included annually obtaining and training a suitable slave or captive to represent and die as the 'image' of their deity in that festival.\n\nAztec temples were basically offering mounds: solid pyramidal structures crammed with special soils, sacrifices, treasures and other offerings. Buildings around the base of the pyramid, and sometimes a small chamber under the pyramid, stored ritual items and provided lodgings and staging for priests, dancers and temple orchestras. The pyramids were buried under a new surface every several years (especially every 52 years – the Aztec century). Thus the pyramid-temples of important deities constantly grew in size.\n\nIn front of every major temple lay a large plaza. This sometimes held important ritual platforms such as the 'eagle stone' where some victims were slain. Plazas were where the bulk of worshippers gathered to watch rites and dances performed; to join in the songs and sacrifices (the audience often bled themselves during the rites) and to partake in any festival foods. Nobility sat on tiered seating under awnings around the plaza periphery, and some conducted part of the ceremonies on the temple.\n\nContinual rebuilding enabled Tlatoani and other dignitaries to celebrate their achievements by dedicating new sculptures, monuments and other renovations to the temples. For festivals, temple steps and tiers were also festooned with flowers, banners and other decorations. Each pyramid had a flat top to accommodate dancers and priests performing rites. Close to the temple steps there was usually a sacrificial slab and braziers.\n\nThe temple house (calli) itself was relatively small, although the more important ones had high and ornately carved internal ceilings. To maintain the sanctity of the gods, these temple houses were kept fairly dark and mysterious – a characteristic that was further enhanced by having their interiors swirling with smoke from copal (incense) and the burning of offerings. Cortes and Diaz describe these sanctuaries as containing sacred images and relics of the gods, often bejeweled but shrouded under ritual clothes and other veils, and hidden behind curtains hung with feathers and bells. Flowers and offerings (including a great amount of blood) generally covered much of the floors and walls near these images. Each image stood on a pedestal and occupied its own sanctuary. Larger temples also featured subsidiary chambers ('little houses') accommodating lesser deities.\n\nIn the ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan, the most important temple was the Great Temple which was a double pyramid with two temples on top. One was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli this temple was called \"Coatepetl\" \"snake mountain\", and the other temple was dedicated to Tlaloc. Below the Tlatoani were the high priests of these two temples. Both high priests were called by the title Quetzalcoatl – the high priest of Huitzilopochtli was \"Quetzalcoatl Totec Tlamacazqui\" and the high priest of Tlaloc was \"Quetzalcoatl Tlaloc Tlamacazqui\". Other important temples were located in the four divisions of the town: for example the temple called \"Yopico\" in \"Moyotlan\" which was dedicated to Xipe Totec. Furthermore, all the Calpullis had special temples dedicated to the patron gods of the calpulli. Priests were educated at the Calmecac if they were from noble families and in the Telpochcalli if they were commoners.\n\nThe Aztec world consisted of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including Tamoanchan, the mythical origin of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called Mictlan, \"place of death\"), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus as the sun was believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. The sky had thirteen layers, the highest of which was called Omeyocan (\"place of duality\") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god Ometeotl. The lowest layer of the sky was a verdant spring-like place with abundant water called Tlalocan (\"the place of Tlaloc\").\n\nAfter death the soul of the Aztec went to one of three places: the sun, Mictlan, or Tlalocan. Souls of fallen warriors and women that died in childbirth would transform into hummingbirds that followed the sun on its journey through the sky. Souls of people who died from less glorious causes would go to Mictlan. Those who drowned would go to Tlalocan.\nIn Aztec cosmology, as in Mesoamerica in general, geographical features such as caves and mountains held symbolic value as places of crossing between the upper and nether worlds. The cardinal directions were symbolically connected to the religious layout of the world as well; each direction was associated with specific colors and gods.\n\nTo the Aztecs, death was instrumental in the perpetuation of creation, and gods and humans alike had the responsibility of sacrificing themselves in order to allow life to continue. This worldview is best described in the myth of the five suns recorded in the Codex Chimalpopoca, which recounts how Quetzalcoatl stole the bones of the previous generation in the underworld, and how later the gods created four successive worlds or \"suns\" for their subjects to live in, all of which were destroyed. Then by an act of self-sacrifice, one of the gods, Nanahuatzin (\"the pimpled one\") caused a fifth and final sun to rise where the first humans, made out of maize dough, could live thanks to his sacrifice. Humans were responsible for the sun's continued revival. Blood sacrifice in various forms were conducted. Both humans and animals were sacrificed, depending on the god to be placated and the ceremony being conducted, and priests of some gods were sometimes required to provide their own blood through self-mutilation.\nSacrificial rituals among the Aztecs and in Mesoamerica, in general, must be seen in the context of religious cosmology: sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise, each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and quail. But the larger the effort required of the god, the greater the sacrifice had to be. Blood-fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For some of the most important rites, a priest would offer his own blood, by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, or offer a human life or even a god's life. The people who were sacrificed came from many segments of society, and might be a war captive, slave, or a member of Aztec society; the sacrifice might also be man or woman, adult or child, noble or commoner.\n\nAn important aspect of Aztec ritual was the impersonation of deities. Priests or otherwise specially elected individuals would be dressed up to achieve the likeness of a specific deity. A person with the honourable charge of impersonating a god was called \"ixiptlatli\" and was venerated as an actual physical manifestation of the god until the inevitable end when the god's likeness had to be killed as the ultimate sacrifice under great circumstance and festivities.\n\nAs with the impersonation of gods, Aztec ritual was often a reenactment of a mythical event which at once served to remind the Aztecs of their myths but also served to perpetuate the world by repeating the important events of the creation.\n\nThe Aztec religious year was connected mostly to the natural 365-day calendar, the xiuhpohualli (\"yearcount\") – which followed the agricultural year. Each of the 18 twenty-day months of the religious year had its particular religious festival – most of which were connected to agricultural themes. The greatest festival was the \"Xiuhmolpilli\" or New Fire ceremony held every 52 years when the ritual and agricultural calendars coincided and a new cycle started. In the table below, the veintena festivals are shown, the deities with which they were associated and the kinds of rituals involved. The descriptions of the rites are based on the descriptions given in Sahagúns \"Primeros Memoriales\", and the Florentine Codex and of Fray Diego Duráns \"Of the Gods and rites\" – all of which provide detailed accounts of the rituals written in Nahuatl soon after the conquest.\n\nThe main deity in the Mexica religion was the sun god and war god, Huitzilopochtli. He directed the Mexicas to found a city on the site where they would see an eagle, devouring (not all chronicles agree on what the eagle was devouring, one says it was a precious bird, and though Father Duran says it was a snake, this is not mentioned in any pre-Hispanic source) perched on a fruit bearing nopal cactus. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli had to kill his nephew, Cópil, and throw his heart on the lake. But, since Cópil was his relative, Huitzilopochtli decided to honor him, and caused cactus to grow over Cópil's heart which became a sacred place.\n\nLegend has it that this is the site on which the Mexicas built their capital city of Tenochtitlan. Tenochtitlan was built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco where modern-day Mexico City is located. This legendary vision is pictured on the Coat of Arms of Mexico.\n\nAccording to their own history, when the Mexicas arrived in the Anahuac Valley around Lake Texcoco, they were considered by the other groups as the least civilized of all. The Mexicas decided to learn, and they took all they could from other peoples, especially from the ancient Toltec (whom they seem to have partially confused with the more ancient civilization of Teotihuacan). To the Mexicas, the Toltecs were the originators of all culture; \"Toltecayotl\" was a synonym for culture. Mexica legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of Quetzalcoatl with the mythical city of Tollan, which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.\n\nIn the process, they adopted most of the Toltec/Nahua (code) pantheon, but they also made significant changes in their religion. As the Mexica rose in power, they adopted the Nahua gods at equal status to their own. For instance, Tlaloc was the rain god of all the Nahuatl-speaking peoples. They put their local god Huitzilopochtli at the same level as the ancient Nahua god, and also replaced the Nahua Sun god with their own. Thus, Tlaloc/Huitzilopochtli represents the duality of water and fire, as evidenced by the twin pyramids uncovered near the Zocalo in Mexico City in the late 1970s, and it reminds us of the warrior ideals of the Aztec: the Aztec glyph of war is \"burning water\".\n\nHuman sacrifice was practiced on a grand scale throughout the Aztec empire, although the exact figures are unknown. At Tenochtitlán, the principal Aztec city, according to Ross Hassig \"between 10,000 and 80,400 persons\" were sacrificed over the course of four days for the dedication of the Great Pyramid in 1487. Excavations of the offerings in the main temple has provided some insight in the process, but the dozens of remains excavated are far short of the thousands of sacrifices recorded by eyewitnesses and other historical accounts. For millennia, the practice of human sacrifice was widespread in Mesoamerican and South American cultures. It was a theme in the Olmec religion, which thrived between 1200 BC and 400 BC and among the Maya. Human sacrifice was a very complex ritual. Every sacrifice had to be meticulously planned from the type of victim to the specific ceremony needed for the god. The sacrificial victims were usually warriors but sometimes slaves, depending upon the god and needed ritual. The higher the rank of the warrior the better he is looked at as a sacrifice. The victim(s) would then take on the persona of the god he was to be sacrificed for. The victim(s) would be housed, fed, and dressed accordingly. This process could last up to a year. When the sacrificial day arrived, the victim(s) would participate in the specific ceremonies of the god. These ceremonies were used to exhaust the victim so that he would not struggle during the ceremony. Then five priests, known as the Tlenamacac, performed the sacrifice usually at the top of a pyramid. The victim would be laid upon the table, held down and then have his heart cut out.\n\n\n\n"}

Typically, the definition covers Western Norway (Vestlandet) and Southern Norway (Sørlandet), which includes the counties of Rogaland (typically called the \"buckle\" of the Bible Belt), Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, Møre og Romsdal, Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder. However, the most urban areas, such as Stavanger (once known as the 'religious capital of Norway'), have become strongly secularised since the 1960s and are no longer considered part of the Bible Belt.\n\nSocioeconomic gender equality in the Bible Belt is the lowest in all of Norway; the major cities of Bergen, Stavanger and Kristiansand, however, are amongst the most progressive municipalities in the country. In the 1926 referendum on the repeal of prohibition on alcohol, the Bible Belt cast a strong vote against repeal (73.1% in Rogaland, 77.2% in Møre og Romsdal), unlike the rest of Norway. The Bible Belt also has a strong pietist movement, that opposes the central authority of the State Church of Norway. Rogaland is home to many missionary associations and the strongest base of the two main Christian democratic parties, the Moderate Left and Christian People's Party (the latter originally being from Hordaland). In Sørlandet, Sunday church attendance is observed by 2 in 10 people, compared to slightly less than 1 in 10 in Norway on average.\n\nAust-Agder, Vest-Agder and Rogaland have the highest percentage of married farmers, and the lowest percentage of cohabitants. Rogaland and Sogn og Fjordane have the lowest proportion of divorces and separations, and the latter country also has the highest rate of unmarried farmers. According to research institute Forskning.no this relationship pattern is typical of the Bible Belt.\n\nThere is also a \"Little Bible Belt\" (\"lille bibelbeltet\") in the southeast near the Swedish border, covering Rømskog, Marker and Aremark.\n"}
{"id": "16975235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16975235", "title": "Biblical Sabbath", "text": "Biblical Sabbath\n\nBiblical Sabbath is a weekly day of rest or time of worship given in the Bible as the seventh day. It is observed differently in Judaism and Christianity and informs a similar occasion in several other faiths. Though many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition of \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\".\n\nObservation and remembrance of Sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments (the fourth in the original Jewish, the Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions, the third in Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions), sometimes referred to individually as the \"Sabbath Commandment\". Most people who observe Biblical Sabbath regard it as having been made for man () at Creation (), and instituted as a perpetual covenant for the people of Israel (, , ), a rule that also applies to proselytes, and a sign respecting two events: the seventh day, during which God rested after having completed Creation in six days (, ), and God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt ().\n\nThe Anglicized term \"Sabbath\" is in Hebrew \"Shabbat\", meaning \"day of rest\".\nThe name form is \"Shabbethai\" a name appearing three times in the Tanakh. The Talmud also contains a pun on \"shebeth\", where it secondarily means \"dill\", a spice. Another related word is modern Hebrew \"shevita\", a labor strike, with the same focus on active cessation of labor. And in over thirty languages other than English, the common name for Saturday is a cognate of \"Sabbath\".\n\nA cognate Babylonian \"Sapattu\" or \"Sabattu\" is reconstructed from the lost fifth Enûma Eliš creation account, which is read as: \"\"[Sa]bbatu\" shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly\".\nIt is regarded as a form of Sumerian \"sa-bat\" (\"mid-rest\"), rendered in Akkadian as \"um nuh libbi\" (\"day of mid-repose\").\n\nThe dependent Greek cognate is \"Sabbaton\", used in the New Testament 68 times. Two inflections, Hebrew \"Shabbathown\" and Greek \"σαββατισμός\" (\"Sabbatismós\"), also appear. The Hebrew form refers to High Sabbaths. The Greek form is cognate to the Septuagint verb \"sabbatizo\" (e.g., ; ; ; ). In English, the concept of \"Sabbatical\" is cognate to these two forms.\n\nThe King James Bible uses the English form \"sabbath(s)\" 172 times. In the Old Testament, \"sabbath(s)\" translates \"Shabbath\" all 107 times (including 35 plurals), plus \"shebeth\" three times, \"shabath\" once, and the related \"mishbath\" once (plural). In the New Testament, \"sabbath\" translates \"Sabbaton\" 59 times and \"prosabbaton\" once (the day before Sabbath); \"Sabbaton\" is also translated as \"week\" nine times, by synecdoche.\n\nSabbath Year or \"Shmita\" (, \"Shmittah\", literally \"release\"), also called Sabbatical Year, is the seventh (שביעי, \"shbiy'iy\") year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by Torah for the Land of Israel, relatively little observed in Biblical tradition, but still observed in contemporary Judaism. During \"Shmita\", the land is left to lie fallow and all agricultural activity—including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting—is forbidden by Torah and Jewish law. By tradition, other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as preventative measures only, not to improve the growth of trees or plants; additionally, whatever fruits grow of their own accord during that year are deemed \"hefker\" (ownerless), not for the landowner but for the poor, the stranger, and the beasts of the field; these fruits may be picked by anyone. A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of \"Shmita\" produce. When the year ended, all debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted (); in similar fashion, Torah requires a slave who had worked for six years to go free in the seventh year. Leviticus 25 promises bountiful harvests to those who observe \"Shmita\", and describes its observance as a test of religious faith. The term \"Shmita\" is translated \"release\" five times in the Book of Deuteronomy (from the root שמט, \"shamat\", \"\"desist\", \"remit\"\").\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew, Mark, and Luke contain several synoptic accounts, which John occasionally concurs in.\n\n\n\n\nThree primary interpretative frameworks exist, with many subcategories. Interpretation is complicated by the differing meanings attributed to unambiguous seventh-day Sabbath prior to the resurrection of Jesus; the ambiguity of events after the resurrection, including first-day and seventh-day events (, , perhaps ; , , , , , and ); and several early Christian observances being attested as daily or on nonspecific days (, , ). Early Christians also observed Jewish practices as a sect of Judaism (, , , , , ), and observed Tanakh feasts (Passover, , , , , ; Pentecost, , , , ; Atonement, ). Interpreters of each framework consider the high regard for the New Covenant described in (cf. ) as supporting their Sabbath positions.\n\nAt least two branches of Christianity keep a seventh-day Sabbath, though historically they are not derived one from the other: the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Seventh-day Sabbatarians. Of different outlooks in some respects, they share others. Just as in the Jewish calendar, the Orthodox begin and end every ecclesial day at sunset, including the Sabbath. Both branches thus observe the Sabbath from what the civil calendar identifies as Friday sunset until Saturday sunset. Both identify the Sabbath with the day of rest established by God as stated in Genesis 2, a day to be kept holy. Both identify Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Sabbath, and acknowledge that he faithfully kept the Sabbath throughout his life on earth. Both accept the admonitions of St. Ignatius on the keeping of the Sabbath.\n\nSeventh-day Sabbatarians rest on the seventh Hebrew day. Jewish \"Shabbat\" is observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night; it is also observed by a minority of Christians. Thirty-nine activities prohibited on \"Shabbat\" are listed in Tractate \"Shabbat\" (Talmud). Customarily, \"Shabbat\" is ushered in by lighting candles shortly before sunset, at halakhically calculated times that change from week to week and from place to place. Observance in Hebrew Scriptures was universally from sixth-day evening to seventh-day evening (, cf. ) on a seven-day week; \"Shabbat\" ends approximately one hour after sunset by rabbinical ordinance to extend the Tanakh's sunset-to-sunset Sabbath into the first day of the week. The Jewish interpretation usually states that the New Covenant () refers to the future Messianic Kingdom.\n\nSeveral Christian denominations (such as Seventh Day Baptist, Seventh-day Adventist, Sabbath Rest Advent Church, Church of God (Seventh Day), and other Churches of God) observe Sabbath similarly to or less rigorously than Judaism, but observance ends at Saturday sunset instead of Saturday nightfall. Like the Jews with \"Shabbat\", they believe that keeping seventh-day Sabbath is a moral responsibility, equal to that of any of the Ten Commandments, that honors God as Creator and Deliverer. The Christian seventh-day interpretation usually states that Sabbath belongs inherently to all nations (, , ) and remains part of the New Covenant after the crucifixion of Jesus (, , , ). Many seventh-day Sabbatarians also use \"Lord's Day\" to mean the seventh day, based on Scriptures in which God calls the day \"my Sabbath\" () and \"to the \" (); some count Sunday separately as Lord's Day and many consider it appropriate for communal worship (but not for first-day rest, which would be considered breaking the Ten Commandments).\n\nIn this way, St. Ignatius saw believers \"no longer observing the [Jewish] Sabbath, but living in the observance of the Lord's Day\", and amplified this point as follows: \"Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness ... But let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed space, nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense in them. And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord's Day as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days.\"\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist official 28 fundamental beliefs (at 20) state:The beneficent Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive acts. (Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Luke 4:16; Isa. 56:5, 6; 58:13, 14; Matt. 12:1-12; Ex. 31:13-17; Eze. 20:12, 20; Deut. 5:12-15; Heb. 4:1-11; Lev. 23:32; Mark 1:32.)\n\nThe Doctrinal Points of the Church of God (7th day) (Salem Conference, at 17) state:We should observe the seventh day of the week (Saturday), from even to even, as the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Evening is at sunset when day ends and another day begins. No other day has ever been sanctified as the day of rest. The Sabbath Day begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. Genesis 2:1-3; Exodus 20:8-11; Isaiah 58:13-14; 56:1-8; Acts 17:2; Acts 18:4, 11; Luke 4:16; Mark 2:27-28; Matthew 12:10-12; Hebrews 4:1-11; Genesis 1:5, 13-14; Nehemiah 13:19.\n\nBoth Jewish and Christian seventh-day interpretation usually state that Jesus' teachings relate to the Pharisaic position on Sabbath observance, and that Jesus kept seventh-day Sabbath throughout his life on earth.\n\nNoticing the rise of blue laws, the Seventh-day Adventist church in particular has traditionally taught that in the end time a coalition of religious and secular authorities will enforce an international Sunday law; church pioneers saw observance of seventh-day Sabbath as a \"mark\" or \"seal\" or test of God's people that seals them, even as those who do not observe Sunday rest will be persecuted and killed. Ellen G. White interpreted , , , , and in this way, describing the subject of persecution in prophecy as being about Sabbath commandments.\n\nMost Christians worship communally on the first (Hebrew or Roman) day. In most Christian denominations (Roman Catholic, some Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant), the \"Lord's Day\" (Sunday) is the fulfillment of the \"Sabbath\" (Catholic Catechism 2175), which is kept in commemoration of the resurrection of Christ, and often celebrated with the Eucharist (Catholic Catechism 2177). It is often also the day of rest. Lord's Day is considered both the first day and the \"eighth day\" of the seven-day week, symbolizing both first creation and new creation (2174). (Alternatively, in some calendars, Sunday is designated the seventh day of the week.) Relatively few Christians regard first-day observance as entailing all of the ordinances of \"Shabbat\". This interpretation usually states that the Holy Spirit through the Apostles instituted the worship celebration of the first day to commemorate Jesus' resurrection, and that the New Covenant transfers Sabbath-keeping (whether defined as rest or communal worship or both) to the first day by implication. In Roman Catholicism, the transfer is described as based on their church's authority and papal infallibility.\n\nRoman Catholics (and many Protestants) view the first day as a day for assembly for worship (2178, ), but consider a day of rigorous rest not obligatory on Christians (, ). Catholics count the prohibition of servile work as transferred from seventh-day Sabbath to Sunday (2175-6), but do not hinder participation in \"ordinary and innocent occupations\". Similarly, second-century father Justin Martyr believed in keeping perpetual Sabbath by repentance, holding that Gentile Christians need not rest as Jews were commanded; but he accepted extant non-Judaizing seventh-day Sabbatarian Christians \"in all things as kinsmen and brethren\".\n\nIn other Protestant denominations, Lord's Day is kept as a rest day with similar rigor as Jewish Sabbath. The Westminster Confession of Faith 21:7-8, a Reformed Sabbatarian creed, states:As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in His Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, He has particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him (Ex. 20:8, 20:10-11, Is. 56:2, 56:4, 56:6-7): which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week: and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week (Ge. 2:2-3, 1 Cor. 16:1-2, Ac. 20:7), which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's Day (Rev. 1:10), and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath (Ex. 20:8, 20:10, Mt. 5:17). This Sabbath is to be kept holy unto the Lord when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations (Ex. 20:8, 16:23, 16:25-26, 16:29-30, 31:15-17, Is. 58:13, Neh. 13:15-19, 13:21-22), but also are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy (Is. 58:13).\n\nLikewise, the General Rules of the Methodist Church required \"attending upon all the ordinances of God\" including \"the public worship of God\" and prohibited \"profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling\".\n\nThe following textual evidence for first-day assembly is usually combined with the notion that the rest day should follow the assembly day to support first-day Sabbatarianism. On the first day of the week (usually considered the day of Firstfruits), after Jesus has been raised from the dead (), he appears to Mary Magdalene, Peter, Cleopas, and others. \"On the evening of that first day of the week\" (Roman time), or the evening beginning the second day (Hebrew time), the resurrected Jesus appears at a meeting of ten apostles and other disciples (). The same time of the week \"a week later\" (NIV) or, more literally, \"after eight days again\" inclusive (KJV), Jesus appears to the eleven apostles and others (). After Jesus ascends (), on the feast of Pentecost or Shavuot (the 50th day from Firstfruits and thus usually calculated as the first day of the week), the Spirit of God is given to the disciples, who baptize 3,000 people into the apostolic fellowship. Later, on one occasion in Troas, the early Christians meet on the first day (Hebrew) to break bread and to listen to Christian preaching (). Paul also states that the churches of Corinth and Galatia should set aside donations on the first day for collection (). Didache 14:1 (AD 70-120?) contains an ambiguous text, translated by Roberts as, \"But every Lord's day gather yourselves together, and break bread, and give thanksgiving\"; the first clause in Greek, \"κατά δέ κυρίου\", literally means \"On the Lord's of the Lord\", and translators supply the elided noun (e.g., \"day\", \"commandment\" (from 13:7), or \"doctrine\"). Gleason Archer regards this as clearly referring to Sunday. Breaking bread may refer to Christian fellowship, agape feasts, or Eucharist (cf. , ). Other interpreters believe these references do not support the concept of transfer of the seventh-day rest, and some add that they do not sufficiently prove that Sunday observance was an established practice in the primitive New Testament church.\n\nBy the second century, Justin Martyr stated, \"We all gather on the day of the sun\" (recalling both the creation of light and the resurrection); and the Epistle of Barnabas on stated the eighth-day assembly marks the resurrection and the new creation: \"He is saying there: 'It is not these sabbaths of the present age that I find acceptable, but the one of my own appointment: the one that, after I have set all things at rest, is to usher in the Eighth Day, the commencement of a new world.' (And we too rejoice in celebrating the Eighth Day; because that was when Jesus rose from the dead, and showed Himself again, and ascended into heaven.)\"\n\nEthiopian Orthodox and Eritrean Orthodox Christians (both of which are branches of Oriental Orthodoxy) distinguish between the Sabbath (seventh day) and Lord's Day (first day) and observe both. Seventh-day Adventists in several islands of the Pacific (Tonga; Western Samoa; Tokelau; Wallis & Futuna; Phoenix & Line Islands) observe Sunday as the practice on ships in the Pacific had been to change days at the 180° meridian. The islands were well to the east of this line, so the missionaries observed the Sabbath on the day sequence of the Western Hemisphere. However, the Tonga islands used the same days as New Zealand and Australia, so the missionaries were observing the seventh-day Sabbath on the day the secular authorities called Sunday.\n\nThe International Date Line (IDL) was placed east of Tonga to align its weekdays with New Zealand and Fiji. \nConsequently, Tonga's time zone is UTC+13 rather than UTC−12:00, as it would be if the Date Line ran along the 180° meridian.\nHowever, the SDA church observes the Sabbath as though the IDL followed the 180° meridian.\n\nWhen the International Date Line was moved, islanders who had been worshiping on Sabbath were suddenly worshiping on Sunday because of a man made international treaty. After much discussion within the church, it was decided that the islanders would continue to worship on the same day as they always had, even though the name of the day had been changed from Saturday to Sunday by decree. However this situation is not without conflict.\n\n\"Note\": \n\nNon-Sabbatarians affirm human liberty not to observe a weekly rest or worship day. While keepers of weekly days usually believe in religious liberty, non-Sabbatarians are particularly free to uphold Sabbath principles, or not, without limiting observance to either Saturday or Sunday. Some advocate Sabbath rest on any chosen day of the week, and some advocate Sabbath as a symbolic metaphor for rest in Christ; the concept of \"Lord's Day\" is usually treated as synonymous with \"Sabbath\". The non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus' obedience and the New Covenant fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, which are thus often considered abolished or abrogated.\n\nSome of Jesus' teachings are considered as redefining the Sabbath laws of the Pharisees (, , ). Since Jesus is understood to have fulfilled Torah (, ), non-Sabbatarian Christians believe that they are not bound by Sabbath as legalists consider themselves to be. Non-Sabbatarians can thus exhibit either Christian liberty or antinomianism. On principles of religious liberty, non-Sabbatarian Jews similarly affirm their freedom not to observe \"Shabbat\" as Orthodox Jews do.\n\nNon-Sabbatarian Christians also cite , in which believers are compared to \"a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts\"; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy (\"tablets of stone\"), but follow a new law written upon \"tablets of human hearts\". adds that \"if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? ... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!\" This is interpreted as teaching that new-covenant Christians are not under the Mosaic law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because \"love is the fulfillment of the law\" (), the new-covenant \"law\" is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.\n\nNon-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people (as in ) often regard this as present spiritual rest and/or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, Irenaeus saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God and an eschatological symbol.\n\nBased on Genesis 2:1-4, Sabbath is considered by seventh-day Sabbatarians to be the first holy day mentioned in the Bible, with God, Adam, and Eve being the first to observe it. In order to reconcile an omnipotent God with a resting on the seventh day of Creation, the notion of active cessation from labor, rather than passive rest, has been regarded as a more consistent reading of God's activity in this passage. Non-Sabbatarians and many first-day Sabbatarians consider this passage not to have instituted observance of Sabbath, which they place as beginning with Moses and the manna. Walter Brueggemann emphasizes Sabbath is rooted in the history of the Book of Exodus.\n\nJesus' statement, \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them,\" is highly debated. Some non-Sabbatarians and others such as Anabaptists believe Jesus greatly reformed the Law and thus that Sabbath could only be justified if it were reaffirmed by Jesus. Antinomianism, generally regarded as a heresy, holds that, because Jesus accomplished all that was required by the law, thus \"fulfilling\" it, he made it unnecessary for anyone to do anything further. Strict Sabbatarians follow or expand Augustine's statement in \"Reply to Faustus\" that Jesus empowered his people to obey the law and gave additional commands that furthered its true intentions. This passage is often related to Colossians 2, from which maintenance, transference, or abolition of Sabbath are variously taught.\n\nThe English Standard Version at (\"Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.\") is taken as affirming non-Sabbatarian freedom from obligations to Sabbath, whether this means only annual Sabbaths () or specifically weekly Sabbath (). This passage's threefold categorization of events is parallel to , , , , ( mentions Sabbaths and festivals but not new moons). Accordingly, non-Sabbatarians and some first-day Sabbatarians believe this passage indicates Sabbath-keeping is part of an Old Covenant that is not mandatory (cf. ). Seventh-day Sabbatarians and strict first-day Sabbatarians believe this passage indicates that weekly Sabbath remains to be kept as a shadow of things future to Paul's day and/or a memorial of creation past.\n\nAdditionally, states, \"And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.\" The ESV footnote regards \"\"in it\" (that is, the cross)\" as equivalent to the closing \"in him\" (Christ). First-day Sabbatarians and non-Sabbatarians often regard Sabbath as changed, either to Lord's Day or to spiritual Sabbath, by the Mosaic law being the \"record of debt\" (ESV) nailed to the cross. Some seventh-day Sabbatarians regard only High Sabbaths as abolished due to their foreshadowing the cross, holding it impossible for weekly Sabbath (which preceded sin) to foreshadow deliverance from sin in the cross. Others see the \"record of debt\" (accusations) as distinct from God's unchanging law, believing it to be in force and affirmed by the evangelists after Jesus died on the cross, regarding Sabbath, new moon, and High Sabbaths not as nailed to the cross but as foreshadowing the eternal plan of God.\n\nThe unique word \"sabbatismos\" in Hebrews 4:9 is translated \"rest\" in the Authorized Version and others; \"Sabbath rest\" in the New International Version and other modern translations; \"Sabbatism\" (a transliteration) in the Darby Bible; \"Sabbath observance\" in the Scriptures 98 Edition; and \"Sabbath keeping\" in the Bible in Basic English. The word also appears in Plutarch, \"De Superstitione\" 3 (Moralia 166A); Justin, \"Dialogue with Trypho\" 23:3; Epiphanius, \"Adversus Haereses\" 30:2:2; \"Martyrium Petri et Pauli\" 1; and \"Apostolic Constitutions\" 2:36:2. Andrew Lincoln states, \"In each of these places the term denotes the observance or celebration of the Sabbath ... Thus the writer to the Hebrews is saying that since the time of Joshua an observance of the Sabbath rest has been outstanding.\" Sabbatarians believe the primary abiding Christian duty intended is weekly Sabbath-keeping, while non-Sabbatarians believe it is spiritual or eschatological Sabbath-keeping; both meanings may be intended. Justin uses \"sabbatismos\" in \"Trypho\" 23:3 to mean weekly Sabbath-keeping.\n\nHowever, Justin does not speak of Hebrews 4, instead holding that there is no longer any need for weekly Sabbath-keeping for anyone. Hippolytus of Rome, in the early third century, interpreted the term in Hebrews 4 to have special reference to a millennial Sabbath kingdom after six millennia of labor. St. Chrysostom interpreted the term as having reference to three rests: God's rest from His labor on the seventh day, the rest of the Israelites in arriving in Canaan, and the heavenly (eschatological) rest for the faithful. He argued that the \"rest\" that \"has been outstanding\" is the heavenly rest, since the first two rests had already been going on. He also interpreted weekly Sabbath as a symbol of this heavenly rest: \"And well did he conclude the argument. For he said not rest but 'Sabbath-keeping'; calling the kingdom 'Sabbath-keeping,' by the appropriate name, and that which they rejoiced in and were attracted by. For as, on the Sabbath He commands to abstain from all evil things; and that those things only which relate to the Service of God should be done, which things the Priests were wont to accomplish, and whatsoever profits the soul, and nothing else; so also [will it be] then.\"\n\nMatthew Henry calls this \"a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires ... undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven ... God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul.\" This is taken to support the belief that Sabbath-keeping is a metaphor for the eternal \"rest\" that Christians enjoy in Christ, prefigured by the promised land of Canaan.\n\nNon-Sabbatarians and some first-day Sabbatarians believe Hebrews 8 indicates Sabbath-keeping is not mandatory, because \"in that he saith, a new covenant, he hath made the first old\" ( KJV; or \"obsolete\" NIV). Seventh-day Sabbatarians and strict first-day Sabbatarians believe Hebrews 8 indicates the Law of God (including Sabbath) remains on the hearts of God's people to be kept, but not fallibly as in the older covenant ().\n\n"}

The number of botánicas found outside of New York and Miami has grown tremendously in the last ten years.\n\nThe name \"botánica\" is Spanish and translates as \"botany\" or \"plant\" store, referring to these establishments' function as dispensaries of medicinal\nherbs. Medicinal herbs may be sold dried or fresh, prepackaged or in bulk.\n\nBotánica almost always feature a variety of products used in Roman Catholic religious practice such as rosary beads, holy water, and images of .

{"id": "36402571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36402571", "title": "Buddhism in Khotan", "text": "Buddhism in Khotan\n\nBuddhism in Khotan comprised bodies of Buddhist religious doctrine and institutions characteristic of the Iranic Kingdom of Khotan as well as much of Western China and Tajikistan. It was the state religion of the Kingdom of Khotan until its collapse in 1000. Influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, the kingdom’s vast collection of texts, which included the indigenous \"Book of Zambasta\" and a Khotanese translation of the \"Sanghata Sutra\" (the earliest translation of the Sanskrit text to date), helped Khotan influence the Buddhist practices of its neighbors, most notably Tibet.\n\nLocal legend suggests that one of the Indian Emperor Ashoka's sons, Kushtana Maurya, founded the Central Asian city of Khotan, once the capital of a prominent Buddhist kingdom alongside the famous Silk Road. According to this same legend, Ashoka’s son was abandoned by his father and nurtured by the Earth, with the ground swelling in the shape of a female breast. For this reason the child was named \"Earth’s Breast\", or Go-stana. As he grew up, settlers from the Indian subcontinent and China began to settle within the oasis surrounding the “Earth’s breast.” Together with an unnamed son of the Chinese emperor, the son of Ashoka helped Indian expatriates settle within the region and found a city named after the son, called Khotan. Even so, the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang and Tibetan records both suggest that Buddhism would not be introduced to the kingdom until Go-stana's grandson Vijayasambhava was born 170 years after the city’s establishment. In Vijayasambhava’s fifth year of life, according to Xuanzang, a Kashmiri missionary named Vairocana arrived in Khotan and practiced meditations in the woods. Gaining the people’s interest, he became a spiritual teacher for the Khotanese people and established the first Buddhist convent in Khotan. His contributions helped introduce Vijayasambhava to the concepts of Buddhism, thus founding the Vijaya dynasty within Khotan and ultimately laying the foundations for the Buddhist faith to become its official religion by 130 BCE.\n\nHowever, an account by the Han general Ban Chao suggested that the people of Khotan in 73 AD still appeared to practice Mazdeism or Shamanism His son Ban Yong who spent time in the Western Regions also did not mention Buddhism there, and with the absence of Buddhist art in the region before the beginning of Eastern Han, it has been suggested that Buddhism may not have been adopted in the region until the middle of the second century AD.\n\nA thriving Silk Road center of trade, the Kingdom of Khotan quickly established trade, diplomatic and religious relationships with its neighbors, most notably with Ancient China. While Khotan’s relations with the Chinese were initially not smooth due to an ill-fated revolt that killed a Chinese commander in the 2nd century, the Khotanese sent embassies to the Three Kingdoms between 202 and 222 CE. This led to the formation of close relations with the Jin Dynasty throughout the fifth and sixth centuries. Because of Khotan’s expansion and relations with its neighbors, its culture and its interpretations of Buddhism became a melting pot of all the cultures that existed along the Silk Road.\n\nBy 665 CE., the Tibetan army had conquered the city of Khotan. Ironically, while the Tibetans occupied the Khotanese kingdom, it was the Khotanese who influenced the Tibetans. This was most notable in the cases of the technical vocabulary and the translation techniques used for Buddhist texts. Much like the modern-day Tibetan alphabet, the Khotanese alphabet utilized a Cursive Gupta script, most likely influenced by Sanskrit from its nearby neighbors. While writing down a translation of a Sanskrit work, Khotanese scribes would render Buddhist technical vocabulary though an etymology of each syllable. This helped the Khotanese maintain the accuracy of their translations, even if they were more concise than the Sanskrit and Pali originals. The Tibetans had long sought to translate Buddhist Sanskrit texts in a more efficient matter, because at that time they did not share a common alphabet. The occupation of the Central Asian kingdom however gave Tibetans an opportunity to learn the Khotanese alphabet. By the 9th Century, the Tibetans had adapted the Khotanese alphabet for their language.\n\nWhile Islam had earlier been introduced into Central Asia, it was not until 982 C.E. when the Islamic Kara-Khanid Khanate of Kashgar began to invade the Kingdom of Khotan. By the time the city of Khotan fell to the Karakhanids in 1006 AD, most of the residual monks had already fled to Tibet, taking many of their sacred texts with them. Not long after the Karakhanids began their occupation, Islam became the dominant religion in Khotan, marking an end of Buddhism in the region.\n\nMonastic communities stood as a key component within Khotanese Buddhist culture. An example of this importance was noted by Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who wrote about his four-month stay within the Kingdom. En route to India and Sri Lanka to obtain Buddhist scriptures, Faxian quickly found that the capital city’s monasteries made plenty of room for monks who traveled across the Silk Road. He also found that the monasteries provided provisions necessary for him to continue his pilgrimage. Within the walls of Gomati (a monastery within Khotan), he took special note of the silent, disciplined lifestyle within the monasteries: “When [the monks] enter the refectory, their demeanour is marked by a reverent gravity, and they take their seats in regular order, all maintaining a perfect silence. No sound is heard from their alms-bowls and other utensils. When any of these pure men require food, they are not allowed to call out (to the attendants) for it, but only make signs with their hands.” \n\nWhile the Gomati and Gosirsa monasteries remain the most well known thanks to their documentation by the famous Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Xuanzang, the kingdom was once home to over a hundred monasteries, accommodating more than five thousand monks. Recently, archaeological evidence was found approximately 28 kilometers south of the modern town of Hotan. While today there exist only crumbling walls, shards of pottery and tops of large buildings today, the ruins of Melikawat once housed a complex of royal administrative buildings and monasteries. An epicenter of Khotan’s religious and political culture, Melikawat stands as a major archaeological clue to the once thriving Buddhist culture within the region. \nAnother temple that helped define Khotanese Buddhist traditions was Tuopulukedun, an area that holds one of the best preserved Buddhist temples discovered to date in the region of Khotan. Originally constructed during the 7th century, the site in Tuopulukedun was excavated from September 20 to August, 2010. The remains of the wooden and earth-built temple measured 40 by 20 meters long and were built on wooden frames with outer layers of earth. Within the temple lay fragments of well-preserved sculptures and painted frescos of the Buddha and his disciples. Throughout the four walls of the temple were paintings that depicted with painstaking detail the characters who appeared within the Mahayana scriptures. Despite being within this rather confined space, the archaeologists found brightly colored frescos to be abundant within the temple, more so than any other temple within the region. In the center of the painted interior stood a 60-foot tall stone statue of Siddartha Gautama Moreover, statues and carvings of the Buddha and his Bodhisattvas were commonplace within temples. The statues and the frescos reflected different influences from different regions of Asia, perhaps due to Khotan’s convenient location in the Silk Road. While the statues reflected Bactrian and Greco-Buddhist influence, the painted frescos on the walls were a prelude to those later found in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist monasteries.\n\nIn addition to helping foreign monks with their pilgrimages, Khotanese Buddhism was woven closely into the very fabric of Khotanese culture. This led not only to the construction of thriving local monastic communities, but also encouraged Khotanese citizens to incorporate the Buddhist faith into their life. This is particularly the case during the first two weeks of June, when processional ceremonies were practiced. Everyone from the Khotanese royal family to the common merchants and laborers would come together within the capital city and, during these two weeks, would offer carriages to the King’s New Monastery [Faxian]. Lavishly filled with what Faxian refers to as the seven precious substances (the Sapta-ratna, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, rubies, diamonds or emeralds, and agate). and prominently displaying an image of the Buddha with two Boddhisatvas on the side, one carriage was carried per day throughout the two-week holiday. \n\nFarhad-beg-yailaki lies on the southern Silk Road in the Kingdom of Khotan. Sir Mark Aurel Stein explored the remains of Buddhist shrines there which he dated from the fourth to sixth century AD. Stein discovered Buddha statues wearing robes with bright floral designs on which had piles of fabrics offered at their feet in worship. Stein concluded that there was evidence of contact with many cultures in Farhad-beg-yailaki. Murals found there depicted two important Buddhist mythological figures, Hariti and Avalokitesvara, draped in cloth with Sassanian designs on.\n\nBalawaste is a ruin site in the eastern part of the Khotan oasis, near the village of Domoko on the southern arm of the Silk Road. It was dsicovered by Sir Mark Aurel Stein on his first and second expeditions in 1900 and 1906 respectively. Stein found fragments of manuscripts, pottery and plaster in Balawaste, around 94 pieces found by Stein can be combined to form a sequence of life-size Buddhas, Bodhisattavas and divine beings.\nThe site is dated to around 600AD based on the clothing style of the divine beings in the paintings found there.\n\nKhotan’s important location on the Silk Road was not the only draw for traveling Buddhist monks. The monasteries that existed within the kingdom were famous for their expansive libraries translated copies of classic Mahayana texts, such as the Flower Adornment Sutra and the Golden Light Sutra. Even though the Khotanese possessed works that were entirely indigenous in origin, some of their more important collections were translated works that would have otherwise been lost to the Western World.\n\nSimilar to the message of the Sanghata Sutra, the Khotanese believed that all people are connected to enlightenment and that no one is estranged from the cycle of reincarnation. To reflect their own interpretations of Mahayana Buddhism, the Khotanese wrote their interpretations of Siddhartha Gautama’s message through fables. This is best seen through \"The Book of Zambasta\", a miscellany of philosophy and tales involving the Bodhisattva. The book dates from the 8th century and, while the final length of Zambasta likely exceeded 4000 lines of verse on 440 folios, only 207 folios have been found thus far. As many artifacts from the Buddhist era of Khotan have been looted from their original sites and sold in antique shops to European visitors, it is likely that pages of the manuscript have disappeared. This makes a complete translation of the book very difficult.\n\nFrom what has been recovered, it is clear that the book has no singular story line, but rather comprises a vast collection of native interpretations of concepts common in Buddhist philosophy. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe book was also famous for its sūtra-styled (“Thus I have heard . . . ”) fable about the spring. It begins with a beautiful description of spring and the effects it has on younger monks. The Buddha brings them to a cemetery, where they are reminded of the impermanence of pleasures in this life.\n\nSimilar to the Book of Zambasta, the Jatakastava chronicles the Buddha’s previous lives as both human and animal. While reliving these past lives, Siddhartha Gautama looks back and talks to himself about the lessons and the characteristics he had to learn prior to becoming the Buddha. The concise nature of Khotanese texts could especially be seen here, as multiple tales are quickly told within only 26 pages. The origins of the Jatakastava caused some debate within the field of Buddhist studies. While some scholars argue that the Jatakastava was written and first published in the Kingdom of Khotan, recent evidence suggests that the Jatakastava is not an original text from Khotan, but rather a translation of an older text, presumably one written in Sanskrit. Regardless, since the Jatakastava written in its original language has been lost, the Khotanese translation is the oldest surviving manuscript.\n\nThe Sanghata Sutra was another text that was saved thanks to an early Khotanese translation that dates as early as the 5th century C.E. The sutra argues that all sentient beings are connected to enlightenment. Because everyone is connected to the goal enlightenment, one would never have to worry about being disconnected from the path of enlightenment. Since those who recite the sutra reportedly recite the exact words that the Buddha spoke during his lifetime, the person who recites the text offers his or her voice to serve as a channel by which the Buddha’s presence within his teachings can spread across the world. Prior to the discovery of the Sanskrit original in 1931 the Khotanese translation was the oldest surviving manuscript of the sutra. While it was most popular within Central Asia, the sutra’s influence has since expanded to become an integral part of Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism as well, as more localized and more expansive translations have been found within those societies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1457506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1457506", "title": "Charas", "text": "Charas\n\nCharas (Hindustani) is the name given to a hashish form of cannabis which is handmade in the Indian subcontinent and Jamaica. It is made from the resin of the cannabis plant (\"Cannabis sativa\" or \"Cannabis indica\"). The plant grows wild throughout Northern India along the stretch of the Himalayas (its putative origin) and is an important cash crop for the local people. The difference between charas and hashish is that hashish is made from a dead cannabis plant and charas is made from a live one.\n\nHashish has been used across the Indian subcontinent for medicinal and religious purposes for thousands of years, and was sold in government shops (along with opium) during the times of the British India and in independent India until the 1980s (marijuana and bhang is still being sold in parts of Rajasthan, India).\n\nCharas plays an important and often integral role in the culture and ritual of certain sects of the Hindu religion, especially among the Shaivs — the sub-division of Hinduism holding Lord Shiva to be the supreme god (in contrast to Vaishnavs who believe Lord Vishnu is the supreme god)—and it is venerated by some as being one of the aspects of Lord Shiva.\n\nDespite this long history, charas was made illegal in India under pressure from the United States in the 1980s and severe sentences were introduced for cultivation and trafficking of charas. Even the mere possession had a mandatory ten-year prison sentence. These laws have been relaxed, but charas remains a popular medium for police to extort money from consumers of the drug.\n\nEven at the peak of the crackdown, charas was still popular and remains so today, especially among young professionals and Indian sadhus. The Naga Sadhus, Aghoris and Tantric Bhairava sects smoke it freely as an integral part of their religious practice. Many smoke it in clay pipes called chillums, using a cotton cloth to cover the smoking end of the chillum and inserting a tightly packed pebble-sized cone of clay as filter under the chunk of charas. Before lighting the chillum they will chant the many names of Shiva in veneration. It is regaining the popularity it once enjoyed with younger generation of India regarding it as a recreational drug of choice. It is freely available in several places around India especially where there is a strong affluence of tourists (Goa, Delhi, Rishikesh, Varanasi, etc.). Although charas can be found in several places around India, its manufacturing can be traced only to specific locations in India such as, Parvati Valley, (Kasol, Rasol, Malana (\"Malana cream\"), Kashmir as well as several other places in northern India. In southern India there are also several places where charas is manufactured.\n\nCharas can be found in many places around India simply because there are people that take charas from the \"source\" to distribute it in areas where there is a substantial demand of it (usually areas with a lot of foreigners). The nominal price of charas in these areas is substantially higher than in the places where charas is made. There is also a large amount of charas that is illegally exported across to Europe.\n\nHigh quality hashish in India comes from cannabis grown in the mountains. The variety from Himachal Pradesh is considered to be of the highest quality throughout India. It is easily available in Kinnaur, Shimla, Karsog, Kumarsain, (Kullu-Malana) & Rampur Bushahr; practically every area in Himachal Pradesh. For this reason, the Indian subcontinent has become very popular with backpackers and drug smugglers.\n\nDuring hand-harvesting, live cannabis plants' flowering buds (as opposed to dried plants/buds) are rubbed between the palms of the harvesters' hands, and by the end of the day one has perhaps 8 or 9 grams of charas. The faster one works, the lower the quality of charas; hence to make \"Malana cream\" it is necessary to go very slowly and make only a few grams a day. Nowadays production of cannabis in the Himalayas has increased with growing demand for Malana cream; the ancient art of manufacturing is disappearing under the pressure to capitalize on the domestic and international market for charas.\n\nHigh quality charas was also produced in Nepal and sold in government monopoly stores in Kathmandu until the government gave in to international pressure and got out of the business in the 1970s. Rolpa district in western Nepal was a production center, with ganja and charas both an important cash crop in this extremely isolated, underdeveloped and impoverished region.\n\nCharas is smoked, usually mixed with cigarette tobacco and rolled back into the cigarette blank. Rolling paper is also used to smoke charas. Charas with tobacco mixture is filled into the rolling paper to make a joint.\n"}
{"id": "22787562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22787562", "title": "Chavrusa", "text": "Chavrusa\n\nChavrusa, also spelled chavruta or havruta (Aramaic: חַבְרוּתָא, lit. \"friendship\" or \"companionship\"), is a traditional rabbinic approach to Talmudic study in which a small group of students (usually 2-5) analyze, discuss, and debate a shared text. It is a primary learning method in yeshivas and kollels, where students often engage regular study partners of similar knowledge and ability, and is also practiced by men and boys outside the yeshiva setting, in work, home and vacation settings. The traditional phrase is to learn \"b'chavrusa\" (בְחַבְרוּתָא, \"in \"chavrusa\"\"; i.e., in partnership); the word has come by metonymy to refer to the study partner as an individual, though it would more logically describe the pair.\n\nUnlike a teacher-student relationship, in which the student memorizes and repeats the material back in tests, \"chavrusa\"-style learning puts each student in the position of analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.\n\nWhile \"chavrusa\"-style learning is traditionally practiced by men and boys, it has also become popular in women's yeshivas that study Talmudic texts. In the 2000s it was extended to telephone and internet learning sessions in which partners study Talmud as well as other traditional Jewish texts.\n\n\"Chavrusa\" is an Aramaic word meaning \"friendship\" or \"companionship\". The Rabbis of the Mishnah and Gemara use the cognate term \"chaver\" (חבר, \"friend\" or \"companion\") to refer to the one with whom a person studies Torah. In contemporary usage, \"chavrusa\" is defined as a \"study partner\".\n\nIn Orthodox Judaism, a \"chavrusa\" always refers to two students learning one on one. When three or more students learn together, they are called a \"chavurah\" (, group). Reform Judaism has expanded the idea of \"chavrusa\" to include two, three, four or even five individuals studying together. It has also extended the material being studied beyond traditional texts, to modern scholarship and poetry. The Reform and Conservative movements have also altered the idea of \"chavurah\" from its Orthodox meaning of groups that meet only for Torah study. In Reform and Conservative terminology, a \"chavurah\" is a group of individuals or families which is part study or prayer group, part social club.\n\nBased on statements in the Mishnah and Gemara, \"chavrusa\" learning was a key feature of yeshivas in the eras of the Tannaim (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE) and Amoraim (Rabbis of the Talmudic period, 200 to 500 CE). The Rabbis repeatedly urged their students to acquire a study partner; for example, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachya enjoined students to \"Make for yourself a Rav and acquire for yourself a \"chaver\"\", and Rabbi Yose ben Chalafta told his son Rabbi Abba that he was ignorant because he did not study with someone else. The choice of \"chavrusas\" seems to have been based on friendship or social proximity; thus, \"chavrusas\" fulfilled a social as well as an educational need.\n\nWhile an individual may choose to study Talmud alone, it is strongly discouraged. In the Talmud, R. Yosi b. R. Hanina is quoted as saying that \"scholars who sit alone to study the Torah ... become stupid\" (\"Berakhot\" 63b).\n\n\"Chavrusa\"-style learning is particularly suited to Talmud study, as the latter is a text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, a student of Talmud must be able to analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others. The \"chavrusa\" relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.\n\nUnlike conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, \"chavrusa\" learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.\n\nA \"chavrusa\" helps the student stay awake, keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's \"chavrusa\". The \"chavrusa\" relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his \"chavrusa\".\n\n\"Chavrusa\" learning takes place in the formalized structure of the yeshiva or kollel, as well as in Talmudic study that an individual does at any time of day. Although a man skilled in learning could study certain topics on his own, the \"chavrusa\" relationship is preferred to help him crystallize his thoughts.\n\nIn the yeshiva setting, students prepare for and review the \"shiur\" (lecture) with their \"chavrusas\" during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as \"sedarim\". On average, a yeshiva student spends ten hours per day learning in \"chavrusa\". Since having the right \"chavrusa\" makes all the difference between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch \"chavrusas\" eight or nine times in a class of 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides. If a \"chavrusa\" gets stuck on a difficult point or needs further clarification, they can turn to the rabbis, lecturers, or a \"sho'el u'mashiv\" (literally, \"ask and answer\", a rabbi who is intimately familiar with the Talmudic text being studied) who are available to them in the study hall during \"sedarim\". In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the \"chavrusas\".\n\n\"Chavrusa\" learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other and then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending on the size of the yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of \"chavrusas\" can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of \"chavrusa\" learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.\n\nPairing up study partners has been compared to making a \"shidduch\" (marriage match), as the skills, interests, temperament and schedule of each person must be taken into consideration. Good friends do not necessarily make good \"chavrusas\". If the \"chavrusas\" spend too much time chatting or joking with each other at the expense of their study time, they are advised to find different study partners.\n\nIn the yeshiva world, the brightest students are highly desirable as \"chavrusas\". However, there are pros and cons to learning with \"chavrusas\" who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger \"chavrusa\" will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a \"chavrusa\" who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker \"chavrusa\", who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, and be ready to justify each and every point. The stronger \"chavrusa\" helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker \"chavrusa\" helps the student learn \"how\" to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of \"chavrusas\" in order to develop on all three levels.\nBeth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood Township, New Jersey is known for its \"tumult day\" at the beginning of each \"z'man\" (semester), when thousands of students mingle outdoors with the goal of choosing a \"chavrusa\" for the new term. A similar \"tumult day\" takes place among the hundreds of students at the main Brisk yeshiva in Jerusalem, and at the Mir in Jerusalem.\n\n\"Chavrusas\" often develop into lasting friendships. The shared commitment to scholarship and intellectual growth creates a close bond between study partners that has been said to be closer than that of many married couples.\n\nWomen's yeshivas that include Talmud study on the curriculum often schedule \"chavrusa\" study sessions for their students. In Orthodox women's seminaries, students are paired with study partners of equal or greater strength to learn Halakha, Chumash, Jewish philosophy, or any other topic in Judaism. Although the latter set-up is often called \"\"chavrusa\" learning\", it is not the same thing as what Orthodox men do and is better called \"one-on-one study\". In recent years, telephone study partnerships for women have been promoted as a \"kiruv\" (Jewish outreach) tool in Israel and as an option for busy homemakers.\n\nRabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, reportedly had a regular half-hour \"chavrusa\" with his wife, during which they studied \"Orach Chaim\".\n\nTorah Umesorah, through its Partners in Torah program, was the first to move \"chavrusa\"-style learning out of the yeshiva and synagogue and into telephone study sessions in 1997. During the 2000s, many free internet services began matching up study partners around the world using videoconferencing and Skype hook-ups.\n\n\n\nFounded in the United Kingdom in 1996 and launched globally in 2009, the Limmud Chavruta Project produces an annual study guide for \"chavrusa\"-style learning. The study guides, which include source texts on topics such as \"Responsibility\", \"Creativity\", \"Time\", and \"Money\", are issued in conjunction with the British-Jewish educational charity's annual conference.\n\nZionist ideologue A. D. Gordon used the term \"chavrusa\" to refer to a communal society, such as the moshav, kibbutz, or worker's association, which acts as a self-educational link to the larger social-educational process. In Zionist thought, the \"chavrusa\" is \"a central tool in the struggle for the revival of the Jewish people, the revival of the individual, and the centrality of the idea of 'labor'. It is the highest expression of the Jewish person's extraordinary effort to recreate him or herself through 'labor', to be reconnected to nature, and to plant the many-branched tree of his or her nation in the land from which it was uprooted\".\n\n\"Chavrusa\" is the name of the magazine of the Rabbinic Alumni of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, published since the late 1950s.\n\n\"Havruta\" magazine is a publication of the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "322721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322721", "title": "Freedom of religion in Iran", "text": "Freedom of religion in Iran\n\nFreedom of religion in Iran is marked by Iranian culture, major religion and politics. Iran is officially and in practice an Islamic republic—the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran mandates that the official religion of Iran is Shia Islam and the Twelver Ja'fari school, and also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites. Iran recognizes Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian religious minorities, among others. The continuous presence of the country's pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, had accustomed the population to the participation of non-Muslims in society. However, despite official recognition of such minorities by Iran's government, the actions of the government create a \"threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities\".\n\nThe country has a total area of approximately 1,636,000 km² (632,000 mi²), and its population is approximately 69 million. In 2006, the population was approximately 98 percent Muslim, of which an estimated 89% were Shi'a and 9% Sunni (mostly Turkomen, Arabs, Baluchs, and Kurds living in the southwest, southeast, and northwest). Although there are no official statistics of the size of the Sufi Muslim population, some reports estimated between two and five million people practice Sufism compared to approximately 100,000 before 1979.\n\nBahá'ís, Christians, Zoroastrians, Mandaeans, and Jews combined constitute approximately two percent of the population. The largest non-Muslim minority is the Bahá'í community, which has an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 adherents throughout the country. Estimates on the size of the Jewish community vary from 20,000 to 30,000. These figures represent a substantial reduction from the estimated 75,000 to 80,000 Jews who resided in the country prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. According to U.N. figures, there were approximately 300,000 Christians, the majority of whom are ethnic Armenians. Unofficial estimates indicated an Assyrian Christian population of approximately 10,000. There also were Protestant denominations, including evangelical churches. The Mandaean Sabaeans, a community whose religion draws on pre-Christian gnostic beliefs, numbered approximately 5,000 to 10,000 persons, with members residing primarily in Khuzestan in the southwest. As of 2006, there were indications that members of all religious minorities are emigrating at a higher rate than previously.\n\nAlthough the Constitution states that \"the investigation of individuals' beliefs is forbidden\" and that \"no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief,\" the adherents of religions not specifically protected under the Constitution do not enjoy freedom of activity. This situation most directly affects adherents of the Bahá'í Faith. The Government regards the Bahá'í community, whose faith originally arose from a movement within Islam, as a misguided or wayward \"sect.\"\n\nIn 2004, the Expediency Council approved appending a note to Article 297 of the 1991 Islamic Punishments Act, authorizing collection of equal \"blood money\" (diyeh) for the death of Muslims and non-Muslims. All women and Baha'i men were excluded from the equalization provisions of the bill. According to law, Baha'i blood or anyones' who marries or helps a Bahá'í or gets involved with them is considered Mobah, meaning it can be spilled with impunity.\n\nThe Government fuels anti-Bahá'í sentiment in the country. Government officials have stated that the Bahá'ís are not a religious minority, but a political organization which was associated with the Shah's regime, is against the Iranian Revolution and engages in espionage activities. However, government officials reportedly nonetheless have stated that, as individuals, all Bahá'ís are entitled to their beliefs and are protected under other articles of the Constitution as citizens. The Iranian representative to the United Nations tried several times, albeit unsuccessfully, between 1982 and 1984 to convince the United Nations diplomatic community that the Bahá'í Faith is a politicized organization with a record of criminal activism against the Iranian government. The United Nations responded to the Iranian government's accusations by stating that there has been no evidence of Iran's claims and that the Bahá'í community in Iran professes its allegiance to the state. The United Nations pointed to the Bahá'í teaching of obedience to the government of one's country and stated that any involvement in any subversive acts against the government would be antithetical to precepts of the Bahá'í religion. The United Nations also stated that if the Iranian government did acknowledge that the Bahá'í Faith is a religion, it would be an admission that freedom of religion does not apply to all in Iran and that it is not abiding by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights to which it is a signatory.\n\nUnlike the Bahá'í Faith, Judaism is a recognized religion in Iran. Despite Iran's official distrust of the country of Israel, the government does not directly attack Judaism itself.\n\nThe central feature of the country's Islamic republican system is rule by a \"religious jurisconsult.\" The Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic controls the most important levers of power; he is chosen by a group of 86 religious scholars. All acts of the Majles (legislative body) must be reviewed for conformity with Islamic law and principles by the Council of Guardians, which is composed of six clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader and six Muslim jurists (legal scholars) nominated by the Head of the Judiciary and elected by parliament.\n\nReligious activity is monitored closely by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance and by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Adherents of recognized religious minorities are not required to register individually with the Government; however, their community, religious, and cultural events and organizations, including schools, are monitored closely. Registration of Bahá'ís is a police function. Evangelical Christian groups have been pressured by government authorities to compile and submit membership lists for their congregations, but evangelicals have resisted this demand. Non-Muslim owners of grocery shops are required to indicate their religious affiliation on the fronts of their shops.\n\nBy law and practice, religious minorities can be elected to a representative body or to hold senior government or military positions, and have 5 of a total 270 seats in the majlis reserved for religious minorities. Three of these seats are reserved for members of the Christian faith, including two seats for the country's Armenian Christians, and one for Assyrians. There is also one seat for a member of the Jewish faith, and one for a member of the Zoroastrian faith. While members of the Sunni Muslim minority do not have reserved seats in the majlis, they are allowed to serve in the body. Sunni members tend to come from the larger Sunni communities. Members of religious minorities are allowed to vote. All of the minority religious groups, including Sunni Muslims, are barred from being elected president.\n\nMembers of religious minorities, are supported in their pursuit of serving in the judiciary and security services. All applicants for public sector employment are screened, irrespective of their faith, for their adherence to and knowledge of Islam, and members of religious minorities can serve in lower ranks of government employment. The constitution states that the country's army must be administered by individuals who are committed to the objectives of the Iranian constitution, regardless of faith. No religious minorities are exempt from military service. Members of religious minorities with a college education could serve as an officer during their mandatory military service but could not be a career military officer.\n\nUniversity applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology, which limits the access of most religious minorities to higher education, although all public school students, including non-Muslims, must study Shia Islam. Applicants for public sector employment similarly are screened for their knowledge of Islam.\n\nThe Government allows recognized religious minorities to conduct the religious education of their adherents. This includes separate and privately funded Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian schools but does not include Bahá'í schools. The Ministry of Education, which imposes certain curriculum requirements, supervises these schools. With few exceptions, the directors of such private schools must be Muslim. Attendance at the schools is not mandatory for recognized religious minorities. All textbooks used in course work, including religious texts, must be approved for use by the Ministry of Education. Religious texts in non-Persian languages require approval by the authorities for use. Recognized religious minorities could provide religious instruction in non-Persian languages, but such texts required approval by the authorities. This approval requirement sometimes imposed significant translation expenses on minority communities. The condition imposed began from 1981 and were reiterated in the fall of 1983 - the Ministry of Education and Training ordered that religious education must be done in Persian, a text written by the MET must be taught in all registered religious minority schools, schools must seek special permission for any ceremonies, and in keeping with society-wide restrictions, female teachers and students must observe Islamic dress code including Hijab when necessary (this last was re-inforced in 1985.) Even most of the time and occasions, all female citizens, including non-Muslims, are required to wear Hijab as Iran is currently an Islamic republic. There have been other requirements of citizens as well. In 1984 the government began to request religious affiliation on questionnaires for passports. Events held for religious groups were broken into and if the meetings were mixed sexed and or women were not wearing headscarves, arrests were made and meetings canceled. It was prohibited that Muslims attend these meetings of minority groups - some groups restricted events so only their own religious members could attend. There were restrictions on music at events. Many of these restrictions moderated in time or were applied to or affected one religion more vs others (see below) and the government has occasionally also taken steps to bring attention to issues important to a religion - in 1982 the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs printed a stamp commemorating the birth of Jesus.\n\nThe textbook the MET wrote on the minority religions was called Talimat-e Maxhadi Vizheh-ye Aqaliathaye Mazhabi - (Kalimi, Zarthoshti, Masihi); Religious Studies Specifically for Religious Minorities: (Jews, Zoroastrians, Christians.) The course was taught by Muslim teachers at least 3 hrs/wk. All the religious minorities objected to the text in 1982 claiming the book was a violation of Article 13 guaranteeing freedom in religious teaching, that there were overt and covert passages from the Quran, and lack of any qualifications of the anonymous author(s) rather than members of the religious minorities writing about their own religions. The situation has moderated for the Armenians significantly by 1995/6. There was also compromise of sorts allowed both Hebrew and Persian language use in Jewish schools.\n\nRecognized religious minorities are allowed by the Government to establish community centers and certain cultural, social, sports, or charitable associations that they finance themselves. This does not apply to the Bahá'í community, which since 1983 has been denied the right to assemble officially or to maintain administrative institutions. Because the Bahá'í Faith has no clergy, the denial of the right to form such institutions and elect officers threatens its existence in the country.\n\nMuslim men are free to marry non-Muslim women; a non-Muslim woman automatically becomes Muslim when the marriage takes place. However, marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men are not recognized unless the man shows proof that he has converted to Islam. If the child of a non-Muslim family converts to Islam, he or she inherits all the wealth of the family.\n\nThe Government is highly suspicious of any proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims and can be harsh in its response, in particular against Bahá'ís, Sunni Muslims and evangelical Christians.\n\nThe Government does not ensure the right of citizens to change or renounce their religious faith. Apostasy, specifically conversion from Islam, can be punishable by death.\n\nA summary of 2013 incidents of prison sentences, fines and punishments showed \"79 religious minorities were sentenced to a total of 3620 months in prison, 200 months probation, 75 lashings and 41,030,000,000 rials in fines. In this area, 49% of the cases involved Baha'i minorities, 16% Christian and Dervish and 14% Sunni minority. Arrests of religious minorities increased by 36% in relation to last year.\"\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith originated in Iran during the 1860s. The Baha'is believe their prophet to be the Messiah for this era. Initially it attracted a wide following among Shi'a clergy. The political and religious authorities of that time joined to suppress the movement, and since then the hostility of the Shi'a clergy to the Bahá'í Faith has remained strong. Bahá'ís are considered apostates by the Shi'a clergy because of their claim to a valid religious revelation subsequent to that of Mohammed. The Bahá'í Faith is defined by the Government as a political \"sect,\" historically linked to the Pahlavi regime and, hence, counterrevolutionary, even though one of the tenets of the Bahá'í Faith is non-involvement in partisan politics.\n\nBahá'ís may not teach or practice their faith or maintain links with coreligionists abroad. The fact that the Bahá'í world headquarters (established by the founder of the Bahá'í Faith in the 19th century, in what was then Ottoman-controlled Palestine) is situated in what is now the state of Israel, allows the Iranian government to charge the Bahá'ís with \"espionage on behalf of Zionism,\" in particular when caught communicating with or sending monetary contributions to the Bahá'í headquarters.\n\nBroad restrictions on Bahá'ís appear to be aimed at destroying them as a community. Bahá'ís repeatedly have been offered relief from mistreatment in exchange for recanting their faith. Bahá'í cemeteries, holy places, historical sites, administrative centers, and other assets were seized shortly after the 1979 revolution. None of the properties have been returned, and many have been destroyed.\n\nBahá'ís are not allowed to bury and honor their dead in keeping with their religious tradition. They are permitted access only to areas of wasteland that the Government designates for their use, and are not allowed to mark the graves. Many historic Bahá'í gravesites have been desecrated or destroyed. In 2000 in the city of Abadeh, a Revolutionary Guard officer bulldozed a Bahá'í cemetery with 22 graves.\n\nIn what appeared to be a hopeful development, in 2002 the Government offered the Tehran community a piece of land for use as a cemetery. However, the land was in the desert, with no access to water, making it impossible to perform Bahá'í mourning rituals. In addition the Government stipulated that no markers be put on individual graves and that no mortuary facilities be built on the site, making it impossible to perform a proper burial.\n\nBahá'í group meetings and religious education, which often take place in private homes and offices, are curtailed severely. Public and private universities continue to deny admittance to Bahá'í students, a particularly demoralizing blow to a community that traditionally has placed a high value on education. Denial of access to higher education appears aimed at the eventual impoverishment of the Bahá'í community.\n\nBahá'ís regularly are denied compensation for injury or criminal victimization. Government authorities claim that only Muslim plaintiffs are eligible for compensation in these circumstances.\n\nIn 1993, the UNSR reported the existence of a government policy directive regarding the Bahá'ís. According to the directive, the Supreme Revolutionary Council instructed government agencies to block the progress and development of the Bahá'í community, expel Bahá'í students from universities, cut Bahá'í links with groups outside the country, restrict employment of Bahá'ís, and deny Bahá'ís \"positions of influence,\" including in education. The Government claims that the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflection of current government practice designed to eradicate slowly the Bahá'í community.\n\nIn September 2001, the Ministry of Justice issued a report that reiterated that government policy continued to aim at the eventual elimination of the Bahá'ís as a community. It stated in part that Bahá'ís would only be permitted to enroll in schools if they did not identify themselves as Bahá'ís, and that Bahá'ís preferably should be enrolled in schools that have a strong and imposing religious ideology. The report also stated that Bahá'ís must be expelled from universities, either in the admission process or during the course of their studies, once it becomes known that they are Bahá'ís.\n\nWhile in recent years the Government has eased some restrictions, thereby enabling Bahá'ís to obtain food-ration booklets and send their children to public elementary and secondary schools, the prohibition against the admission of Bahá'ís to universities remains. Thousands of Bahá'ís dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980s receive no unemployment benefits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pensions received from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison sentences.\n\nIran has taken some positive steps in recognizing the rights of Bahá'ís, as well as other religious minorities. In November 1999, President Khatami publicly stated that no one in the country should be persecuted because of his or her religious beliefs. He added that he would defend the civil rights of all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or religion. Subsequently, the Expediency Council approved the \"Right of Citizenship\" bill, affirming the social and political rights of all citizens and their equality before the law. In February 2000, following approval of the bill, the head of the judiciary issued a circular letter to all registry offices throughout the country that provided for any couple to be registered as husband and wife without being required to state their religious affiliation. The measure effectively permits the registration of Bahá'í marriages in the country. Previously Bahá'í marriages were not recognized by the Government, leaving Bahá'í women open to charges of prostitution. Thus children of Bahá'í marriages were not recognized as legitimate and therefore denied inheritance rights.\n\nAccording to a U.S. panel, attacks on Bahá'ís in Iran have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president as well as Sunni Muslims. On May 14, 2008, members of an informal body known as the Friends that oversaw the needs of the Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested and taken to Evin prison. Officers from the Ministry of Intelligence in Tehran searched and raided the homes of the six people in the early hours of May 14. The arrest of the six follow the detention of another Bahá'í leader in March, who was originally taken to answer questions relating to the burial of a Bahá'i in the Bahá'í cemetery in Mashad. They have not been charged, and are prisoners of conscience. The Iran Human Rights Documentation Center has stated that they are concerned for the safety of the Bahá'ís, and that the recent events are similar to the disappearance of 25 Bahá'í leaders in the early 1980s. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has stated that it fears that the \"development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in Iran in the 1980s when Baha'is were routinely arrested, imprisoned, and executed.\"\n\nWhile Jews are a recognized religious minority, allegations of official discrimination are frequent. The Government's anti-Israel policies, along with a perception among radical Muslim elements that all Jewish citizens support Zionism and the State of Israel, create a threatening atmosphere for the small Jewish community. Jewish leaders reportedly are reluctant to draw attention to official mistreatment of their community due to fear of government reprisal.\n\nPersecution and discrimination has increased among the government and society since the Revolution in 1979. On the eve of Passover 1998, 13 Iranian Jewish men were arrested on charges of espionage. The United States and Israel both demanded their release. Iran accused the men of spying for \"world arrogance\" (being the U.S.) and the \"Zionist regime\" (being Israel). The conviction is highly doubted by the rest of the world.\n\nAccording to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees Background Paper on Iran, the Mandaeans are regarded as Christians, and are included among the country's three recognized religious minorities. However, Mandaeans regard themselves not as Christians, but as adherents of a religion that predates Christianity in both belief and practice. Mandaeans enjoyed official support as a distinct religion prior to the revolution, but their legal status as a religion since then has been the subject of debate in the Majles and never has been clarified.\n\nAccording to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States, since 1979 more than 200 Bahá'ís have been killed and 15 have disappeared and are presumed dead. The Government continued to imprison and detain Bahá'ís based on their religious beliefs.\n\nThe Government appears to adhere to a practice of keeping a small number of Bahá'ís in arbitrary detention, some at risk of execution, at any given time. There were four Bahá'ís reported to be in prison for practicing their faith at the end of the period covered by this report, two facing life sentences and two facing sentences of 15 years. In addition the Government appears to engage in harassment of the Bahá'í community by arresting Bahá'ís arbitrarily, charging them, and then releasing them, often without dropping the charges against them. Those with charges still pending against them fear arrest at any time.\n\nTwo Bahá'ís, Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam and Hadayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, were tried in 1998 and later sentenced to death by an Islamic Revolutionary Court in Mashad for practicing their faith. In 2000 the sentences were reduced to 7 and 5 years respectively. Kashefi-Najafabadi was released in October 2001, after serving 4 years of his sentence. Zabihi-Moghaddam, who originally was arrested in November 1997, was released in June 2002.\n\nThe Government continued to imprison and detain Bahá'ís based on their religious beliefs. Manuchehr Khulusi was arrested in June 1999 while visiting fellow Bahá'ís in the town of Birjand, and was imprisoned until his release in May 2000. During his imprisonment, Khulusi was interrogated, beaten, held in solitary confinement, and denied access to his lawyer. The charges brought against him remain unknown, but they were believed to be related to his faith. The Islamic Revolutionary Court in Mashhad held a 2-day trial in September 1999 and sentenced Khulusi to death in February 2000. Despite Khulusi's release, it is unclear if the conviction and death sentence against him still stand.\n\nThe property rights of Bahá'ís generally are disregarded. Since 1979 large numbers of private and business properties belonging to Bahá'ís have been confiscated. During the period covered by this report, 14 Bahá'í homes were seized and handed over to an agency of Supreme Leader Khamenei. Authorities reportedly confiscated Bahá'í properties in Kata and forced several families to leave their homes and farmlands. Authorities also imprisoned some farmers, and did not permit others to harvest their crops. In 2000 authorities in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz reportedly also confiscated eight buildings belonging to Bahá'ís. In one instance, a woman from Isfahan who legally traveled abroad found that her home had been confiscated when she returned home. During the period covered by the report, the Government also seized private homes in which Bahá'í youth classes were held despite the owners having proper ownership documents. In 1999 three Bahá'í homes in Yazd and one in Arbakan were confiscated because their owners were Bahá'ís. The Government's seizure of Bahá'í personal property, as well as its denial of Bahá'í access to education and employment, are eroding the economic base of the Bahá'í community.\n\nIn 1998, after a nationwide raid of more than 500 Bahá'í homes and offices, as well as numerous arrests, the authorities closed the Bahá'í Institute of Higher Learning. Also known as the \"Open University,\" the Institute was established by the Bahá'í community shortly after the revolution to offer higher educational opportunities to Bahá'í students who had been denied access to the country's high schools and universities. The Institute remains closed.\n\nIt has become somewhat easier for Bahá'ís to obtain passports in order to travel abroad. In addition some Iranian embassies abroad do not require applicants to state a religious affiliation. In such cases, it is easier for Bahá'ís to renew passports. Nevertheless, in February 2001, the Government denied visas to foreigners in the Bahá'í delegation to the Asia-Pacific Regional Preparatory Conference for the World Conference on Racism, held in Tehran. The delegation was composed of American, Japanese, South Korean, and Indian nationals.\n\nMore recently, in the later months of 2005, an intensive anti-Bahá'í campaign was conducted by Iranian newspapers and radio stations. The state-run and influential Kayhan newspaper, whose managing editor is appointed by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, ran nearly three dozen articles defaming the Bahá'í Faith The articles, which make use of fake historical documents, engage in a distortion of history to falsely describe Bahá'í moral principles in a manner that would be offensive to Muslims, thus inducing feelings of suspicion, distrust and hatred to members of the Bahá'í community in Iran.\n\nFurthermore, a confidential letter sent on October 29, 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forced in Iran states that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei has instructed the Command Headquarters to identify people who adhere to the Bahá'í Faith and to monitor their activities and gather any and all information about the members of the Bahá'í Faith. The letter was brought to the attention of the international community by Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on freedom of religion or belief, in a March 20, 2006 press release.\n\nIn the press release the Special Rapporteur states that she \"is highly concerned by information she has received concerning the treatment of members of the Bahá'í community in Iran.\" She further states that \"The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.\"\n\nThe authorities are \"vigilant in curbing proselytizing activities by evangelical Christians\" including when services are conducted in Persian, but some sources indicate that Bibles and religious material on Persian are freely available to Iranians. Status related to this issues can be hard to determine because of poor relationships between Iran and other states, such as the United States, and due to Iran's strict controls of media and information. For example, Youcef Nadarkhani is an Jammiat-e Rabbani (Christian) pastor who was given a death sentence for apostasy, though eventually he was released after winning an appeal. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to three years in prison for proselytizing. Iran has denied many components of Nadarkhani's story, and has even described such claims by Western media as \"propaganda\". Blasphemy law in Iran is used as a weapon against Christians and Christianity within Iran's borders.\n\nSome issues dealing with Christianity in Iran deal more directly with the Armenian ethnic minorities. For example, in early 1983 the MET specifically requested that the Armenian religious schools teach religion in Persian and time allocated to the Armenian languages must be reduced or eliminated. While the community responded to these orders issues raised in discussions included if the Armenians could speak/teach their own language other minorities would demand the same but also if Persian was used it would make proselytization easier as facility with Persian language use of religious issues improved. At the end of the 1983 academic year the MET requested the questions that were to be included in the final exam and the questions had to be sent in Persian and were ordered to be used in Persian as the final exam. Most fifth grade students refused to take the test and 3rd grade students handed in blank pages. The authorities then failed all the students. Some schools ignored the demands on languages, others did limit teaching to 2 hrs and others removed it entirely. Some continued religious classes and some dropped them all together. Observance of these rules on Armenian language teaching was most strict in Tehran while 6 to 8 hrs per week were common beyond. However, in 1995 the limit on languages was raised from 2 hrs to 5 hrs per week in Tehran as well. Circa 1996 a settlement was reached; during the first two months of each school year, the ministry-provided Persian book on religious ethics is taught in Armenian schools while Armenian-approved religious lessons are taught in Armenian for the rest of the year. This was not a totally satisfactory settlement of the issue for both sides, but it settled the issue.\n\nIn 1976, the Christian population numbered 168,593 people, mostly Armenians. Due to the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, almost half of the Armenians migrated to the newly independent Armenia. However, the opposite trend has occurred since 2000, and the number of Christians with Iranian citizenship increased to 109,415 in 2006 and 117,704 in 2011. According national Statistical centre Christians were fastest growing religion in Iran during 1996-2006 period (+38.9%), and second fastest during 2006-2011 period (+7.6%, after Zoroastrianism). At the same time, significant immigration of Assyrians from Iraq has been recorded due to massacres and harassment in post-Saddam Iraq. However, most of those Assyrians in Iran do not have Iranian citizenship. In 2008, the central office of the International Union of Assyrians, a mistranslation in the Iranian press for the Assyrian Universal Alliance, was officially transferred to Iran after being hosted in the United States for more than four decades.\n\nIn 1984 the government began to request religious affiliation on questionnaires for passports. In contrast to other registered religious minorities starting in 1983, Jewish families were prevented from traveling as a group and if one member of the family traveled then another family member's passport was held. Regardless, thousands of Jews had emigrated in the first eight months of 1987 through Austria. Perhaps half the Jews left Iran leaving about 30,000 Jews by 1986. Some may have returned in the late 1980s. Generally the overall economic position has deteriorated significantly post revolution.\n\nIt is estimated that a minimum of 13 Jews have been executed by Iran since the country's revolution. Of them include two men (not of the ones written above) hanged in 1997 for allegedly spying for Israel and the United States; as well as businessman Ruhollah Kadkhodah-Zadeh who was hanged in prison without a public charge or legal proceeding, apparently for assisting Jews to emigrate.\n\nThe Special Clerical Court (SCC) system, established in 1987 to investigate offenses and crimes committed by clerics and which the Supreme Leader oversees directly, is not provided for in the constitution and operates outside the domain of the judiciary. In particular, critics alleged that the clerical courts were used to prosecute certain clerics for expressing controversial ideas and for participating in activities outside the area of religion, including journalism.\n\nDuring the latter part of 2000, a Special Clerical Court began the trial of Hojatoleslam Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari, a cleric who participated in a conference in Berlin on Iran, on charges of apostasy, \"corruption on earth,\" \"declaring war on God,\" and \"denial of basic religious principles,\" which potentially carry the death penalty. Eshkevari has called for more liberal interpretations of Islamic law in certain areas. The verdict was not announced, but, according to Amnesty International, Eshkevari widely was reported to have been sentenced to death. In November 2001, following domestic and international criticism, his sentence reportedly was reduced to 30 months' imprisonment and removal of his status as a cleric. On February 6, 2005, the special clerical court agreed to his conditional release (parole); he had served two thirds of his seven-year sentence and was therefore eligible for parole under the law.\n\nIndependent newspapers and magazines have been closed, and leading publishers and journalists were imprisoned on charges of hate speech and \"insulting Islam\" and sparking revolutionary sentiments whilst \"calling into question the Islamic foundation of the Republic.\" In 2002 academic Hashem Aghajari was sentenced to death for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammed, based on a speech in which he challenged Muslims not to blindly follow the clergy, provoking an international and domestic outcry.\n\nIn 2003 his death sentence was revoked by the Supreme Court, but the case was sent back to the lower court for retrial. He was retried on charges that did include revolutionary incitement and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, two of which were suspended, and five years of additional \"deprivation of social right\" (meaning that he could not teach or write books or articles). His time served was counted towards his three-year sentence; the court converted the remainder of the time to a fine. He was released on bail in 2004.\n\nLate November, 2018 prison warden Qarchak women prison in Varamin, near the capital Tehran attacked and bit three Dervish religious minority prisoners when they demanded their confiscated belongings back.\n\nZoroastrian served as the national- or state religion of a significant portion of the Iranian people for many centuries before it was gradually marginalized by Islam from the 7th century onwards. The political power of the pre-Islamic Iranian dynasties lent Zoroastrians immense prestige in ancient times, and some of its leading doctrines were adopted by other religious systems.\n\nThere are no official reports of government harassment of the Zoroastrian community to date. Unofficial reports of discrimination in employment and education has come up, but are by no means frequent. Zoroastrians are free to make, without government interference, their annual pilgrimage to one of the holiest sites of their faith, the temple of Chak-Chak (near the city of Yazd).\n\nThe continuous activity of the country's pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, has accustomed the population to the presence of non-Muslims in society. However, actions of the conservative parts of society and the government create a threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities. For a Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian there is constant pressure at school to convert.\n\nThe Jewish community has been reduced to less than one-half of its prerevolutionary size. Some of this emigration is connected with the larger, general waves of departures following the establishment of the Islamic Republic, but some also stems from continued perceived anti-Semitism on the part of the government and within society.\nThe government's anti-Israel policies, along with a perception among radical Muslims that all Jewish citizens supported Zionism and the state of Israel, created a hostile atmosphere for the small community. For example, in 2005 many newspapers celebrated the one-hundredth anniversary of the anti-Semitic publication Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Jewish leaders reportedly were reluctant to draw attention to official mistreatment of their community due to fear of government reprisal.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4622380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4622380", "title": "Hinduism and Sikhism", "text": "Hinduism and Sikhism\n\nHinduism and Sikhism are both Indian religions. Hinduism is an older religion, while Sikhism was founded in the 15th-century by Guru Nanak Dev Ji.\n\nBoth religions share many philosophical concepts such as Karma, Dharma, Mukti, Maya and Saṃsāra. In the days of Mughal rule, the Sikh community came to the defence of Hindus who were being forcibly converted to Islam. Guru Nanak was the first to raise his voice against Babur, the Muslim ruler of India.\n\nScholars state that the origins of Sikhism were influenced by the \"nirguni\" (formless God) tradition of Bhakti movement in medieval India.. The roots of the Sikh tradition perhaps in the Sant-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition. Furthermore, \"Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" and the secondary canon, the \"Dasam Granth\" and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors\". \n\n\"Ik Onkar\", iconically represented as in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (although sometimes spelt out in full as ) is the iconographic statement in Sikhism that is 'there is one God'. The phrase is an expression of monotheistic unity of God.\n\nThe \"Onkar\" in () of Sikhism is related to \"Om\" () of Hinduism. Some Sikhs disagree that \"Ik Onkar\" is same as \"Om\". Onkar is, states Wazir Singh, a \"variation of Om (Aum) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a slight change in its orthography), implying the seed-force that evolves as the universe\". In \"Ek Onkar\", explains Gulati, \"Ek\" means One, and Onkar is \"equivalent of the Hindu \"Om\" (Aum)\".\n\nHowever, both of them are different as far as sikhs believe because Oankar refers to the total primary lord God.\n\nDuring the Mughal Empire period, the Sikh and Hindu traditions believe that Sikhs helped protect Hindus from Islamic persecution, and this caused martyrdom of their Guru. The Sikh historians, for example, record that the Sikh movement was rapidly growing in northwest India, and Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was openly encouraging Sikhs to, \"be fearless in their pursuit of just society: he who holds none in fear, nor is afraid of anyone, is acknowledged as a man of true wisdom\", a statement recorded in Adi Granth 1427. While Guru Tegh Bahadur influence was rising, Aurangzeb had imposed Islamic laws, demolished Hindu schools and temples, and enforced new taxes on non-Muslims.\n\nAccording to records written by his son Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the Guru had resisted persecution, adopted and promised to protect Kashmiri Hindus. The Guru was summoned to Delhi by Aurangzeb on a pretext, but when he arrived with his colleagues, he was offered, \"to abandon his faith, and convert to Islam\". Guru Tegh Bahadur and his colleagues refused, he and his associates were arrested, tortured for many weeks. The Guru himself was beheaded in public.\n\nSikhism is a monotheistic religion; Sikhs believe there is only one God, who has infinite qualities and names. According to Eleanor Nesbitt, English renderings of Sikhism as a monotheistic religion \"tend misleadingly to reinforce a Semitic understanding of monotheism, rather than Guru Nanak's mystical awareness of the one that is expressed through the many. However, what is not in doubt is the emphasis on 'one'\".\n\nHinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, agnosticism, deism and atheism.\n\nHinduism splits people into 4 groups, namely Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishyas and Shudras. But the terms \"varna\" (theoretical classification based on occupation) and \"jāti\" (caste) are two distinct concepts. Jāti (community) refers to the thousands of endogamous groups prevalent across the subcontinent. A jati may be divided into exogamous groups based on the same gotras. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the varnas; even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.\n\nSikhism treats all people equally and founds systems such as Langar and Pangat to help play this out in daily life.\nOnce a person initiates into the Khalsa (Sikh Baptism) it is said that they no longer belong to any caste.\nThis, however, does not imply that the practice of caste hierarchy is absent within the adherents of Sikhism. Caste hierarchy is generally a social reality within the Indian subcontinent regardless of religious affiliation.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh founded the Nirmale school to help teach Sanskrit and classical Hindu literature, which was then was primarily only available to the higher caste Brahmins, the Guru in this way translated many Hindu works into Punjabi.\n\nSikhs believe in \"naam jap\" (meditation), and focus on listening to the hymns from Guru Granth Sahib, the central religious scripture of Sikh faith. The Guru is the focal point of worship in any Sikh \"Gurdwara\", and the worshippers bow before it. Guru Granth Sahib is installed every morning and put to bed at night in many \"Gurdwaras\".\n\nDifferent schools of Hinduism have different theories about rituals and on salvation (moksha). However, they are primarily based around Puja (devotional worship to a personal deity, often using an idol or Murthi), and Yajna (ritual non-human/non-animal sacrifice).\n\nSikhs shun idol worship as a part of their faith.\n\nHindus accept the worship facilitated with images or \"murti\"s (idols), particularly in Agamic traditions, such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism. Some scholars state it is incorrect to state that all Hindus worship idols, and more correct to state that for some the idol is a means to focus their thoughts, for some idol is a manifestation of spirituality that is everywhere, and for some even a linga, a sunrise or a river or a flower serves the same purpose. Hindu temples are called Mandirs, while Sikh temples are called Gurdwaras. However, the most famous Sikh shrine is called Hari Mandir.\n\nThe Sikh concept of salvation is similar to some schools of Hinduism, and it is called mukti (moksha) referring to spiritual liberation. It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths. Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through \"God's grace\". In the teachings of the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib, the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for \"Mukti\".\n\nSikhism recommends Naam Simran as the way to mukti, which is meditating.\n\nThe six major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy offer diverse soteriological views on moksha, including whether moksha can be achieved in this life, or after this life. The Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider moksha as possible only after death. Samkhya and Yoga schools consider moksha as possible in this life. In Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes moksha is possible in this life. The Dvaita and Visistadvaita sub-schools of Vedanta tradition, highlighted by many poet-saints of the Bhakti movement, believe that moksha is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life moksha.\n\nHinduism does not explicitly prohibit eating meat, but it does strongly recommend Ahimsa – the concept of non-violence against all life forms including animals. As a consequence, many Hindus prefer vegetarian or lacto-vegetarian lifestyle, and methods of food production that is in harmony with nature and compassionate, respectful of other life forms as well as nature.\n\nThe tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, but rather leave the decision of diet to the individual. Sikh sects and groups that have a \"Vashnavite\" influence (AKJ, GNNSJ, 3HO, Namdhari's etc.) tend to be vegetarians. Other Sikhs eat meat that has been prepared by the Jhatka method (meat prepared by sudden death of the animal), and consider only that meat as expressly forbidden that is ritually slaughtered like Kosher or Halal (Kutha meat, the meat of animals prepared by slowly bleeding it to death). HS Singha explains the Jhatka meat requirement to have support in the Hindu tradition as well, as follows,\n\n\nIn the Hindu and Sikh traditions, there is a distinction between religion and culture, and ethical decisions are grounded in both religious beliefs and cultural values. Both Hindu and Sikh ethics are primarily duty based. Traditional teachings deal with the duties of individuals and families to maintain a lifestyle conducive to physical, mental and spiritual health. These traditions share a culture and world view that includes ideas of karma and rebirth, collective versus individual identity, and a strong emphasis on spiritual purity.\n\nThe notion of dharma, karma, moksha are very important for both Hindus and Sikhs. Unlike the linear view of life, death, heaven or hell taken in Abrahamic religions, for Hindus and Sikhs believe in the concept of Saṃsāra, that is life, birth and death are repeated, for each soul, in a cycle until one reaches mukti or moksha.\n\nThere is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs' ancestors were Hindus. Some Hindus view Sikhism as a tradition within Hinduism (such as some Hindus referring to Sikhs as Keshdhari Hindus), even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion. Historically, Sikhs were seen as the protectors of Hindus and were even considered the \"sword arm\" of Hinduism. This status as protectors of Hindus was strong enough that Punjabi Hindus would often raise their eldest son as a Sikh.\n\nMarriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among \"Khatris\", are frequent. Dogra states that there has always been inter-marriage between the Hindu and the Sikh communities. Charing and Cole state that \"Sikhism originated and developed within Hinduism. Hindus and Sikhs, in initial years of Sikhism, used to have what is termed as \"Roti Beti di Sanjh\"; that is they eat together and intermarry\". William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi state that for some Sikhs, intermarriage between Hindus and Sikhs of same community was preferable than other communities.\n\nIn the past, Sikh scriptures were treated as part of the corpus of the sacred writing of Hindus.\n\n\n\n"}

In its most basic form, it states that Bahá'ís should make a 19% voluntary payment on any wealth in excess of what is necessary to live comfortably, after the remittance of any outstanding debt. The money is then disbursed to social and economic development projects, or similar philanthropic purposes.\n\nBahá'u'lláh wrote down the law of Huqúqu'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in 1873, but he did not accept any payments initially. In 1878 he appointed the first trustee of the Huqúqu'lláh, who had the responsibility of receiving the \"Huqúq\" from the Bahá'ís in Iran. Later this was expanded to the Bahá'ís of the Middle East. In 1985 information about the \"Huqúq\" was distributed worldwide and in 1992 the law was made universally applicable. As the number of payments increased, deputies and representatives to receive the payments have been appointed. In 1991 the central office of Huqúqu'lláh was established at the Bahá'í World Centre in Haifa, Israel.\n\nDuring the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh, the offerings were made directly to him, and following his death, to `Abdu'l-Bahá. In his Will and Testament, `Abdu'l-Bahá provided that Huqúqu'lláh be offered after him \"through the Guardian of the Cause of God\". Since the election of the Universal House of Justice, it is to this institution that payments are made.\n\n\nThe following is a basic timeline of the institution of Huqúqu'lláh.\n\nThe Huquq'ullah is not meant to be a donation, but is rather meant to be a claim by God for support of the interests of all people. It is partly used to equalize wealth across different parts of the world. The payment of the Huquq'ullah is also meant to increase the spiritual link between the religion's central institutions and the individual. This offering is to be considered separate from giving to the various Bahá’í funds and takes precedence over them. Furthermore, the Huquq'ullah should not be solicited by anyone, and no payments of it can be accepted unless the individual was doing so \"with the utmost joy\".\n\nThe payment of Huqúqu'lláh is based on the calculation of the value of the individual’s possessions, which includes one’s merchandise, property and income, after all necessary expenses have been paid. If a person has possessions or wealth in excess of what is necessary equal in value to at least nineteen mithqáls of gold (2.2246 ounces or 69 grams) it is a spiritual obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount, once only, as Huqúqu'lláh. Thereafter, whenever an individual acquires more possessions or wealth from income by the amount of at least nineteen mithqáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this increase, and so on for each further increase.\n\nCertain categories of possessions are exempt from the payment of the Huqúqu'lláh, such as one’s residence, necessary household furnishings, business or professional equipment and furnishings, and others. Bahá'u'lláh has left it to the individual to decide which items are considered necessary and which are not. Specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss, the failure of investments to yield a profit and for the payment of the Huqúqu'lláh in the event of the person’s death.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50796485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50796485", "title": "Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Ruiz", "text": "Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Ruiz\n\nLuis Hernando de Larramendi Ruiz (1882-1957) was a Spanish Carlist politician and theorist. Though his term as a party \"jefe\" was rather short (1919-1921), he stands out as monumental figure in history of the 20th-century Carlism, remaining among its leaders for some 40 years and taking part in decision-making process from the mid-1910s until the mid-1950s. As author he is recognized for his 1937 work, \"El sistema tradicional\", an orthodox lecture of Traditionalism.\n\nLuis’ paternal family was related to Old Castile; one of his ancestors gained recognition as member of the Cura Merino unit, fighting the French during the War of Independence; he served under the same commander also during the First Carlist War. Later on the family found itself on the descendant path and Luis’ grandparents were referred to as \"laboradores modestos\". His father, Mariano Hernando Ruiz (1861-1913), originated from Riaza in the province of Segovia; he studied medicine but upon graduating has never practiced; instead, he made a living by trading arts, mostly paintings and sculptures. Heavily engaged in preparing the Spanish pavilion for the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, apart from presenting art he also co-ordinated works related to construction of a bullring in the Trocadero park. He has never made it to the affluent bourgeoisie strata and back in Madrid suffered financial problems, living first at Calle Ancha de San Bernardo and then at Calle Lista. Mariano Hernando married Maria Cuadrado, with whom he had 3 children. Upon her premature death he remarried with Luisa Larramendi Serrano, also a madrileña though of Alavese origins. The couple had 6 children, Luis born as the oldest of the siblings and the only son.\n\nThe young Luis was first educated at the Madrid Instituto de San Isídro, a prestigious Jesuit establishment with long distinguished record; it is there where he got his baccalaureate and where he made acquaintances, some of them later public figures like Luis Urquijo, marqués de Amurrio. However, it is also at the college where despite his penchant for letters he ran into problems with the teacher of Retórica y Poética, resulting in Luis’ later lukewarm attitude towards the Jesuits and formal education. At unspecified date he entered Facultad de Derecho at Universidad de Madrid; not averse towards bohemian lifestyle, he befriended the likes of Alejandro Sawa and Ramón Valle Inclán. Date of graduation is not known, apart that it was prior to 1905; at that time he was already practicing law as an intern, to open his own law office later on. In honor of his maternal family Luis got his name changed from Hernando y Larramendi to Hernando de Larramendi y Ruiz.\n\nDuring his academic years Larramendi met a sister of his university colleague Mariano de Montiano, María de Montiano y Uriarte (1886-1976), originating from Bilbao. Daughter of a physician, descendant to a noble prestigious family and considered the most handsome girl in the city, she was also fanatically Basque. They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904; he tended to be quiet and unassuming, she was also introvert, but of a decisive and bold character. The couple settled at Calle Valázquez; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls. The oldest son, Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, became known nationwide as longtime manager and the moving spirit behind MAPFRE, a corporate insurance giant; other children did not grow to prominence nationwide. Luis' grandson, Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Martínez, is one of the current Carlist leaders.\n\nMariano Hernando was not a Carlist; it was thanks to the influence of his paternal grandfather that during his childhood and youth Luis embraced Carlism. When at the University he befriended a number of Traditionalist-minded students like conde Rodezno, conde de Doña Marina and ; together with them in the first decade of the 20th century he was active in Juventud Carlista and Congregación de los Luises, a Jesuit youth organization. In 1904 he was briefly editor-in-chief of an ephemeral Carlist daily \"El Correo de Guipúzcoa\", though it is not clear whether he lived in San Sebastián at that time. In Madrid he gained recognition in 1905 becoming secretary of Sección de Ciencias Historicas of Ateneo de Madrid, though principally as a young and successful lawyer, involved in cases gaining wider publicity.\n\nWhen in Ateneo Larramendi embarked on Catholic propaganda, trying to confront the growing secularization tide. In 1906 he addressed Cortes with legal note, aimed against the plan to introduce civil marriages; in 1910 he published \"Cómo defendernos de las escuelas laicas\", a booklet aimed against the concept of public, secular, free and obligatory school, launched by the republican groupings; Larramendi claimed that fathers had the right to bring up their children the way they wanted. Campaigning against secular education carried him as far as to Andalusia, though his principal battleground were various public fora of the capital; apart from the Ateneo he spoke also in theatres and apart from education discussed also Catholic syndicalism and episodes of public blasphemy, soon growing to president of the Madrid branch of Juventud Jaimista.\n\nIn 1910 Larramendi decided to run on Traditionalist ticket for the Cortes; as he was unrelated to Asturias, it is not clear why he chose the district of Oviedo. Competing against local heavyweights like Melquíades Álvarez and he stood little chance and lost, afterwards appealing corruption and unfair deployment of Guardia Civil. The following year he tried his chances in local elections in Valencia; this time banking on support of local Carlists like and , the latter running a daily \"Diario de Valencia\"; the bid proved unsuccessful. In Madrid he engaged in launching a periodical of Traditionalist youth, which eventually materialized as \"Juventud – Organo de las Juventudes Tradicionalistas\". Given lack of broader Carlist base in Madrid the initiative proved to be short-lived, and the weekly was issued in 1912-1913 only. Nevertheless, Larramendi was already well known among conservative youth of the capital: \"quién no conoce al simpático y cultisimo Larramendi?\" – asked one of the periodicals. With ease of writing, by the mid-1910s he supplied Carlist periodicals as far as Tortosa, Castellón, Alicante and Badajoz, let alone other titles in Madrid.\n\nIn the 1910s Larramendi neared the socially-minded Carlists known as the \"Zaragoza group\" and composed of Pascual Comín, Salvador Minguijón, r and Inocencio Jiménez; they animated \"La Paz Social\" periodical and the likewise named booklet series that the first Larramendi’s work formed part of. He co-operated with their Centro de Publicaciones Católicas, fascinated by French Catholic scholars grouped around Leon Garriguet. Though he eventually failed to translate Antonin Sertillanges, thanks to his work the Centro released the Spanish version of Albert Rougenant’s \"A propos de la crise de l'Apprentissage\" (1911).\n\nAlso in liaison with the Zaragoza group Larramendi published a series of booklets under the common title \"En la Avanzada\". \"Crítica política. Cuestiones vascas. Cinematógrafo\" (1911) exploited the revolution v. counterrevolution antinomy; touching upon the Basque subject, it defended provincial fueros but lambasted separatists. \"Catecismo á los ateos. ¿Qué son las escuelas laicas? Romanones, ¡á la barra!\" (1913) re-prnted earlier pamphlets and went on with new onslaught on secular education, based on outdated illusions of Rousseau. Finally, \"¡Viva el Rey! Psicología social y literaria\" (1914) tackled major issues like monarchy, strikes, self-government and labor organization, though it also discussed literature. Apart from publications he did not neglect attending public meetings, delivering addresses across Spain at gatherings flavored with Carlism or social-Catholicism.\n\nIn the 1910s Carlism was increasingly paralyzed by internal crisis related to conflict between the claimant Don Jaime and the key party theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella; both factions competed to control the Madrid-based semi-official Carlist daily, \"\". Larramendi remained fully loyal to his king; moreover, as a lawyer he helped to transfer the newspaper ownership to marqués de Valldespina and to purge the editorial board from dissenters like . He confirmed his image of a loyal subject also during the 1914 elections. With propaganda campaign already in full swing, the party candidate in Vitoria, Esteban Bilbao, balked at the official plan and fielded his candidature in Durango; as emergency measure Larramendi was asked to replace him. It turned out he had little chance standing against the Conservative leader, Eduardo Dato, though following defeat he did not hesitate to appeal administrative pressure. \n\nIn the late 1910s Larramendi was already recognized as an important figure in the party, though he did not rise to executive structures either nationwide or on the regional Castilian basis and was rather considered a young man for the future. The setting changed dramatically when following the end of World War One the claimant was released from his confinement in Austria and early 1919 arrived in Paris to reclaim party leadership from the Mellistas. The conflict exploded in expulsion of de Mella and massive defections of his supporters, many of them occupying key positions in Carlist structures; command chain of the party was decimated. Political delegate of the king in Spain, marqués de Cerralbo, resigned; he was only provisionally replaced by Pascual Comín, who upon appointment declared he was not prepared to stay at the helm longer than provisionally.\n\nComín appreciated Larramendi following works of the Zaragoza group; he suggested that the Madrid lawyer becomes his replacement. Don Jaime acknowledged Larramendi’s loyalty during the strife for control of \"El Correo\". Moreover, as a young militant deprived of own political basis he seemed to have posed no threat to royal leadership; his location in Madrid and profession of a lawyer offered additional advantages. Lack of experience was a disadvantage; Melgar dissuaded the choice also due to pro-German Larramendi’s leaning during the war. Don Jaime’s special envoy to Madrid returned with good news and in August 1919 the claimant appointed Larramendi his key representative in Spain and effectively the party leader, though not with the title of Jefe Delegado, but as a Secretario General.\n\nLarramendi faced an extremely difficult task of re-building command structures. He threw himself into a series of hectic meetings with provincial and regional leaders, incessantly touring the country; in some cases, like Catalonia or Valencia, he faced also bitter personal conflicts. Apart from that, as a lawyer he successfully kept fighting off the Mellistas when struggling for \"El Correo\". His first major initiative was launching the project of a grand Carlist assembly; it materialized in November 1919 as Magna Junta de Biarritz. The event was a success as it consolidated the party and helped it to re-gain momentum, even though in none of 3 major issued debated - re-organization, financial problems and marriage of Don Jaime - any key decision was adopted.\n\nIn 1920 Larramendi focused mostly on engineering the Carlist electoral campaign; none of the scholarly sources consulted provides information on what strategy he adopted, though he is known to have angrily rejected veiled calls for a low-denomination Catholic right-wing alliance, advocated by emergent accidentalist Christian-Democratic groupings and their mouthpiece, \"El Debate\". The campaign was an utter failure; 3 mandates secured was the worst result since the Carlists joined electoral competition in the early 1890s. Also personally Larramendi had to acknowledge defeat: running in the Navarrese district of Aoiz, for some 20 years almost an exclusive Carlist electoral fiefdom, he lost to a Conservative counter-candidate.\n\nIn 1921 Larramendi seemed already overwhelmed by mounting problems; another one were rumors about negotiations related to some sort of dynastic accord, allegedly conducted by Don Jaime with the Alfonsist branch; Larramendi has always been fiercely hostile to any compromise with the despised Liberal dynasty. He arranged for another grand meeting; it took place in Lourdes, though due to lower attendance and minor scale of discussions taking place it was rather an operational session than a milestone comparable to the Biarritz amassment; it provided Larramendi with little assistance. Soon afterwards the claimant left for Colombia with hardly any guidance or information passed to his delegate in Spain; upon his return, in the summer of 1921, Larramendi handed his resignation. When discussing its background, some scholars claim he was tired of uphill struggle; others point to talks with the Alfonsists and general Don Jaime’s detachment or Larramendi’s remorse about the 1920 electoral disaster.\n\nReplaced as Carlist political leader by marqués de Villores, Larramendi remained engaged in the party executive; his activity was related to dynastical issues rather than to daily business. In 1922 he represented Don Jaime’s sister, Doña Blanca, in court; wife to a member of the imperial Habsburg house she refused to recognize the Austrian republic and sought shelter in Spain. Larramendi presented her case when claiming the Spanish citizenship, resulting in a booklet titled \"Dictamen referente a la nacionalidad de S.A.R. Doña Blanca de Borbón y Borbón\". His efforts were crowned with success and Doña Blanca with her family settled in Barcelona. In the future the episode would prove of great value for the Carloctavista dynastic claim, but no source clarifies whether in the early 1920s Larramendi considered her sons would-be claimants to the Spanish throne. It is confirmed, however, that he was acutely aware of the looming dynastical crisis. As Don Jaime, at that time in his early 50s, had no offspring, the Carlist branch was endangered with extinction. Larramendi kept advocating last-minute rescue mission by Don Jaime’s marriage with his niece; the scheme crashed when in 1922 Fabiola Massimo married an Italian aristocrat.\n\nThe 1923 advent of Primo de Rivera dictatorship brought national political life to a standstill: all parties have been dissolved. It seems that initially Larramendi welcomed the coup as doing away with a long overdue liberal democracy and a stepping stone towards Traditionalist monarchy, position fairly popular among the Carlists; his friend, Víctor Pradera, wholeheartedly engaged in building the regime structures. In late 1924 Larramendi addressed the military directorate with a letter; it contained congratulations on \"patriotic work\" and offered personal services. Another letter denied lack of understanding for \"movimiento regenerador de 13 de Septiembre\"; written from clearly Jaimist positions, it praised the military for cracking down on and bureaucracy, considered support for the government \"most basic duty of a citizen\" and even declared Alfonso XIII \"más fecunda encarnación de España\".\n\nIt seems that in the mid-1920s Larramendi’s lukewarm approval turned into disappointment, still in line with official line adopted by Don Jaime. He could not understand how Rodezno, his juvenile acquaintance of love-and-hate relationship, could have accepted the Villafranca mayorship \"given the circumstances\"; by his son he was recollected as opposed to Primo and refusing to join either Unión Patriótica or any other primoderiverista structure. Indeed, in the late 1920s he was recorded mostly as active in the Catholic realm, giving lectures and once assigned a somewhat ambiguous praise of \"Ganivet Católico\". Though in 1930 he took part in Catholic political initiatives of strongly leaning, like the Salamanca gathering with Gil-Robles and Herrera Oria, he stood firmly by monarchist views, also during confusion of the last months of the monarchy, at times attracting fire from the young Jaimist hot-heads.\n\nFrom his Calle de Velázquez apartment Larramendi watched revolutionary masses ruling the streets of Madrid during declaration of the Republic in April 1931 and soon afterwards the smoke of burning churches during Quema de Conventos in May. Amongst bewilderment of the Right he decided to defend the monarchist cause standing in the forthcoming Cortes elections as a Jaimist candidate in Madrid. His campaign confronted the anti-clerical and anti-religious tide head on: Larramendi referred to the Church as to a truly popular structure, with priests and friars \"la sangre del pueblo más humilde de España\". With his propaganda machine reduced to some 30 members of the Madrid Círculo Jaimista he gathered some 7,500 votes, compared to 134,000 votes for the leading candidate and 36,000 for the last candidate elected.\n\nDuring the summer Larramendi launched a new periodical, \"Criterio. Revista Semanal de Orientación Política y Literaria\". Some authors claim he was one of key people behind it, others name him manager of the weekly, which represented \"most combative Carlism\". In late 1931 and early 1932 \"Criterio\" was enthusiastically supporting unification of three Traditionalist branches in , though it remained a private enterprise. It attracted a few known names like Pradera, and , but in August closed due to financial problems. Larramendi engaged also in Traditionalist propaganda meetings, at times featured among the party pundits. In late 1932 and across 1933 his activity became intense and there was hardly a month without a press note on his public harangues; in June 1933 he defended in court generals accused of taking part in Sanjurjada.\n\nThough recognized in the movement as one its former leader and one of most experienced militants, during the early 1930s he did not count among top Carlist executive. His relations with the new party leader Rodezno have always been ambiguous; in the 1930s they were aggravated by differences on policy versus the Alfonsists; unlike Rodezno, Larramendi was as usual vehemently opposed to compromising intransigent Carlist stand and averse to entering . He claimed that an alliance would turn 100 years of Carlist history, including 80,000 men who gave lives for their king, into a comedy; moreover, such an ambiguous coalition would merely weaken the only force capable of confronting the revolution, namely Traditionalism.\n\nDuring gear-up to the 1933 electoral campaign he was overruled by Rodezno, who pushed for a joint far-Right alliance. Larramendi decided to comply and agreed to stand as a sole Traditionalist candidate on a joint \"Coalición antimarxista\" list in Madrid. The campaign in general was a triumph of the Right, but in the urban Madrid constituency PSOE retained its dominant position and Larramendi, though attracted 130,000 votes, failed again. Despite the defeat suffered, he continued with intense propaganda activity, which in the mid-1930 became nothing less than hectic. There were periods when hardly a week passed by without his public appearance noted in the press, the Traditionalist one hailing him as \"elocuente orador\".\n\nIn 1934 Rodezno was replaced as the Carlist leader by Manuel Fal Conde; the new setting suited Larramendi more, and he soon started to assume high positions within the party structures. In 1934 he was appointed to Consejo de Cultura, a decorative body entrusted with disseminating Traditionalist thought. More important was his 1935 nomination to Consejo de Comunión Tradicionalista, set up as a collective executive supposed to assist Fal. Fully aligned with the leader, Larramendi went on lambasting any conservative compromise and kept voicing against new far-Right coalitions.\n\nA penchant for accord with the Alfonsinos, demonstrated by some Carlists, stemmed from a looming dynastical crisis; the claimant Don Alfonso Carlos was an octogenarian and there was no clear successor in sight. Larramendi was leaning towards the deposed Portuguese Braganza family, pointing to Duarte Nuño as to a potential Carlist successor. However, later he got converted to a regentialist solution. In early 1936 it was Larramendi, considered totally loyal and an excellent lawyer, who edited the royal decree of Alfonso Carlos; it nominated Don Javier as the future Carlist regent. As authority he wrote prologue to \"Historia critica del tradicionalismo español\" of . His vital role was reflected in the 1936 electoral campaign, when together with Fal he negotiated a failed deal with Gil-Robles. For unclear reasons he ran in Gerona; his name sounded strange among Catalan candidates though it was Frente Popular triumph which contributed to his next electoral failure. Last but not least, as an abogado he kept defending Carlists before the Republican courts.\n\nIt is not clear whether Larramendi was aware of Carlist gear-up to the 1936 coup. In early July with half of his children he moved to the usual family summer location in San Sebastián; his wife and remaining children joined him on July 14. When learning about the rising in Morocco he noted „todo estaba perdido”, probably reflecting his mistrust towards the military. Since in Gipuzkoa the insurgency failed, as a safety measure he moved to a nearby hotel, but on July 20 left the city and made it on foot to Navarre, already controlled by the Carlists. In September, together with the victorious Requeté, he returned to San Sebastián and commenced editing a new Carlist periodical, \"La Voz de España\"; he is also noted as helping some PNV activists to flee.\n\nLarramendi did not enter any of the wartime Carlist ruling bodies, though he remained among close collaborators of Don Javier. Already in late 1936 he voiced against Falangist drive for power; when unification within a state party became a burning issue in early 1937 he tended to skepticism. He was present during a meeting of Carlist executive in Insua, but there is little data on his stance. It seems that like most Traditionalist leaders he was disoriented; the only information available is that he insisted on clear war objectives. The Insua meeting was his last appearance amongst the party leaders before the was announced.\n\nLarramendi refused to join Francoist structures and criticized those who did; he verbally assaulted Julio Muñoz Aguilar, co-editor from \"La Voz de España\", for an article supporting Franco. In 1937 he closed himself for a month in a San Sebastián hotel and wrote \"El sistema tradicional\". The work was an orthodox lecture of political Traditionalism, stemming from assumption that traditionalist system does not need to be implemented: it exists as a natural phenomenon. It is not clear whether Larramendi hoped to get the work published; it was not possible before 1952, when it went to print as \"Cristiandad, Tradición y Realeza\". In 1938 he agreed that two of his sons, aged 17 and 16, enlist to Requeté.\n\nIn 1939 Larramendi returned to Madrid, still in touch with Don Javier. In 1940 the Alfonsist heir, Don Juan, addressed the regent with a letter, seeking dynastic concord; Larramendi made sure the response was as harsh and uncompromising as possible. He remained a central figure among Madrid Traditionalists and supplied party youth bulletins, issued by semi-clandestine AET, with his articles. Though falling short of openly anti-Francoist language, they constituted a call for loyalty to Carlism, during its history \"exonerado, proscrito, confiscado en prisiones, fusilado, asesinado, perseguido, traicionado, calumniado, silenciado, y vendido durante más de un siglo, dado por muerte mil veces\", but remaining \"tradición inmarcesible de la España eterna\". He took part in public Carlist events, tolerated by the regime, e.g. the annual Fiesta de los Mártires de la Tradición or funerals of Carlist leaders.\n\nOn the practical side, Larramendi resumed his career of a lawyer. The number of his customers decreased as they realized that the new political setting provided him with neither political influence nor any other benefits. He continued serving some of the older clientele, e.g. in the 1940s fighting legal battles related to heritage and last will of a Carlist aristocrat, barón de Sangarren.\n\nIn the late 1940s Larramendi, at that time almost 70, acquired the status of Carlist moral authority if not a movement's patriarch. He was aging quickly; in the 1950s he suffered heavily from arteriosclerosis and loss of sight, gradually turning almost blind. Nevertheless, he remained engaged in internal politics and counted among those who advocated termination of the regency, to be replaced with personal claim of Don Javier. In 1952 he presided over the Consejo Nacional de la Tradición meeting, discussing how it should be advanced; due to health reasons he did not attend the , where Don Javier was effectively introduced as a king. In 1955 Larramendi met his monarch for the last time. When in the mid-1950s the intransigent Carlist opposition to Franco came under fire as inefficient and counter-productive, Larramendi kept protesting a would-be rapprochement. Some scholars claim that in 1956 he was nominated to a new Carlist executive, Secretariado General; this is not impossible, as at that time Larramendi was sort of a Carlist living saint; however, others point rather to his son, Ignacio.\n\nIt seems that despite his longtime presence among top Carlist political strata, Larramendi generated little personal antagonism; cases of open challenge are scarce and seem to be rather circumstantial, while there is evidence of respect even among the most die-hard Carlist enemies, the Anarchists. Following death he was gradually falling into oblivion; the popular Madrid daily \"ABC\" mentioned him for the first time in 1982, in a commemorative article by his grandson. It was only in the late 1980s that his name started to circulate widely in public discourse, all thanks to Fundación Hernando de Larramendi, set up by his son in 1986. Its declared mission is to promote \"caridad en las relaciones sociales\" in line with the Catholic teaching, to act as independent think-tank, to study history of Carlism and to support non-commercial scientific research; its most visible activities are those related to dissemination of Traditionalist thought and promotion of Carlist studies. The foundation honors Larramendi’s name in editorial series, titled \"Colección Luis Hernando de Larramendi\", and in awards in history of Carlism, named Premio Internacional de Historia del Carlismo Luis Hernando de Larramendi.\n\nLuis Hernando de Larramendi gained no dedicated scholarly work; the closest thing to a monograph are chapters dedicated to his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, \"Así se hizo MAPFRE\" (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they paint a picture of a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.\n\nIn Carlist historiography Larramendi is treated briefly, usually when discussing his 1919-1921 leadership tenure and the 1936 decree of Don Alfonso Carlos. In history of political thought his written opus, \"El sistema tradicional\", went largely unnoticed and is not discussed in Spain. Abroad Larramendi has been acknowledged as important, though not a first-row thinker, noted rather for his legal dynastic reading. His son presented \"El sistema\" in sequence of great theoretical works, following those of Gil Robles, Vázquez de Mella and Pradera, and preceding those of Elías de Tejada and Gambra. He is portrayed as sworn Christian counter-revolutionary, concerned with justice in general and protection of the weak in particular. The enemy of democracy founded on universal suffrage, he embraced the vision of Catholic monarchy, based on traditional social establishments and organic representation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "68904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68904", "title": "Michael J. Fox", "text": "Michael J. Fox\n\nMichael Andrew Fox (born June 9, 1961), known professionally as Michael J. Fox, is a Canadian-American actor, author, film producer, activist and comedian with a film and television career spanning from the 1970s. He starred in the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy where he portrayed Marty McFly. Other notable roles have included Mike Flaherty on the ABC sitcom \"Spin City\" (1996–2000) and his portrayal of Alex P. Keaton on the American sitcom \"Family Ties\". He has won five Primetime Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, a Grammy Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nFox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991 at age 29, and disclosed his condition to the public in 1998. He partly retired from acting in 2000 as the symptoms of his disease worsened. He has since become an advocate for research toward finding a cure; he created the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Sweden's Karolinska Institutet gave him an \"honoris causa\" doctorate on March 5, 2010 for his work advocating a cure for Parkinson's disease.\n\nSince 1999, Fox has mainly worked as a voice-over actor in films such as \"Stuart Little\" and Disney's \"\". On the CBS TV show \"The Good Wife\", he earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years for his recurring role as crafty attorney Louis Canning. He has also taken recurring guest roles and cameo appearances in \"Boston Legal\", \"Scrubs\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", \"Rescue Me\", and \"Designated Survivor\". He has released the \"Lucky Man: A Memoir\" (2002), \"Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist\" (2009), and \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future: Twists and Turns and Lessons Learned\" (2010). He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2010. He also was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2000.\n\nMichael Andrew Fox was born on June 9, 1961, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to Phyllis (\"née\" Piper), an actress/payroll clerk, and William Fox, a police officer and Canadian Forces member.\n\nFox's family lived in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career. Their family finally moved to Burnaby, a large suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack. Fox attended Burnaby Central Secondary School, and now has a theatre named for him at Burnaby South Secondary. At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series \"Leo and Me\", produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided to move back to Vancouver. Fox is one of four members of the \"Leo and Me\" cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.\n\nFox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film \"Letters from Frank\", credited under the name \"Michael Fox.\" He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild, which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities (and the possibility that royalty checks would be sent to the wrong actors), he discovered that Michael Fox, a veteran character actor, was already registered under the name. As he explained in his autobiography, \"Lucky Man: A Memoir\" and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name. He did not like the sound of \"Michael A. Fox\" during a time when \"fox\" was coming to mean \"attractive\" and because his middle initial sounded too much like the Canadian \"eh?\" He also didn't like the sound of \"Andrew\" or \"Andy,\" so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on \"J,\" as a tribute to actor Michael J. Pollard.\n\nFox's first feature film roles were \"Midnight Madness\" (1980) and \"Class of 1984\" (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing \"Young Republican\" Alex P. Keaton in the show \"Family Ties\", which aired on NBC for seven seasons from 1982–89. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon in April 2014, Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at Pioneer Chicken. He received the role only after Matthew Broderick was unavailable. \"Family Ties\" had been sold to the television network using the pitch \"Hip parents, square kids\", with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode. At its peak, the audience for \"Family Ties\" drew one-third of America's households every week. Fox won three Emmy awards for \"Family Ties\" in 1986, 1987, and 1988. He also won a Golden Globe Award in 1989.\n\nBrandon Tartikoff, one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that \"this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box.\" After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription \"To Brandon, this is for you to put your crow in. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox.\" Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.\n\nWhile filming \"Family Ties\", Fox met his wife, Tracy Pollan, who portrayed his girlfriend, Ellen. When Fox left the TV series \"Spin City\", his final episodes made numerous allusions to \"Family Ties\": Michael Gross (who played Alex's father Steven) portrays Mike Flaherty's (Fox's character's) therapist, and there is a reference to an off-screen character named \"Mallory\". Also, when Flaherty becomes an environmental lobbyist in Washington, D.C., he meets a conservative senator from Ohio named Alex P. Keaton, and in one episode Meredith Baxter played Mike's mother.\n\nAs a consequence of working in \"Family Ties\", as well as his acting in \"Teen Wolf\" and \"Back to the Future\", Fox became a teen idol. VH1's show \"The Greatest\" later naming him among their \"50 Greatest Teen Idols.\"\n\nIn January 1985, Fox was cast to replace Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in \"Back to the Future\".\nRobert Zemeckis, the director, originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg the creator of \"Family Ties\", which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming \"Back to the Future\", but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in \"Once Bitten\", but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for \"Family Ties\" from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the \"Back to the Future\" set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30 a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. \"Back to the Future\" was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. \"Variety\" applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, \"Back to the Future Part II\" (1989) and \"Back to the Future Part III\" (1990).\n\nDuring and immediately after the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, Fox starred in \"Teen Wolf\" (1985),\" Light of Day\" (1987), \"The Secret of My Success\" (1987), \"Bright Lights, Big City\" (1988), and \"Casualties of War\" (1989).\n\nIn \"The Secret of My Success\", Fox played a recent graduate from Kansas State University who moves to New York City, where he has to deal with the ups and downs of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, grossing $110 million worldwide. Roger Ebert in \"The Chicago Sun Times\" wrote; \"Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls.\"\n\nIn \"Bright Lights, Big City\", Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in \"The Washington Post\" criticizing Fox by claiming that \"he was the wrong actor for the job\". Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: \"Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)\". During the shooting of \"Bright Lights, Big City\", Fox co-starred again with Tracy Pollan, his on-screen girlfriend from \"Family Ties\".\n\nFox then starred in \"Casualties of War\", a dark and violent war drama about the Vietnam War, alongside Sean Penn. \"Casualties of War\" was not a major box office hit, but Fox, playing a private serving in Vietnam, received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic's website wrote; \"Fox, only one year beyond his \"Family Ties\" sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn.\"\n\nIn 1991, he starred in \"Doc Hollywood\", a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. Michael Caton-Jones, from \"Time Out\", described Fox in the film as \"at his frenetic best\". \"The Hard Way\" was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer James Woods. After being privately diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1991 and being cautioned he had \"ten good working years left\", Fox hastily signed a three-film contract, appearing in \"For Love or Money\" (1993), \"Life With Mikey\" (1993), and \"Greedy\" (1994). The mid-1990s saw Fox play smaller supporting roles in \"The American President\" (1995) and \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996).\n\nHis last major film role was in \"The Frighteners\" (1996), directed by Peter Jackson. \"The Frighteners\" tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his \"ghost hunting\" business. However, a mass murderer comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, Kenneth Turan in the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote; \"The film's actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and [Trini] Alvarado, who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things.\"\n\nHe voiced the American Bulldog Chance in Disney's live-action film \"\" and its sequel \"\", the titular character in \"Stuart Little\" and its two sequels \"Stuart Little 2\" and \"\", and Milo Thatch in Disney's animated film \"\".\n\n\"Spin City\" ran from 1996 to 2002 on American television network ABC. The show was based on a fictional local government running New York City, originally starring Fox as Mike Flaherty, a Fordham Law School graduate serving as the Deputy Mayor of New York. Fox won an Emmy award for \"Spin City\" in 2000, three Golden Globe Awards in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1999 and 2000. During the third season of \"Spin City\", Fox made the announcement to the cast and crew of the show that he had Parkinson's disease. During the fourth season, he announced his retirement from the show. He announced that he planned to continue to act and would make guest appearances on \"Spin City\" (he made three more appearances on the show during the final season). After leaving the show, he was replaced by Charlie Sheen, who portrayed the character Charlie Crawford. Altogether, 145 episodes were produced. Fox also served as an executive producer during his time on the show, alongside co-creators Bill Lawrence and Gary David Goldberg.\n\nIn 2004, Fox guest starred in two episodes of the comedy-drama \"Scrubs\" as Dr. Kevin Casey, a surgeon with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. The series was created by \"Spin City\" creator Bill Lawrence. In 2006, he appeared in four episodes of \"Boston Legal\" as a lung cancer patient. The producers brought him back in a recurring role for Season three, beginning with the season premiere. Fox was nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest appearance.\n\nIn 2009, he appeared in five episodes of the television series \"Rescue Me\" which earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Since 2000 Fox has released three books, \"Lucky Man: A Memoir\" (2002), \"Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist\" (2009), and \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future: Twists and Turns and Lessons Learned\" (2010). Starting in 2010, Fox played a recurring role in the US drama \"The Good Wife\" as crafty attorney Louis Canning and earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years. In 2011, Fox was featured as himself in the eighth season of the Larry David vehicle, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\". David's character (also himself) becomes a temporary resident of the New York City apartment building that Fox resides in and a conflict arises between the two, whereby David believes that Fox is using his condition (Parkinson's disease) as a manipulative tool. On August 20, 2012, NBC announced \"The Michael J. Fox Show\", loosely based on his life. It was granted a 22-episode commitment from the network and premiered on NBC on September 26, 2013.\n\nFox also made several appearances in other media. At the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he delivered comedy monologues, along with William Shatner and Catherine O'Hara, in the \"I am Canadian\" part of the show. Along with Tatjana Patitz, Fox appears in the 2011 Carl Zeiss AG calendar, photographed by Bryan Adams in New York City in the summer of 2010. Despite a sound-alike, A.J Locascio, voicing his character of Marty McFly in , Fox lent his likeness to the in-game version of Marty alongside Christopher Lloyd. Fox made a special guest appearance in the final episode of the series as an elder version of Marty, as well as his great-grandfather Willie McFly.\n\nIn 2018, Fox was cast in the recurring role of Ethan West on the second season of the ABC political drama \"Designated Survivor\".\n\nFox married actress Tracy Pollan on July 16, 1988 at West Mountain Inn in Arlington, Vermont. The couple have four children: son Sam Michael (born May 30, 1989), twin daughters Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances (born February 15, 1995), and daughter Esmé Annabelle (born November 3, 2001). He holds dual Canadian-US citizenship. He provided a light-hearted segment during the 2010 Winter Olympics' closing ceremony in Vancouver, British Columbia on February 28, 2010 when he expressed how proud he is to be Canadian. On June 4, 2010, the city of Burnaby, British Columbia granted him the Freedom of the City. He and his family live in Manhattan.\n\nFox started displaying symptoms of early-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991 while shooting the movie \"Doc Hollywood\", although he was not properly diagnosed until the next year. After his diagnosis, Fox started drinking heavily. He sought help and stopped drinking altogether. In 1998, he decided to go public about his Parkinson's disease, and since then, he has been a strong advocate of Parkinson's disease research. His foundation, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson's disease, including embryonic stem cell studies.\n\nFox manages the symptoms of his Parkinson's disease with the drug carbidopa/levodopa, and he also had a thalamotomy in 1998.\n\nHis first book, \"Lucky Man\", focused on how, after seven years of denial of the disease, he set up the Michael J. Fox Foundation, stopped drinking and began to be an advocate for people living with Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn \"Lucky Man\", Fox wrote that he did not take his medication prior to his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee in 1999 ():\nIn an interview with NPR in April 2002, Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic during an interview:\n\nIn 2006, Fox starred in a campaign ad for then State Auditor of Missouri Claire McCaskill (D) in her successful 2006 Senate campaign against incumbent Jim Talent (R), expressing her support for embryonic stem cell research. In the ad, he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson's disease:\n\n\"The New York Times\" called it \"one of the most powerful and talked about political advertisements in years\" and polls indicated that the commercial had a measurable impact on the way voters voted, in an election that McCaskill won. His second book, \"Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist\", describes his life between 1999 and 2009, with much of the book centred on how Fox got into campaigning for stem-cell research. On March 31, 2009, Fox appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" with Mehmet Oz to publicly discuss his condition as well as his book, his family and his prime-time special which aired May 7, 2009, (\"Michael J. Fox: Adventures of an Incurable Optimist\").\n\nHis work led him to be named one of the 100 people \"whose power, talent or moral example is transforming the world\" in 2007 by Time magazine. On March 5, 2010, Fox received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institutet for his contributions to research in Parkinson's disease. He has also received an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of British Columbia.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the Justice Institute of British Columbia to recognize his accomplishments as a performer as well as his commitment to raising research funding and awareness for Parkinson's disease. Fox recalled performing in role-playing simulations as part of police recruit training exercises at the Institute early in his career.\n\nIn 2016, his organization the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research created a raffle to raise awareness for Parkinson's disease and raised $6.75 million, with the help of Nike via two auctions, one in Hong Kong and the other in London.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2095244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095244", "title": "Murabitun World Movement", "text": "Murabitun World Movement\n\nThe Murabitun World Movement is an Islamic movement founded by its current leader, Abdalqadir as-Sufi (born as Ian Dallas), with communities in several countries. Its heartland is Spain. The number of its followers may amount, according to one estimate, to around 10,000.\n\nThe movement's objectives include the restoration of Zakat, Da’wa and the practice of \"bayat\" (allegiance) to an amir. It considers itself a tariqa in the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa tradition.\n\nThe name Murabitun derives from the name of the Almoravid dynasty. The founder of the Murabitun World Movement is Abdalqadir as-Sufi, a convert to Islam born Ian Dallas in Ayr, Scotland, in 1930. He met his first Shaykh, Muhammad ibn al-Habib, in Meknes around 1968, and was made a \"muqaddam\" and given the title \"as-Sufi\". Ibn al-Habib said to him, “You can stay here with me, and something might happen. But go to England and see what will happen,” and so he went to London and gathered a group of new British Muslims, returning to Morocco in 1970. He founded a learning centre in Bristol Gardens, London, in 1972, and another centre in Berkeley, California.\n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi travelled in Europe and America, held talks, and published works such as \"The Way of Muhammad\" and \"Islam Journal\" proposing that Islam could be understood, and entered, as the \"completion of the Western intellectual and spiritual tradition\". He also initiated translations into English of classical texts on Islamic law and Sufism, including the \"Muwatta Imam Malik\" and the letters of Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi, published as \"The Darqawi Way\".\n\nIn 1982 Abdalqadir as-Sufi held a series of talks in America which were to become the basis of his work, \"Root Islamic Education\".\n\nThe political and social work of the Murabitun centres around the restoration of the “fallen pillar” of \"zakat\", which, it is claimed, has been abandoned on several primary counts.\n\nPrincipally:\n\nAs their authority for this position the Murabitun cite a wide range of sources, beginning with the Qur'anic injunction to take \"zakat\", the Prophetic practice of \"zakat\"-taking, the well-known position of the Khalif Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, and the established practice among the world Muslim community which was until relatively recently the assessment and collection of \"zakat\" by the Leader and his collectors.\n\nThis they place in contradistinction to the currently prevailing practices of voluntary self-assessment, donation to the \"zakat\" charity of one’s choice, and the placement of \"zakat\" donations into interim or even long-term investment funds. This, they argue, destroys the political cohesion of the Muslim community, which is based primarily on the circulation of wealth along divinely revealed lines. They also condemn \"zakat\" investment funds as un-Islamic.\n\nThey previously connected their position on \"zakat\" with promotion of the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham, which was developed above all by the scholar Umar Ibrahim Vadillo. Paper money, since actually a promise of payment written on paper, can from the point of view of \"zakat\" only be considered in terms of its value as paper, since \"zakat\" cannot be discharged by passing on a token of debt owed to a third party. Vadillo has written extensively on the origins of paper money and the Islamic position on money.\n\nThe Murabitun traced the bi-metallic currency back to Muhammad and the first Muslim community; its specific weights and purities were formally recorded by ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattab. They also cited the dinar’s mention in the Qur'an, its use in the universally accepted \"fiqh\" to define the terms of \"zakat\", and its mention as currency throughout the entire body of Islamic \"fiqh\".\nIn February 2014, however, Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, \"So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham\".\n\nThe Murabitun advocate personal rule as the Islamic and indeed natural form of human governance, taking authority for this position from extensive Qur'anic references. \n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi's advocacy of Malik’s school of Madinah is explained at length in his work \"Root Islamic Education\". The Murabitun do not, however, in any way dispute the validity of the other legal schools, nor is adherence to or advocacy of the \"madhhab\" of Malik a condition of membership of the Murabitun.\n\nThe Murabitun advocate a revival of the forms of trading and social welfare practiced during the first generations of Muslims and for most of the history of Islam, proposing that these are the natural modes of human activity and rejecting the dialectical categorisation of “ancient” or “modern”, a set of opposites whose application to Islam they consider irrelevant and misleading.\n\nThese models have been formulated in detail and include \"awqaf\" for the funding of social welfare institutions, mosques and other public facilities.\n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi has consistently identified terrorism and suicide tactics as forbidden in and alien to Islam, and indeed as a phenomenon with no precursor in Muslim history. Instead, he states that its original appearance as a tactic and a psychology was among the Isma‘ili sect of Shi‘a Islam, and that it later emerged among the Russian nihilists of the late 19th century.\n\nThe Murabitun organise themselves around amirs. This is distinct from the role of the movement’s founder, Abdalqadir as-Sufi, who, while exercising an undoubted influence, is a spiritual guide rather than a political leader – an arrangement common throughout the history of Islam.\n\n\n"}

Born in Lubbock, Texas, Maines considers herself a rebel who \"loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought.\"\n\nIn 1995, after leaving Berklee College of Music, Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, Laura Lynch. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 Country Music Association Awards and 13 Grammy Awards for their work between 1998 and 2007.\n\nIn 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released \"Taking the Long Way\". The album subsequently won five Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year).\n\nMaines released her solo album, \"Mother\", on May 7, 2013.\n\nMaines was born in Lubbock, Texas, to country musician and producer Lloyd Maines and his wife Tina May Maines. She attended Williams Elementary School in Lubbock where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, \"Teacher, I don't need to learn this stuff—I'm gonna be a star.\" Maines was a cheerleader while attending O.

Maines has described growing up in conservative Texas, saying \"I always rebelled against that. My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I've always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so.\"\n\nFollowing the completion of high school, Maines attended several colleges. She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at West Texas A&M where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at South Plains College. One of Maines's instructors at South Plains, and a former member of The Maines Brothers Band, Cary Banks, recalled \"She was mostly into rock'n'roll, rhythm and blues ... alternative rock.\" When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. \"She would get into a lot of political arguments\" at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor Ann Richards. \"She's always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad.\" In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of Texas Tech University, she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in \"Introductory Wildlife\".\n\nMaines's first commercially released work was background vocals on Pat Green's debut album, \"Dancehall Dreamer\", produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female country music band, the Dixie Chicks, which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention. Maines replaced founding lead singer Laura Lynch. She plays guitar and bass in concert in the band.\n\nMaines co-wrote four tracks for the Dixie Chicks' first three albums, including the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart number one hit \"Without You\" on \"Fly\". Maines was a primary songwriter on all 14 tracks of the band's 2006 album \"Taking the Long Way\" which peaked on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at No. 1. \"Taking the Long Way\" has the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 single \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", (Maines, Strayer, Erwin, Wilson) hitting No. 4<ref name=\"Billboard\">\n"}

They were an important ruling dynasty in post-medieval Karnataka. They initially ruled as a vassal of the famous Vijayanagar Empire. After the fall of the empire in 1565, they gained independence and ruled significant parts of Malnad region of the Western Ghats in present-day Karnataka, most areas in the coastal regions of Karnataka, and parts of northern Kerala, Malabar and the central plains along the Tungabhadra river. In 1763 AD, with their defeat to Hyder Ali, they were absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore. They played an important part in the history of Karnataka, during a time of confusion and fragmentation that generally prevailed in South India after the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Keladi rulers were Lingayats but they were tolerant towards followers of other faiths. The Haleri Kings of Kodagu who ruled over Coorg between 1600 A.D and 1834 A.D. were an offshoot of Keladi Nayaka dynasty.\n\nChaudappa Nayaka, originally \"Chauda Gowda\", (1499–1530), was from a village called \"Pallibailu\" near Keladi. He was the son of Lingayat couple \"Basavappa\" and \"Basavamambe\", who were into farming. He was the earliest chieftain to rule the area surrounding Shimoga, rose through self capability and acumen and was a feudatory of Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nSadashiva Nayaka (1530–1566) was an important chieftain in the Vijayanagar Empire and earned the title \"Kotekolahala\" from emperor Aliya Rama Raya for his heroics in the battle of Kalyani.\nThe coastal provinces of Karnataka came under his direct rule. He moved the capital to Ikkeri some 20 km. from Keladi.\n\nSankanna Nayaka (1566–1570), succeeded Sadashiva Nayaka.\n\nChikka Sankanna Nayaka (1570–1580) was an opportunistic ruler who took advantage of the confusion in the Vijayanagar Empire following its defeat at Tallikota and grabbed a few provinces in Uttara Kannada district.\n\nRama Raja Nayaka (1580–1586)\n\nHiriya Venkatappa Nayaka (1586–1629) is considered by scholars as ablest monarch of the clan. He completely freed himself from the overlordship of the relocated Vijayanagar rulers of Penugonda. Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle, who visited his kingdom in 1623, called him an able soldier and administrator. In his reign the kingdom expanded so that it covered coastal regions, Malnad regions, and some regions to the east of the western Ghats of present-day Karnataka. He is also known to have defeated the Adilshahis of Bijapur in Hanagal. Though a Virashaiva by faith, he built many temples for Vaishnavas and Jains and a mosque for Muslims. He defeated the Portuguese in 1618 and 1619.\n\nVirabhadra Nayaka (1629–1645) faced many troubles from the start, including competition from rival Jain chieftains of Malenad for the throne of Ikkeri and invasion by the Sultanate armies of Bijapur. Ikkeri was plundered by the Bijapur army during his time.\n\nShivappa Nayaka (1645–1660) is widely considered as the ablest and greatest of the Keladi rulers. He was the uncle of Virabhadra Nayaka. Shivappa deposed his nephew to gain the throne of Keladi. He was not only an able administrator; he also patronised literature and fine arts. His successful campaigns against the Bijapur sultans, the Mysore kings, the Portuguese, and other Nayakas of the neighbouring territories east of the western ghats helped expand the kingdom to its greatest extent, covering large areas of present-day Karnataka. He gave importance to agriculture and developed new schemes for collection of taxes and revenues which earned him much praise from later British officials. A statue of him and the palace built by him containing many artifacts of his times are reminders of the respect he has earned even from the present generation of people of the region. He destroyed the Portuguese political power in the Kanara region by capturing all the Portuguese forts of the coastal region.\n\nChikka Venkatappa Nayaka (1660–1662), ruled for a short span of time after Shivappa Nayaka.\n\nBhadrappa Nayaka (1662–1664), succeeded Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka.\n\nSomashekara Nayaka I (1664–1672) The King who was once a good administrator, gave up his interest in administration after his associastion with a dancer named Kalavati. Bharame Mavuta, a relative of Kalavati slow poisoned the king which eventually led to his death.\n\nKeladi Chennamma (1672–1697) She was an able ruler who some scholars claim was allied with the Maratha Shivaji and later his son Sambhaji to defeat all rival claimants to the throne. She gave shelter to Chhatrapathi Rajaram when he fled from the Mughal army. Chennamma of Keladi is well remembered by local people through tales of her bravery.\n\nBasavappa Nayaka (1697–1714) He was a brave ruler and was adopted by Rani Chennammaji from their relative\nMarkappa Shetty of Bedanur\n\nSomashekara Nayaka II (1714–1739)\n\nKiriya Basavappa Nayaka (1739–1754)\n\nChenna Basappa Nayaka (1754–1757)\n\nQueen Virammaji (1757–1763) was defeated by Hyder Ali who merged the Keladi kingdom with the Kingdom of Mysore. The queen was captured by Hyder Ali and was kept in confinement along with her son in the fort of Madugiri. They were however rescued in 1767 when Madhavrao I of the Maratha Empire defeated Hyder Ali in the battle of Madugiri. Later, they were sent to Pune the capital of the Maratha Empire for protection.\n\nFor more than two hundred years the kingdom controlled the coastal and malnad regions of present-day Karnataka and fostered a rich tradition of trade with the English, the Portuguese, and the Dutch. However, in the period of gloom brought about by the fall of the last great Hindu empire, the Vijayanagar empire, constant wars—campaigns against local chieftains and the Mysore Kingdom and the harassment of the Marathas finally drained the treasury and resulted in the end of the kingdom.\n\n\n\nThe Keladi Nayakas built some fine temples in Ikkeri and Keladi using a combination of late Kadamba, Hoysala, Vijayanagar, and Dravida styles. The use of granite for their construction shows they simply followed the Vijayanagar model of architecture. The Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri and the Rameshwara temple at Keladi are the best examples of the Nayakas' art. Vijayanagar-style pillars with hippogryphs are common; called \"yali\" columns (depiction of horses and lions as seen in Hampi) is found here. These are pillars with lions, either with their forepaws raised or simply in a sitting position, and pillars with a mythical horse-like animal with front legs raised, balancing on its rear legs, and with an armed rider on its back which are worth seeing at Ikkeri. A roof sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda, the mythical two-headed bird of Karnataka, is found in Keladi. Also, in the Rameshwara temple, a pillar sculpture shows Maratha Rajaram with Keladi Chennamma (history has it that Rajaram was protected by the queen when he was on the run from the Mughals).\n\nThe Keladi Nayakas were Lingayats, patronized the religion, constructed numerous mutts and were responsible for the spread of Lingayatism to the Malenadu and Coastal Karnataka. There were sixty four mutts in the district of Dakshina Kannada alone. Nevertheless, they were tolerant towards followers of other religions and other Hindu denominations. \nThe Keladi Nayakas invited Kazi Mahmoud who was a grandson of chief kazi of Adil Shahi kingdom of Bijapur to settle in Bhatkal. The revenue of Tenginagundi village was given to Kazi Mahmoud. The kazi family of Bhatkal is popularly known as Temunday Family due the ownership of lands in Tenginagundi. Many Nawayath Muslims were appointed in the administrative positions. The families of these nobles Nawayath still use their surnames as Ikkeri and are mainly settled in and around Bhatkal. The Golden Kalasa on the dome of Bhatkal Jamia Masjid popularly known as 'Chinnada Palli' meaning 'Golden Mosque' is believed to be a generous gift from Keladi rulers.\n\n\n"}

The Greek word \"Pan\" also translates as \"All\", and so he is “a symbol of the Universal, a personification of Nature; both Pangenetor, \"all-begetter,\" and Panphage, \"all-devourer\" (Sabazius, 1995). Therefore, Pan is both the giver and the taker of life, and his Night is that time of symbolic death where the adept experiences unification with the All through the ecstatic destruction of the ego-self. In a more general sense, it is the state where one transcends all limitations and experiences oneness with the universe.\n\nIn the A∴A∴ system of attainment, after the adept has achieved the Knowledge and Conversation with his Holy Guardian Angel, he then must cross the great Abyss, where he meets Choronzon, who will tempt him to hold on to his subjective self and become trapped in his realm of illusion. To escape the Abyss, the adept gives up his deepest sense of earthly identity, in the symbolic gesture of pouring out his blood into the Cup of Babalon. The adept then becomes as a Babe in the Womb of Babalon—impregnated by Pan—and his lifeless Self becomes as a pile of dust, taking rest in the City of the Pyramids, which lies under the Night of Pan. This is why it is called Night—it represents the lightless Womb, and also the time before the dawning of the new Sun (or rather, the new Self). He then waits in this sublime state until he is ready to move on to the next stage, and become “born” again from the Great Mother of Babalon, begotten by Pan.\n\nAleister Crowley identifies this process as one of Love. He explains in \"Little Essays Towards Truth:\"\n\nIt is also described in the mystical text \"Liber VII:\"\n\nFinally, Crowley writes of the Night of Pan in his \"The Book of Lies\", in the chapter \"Sabbath of the Goat\":\n\nIn his commentary on this writing, Crowley explains:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5631978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5631978", "title": "Noahidism", "text": "Noahidism\n\nNoahidism () or Noachidism () is a monotheistic branch of Judaism based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism. According to the Jewish law, non-Jews (Gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba), the final reward of the righteous. The divinely ordained penalty for violating any of these Noahide Laws is discussed in the Talmud, but in practical terms it is subject to the working legal system which is established by the society at large. Those who subscribe to the observance of the Noahic Covenant are referred to as B'nei Noach (, \"Children of Noah\") or Noahides (). Supporting organizations have been established around the world over the past decades by either Noahides or Orthodox Jews.\n\nHistorically, the Hebrew term \"B'nei Noach\" has applied to all non-Jews as descendants of Noah. However, nowadays it's primarily used to refer specifically to those non-Jews who observe the Seven Laws of Noah.\n\nAccording to a Noahide source in 2018, there are over 20,000 Noahides, and the country with the greatest number is the Philippines.\n\nThe seven laws listed by the Mishnah in Sanhedrin 56a are:\nto have laws and courts for the society, and to refrain from blasphemy, idolatry, a set of six forbidden sexual relationships, murder, theft, and eating flesh that was removed from a living animal.\n\nThe \"Sebomenoi\" or God-fearers are an early example of non-Jews being included within the Jewish community.\n\nThere are two different concepts of Noahidism in Judaism: \nAccording to the first approach, the answer to the question \"Can a non-Jew observe the Sabbath and study the Torah?\" is negative, and according to the second one, it is affirmative.\n\nIn one place in his books, Maimonides writes \"The \"goy\" must not observe the Sabbath and study the Torah,\" while in another place he says \"If a Noahide wants to observe additional commandments besides the seven basic ones of \"B'nei Noah\", he receives a reward from Heaven, and we (the Jews) must support him in this.\" Many people quote the first of his statements, not knowing about the existence of the second one. Rav Uri Scherki (and the rabbinical council of the Brit Olam organization) explain this contradiction in Maimonides by saying that the \"goy\" and \"B'nei Noah\" are different halakhic concepts. A \"goy\" is a gentile who has not yet accepted the commandments of \"B'nei Noah\". However, if he has already accepted Seven Laws, he ceases to be a \"goy\" and became a \"B'nei Noah\", and as such can follow additional commandments, including keeping the Sabbath and teaching the Torah. \n\nA High Council of B’nei Noah, set up to represent B'nei Noah communities around the world, was endorsed by a group that claimed to be the new Sanhedrin.\n\nThe Rabbinical Council for the Noahide Movement is composed of the rabbis of the Noahide Academy of Jerusalem which include Rabbi Moshe Weiner, author of the \"Divine Code, the complete compilation of the Noahide Code of Law\", Rabbi Moshe Perets, Executive Director of the Noahide Academy of Jerusalem, Dr Michael Schulman, Rabbi Shimon Cowen, Rabbi Ytshock Dubovick, Rabbi Assaf Studnitz, Rabbi Zalman Notik, and Rabbi Assi Harel.\n\nRabbi Meir Kahane organized one of the first Noahide conferences in the 1980s. In 1990, Kahane was the keynote speaker at the First International Conference of the Descendants of Noah in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nThe Chabad-Lubavitch movement has been the most active in Noahide outreach, believing that there is spiritual and societal value for non-Jews in at least simply acknowledging the seven laws, and even more so if they accept or observe them. In 1991, they had a reference to these laws enshrined in a Congressional proclamation: Presidential Proclamation 5956, signed by then-President George H. W. Bush. Recalling Joint House Resolution 173, and recalling that the ethical and moral principles of all civilizations come in part from the Seven Noahide Laws, it proclaimed March 26, 1991 as \"Education Day, U.S.A.\" Subsequently, Public Law 102-14 formally designated the Lubavitcher Rebbe's 90th birthday as \"Education Day, U.S.A.,\" with Congress recalling that \"without these ethical values and principles, the edifice of civilization stands in serious peril of returning to chaos,\" and that \"society is profoundly concerned with the recent weakening of these principles, that has resulted in crises that beleaguer and threaten the fabric of civilized society.\"\n\nIn April, 2006, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafak Tarif, met with a representative of Chabad-Lubavitch to sign a declaration calling on all non-Jews in Israel to observe the Noahide Laws as laid down in the Bible and expounded upon in Jewish tradition. The mayor of the Galilean city of Shefa-'Amr (Shfaram) — where Muslim, Christian and Druze communities live side-by-side — also signed the document.\n\nIn March, 2007, Chabad-Lubavitch gathered ambassadors from six countries to take part in a gathering to declare, in the name of the states they represent, their support of the universal teachings of Noahide Laws. They represented Poland, Latvia, Mexico, Panama, Ghana, and Japan. They were part of a special program organized by Harav Boaz Kali.\n\nIn April, Abu Gosh mayor Salim Jaber accepted the seven Noahide laws as part of a mass rally by Chabad at the Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv. In May, the newly elected president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, met with a Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi, Dovid Zaoui, who presented him with literature on the universal teachings of the Noahide Laws.\n\nIn 2016 Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef taught that Jewish law requires that the only non-Jews allowed to live in Israel are Noahides: \"“According to Jewish law, it’s forbidden for a non-Jew to live in the Land of Israel – unless he has accepted the seven Noahide laws.” The Anti-Defamation League issued a strong denunciation of Yosef’s comments, and called on him to retract them.\n\n\n"}

In 651 BCE he had his priestly offices confirmed by Psamtik I, above all that of prophet of Amun of Teudjoi. After he had resigned from his powerful office of administrator of Upper Egypt, the priests of Teudjoi decided in 621 to wrest his priestly offices, which were well paid, from him and killed two of his grandsons. Pediese received police protection. He restored the fortunes of the temple at Teudjoi. Pediese's rights were inscribed on a stela. He signed over his prophet's portion to his son Wedjasematawi I.\n\nIn 591, Petiese II, son of Wedjasematawi I, accompanied Psamtik II on a campaign to Syria.

Concluding the ten-year investigation, on September 4, 2007, a Belgian prosecutor recommended that 12 persons associated with Scientology and two legal entities – the Belgian Church of Scientology and Scientology's Office of Human Rights – should be prosecuted on counts of extortion, fraud, organized crime, obstruction of medical practice, illegal medical practice, invasion of privacy, conspiracy and commercial infractions like abusive contractual clauses. An administrative court would decide if the case would go ahead and charges would be pressed. The court's decision was expected to be announced within a few months.\n\nBelgium and other European countries have been criticized by the U.S. State Department for ruling that Scientology was a cult or sect and enacting restrictive laws against it.\n\nIn response to the proposed trial, the U.S. State Department said that if Belgian authorities \"have evidence that individuals violated Belgian law, they should take appropriate legal steps consistent with Belgium’s international obligations to protect freedom of thought, conscience and religion\"; however, the State Department would \"oppose any effort to stigmatize an entire group based solely upon religious beliefs and would be concerned over infringement of any individual’s rights because of religious affiliation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported an official statement released by the Church of Scientology on September 4, 2007:\n\n\"For the last 10 years, the prosecutor has been using the media, trying to damage the reputation of the Church of Scientology and not being able to put a case in court,\" Scientology said. \"As a consequence, this created a climate of intolerance and discrimination\" in Belgium.\n\nThe Church added that the prosecutor's recommendations suggested Scientology was guilty even before a court could hear the charges, making it \"difficult for the Church of Scientology to recover and properly defend (itself) before the court.\"\n\nIn October 2015 a criminal trial started against twelve leaders of Scientology in Belgium. Charges against them were bribery, extortion, fraud, violation of the privacy and unlicensed practicing of medicine.\n\nOn March 2016, the Church of Scientology was acquitted of all charges, and demands to close its Belgian branch and European headquarters were dismissed. The presiding judge, Yves Regimont, cited prejudice in the investigators and said that the church had been “unfairly hounded for years by Belgian authorities,” according to a report by ABC. “The entire proceedings are declared inadmissible for a serious and irremediable breach of the right to a fair trial. The defendants were prosecuted primarily because they were Scientologists,” the judge said.\n\nOn April 2016, the decision become “definitive” due to the Belgian prosecutors’ failure to appeal, said Pascal Vanderveeren, the lawyer for the church in Belgium, to a press conference. “It was important to point out that the ruling for a week is final. The prosecution had thirty days to appeal and also had the prosecutor ten days following notification (the ruling) to appeal. We note that none of them objected to this statement,\" said Vanderveeren. Eric Roux, Church of Scientology Belgium spokesman stated, “This is a victory for the freedom of religion.” The Church of Scientology also announced that they are taking into consideration attempting to acquire compensation from the Belgian State for damages incurred. The final ruling effectively ends the 18-year-old legal proceedings against the church in Belgium.\n\nOn September 2016, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe published a presentation by the Church of Scientology regarding the acquittal. It stated that after an eighteen-year investigation, the evidence was closely scrutinized and evaluated. They cited that the prosecutor had been “prejudiced” against the church and had a “total lack of objectivity.” According to the document, the presumption of guilt of the defendants just by simply associating with Scientology is an “egregious violation of defendants’ rights.” Charges included fraud, extortion, running a criminal enterprise, violating privacy and the illegal practice of medicine.

The best-known form is:\n<poem>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\nCourage to change the things I can,\nAnd wisdom to know the difference.</poem>\n\nNiebuhr, who first wrote the prayer for a sermon at Heath Evangelical Union Church in Heath, Massachusetts, used it widely in sermons as early as 1934 and first published it in 1951 in a magazine column. The prayer spread through Niebuhr's sermons and church groups in the 1930s and 1940s and was adopted and popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step programs.\n\nThe prayer has appeared in many versions. Reinhold Niebuhr's versions of the prayer were always printed as a single prose sentence; printings that set out the prayer as three lines of verse modify the author's original version. The most well-known form is a late version, as it includes a reference to grace not found before 1951:\n<poem>God, give me grace to accept with serenity\nthe things that cannot be changed,\nCourage to change the things\nwhich should be changed,\nand the Wisdom to distinguish\nthe one from the other.\n\nLiving one day at a time,\nEnjoying one moment at a time,\nAccepting hardship as a pathway to peace,\nTaking, as Jesus did,\nThis sinful world as it is,\nNot as I would have it,\nTrusting that You will make all things right,\nIf I surrender to Your will,\nSo that I may be reasonably happy in this life,\nAnd supremely happy with You forever in the next.\n\nAmen.</poem>\n\nA version (apparently quoted from memory) appeared in the \"Queries and Answers\" column in \"The New York Times Book Review\", July 2, 1950, p. 23, asking for the author of the quotation. A reply in the same column in the issue for August 13, 1950, p. 19, attributed the prayer to Niebuhr, quoting it as follows:\n<poem>O God and Heavenly Father,\nGrant to us the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed; courage to change that which can be changed, and wisdom to know the one from the other, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.</poem>\nSome twelve-step recovery programs use a slightly different version:\n<poem>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\nCourage to change the things I can,\nand the Wisdom to know the difference.</poem>\n\nThe earliest recorded reference to the prayer is a diary entry from 1932 by Winnifred Crane Wygal, a pupil and collaborator of Reinhold Niebuhr, quoting the prayer and attributing it to Niebuhr. Several versions of the prayer then appeared in newspaper articles in the early 1930s written by, or reporting on talks given by, Wygal. In 1940, Wygal included the following form of the prayer in a book on worship, attributing it to Niebuhr: \nO God, give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be changed, and the wisdom to know the one from the other.\n\nWygal was a longtime YWCA official and all early recorded usages were from women involved in volunteer or educational activities connected to the YWCA.\n\nThe earliest printed reference, in 1936, mentions that during a speech, a Miss Mildred Pinkerton \"quotes the prayer,\" as if to indicate it was already in a circulation known to the reporter, or that Pinkerton relayed it as a quote, without mentioning its authorship. A 1937 Christian student publication attributed the prayer to Niebuhr in the following form, which matches the other earliest published forms in requesting \"courage to change\" before petitioning for serenity:\n\nFather, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other.\n\nVarious other authors also cited Niebuhr as the source of the prayer from 1937 on. The Federal Council of Churches (NCC) included the prayer in a book for army chaplains and servicemen in 1944 and the USO circulated the prayer (with Niebuhr's permission) to soldiers on printed cards during World War Two. In 1950, in response to questions about the already quite widely known prayer's provenance, Niebuhr wrote that the prayer \"may have been spooking around for years, even centuries, but I don't think so. I honestly do believe that I wrote it myself.\" He confirmed this in 1967. His daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, thought that Niebuhr had first written it in 1943, while Niebuhr's wife Ursula believed it had been written in 1941 or '42, adding that it may have been used in prayers as early as 1934.\n\nThe Serenity Prayer will be listed under Niebuhr’s name in the next edition of the \"Yale Book of Quotations\", whose author Fred R. Shapiro had first raised doubts about, but was later instrumental in confirming Niebuhr's authorship.\n\nNumerous statements of more or less similar sentiments by other authors have been identified and it is likely that more will be found. The prayer has also been falsely attributed to a variety of other authors.\n\nEpictetus wrote: \"Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens. Some things are up to us [eph' hêmin] and some things are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions—in short, whatever is our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices, or, that is, whatever is not our own doing.\"\n\nThe 8th-century Indian Buddhist scholar Shantideva of the ancient Nalanda University suggested:\n<poem>If there's a remedy when trouble strikes,\nWhat reason is there for dejection?\nAnd if there is no help for it,\nWhat use is there in being glum?</poem>\n\nThe 11th-century Jewish philosopher Solomon ibn Gabirol wrote:\nAnd they said: At the head of all understanding – is realizing what is and what cannot be, and the consoling of what is not in our power to change.\n\nThe philosopher W.W. Bartley juxtaposes without comment Niebuhr's prayer with a Mother Goose rhyme (1695) expressing a similar sentiment:\n<poem>For every ailment under the sun\nThere is a remedy, or there is none;\nIf there be one, try to find it;\nIf there be none, never mind it.</poem>\n\nFriedrich Schiller advocated the first part in 1801: \"Blessed is he, who has learned to bear what he cannot change, and to give up with dignity, what he cannot save.\"\n\nThe prayer has been variously attributed (without evidence) to Thomas Aquinas, Cicero, Augustine, Boethius, Marcus Aurelius, Francis of Assisi, and Thomas More, among others.\n\n, a professor of education at the University of Kiel, published a German version of the prayer under the pseudonym \"Friedrich Oetinger\". Wilhelm's plagiarized version of the prayer became popular in West Germany, where it was widely but falsely attributed to the 18th-century philosopher Friedrich Christoph Oetinger.\n\nThe prayer became more widely known after being brought to the attention of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1941 by an early member, who came upon it in a caption in a \"routine New York Herald Tribune obituary\". AA's co-founder and staff liked the prayer and had it printed in modified form and handed around. It has been part of Alcoholics Anonymous ever since, and has also been used in other twelve-step programs. \"Never had we seen so much A.A. in so few words,\" noted founder Bill Wilson. \"Grapevine, The International Journal of Alcoholics Anonymous\", identified Niebuhr as the author (January 1950, pp. 6–7), and the AA web site continues to identify Niebuhr as the author.\n\nThe original text for this adapted prayer was:\n<poem>Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, \nserenity to accept what cannot be helped, \nand the insight to know the one from the other.</poem>\n\nA slightly different version of the prayer has been widely adopted by twelve-step groups:\n<poem>God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, \nthe courage to change the things we can, \nand the wisdom to know the difference.</poem>\n\n"}

{"id": "55382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55382", "title": "Supernatural", "text": "Supernatural\n\nThe concept of the supernatural proposes that something cannot be explained by scientific understanding or the laws of nature. Examples often include characteristics of or relating to entities and concepts such as ghosts, angels, gods, souls and spirits, non-material beings, or anything else considered \"beyond\" nature like magic or miracles.\n\nOver time, things once thought to be supernatural such as lightning, seasons, and human senses have been shown to have entirely naturalistic explanations and origins. Some believe that which is considered supernatural will someday be discovered to be completely physical and natural. Those who believe only the physical world exists are called naturalists. Those who believe similarly often maintain skeptical attitudes and beliefs concerning supernatural concepts. Belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts.\n\nThe supernatural is featured in paranormal, occult, and religious contexts. However, belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts as well.\n\nOccurring as both an adjective and a noun, descendants of the modern English compound \"supernatural\" enters the language from two sources: By way of Middle French (\"supernaturel\") and directly from the Middle French's term's ancestor, post-Classical Latin (\"supernaturalis\"). Post-classical Latin \"supernaturalis\" first occurs in the 6th century, composed of the Latin prefix \"super-\" and \"nātūrālis\" (see nature). The earliest known appearance of the word in the English language occurs in a Middle English translation of Catherine of Siena's \"Dialogue\" (\"orcherd of Syon\", around 1425; \"Þei haue not þanne þe supernaturel lyȝt ne þe liȝt of kunnynge, bycause þei vndirstoden it not\").\n\nThe semantic value of the term has shifted over the history of its use. Originally the term referred exclusively to Christian understandings of the world. For example, as an adjective, the term can mean 'belonging to a realm or system that transcends nature, as that of divine, magical, or ghostly beings; attributed to or thought to reveal some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature; occult, paranormal' or 'more than what is natural or ordinary; unnaturally or extraordinarily great; abnormal, extraordinary'. Obsolete uses include 'of, relating to, or dealing with metaphysics'. As a noun, the term can mean 'a supernatural being', with a particularly strong history of employment in relation to entities from the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\n\nThe metaphysical considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the natural, will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected.\n\nOne complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of \"natural\" and the limits of naturalism. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality and occultism or spiritualism.\n\nThe term \"supernatural\" is often used interchangeably with paranormal or preternatural — the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics. Epistemologically, the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, \"ex hypothesi,\" violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are realistically accountable.\nMany supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past, present, and future complexities and mysteries of the universe cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained.\n\nViews on the \"supernatural\" vary, for example it may be seen as:\n\n\nDialogues from Neoplatonic philosophy in the third century AD contributed the development of the concept the supernatural via Christian theology in later centuries. The term \"nature\" had existed since antiquity with Latin authors like Augustine using the word and its cognates at least 600 times in \"City of God\". In the medieval period, \"nature\" had ten different meanings and \"natural\" had eleven different meanings. Peter Lombard, a medieval scholastic in the 12th century, asked about causes that are beyond nature, in that how there could be causes that were God's alone. He used the term \"praeter naturam\" in his writings. In the scholastic period, Thomas Aquinas classified miracles into three categories: \"above nature\", \"beyond nature\", and \"against nature\". In doing so, he sharpened the distinction between nature and miracles more than the early Church Fathers had done. As a result, he had created a dichotomy of sorts of the natural and supernatural. Though the phrase \"supra naturam\" was used since the 4th century AD, it was in the 1200s that Thomas Aquinas used the term \"supernaturalis\", however, this term had to wait until the end of the medieval period for it become more popularly used. The discussions on \"nature\" from the scholastic period were diverse and unsettled with some postulating that even miracles are natural and that natural magic was a natural part of the world.\n\n\n"}

The organization teaches annual classes in the capitols of 41 American states. Its vision statement/slogan is \"Changing Lives to Change the World,\" and its mission statement is, \"to train youth to understand the political process, value their liberty, defend their Christian faith and engage the culture at a time in their lives when, typically, they do not care about such things\". \n\nTeenPact offers \"state classes\" and \"alumni events,\" the former focusing on state government and politics, and the latter on a wide variety of topics. All students must complete their state's four-day State Class at least once before they can participate in alumni events. \n\nThe State Class is the base level and foundation of the TeenPact organization. This class runs from Monday through Thursday of a given week at students' respective state capitols, is designed for students of ages 13 through 19, and is billed as a \"hands-on learning experience.\" In this class, students participate in a variety of activities, encompassing many aspects of their particular state government as well as the Christian emphasis of the program. The class consists of student mock legislative sessions, learning how bills become law, field experiences (such as interviewing lobbyists), and special speakers (often state legislators or activists). On the Christian side of the program, students participate in worship sessions, bible study, and prayer walks through the various state capitols. Because of the on-site exams and pre-class homework, TeenPact describes its class as being worth one-third of a high-school carnegie unit. After completing the four-day State Class, a student is eligible to attend Alumni Events.\n\nAll students are required to wear what the ministry describes as \"formal business attire\" at their politically-oriented State Classes as well as parts of some Alumni Events. This professional dress code requires skirts for women. During events that do not take place in a \"professional environment,\" however, dress codes are much more relaxed for both sexes, and women are permitted to wear pants or shorts.\n\nTeenPact also offers a one-day State Class (formerly known as \"TeenyPact\") for younger students. It is a branch of the four-day class, held on Friday immediately following TeenPact \"graduation.\" This class is designed as a compact and simplified version of the longer class, tailored to students ages 8 through 12. It includes many of the events of the upper level in a more age appropriate and fast-paced environment. \n\nA Political Communication Workshop (formerly a Public Speaking Class) is also offered as an extension of the week for four-day students, and is also held on the Friday following the normal TeenPact program, occurring simultaneously with the one-day class. In the workshop, the older students are developed and polished in the simple fundamentals of oratory, including eye contact, stage movement and gestures, speech writing, impromptu speaking, and the basics of civilized debate, as well as drafting mock resolutions similar to mock legislation drafted during the State Class.\n\nOnce a student has attended the four-day class, he or she is classified as a \"TeenPact Alumnus\" and is eligible for participation in any of the several additional events TeenPact offers.\n\nThe largest Alumni event in terms of participation is TeenPact's National Convention (commonly referred to as \"NC\"). The week-long event includes speakers, worship sessions, small group activities, and sports tournaments including Ultimate Frisbee, volleyball and soccer, and student elections. Students run in national elections for various mock positions, including President and Vice-President, Senator, and Representative. This aspect of the event immerses students into the campaign process, with candidates creating websites, T-shirts, flyers, posters, and commercials. The entire elections process is tracked from primaries to the general election via a live news program, \"TPN News.\"\n\nTeenPact also offers week-long events focused on the three branches of government. TeenPact Congress, held at the Florida State Capitol, immerses students into the legislative process, complete with elected officials, lobbyists, and journalists. TeenPact Back to DC, held at the Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia, offers a more comprehensive curriculum on campaigning, which students use to run mock presidential campaigns. In addition to this, students commute to downtown Washington, D.C. daily, where they have the opportunity to visit Capitol Hill, tour monuments and museums, and attend political conferences such as the Values Voter Summit (which Back to DC is usually scheduled around). Finally, TeenPact Judicial is a legal-oriented course held at Liberty University School of Law, which includes lectures from various presenters and a moot court. TeenPact is an independent non-profit organization unaffiliated with a political party.\n\nThree of TeenPact's Alumni events - Venture, Endeavor, and Survival - are not politically oriented, and are run in the tradition of a summer camp for males, females, and co-eds, respectively.\n\nTeenPact is run through several tiers of administration. A board of directors has executive control of the organization, with Founder and President Tim Echols serving as chairman of the board. A separate staff of employees in Richmond, Virginia, headed by CEO Peter Martin, directs the state classes and handles public relations. However, the bulk of TeenPact's field staff responsible for executing classes is composed of two sets of volunteers. A group of traveling student interns is assembled each year to travel to and lead each state's classes, while individual staffing volunteers - student alumni selected via an applications process - stay in their home state or travel at their own expense to assist in leading the class. Whether an intern within the multi-state group or an individual in a single state, TeenPact volunteers are required to have attended the four-day class held in their state at least once. Traveling interns must also have previously staffed a state class, and have had sufficient experience with the Alumni programs.\n\nTeenPact students occasionally organize \"Student Projects,\" which may involve a political activity or other types of volunteering. TeenPact's founder, Tim Echols, was on one occasion the subject of questions regarding the ethicality of TeenPact students working on a political campaign (John Oxendine's unsuccessful 2010 GA gubernatorial campaign). A formal ethics complaint was filed against Echols, then serving as Oxendine's campaign manager, alleging that his Gold Dome Consulting firm improperly benefited from TeenPact volunteers. The complaint was found to be without merit, and was dismissed.\n\nMore recent TeenPact publications note the ministry's status as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and clarify that \"Student Projects are organized by parents and/or students, not the ministry itself.\" The \"Student Project\" moniker may therefore be applied not only to political campaigns, but also to a number of service and volunteering opportunities available to TeenPact alums.\n\nTim Echols has stepped back from the day-to-day operations of the organization in order to serve as a commissioner on the State of Georgia's Public Service Commission.\n\n\n\n"}

It discusses the Jewish communities that formed in Los Angeles and Miami in the post-World War II period. Moore argued that the migration to new communities helped American Jews find their identities and that they \"reinvented\" themselves.\n\nJenna Weissman Joselit of the New York University Department of Liberal Studies described Moore as \"one of this generation's foremost historians of America's Jews\". At the time of publication Moore was Vassar College's American culture program director.\n\nMoore characterizes Jews who moved into newly established cities; which had a lack of established culture and tradition, mild climates, and lifestyles perceived as being casual; as \"permanent tourists\". The references include monographs and interviews.\n\nRaymond A. Mohl of \"American Jewish History\" wrote that the oral history and archival research supporting the book serves as its \"great strength\". Carol R. Glatt of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Library, Philadelphia wrote that the book's documentation was \"solid\".\n\nThe book covers the post-World War II period up until the early 1960s.\n\nStephen J. Whitfield of Brandeis University stated that the book focuses more on similarities between Los Angeles and Miami rather than differences; he argued that \"southern regionalists\" may dispute the technique, but that \"her approach is compelling when framed within Jewish history\".\n\nJoselit wrote that Moore emphasizes that \"the Jewish historical experience, from Minsk to Miami, is grounded less in the particularities of place-in the \"style of the landscape\"-than in its promise\" and that \"the sense of possibility\" appears throughout the work.\n\nMoore stated that Jewish culture continued to thrive in Los Angeles and Miami even though some individuals decades earlier predicted it would evaporate, and therefore she argued that Jewish culture will continue to be intact.\n\nGlatt wrote that the book had a \"fluid, readable style\" and that \"This seminal work will be widely read.\"\n\nJoselit wrote that much of the phenomena described in the book \"have as much to do with postwar America more generally than with the\nspecific geographical contours of Miami and Los Angeles\".\n\nMohl wrote that \"To the Golden Cities\" was overall \"an excellent book, deeply researched and extremely readable\", but he took issue with the book's central thesis that the new Jewish society formed in Miami and Los Angeles, arguing that it also could have formed in suburbs of older cities and that social and political movements divided Jews in the North, not only in the South.\n\nEugene Patron of \"The Forward\" wrote that the book \"for the most part [...] is an engaging exploration of what has been an untold story\" although \"an overload of details\" sometimes \"bogs down\" the book.\n\nJune Sochen of the Northeastern Illinois University Department of History wrote that \"has done a fine job of synthesizing\" its sources \"to produce the first important analysis of this migration\" and that the book \"will be the foundation upon which future studies of the subject are built.\"\n\nWhitfield stated that the book was \"the best social history of Miami Jewry\" because \"To The Golden Cities\" \"is also the \"only\" serious history of that community\" and therefore giving this distinction would be \"faint praise\". Whitfield praised the \"clear and unobtrusive\" design and prose and the research undertaken, but he argued that the phenomena happening in Miami and Los Angeles also happened in the north and that the events reflect broader Jewish history rather than specific histories of the U.S. Sunbelt.\n\n\n"}

This classic text has long been famous both as a foundational text of religious Daoism and as a brilliant exemplar of medieval Chinese poetry.\n\nThe \"Zhengao\" is a compendium of Shangqing Daoist materials transmitted by the Eastern Jin dynasty scholar and mystic Yang Xi (330-c. 386) and his patrons Xu Mi (許谧, 303-376) and Xu Hui (許翽, 341-c. 370). The large, aristocratic Xu (許) family was from Jurong, Jiangsu, which was the Eastern Jin capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing) from 317 to 420. Following the Xu family tradition of government service, Xu Mi and his son Hui were officials in the court of Emperor Ai, unlike Xu Mi's elder brother Xu Mai (許邁, 300-348) who converted to the Way of the Celestial Masters, resigned from his official career and devoted himself to Daoist studies and practices. In 362, the Xus employed Yang Xi as their household shaman and spiritual advisor, and two years later when he first established contact with the Perfected Ones from the previously unknown heaven of Shangqing (上清, Highest/Supreme Clarity), they prophesied that the Xu family would have an important role in transmitting the prophetic revelations (Robinet 2008b: 1248).\n\nAccording to Shangqing School tradition, between 364 and 370, Yang Xi had a series of midnight visions in which Perfected Ones appeared to him in order to reveal their sacred scriptures, talismans, and secret registers, as well as their instructions conncerning personal matters such as health and longevity (Schipper 1999: 403). Yang wrote down the content of every vision in ecstatic verse, recording the date along with the name and description of each Perfected who appeared. The purpose of the revelations was to set up a new syncretic faith that claimed to be superior to all earlier Daoist traditions (Espessett 2008: 1147). Most texts revealed by Yang Xi were intended for the family patriarch Xu Mi, his relatives, and friends.\n\nThe visions appeared to Yang Xi alone, and he said the Perfected directed him to transcribe the revelations for transmission to Xu Mi and Xu Hui, who would make additional copies (Strickmann 1977: 16). The \"Zhen'gao\" says the Perfected women told Yang that since they could not express themselves in debased human writing, he would act as an intermediary, rendering their words in his own outstanding calligraphy. After each transmission the Perfected checked that he transcribed their words correctly and then \"presented\" it back to him as if they had written it themselves (Bokenkamp 1996: 167). The heavenly maidens who visited Yang at night \"never write themselves, neither with their hands nor with their feet\", but instead would take his hand and engage him in a \"sublime relationship\" while he transcribed the sacred texts (tr. Ledderose 1984: 254, 256).\n\nThe Perfected who appeared to Yang Xi constituted three groups (Smith 2013: 16). The first were early saints in the Shangqing movement. The three brothers Mao Ying (茅盈), Mao Gu (茅固), and Mao Zhong (茅衷), referred to as the Three Lords Mao, supposedly lived in the Western Han dynasty. Perfected Lady Wei Huacun (252-334), a Way of the Celestial Masters adept proficient in Daoist meditation techniques was among the Perfected, and she became Yang's \"xuanshi\" (玄師, Teacher in the Invisible World) (Strickmann 1977: 41). Another notable example is the legendary \"xian\" transcendent Zhou Yishan (周義山, b. 80 BCE). The second group includes Yang Xi's bride, the Perfected Consort An (安妃), the Ninefold Florescent Perfected Consort in the Upper Palace of Purple Clarity, and her mythological parents Master Redpine and Lady Li (李夫人). The third are the Queen Mother of the West's daughters, such as the Lady of Purple Tenuity (紫微夫人) who served as matchmaker between Yang Xi and Consort An.\n\nAfter Xu Mi died in 376, Xu Hui's son Xu Huangmin (許黄民, 361-429) spent several years compiling all the available Yang-Xu transcribed texts. He first distributed copies among the Xu family and their friends. Early readers of these revealed texts were impressed both by the erudite literary style of ecstatic verse and the artistic calligraphy of Yang Xi and Xu Hui (Strickmann 1977: 3, 42).\n\nManuscripts concerning the Shangqing revelations later were collected by several eminent Daoists. Notably, Gu Huan (顧歡, c. 425-c. 487) edited a compilation of Yang-Xu texts entitled \"Zhenji\" (真跡, Traces of the Perfected), which became the model for Tao Hongjing's 499 \"Zhen'gao\". Tao's postface notes differences between the two collections of Yang-Xu manuscripts. The \"Zhenji\" includes secondary texts such as biographies of the Daoist hermit Xu Mai by his famous calligrapher friends Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi, while the \"Zhen'gao\" is restricted to the revealed texts and their historical context. Gu's work was composed of facsimile tracings of the manuscripts, while Tao's more accessible work included his calligraphic analysis of who wrote each component text (Strickmann 1977: 32).\n\nThe eminent Shangqing scholar and alchemist Tao Hongjing (456-536) collected, annotated, and redacted all the available autograph fragmentary Yang-Xu manuscripts Kohn 2008b: 119). Based upon his remarkable familiarity with the calligraphy of Yang Xi, Xu Mi, and Xu Hui, Tao was able to judge authenticity and to eliminate forgeries, resulting in an early example of text-critical scholarship (Robinet 2008b: 1248). Tao's painstakingly endeavors resulted in two texts. The esoteric c. 493-514 \"Dengzhen yinjue\" (登真隱訣, Concealed Instructions for the Ascent to Perfection), which provides technical guidance for Shangqing adepts, and the 499 \"Zhen'gao\", which was intended for a broader audience of laypeople (Robinet 2008b: 1249).\n\nTao Hongjing's \"Zhen'gao\" Declarations of the Perfected survives as a complete work, with interpolations and commentarial additions. Standard editions are found in the 1444 \"Daozang\" Daoist Canon (CT 1016) and the 1782 \"Siku Quanshu\" literary collection. The received text of \"Zhen'gao\" is dated 499, with a preface by Gao Sisun (高似孫) dated 1223 (Robinet 2008b: 1248, 206).\n\nIn English, there are only partial translations of the \"Zhen'gao\". Bokenkamp (1996) translated some prose and seven poems, Kroll (1996) translated nine poems, and Schipper (1999) two (Komjathy 2004: 42-43). Smith (2013) made an annotated translated of Chapter 1.\nIn Japanese, there are \"Zhen'gao\" (\"Shinkō\") reference works and a full translation. Ishii (1971–72) and (1987) compiled indexes of the people, places, and titles mentioned in the text, and Mugitani (1991) created a concordance. Yoshikawa and Mugitani (2000) wrote an annotated translation (Fabrizio 2008: 1329).\n\nTao Hongjing titled his book with \"zhēn\" (真 or 眞, \"real; true; perfected\"; as in Gu Huan's \"Zhenji\" Traces of the Perfected) and \"gào\" (誥 , \"proclamation; announcement\"), denoting that its contents were divinely inspired. Daoist \"zhenren\" \"Perfected\" deities \"gao\" \"dictated\" the Shangqing revelations to highly literate medium and shaman Yang Xi (Schipper 1999: 402).\n\nIn the historical linguistics of the Chinese language, \"Medieval Chinese\" was used in texts during the 4th and 5th centuries when the \"Zhen'gao\" was written and compiled. Owing to the significant differences in word meanings between Medieval and Modern Chinese, the following semantic discussion of \"zhen\" and \"gao\" will summarize English translation equivalents from Paul W. Kroll's dictionary of Classical and Medieval Chinese (2017).\n\n\"Zhēn\" (from Middle Chinese \"tsyin\") (眞 or 真) had complex abstract meanings. \n\nThe Daoist term \"zhēnrén\" (真人) has many English translations such as \"Real Person\", \"Authentic Person\", \"True Person\", \"Perfected Person\", and \"Perfected\" (Miura 2008b: 1265). Kroll clarifies the difference between Daoist and Buddhist usages: \"(1.c.) \"zhēnrén\", Realized Persons, the Perfected, term found as early as the 6th chapter of \"Zhuangzi\" and used in various movements, but esp[ecially] influential in Shangqing Dao[ism] to designate the highest class of divine beings whose home is in the Shangqing heaven and who are completely spiritualized.\"; \"(2.) … \"zhēnrén\", \"one who embodies truth,\" [transcription] of Sanskrit \"arhat\"…\n\nChinese \"zhēn\" \"real; true; genuine; etc.\" is written with several variant characters in East Asian languages, illustrating the Unicode compatibility difficulties with encoding CJK [Chinese, Japanese, and Korean] characters.\n\nThe early graph 眞 (U+771E) is now an outdated traditional Chinese character, Korean \"hanja\", Vietnamese Chữ Nôm, and Japanese \"kyūjitai\" (\"old character form\") \"kanji\". There are variations of the calligraphic strokes below the \"mù\" 目 \"eye\" component in 眞. This 10-stroke 眞 graph has a single \"down and right\" pattern (cf. 乚); which the 11-stroke 眞 (U+2F945) replaces with a 2-stroke \"down and stop, right\" version.\n\nThe modern 真 is both the traditional and simplified Chinese character, and the Japanese \"shinjitai\" (\"new character form\"). Note the change of the original \"bǐ\" 匕 \"spoon\" at the top of 眞 (compare the Small seal script in the infobox above) to \"shí\" 十 \"ten\". There are Sino-Japanese variations on the horizontal line below the 目 \"eye\" element; Chinese (U+771F) connects it with the horizontal line, while Japanese (U+2F947) separates them.\n\n\"Gào\" (Middle Chinese \"kawH\") 誥 had comparatively more concrete semantics.\nThe traditional Chinese character 誥 or simplified 诰 is classified as a radical-phonetic character, composed from the \"speech\" radical \"yán\" 言 and a \"gào\" (MC \"kawh\" or \"kowk\") 告 \"announce, proclaim; report; exhort; accuse\" phonetic element.\n\nScholars either transliterate the title (\"Zhen'gao\", \"Zhen Gao\", \"Chen-kao\", etc.) or translate it:\nNote that the correct pinyin romanization of the title 真誥 is \"Zhen'gao\", but some sources give \"Zhengao\", comparable with misspelling the city \"Xi'an\" as \"Xian\". The uncommon pinyin apostrophe (') is only used to remove ambiguity about syllabification in a polysyllabic word. That is, to differentiate the spelling \"zhen'gao\" (\"zhen\" 真 \"perfect\" and \"gao\" 誥 \"proclamation\") from \"zheng'ao\" (\"zheng\" 正 \"straight\" and \"ao\" 傲 \"proud\"), as in the name of the Chinese soccer player Sun Zheng'ao.\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\" primarily contains Yang Xi's writings that purport to convey the teachings revealed in his spiritual visions (Eskildsen 1998: 72). Tao Hongjing's redacted fragments relate the circumstances of the revelations, the Perfected Ones' explanations and interpretations of their scriptures and methods, private correspondences between Yang and the Xus, and responses to their direct questions addressed to the Shangqing divinities. Tao regularly comments on the authenticity of a text and whether he considered it an original Shangqing fragment (Robinet 2000: 206). Gao Sisun's preface uses the weaving terms \"jīng\" (經, warp) and \"wěi\" (緯, weft)—alluding to the literary terms \"jīngshū\" (緯書, classics; scriptures) and \"wěishū\" (緯書, esoteric glosses on the classics) —to describe the \"Zhen'gao\" as the \"weft\" background of the Shangqing revelations (Robinet 2008b: 1249).\n\nTao Hongjing's received \"Zhen'gao\" is divided into seven \"piān\" (篇, chapters) and twenty \"juǎn\" (卷, volumes), but this was not the original format. It was initially arranged into ten \"juan\", or ten \"pian\" according to some later references. In the present text, chapters 1, 2, and 4 are each split in two parts, making ten chapters altogether, and the arrangement into twenty volumes results from the further subdivision of each chapter into two parts (Robinet 2008b: 1248).\n\nEach chapter has a three-character title, emulating the New Text school's apocryphal \"chènwěi\" (讖緯, \"mystical Confucian prophetical works of Eastern Han\") (Theobald 2011). In the table below, chapter 1 and 2 translations are by Smith (2013) while the others are tentative.\n\nThe division into seven chapters resulted from Tao's \"sometimes clumsy\" effort to give coherence to the whole (Robinet 2008b: 1249). The first five chapters record the revelations of the Perfected. Chapter 1 contains texts relating Yang Xi's visions of and hymns sung by the Perfected, and fragments of Ziyang zhenren (紫陽真人, Perfected Purple Yang)'s lost \"Jianjing\" (劍經, Scripture of the Sword) with a method for making a magic sword that will provide immortality through \"shijie\" (屍解, liberation by means of a simulated corpse) (Robinet 2008b: 1250). Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted to minor recipes and methods by lesser divinities, with information on the afterlife of the Xus' relatives and acquaintances, and a work revealed to Peijun (裴君, Lord Pei), the Baoshen qiju jing (寶神起居經, Scripture on the Behavior for Treasuring the Spirit) (Robinet 1984, 2: 359-362). The fourth chapter concerns Maoshan, its long history of mystics and hermits, biographies of the Mao brothers, and Guo Sichao (郭四朝), an early inhabitant of the mountain (Robinet 1984, 2: 389-98). The fifth comprises a detailed description of the Chinese underworld, and may have constituted the lost \"Fengdu ji\" (酆都記, Records of Fengdu), referring to the subterranean administrative headquarters of hell. Chapter 6 of the \"Zhen'gao\" consists of personal letters, memoranda, and records of dreams written by Yang and the Xus. Tao gives a detailed commentary on the texts contained in these first six chapters. The seventh chapter is Tao's postface, explaining his editorial methods, the history of the Shangqing textual corpus being scattered and plagiarized, and the Xu family genealogy (Strickmann 1977: 4). Despite this overall ordering, some sections have occasional interpolations, repetitions, and misplaced insertions, often resulting in a \"confused and truncated\" logical order of presentation (Robinet 2000: 206).\n\nScholars have long recognized that much of the \"Zhen'gao\" content derives from a syncretic assortment of older sources from \"Wu\" shamanism, Celestial Master Daoism, and Chinese Buddhism, despite the \"resplendent homogeneity which originally disparate elements appear to have acquired in his inspired transcriptions\" (Strickmann 1977: 5).\n\nThe Shangqing school \"succeeded in adhering to a perilous ridgeline\" situated between ancient shamanism or mediumship and modern institutionalizing a church and codifying its liturgy (Robinet 1993: 228). Chinese shamanic spirit journeys are a key literary device in both \"Zhen'gao\" poems and earlier \"Chuci\" (Songs of Chu) poems such as \"Li Sao\" (Encountering Sorrow), \"Yuan You\" (Far-off Journey), \"Jiu Ge\" (Nine Songs), and \"Jiu Bian\" (Nine Changes). Chinese \"wu\" shamans were spirit mediums who practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, and rainmaking. Many of their practices were later adapted by Daoists.\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\" section recording Yang Xi's and Consort An's betrothal and \"spirit marriage\" of illustrates how Yang adapted southern shamanic traditions. It resembles \"Chuci\" poems where male and female shamans describe their meetings, celestial travels, intercourse with nature spirits, and recount their yearnings once the spirit has gone. The passage is also an explicit renunciation of Celestial Masters marriage rites in which the initial sexual act of a bride and groom was performed ritually in the presence of the elders. The Shangqing spirit marriage between Yang and his celestial Consort also involves the merging of corporeal spirits, but all traces of the human sexual act are absent. Yang Xi names this refined type of spiritual union as \"oujing\" (偶景, \"mating of the effulgent spirits\") rather than the Celestial Master sexual practice of \"heqi\" (合氣, \"joining of the pneumas\") (Bokenkamp 1996: 168-169).\n\nZiwei Fujin (紫微夫人), translated as the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity (Bokenkamp 1996) or Lady of Purple Tenuity (Smith 2013), was the celestial matchmaker between Yang Xi and Consort An. In Chinese astronomy, \"Ziwei\" (紫微, Purple Clarity) is the name of a constellation near the Pole star that was associated with Destiny in Daoist fortune-telling (Bokenkamp 1996: 170).\n\nOn the night of 26 July 365, the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity descended to Yang Xi and introduced his stunning bride Consort An. Both Perfected ladies dictated poems to ensure that Yang understood the cosmic significance of their engagement. At their spirit marriage on the next night, Consort An explains their destiny,\nIt is just that I grasp the crux of things and so seized this rare opportunity, thereby responding to cosmic rhythms and numerological fate. In lowering my effulgent corporeal spirits into the dust and evanescence of your world, I have harnessed them as dragons to plunge below. This was done expressly to summon to me the male who pursues the mysterious and to pursue with him an association wherein I might gain a suitable counterpart. We came together because of predestination. As a result,\n<poem>Our records were compared, our names verified;\nOur immaculate tallies joined in the jeweled realms—\nOur dual felicity has been arranged:\nWe will travel as wild geese supporting one another.\nWe will share sips from a single gourd-goblet,\nToasting the nuptial quilt and knotting our lower garments.\nWhen you look to your mate for the food she will prepare—\nIt is the Perfected drugs she holds inside herself. ... (tr. Bokenkamp 1996: 175-176)</poem>\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\" is a unique source for understanding the ancient shamanistic Daoism of Southern China, and its ecstatic poetry shows a distinct relationship to earlier shaman-inspired literature such as in the \"Chuci\" anthology. The spiritual quest for \"a divine lover who is at the same time a redeemer\" is a central theme in the \"Zhen Gao\", and the male and female Daoist adepts exchange love poems with their immortal counterparts, in celebration of their ecstatic union (Schipper 1999: 403). Take for instance, the \"Song of Consort An\" that she dictated to Yang Xi.\n<poem>\nMy chariot has departed from the realm of Western Flowers,\nWandering between the worlds of impermanence and transcendence.\nI now look at the summits of the Five Marchmounts,\nThen again I bathe myself in the Milky Way.\nLeaving my chariot behind, I search for an empty vessel,\nIn all this I am full of passionate feelings,\nWho like a mustard grain can suddenly grow to cover ten thousand acres!\nIn the center stands Mount Sumeru:\nThere is no difference between large and small.\nThe same cause stands at the root of what is far and near;\nYou come from the impermanent world of phenomena.\nBut I love you as a transcendent being! (tr. Schipper 1999: 403, cf. Smith 2013: 162) </poem>\n\nAmong the Perfected who transmitted poetry to Yang Xi, the most prolific (9 poems from 21 August 365 to 28 May 366) was Lady Youying (右英婦人), the thirteenth daughter of the goddess Queen Mother of the West. All nine were \"seduction songs\" for Yang's patron Xu Mi, who the Perfected said was destined to join Lady Youying in spirit marriage and ascend to Shangqing heaven. At that time Xu Mi was in his early sixties, and seen by the Perfected to be entangled in earthly, carnal desires. Lady Youying hoped that her poetry, filled with the colors, sounds, and scenes of the celestial regions, will convince him to join her in a mystical sacred marriage in the \"unseen realm\" (Kroll 1996: 181). However, despite Lady Youying's repeated otherworldly pleadings, Xu Mi waited over a decade to join her. He completed his official career in the capital, and moved to Maoshan where he practiced Shangqing worship until his death in 376 (Ledderose 1984: 255).\n\nYang recorded that Lady Youying dictated the following poem on 6 March 366.\n<poem>Reining in the sky-lights, I ascend the empyrean's dawn-source,\nRambling to revelry in the Palace of Watchet Whitecap.\nPrismatic clouds wreathe the cinnabar auroras;\nNuminous cumuli bestrew the Eight Hollows.\nThe Perfected Ones on high chant in rose-gem abodes;\nLofty Transcendents carol in blue-gem chambers.\nNine phoenixes sing through the vermilion sounding-pipes;\nThe rhythms of the void commingle in the plumed bells.\nWith our necks entwined, within the Golden Court\nI'll unite with my mate amidst the unseen realm. \nTogether we will tap the ichor of the jade ale—\nIn a flash and a flicker, are now in the nonage of infancy!\n—Well then, why do you crouch athwart the worldly road,\nYour lapses and maladies increasing with every day? (tr. Kroll 1996: 186)</poem> \nSongs such as Lady Youying's are \"direct heirs\" to the \"Chuci\"'s \"Yuan you\" Far-off Journey, which poetically describes a shamanic/Daoist flight around the heavens and earth (Kroll 1996: 181).\n\nThe Silk Road transmission of Buddhism into China began in the 1st or 2nd century CE, and the new foreign religion had become widely popular by the time the \"Zhen'gao\" was written. The Daoist Lingbao School, which began in the early 5th century, borrowed many practices and terms from Buddhism (Zürcher 1980). The Shangqing Daoist \"Zhen'gao\" incorporated some passages from Buddhist texts and adapted religious concepts such as monastic celibacy.\n\nSome revelations the Perfected bestowed upon Yang were corrections of existing texts in other traditions. One of the clearest examples of Buddhist borrowings in the \"Zhen'gao\" is a portion of the \"Sishi'erzhang jing\" \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\", which is believed to have been the first Buddhist scripture translated into Chinese (Strickmann 1977: 10). The Chinese philosopher and author Hu Shih (1935) first discovered the \"Sishi'er zhang jing\" borrowings in the \"Zhen'gao\" (volumes 6 and 9, and criticized Tao Hongjing for plagiarism (Eskildsen 1998: 183).\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\" imbeds borrowed passages within discourses attributed to Daoist deities. The following passage uses two fundamental tenets of Buddhism—\"Dukkha\" \"suffering; unsatisfactoriness\" (Chinese \"kǔ\" 苦 \"bitterness\"), the first of the Four Noble Truths, and \"Saṃsāra\" \"karmic cycle; reincarnation\" (\"lúnhuí\" 輪回 \"transmigration\")— to exhort Shangqing adepts toward single-minded, painstaking training and to reject the futile cravings of mundane life.\nThe Blue Boy of Fangzhu appeared and proclaimed, \"\"For a person to practice the Tao is also to suffer, but to not practice the Tao is also to suffer. People from their birth reach old age, and from old age reach [the stage of] illness\". Protecting their bodies \"they reach [the point of] death. Their suffering is limitless. In their minds they worry and they accumulate transgressions. With their births and deaths unending, their suffering is difficult to [accurately and sufficiently] describe\" (emphasis added). Even more so it is because many do not live to their old age ordained by Heaven! [By saying that] to practice the Tao is also to suffer, I mean that to maintain the Perfect purely and immaculately, to guard the mysterious and long for the miraculous, to search for a teacher while struggling, to undergo hundreds of trials, to keep your heart diligent without failure, to exert your determination firmly and clearly; these are also the utmost in suffering.\" (vol. 6, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 73; italicized portions from \"Sishi'erzhang jing\" 35) \n\nAnother recurring \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\" theme in the \"Zhen'gao\" is the elimination of sexual desire. One borrowed passage states, \"As for what is great among longings and desires, nothing is greater than lust. The guilt it brings on has no limit, and it is a matter that cannot be forgiven.\" (\"Zhen'gao\" 6, \"Sishi'erzhang jing\" 22, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 74). Prior to significant Buddhist influence, Daoists traditionally encouraged the practice of \"retention of the semen\" as a means to increase longevity, with \"jīng\" (精) meaning both physical \"sperm\" and spiritual \"essence\" in \"Neidan\" Internal Alchemy and Traditional Chinese medicine. Thus, \"The Oral Lesson of the Female Immortal, the wife of Liu Gang\" warns, \"Those who seek immortality must not associate with women.\" (\"Zhen'gao\" 10, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 76).\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\" used \"yàolì\" (藥力, \"efficacy of a medicine\") in an unclear meaning: \"If a Taoist adept seeks to become an immortal, he must not copulate with women. Each time you copulate, you nullify a full year's medicinal strength. If you ingest nothing and engage in bedroom activities, you will lose thirty years off your life span.\" (10, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 75, interpreting that uncelibate adepts could take special medicines to supplement their \"jing\").\n\nOne of the primary \"Zhen'gao\" reasons for maintaining celibacy and eliminating lust was to attain direct spiritual encounters with immortals and gods. \"Those who are perfect have no feelings of [erotic] passion and desire, nor any thoughts of man and woman. If [thoughts of] red and white exist in one's bosom, the sympathy of Perfected beings will not come about as a response, and Divine Women and Superior Worthies will not descend [before you].\" (6, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 78). This \"red and white\" may refer to blood and sperm (1998: 184). The \"Zhen'gao\" poem \"Spiritual Union, Not Sexual Intercourse\" begins, \"The world prizes sweetly scented intercourse / The way prescribes union in the mystic empyrean\" (tr. Smith 2013: 137).\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\" was influential in medieval Chinese literature and continues to have extraordinary lyrical value. The works of many of China's greatest poets, including Li Bo, Wang Wei, Bo Juyi, and Li Shangyin, were influenced by it (Schipper 1999: 403).\n\nThe first readers of the \"Zhen'gao\" were Eastern Jin dynasty literari, well-educated intellectuals who esteemed poetic ability. The text comprises some 70 poems and songs recited to Yang Xi by the Shangqing divinities, and they communicated with verbal artistry specifically \"calculated to impress and enchant\" the literate aristocracy of the Eastern Jin court. Yang Xi's \"virtuoso efforts combining spiritual content with lyric technique\" precisely appealed to this 4th-5th century Chinese audience, since most of the Perfected Ones' verses had the then current pentasyllabic meter favored by the Eastern Jin literati themselves (Kroll 1996: 180).\n\nFor a final example of Yang Xi's literary ability, consider this description of when Lady of Purple Tenuity first appeared to him (described above). \"Her garments flashed with light, illumining the room. Looking at her was like trying to discern the shape of a flake of mica as it reflects the sun. Her billowing hair, black and long at the temples, was arranged exquisitely. It was done up in a topknot on the crown of her head, so that the remaining strands fell almost to her waist. There were golden rings on her fingers and jade circlets on her arms. judging by her appearance, she must have been about thirteen or fourteen.\" (tr. Bokenkamp 1996: 171).\n\n\n"}

Zoroaster was born in the beginning of the fourth period, to be succeeded at the end of each next millennium by a new saviour. When Saoshyant, the third and last saviour would come the last judgment and the creation of a new world.\n\nAccording to the Zoroastrian story of creation, Ahura Mazda existed in light and goodness above, while Angra Mainyu existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. Ahura Mazda first created seven abstract heavenly beings called \"Amesha Spentas\", who support him and represent beneficent aspects, along with numerous \"yazads\", lesser beings worthy of worship. He then created the universe itself in order to ensnare evil. Ahura Mazda created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (\"menog\") and 3,000 years later, the physical (\"getig\"). Ahura Mazda then created Gayomard, the archetypical perfect man, and the first bull.\n\nWhile Ahura Mazda created the universe and mankind, Angra Mainyu, whose instinct is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil \"yazads\", and noxious creatures (\"khrafstar\") such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting Gayomard and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bull emitted seeds. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world, and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the first human couple. Man thus struggles in a two-fold universe trapped with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness, but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and ever day-lit world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night.\n"}
