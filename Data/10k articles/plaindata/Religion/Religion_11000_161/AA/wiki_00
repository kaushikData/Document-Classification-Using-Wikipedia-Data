He co-founded the New History Society and the Caravan of East and West in New York and was excommunicated from the Bahá'í Faith in 1939 by Shoghi Effendi.\n\nBorn a Bahá'í in Sedeh, Isfahan Province, Persia (now Iran), Sohrab's father `Abdu'l-Baghi was a descendent of Muhammad. `Abdu'l-Baghi was the chief dyer of the town. Both sides of Sohrab's family, his mother and his father, claimed descent from the Imam Husayn, grandson of Muhammad. His mother died when Sohrab was a few months old, while she herself was still a teenager, and he was taken to live with his maternal grandmother in Isfahan.\n\nBy 1911, he had founded an organization called the Persian-American Educational Society. Later that year he sailed to Europe \"in the interests of his work\". Sohrab was secretary and interpreter to `Abdu'l-Bahá from 1912 to 1919. He emigrated to the United States in 1919, sailing as a first class passenger from Port Said, Egypt to New York, on board the S/S \"Yeboshi Maru\". In the 1920's, while living in Los Angeles, he helped write a scenario for a movie dealing with Mary Magdalene, for the actress Valeska Surratt. In 1927 Cecil B. Demille released The King of Kings which the duo claimed he had stolen from their scenario. Suratt sued Cecil B. Demille and others in 1928, and mentioned that Sohrab had helped her write the play. The case went to trial in 1930 and was quietly settled out of court.\n\nHe found it necessary to go to New York to discuss business matters with Miss Surratt and it was through her that he was introduced to Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler and his wife Julie. Together they formed the \"New History Society\" in 1929 as an indirect way of spreading the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nOn Mar 10, 1930, \"Mirza Ahmad Sohrab\" filed a petition for naturalization in the US District Court of New York City. The petition states that he is 39 years old and residing at 28 W 50th Street.\n\nThe New History Society gave rise in 1930 to the Caravan of East and West, and the Chanler's New York house was now called \"Caravan House\". This foundation was designed to prepare children and youth to join the New History Society. This group had a quarterly magazine called \"The Caravan\", where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared. (The autobiography appeared again in 1959, shortly after his death, with a few additional paragraphs which add little.)\n\nSohrab had already published a few books, pamphlets and a movie scenario, when in 1933, with Julie Chanler he wrote a book that provided an overview of many of the events of the Bahá'í movement; it contained a description of the events of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh — his claim in the Garden of Ridván— Táhirih, and `Abdu'l-Bahá. The book also contains several pictures, including some which may be unique.\n\nMrs. Chanler attempted to patch things up between Sohrab and Horace Holley, \"one of the chief men in the American Bahá'í Administration\". But Sohrab refused to allow the New York Spiritual Assembly, to have oversight of the affairs of the New History Society. Since Holley sat on the National Spiritual Assembly at this time, this led to a confrontation which resulted in Sohrab and the Chanlers being expelled from the Bahá'í community about 1939.\n\nSohrab's wife and daughter remained faithful to Shoghi Effendi and changed their names.\n\nIn 1941, Allen McDaniel and others, as members of the National Spiritual Assembly, filed suit against Sohrab to try to stop him from using the name Bahá'í. The NSA felt this created the impression that Sohrab was \"connected with and authorized to represent the Bahá'í religion...\"\n\nThis suit was filed in the Supreme Court of New York County. The judge granted a motion to dismiss, stating that \"the plaintiffs have no right to a monopoly of the name of a religion. The defendants, who purport to be members of the same religion, have an equal right to use the name of the religion...\"\n\nThe judge mentioned that the complaint could be further amended and the NSA appealed but the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.\n\nAfter his excommunication, Sohrab joined forces with other people who opposed Shoghi Effendi. Part of this combination was a court case raised by Qamar Bahá'í, Jalal the grandson of Mírzá Músá and others in about 1950-1, challenging Shoghi Effendi's right to carry out major construction work around the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh. One of their key witnesses, Nayyir Afnan, died shortly before the case was due to open, and it all came to nothing. One of the culminations of this was a meeting that was held in Famagusta in the late 1950s. Representatives of all three main generations of what Baha'is call \"Covenant-breakers\" were present including: Jalal Azal representing the followers of Mirza Yahya, `Ismat and others represented the followers of Mírzá Muhammad `Alí, and Ahmad Sohrab represented those opposed to any form of administration. One of the aims of this conference was to build a mausoleum over the grave of Mírzá Yahyá. To this end, an amount of money was collected but it \"disappeared\" and nothing came of the project.\n\nMoojan Momen notes that:\n\nCaravan eventually severed the links with the Bahá'í Faith, but Sohrab, Mrs. Chanler, and their organizations continued claim association with the Bahá'í Faith as long as they both were living.\n\nThe Caravan existed for a time as a worldwide pen-pal club with social ideals. In addition, there are various references to the Caravan Art Gallery at this same address. There are also references in Mrs. Chanler's and Sohrab's writings to art showings.\n\nSohrab died April 20, 1958. In his obituary he is described as \"leader of the Reform Bahá'í Movement in the United States and co-director of the Caravan of East and West\".\n\nThe New History Society is now defunct, not outliving Sohrab, however the Caravan of East and West persisted and currently operates at the same address as Caravan Institute, an adult-education Italian language school with no connection to the Bahá'í Faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Constructed in the 14th century, it is still in regular use for worship. The Chapel has stood virtually unchanged for over 600 years.\n\nNicholas Henry, who lived in nearby La Perelle manor constructed the chantry chapel in 1392 and dedicated it to Saint Apolline.\n\nAccording to Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Apolline was a woman in Alexandria around A.D. 249 where Christians were being persecuted. After having her jaw and all her teeth destroyed, when she threw herself into a fire, becoming a martyr. Canonised in A.D. 300, she became the patron saint of dentists. A fourteenth century Dominican prayer appeals to her against the pain of toothache.\n\nThe first mention of a chapel was on the 20th July, 1394 when Richard II of England issued a charter mentioning “la chapelle de Saint Marie de la Perelle”. The first time the name was used, ‘la chapelle de Notre Dame de la Perrelle, appelleye la chapelle Sainte Appolyne’ is in a title document dated 1452\n\nThe chapel changed hands a number of times until with the old Catholic order being replaced during the Protestant Reformation, a Royal Commissions, set up on 25 May 1563, conveyed Ste Apolline’s Chapel to Thomas Effart, who was a leading Protestant and Jurat. The building then fell into ruin, saved from demolition by its use as a stable.\n\nA number of objects were probably hidden or taken at this time, some of which have since been recovered including a 14th-century stone figurine, 16th century cross, a silver burette for holding wine or water, two candlesticks and a bell clapper.\nThe chapel appears on the 1787 Duke of Richmond’s map of Guernsey by William Gardner on a plot of three Vergée (around 1.2 acres) planted with an apple orchard.\n\nThe States of Guernsey bought the building and 12 perches of land (about 0.12 acre) in 1873 for £120 when it was being used as a cattle barn. It was the first such acquisition to preserve important buildings in Guernsey.\n\nThe chapel was restored in the 1970s. Under floor heating were added to try to solve the damp together with a replaced bellcote, new roof and lighting.\n\nThe damp problem was not solved, with both roof leaks and rising damp affecting the building and paintings. In 2003 proposals were made to improve the preservation of the chapel and in particular the paintings. These further improvements, including improving ventilation have since reduced the problem.\n\nWith 8.2m x 4.2m interior dimensions, there is seating for 14 inside the Chapel which comprises a single room with a pointed vaulted roof.\n\nThe interior of the chapel shows evidence of the original 14th-century paintings, one on the south wall depicting the last supper. another is possibly of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles. The paintings would have been created in haste, needing to complete them as the plaster dried.\n\nThe 0.75m thick walls of the chapel indicate various sources for the stone, mainly from nearby Cobo, on the west coast, there is also local Perelle stone and stone from Icart on the south of Guernsey. Stones from the more distant Chausey islands have been identified and two blocks of Caen stone, from Normandy, are used in the north window.\n\nThe Chapel is open every day to the public and is used as a place of prayer for Christian Unity. A simple place for contemplation and reflection.\n\nThe building the boundary walls and enclosed area were listed as a Protected Monument on 16 March 1938, reference PM204\n\n"}

He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. According to the Bible, Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended. In the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose. Moreover, he showed his interest in the project by sending back with them the sacred vessels which had been taken from the First Temple and a considerable sum of money with which to buy building materials. The existence of the decree has been challenged.\n\nCyrus the Great is unconditionally praised in the Jewish sources. It is likely that, after the Persian conquest of Babylon, Cyrus had commenced his relationship with the Jewish leaders in exile, and that he later was considered as anointed by God.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible states that Cyrus issued the decree of liberation to the Jews. Cyrus's edict for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people. According to Ezra 4:1-6 \"the enemies of Judah and Benjamin\" asked to help build the temple, and when this was denied hired counselors to frustrate the people of Judah from completing the rebuilding throughout the reign of Cyrus, Xerxes ('Ahasuerus'), and Artaxerxes, until the reign of Darius II. The work recommenced under the exhortations of the prophets, and when the authorities asked the Jews what right they had to build a temple, they referred to the decree of Cyrus. Darius II, who was then reigning, caused a search for this alleged decree to be made, and it was found in the archives at Ecbatana, whereupon Darius reaffirmed the decree and the work proceeded to its triumphant close.\n\nA chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus ('Nabuna'id'), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In 538 BC, there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Media, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered \"without fighting,\" and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to \"all the province of Babylon,\" of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses II, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of \"king of Babylon,\" claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple.\n\nSpeculation abounds as to the reasoning for Cyrus' release of the Jews from Babylon. One argument being that Cyrus was a follower of Zoroaster, the monotheistic prophet: Zoroastrianism played a dominant religious role in Persia throughout its history until the Islamic conquest. As such, he would have felt a kindred spirit with the monotheistic Jews. Another possibility is the magnanimous respect he is ascribed to have evinced for the diverse beliefs and customs of the peoples within his extended kingdom. As one example, upon the conquest of Babylon itself, it is recorded that he paid homage at the temple of the Babylonian god Marduk – thereby gaining the support of the Babylonian people and minimizing further bloodshed. While Jewish tradition, as described previously in Ezra1:1-8, indicates \"the Lord inspired King Cyrus of Persia to issue this proclamation\", in the Cyrus Cylinder he pays homage to Marduk. This Babylonian document has been interpreted as referring to the return to their homelands of several displaced cultural groups, one of which could have been the Jews:\n\nHowever, it has been argued that it must be referring to people associated to the image's cult instead of deportees. Diana Edelman has pointed at the serious chronological difficulties that arise when we accept that the Jews returned during the reign of Cyrus.\n\nThe terms used by the author of Deutero-Isaiah are reminiscent of certain passages in the Cyrus Cylinder: Traditionally, these passages in Isaiah were believed to predate the rule of Cyrus by about 100 years, however, most modern scholars date Isaiah 40-55 (often referred to as \"Deutero-Isaiah\"), toward the end of the Babylonian exile (c. 536 BC). Whereas Isaiah 1-39 (referred to as \"Proto-Isaiah\") saw the destruction of Israel as imminent, and the restoration in the future, Deutero-Isaiah speaks of the destruction in the past (Isa 42:24-25), and the restoration as imminent (Isa 42:1-9). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from (Isa 39:6-7), where the Babylonian Captivity is cast far in the future, to (Isa 43:14), where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon. According to scholar R. N. Whybray, the author of Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40-55) was mistaken for he thought that Cyrus would destroy Babylon but he did not. Cyrus made it more splendid than ever. But he did allow the Jewish exiles to return home, though not in the triumphant manner which Deutero-Isaiah expected.\n\nThen the alliance between Cyrus and God is made explicit:\n\nAmong the classical Jewish sources, besides the Bible, Josephus (1st century AD) mentions that Cyrus freed the Jews from captivity and helped rebuild the temple. He also wrote to the rulers and governors that they should contribute to the rebuilding of the temple and assisted them in rebuilding the temple. A letter from Cyrus to the Jews is described by Josephus.:\n\nThe historical nature of this decree has been challenged. Professor Lester L. Grabbe has argued that there was no decree but that there was a policy that allowed exiles to return to their homelands and rebuild their temples. He also argues that the archaeology suggests that the return was a \"trickle\" taking place over perhaps decades, resulting in a maximum population of perhaps 30,000.\n\n\nInitial text from Easton's \"Bible Dictionary\", 1897 and Schaff-Herzog \"Encyclopaedia of Religion\".\n\n"}
{"id": "59213204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59213204", "title": "Darius Vase", "text": "Darius Vase\n\nThe Darius Vase is a famous vase painted by an anonymous Magna Graecia Apulian vase painter, commonly called the Darius Painter, the most eminent representative at the end of the \"Ornate Style\" in South Italian red-figure vase painting. The vase was produced between 340 and 320 BCE, probably in a large factory-like workshop in the Greek city of Taranto (ancient Taras), Magna Graecia, well before the fall of Taranto to the Romans in 272 BCE. It is an important part of Apulian vase painting.\n\nThe \"Darius Vase\" was discovered in 1851 near Canosa di Puglia and is now on display at the Museo Archaeologico Nazionale, Naples (H3253). This work, a volute \"krater\"is of large dimensions. It is 1.3 meters in height and 1.93 meters in circumference.\n\nThe vase contains several inscriptions, such as naming individual figures, but there are also thematical names (such as \"persai\" - Persians). To some extent these inscriptions can be seen as \"titles\". All available space on the vase is used for figural depictions, arranged in two or three registers. Some individual zones are structured by opulent ornamental friezes. The Darius Painter is considered the first painter to have fully exploited the possibilities of large-format vase painting. His drawing style is reputed to be especially good, particular as regards faces, which he often depicts in a three-quarter profile. \n\nThe neck of the vase shows combat scenes between the Greeks and the Persians. It is generally thought that these scenes represents the combats between Alexander the Great and Darius III, rather than the earlier combats of the troops of Darius I during his First Persian invasion of Greece.\n\nAbove Darius stands a line of Greek Gods: Artemis riding a stag, Apollo seated holding a swan, Aphrodite together with Eros, Zeus holding a winged thunderbolt, Hellas standing, Athena holding a shield, Apate holding two torches, Asia seated on an altar, next to a pillar holding a head (possibly of xoanon).\n\nDarius I is shown seated, wearing a long, ornate, sleeved robe and a high Persian hat. A body guard stands behind him, as Darius is listening to an allegory of the Persian people, enjoining him not to attack the Greeks. Darius could also be simply listening to a messenger. Xerxes I, still a Prince, is said to be represented, second from right. The scene of the audience given by an Achaemenid ruler seems to have been quite conventional, and also appears in a similar fashion in the frieze on the tomb of Lycian ruler Arbinas.\n\nA tax collector, the Royal Treasurer, is seen receiving payments by various conquered nations, who are prostred in front on him. On a table lays a calculating table (a \"recknoning board\" or abax, used for complicated calcutations), with a number of small pebbles or counters in front of the Greek numerals for calculating large numbers. The symbol \"O\" appears in the calculation table, a Boetian symbol for the obol, or small unit. The use of pebbles on a board to make calculations is illustrated down to modern times by the fact that \"calx\" is \"pebble\" in Latin, which is the ethymology for the word \"calculation\".\n\nThe board contains the letters M (= 10.000), Ψ (Boetian for 1.000), H (= 100), Δ (= 10) and (=5, or possibly the unit symbol for the Drachma). Next to them appear the former symbols used to represent the Greek coins: Obol (Boetian symbol O, 1/6 of a Drachma), half an Obol (С) and a quarter of an Obol (T). These symbols resemble those found in the Salamis abacus. The number here shown is probably 1741 and 4/6 Drachms. The tax collector also holds an open diptych (two-leaved wax tablet) in which can be read the letters TAΛNTA:H , presumably meaning \"tal'anta hekaton\"' (\"one hundred talents\").\n\nThe Darius vase may have represented a scene from a Greek drama. The depiction of Darius on his name-vase is possibly derived in its details from the \"Persae of Phrynikos\", C. Anti concluded in 1952, and Schmidt 1960 follows him. However Oliver Taplin notes in Pots and Plays, 2007, p.235-7, the only strong indications of tragic reference are Darius himself and the old man in paidagogos outfit on the plinth inscribed ΠΕΡΣΑΙ, who might be performing the messenger role. Taplin speculates that the iconography of tragedy \"could be assimilated into other contexts without danger of confusion\", op. cit. p.237.\n\n\n"}

The website espouses views that are critical towards Islam and immigration, and supportive of Israel and the United States. Some have labelled the site Islamophobic, but the Norwegian Centre Against Racism considers it only sometimes Islamophobic, while others consider it to be within legitimate political debate. The National Library of Norway classifies it as a web periodical focusing on culture, politics and political science. Document originally began as a small publishing company, and in addition to books it has also published a printed periodical starting in 2013. The website was launched in 2003, and is owned by the limited company with the same name. The founder and editor is Hans Rustad (born 1950), a former journalist for the news agency NTB.\n\nThe website played a key part in exposing the blasphemy bill proposed by the Norwegian government in 2009, and the \"Roma woman\" feature by state broadcaster NRK in 2013. It received global media attention in July 2011 as it turned out Anders Behring Breivik had posted user comments on the site.\n\nDocument.no began publishing as a blog on 14 January 2003. It moved from having the form of a blog to being a news site, as more authors as Christian Skaug and Nina Hjerpset-Østlie joined the editorial team. Today it is referred to as an online magazine. Other contributors includes journalist and former resistance member Ragnar Ulstein.\n\nBy 2011 the website reached an audience of up to 40,000 unique visitors every week. The website reached 145,000 unique monthly visitors in December 2014, and nearly 270 000 unique visitors in September 2016.\n\nIn 2015, blogger Hanne Tolg quit her job in North Wales and joined document.no on a full-time basis after being the target of an anonymous campaign, which included unsourced claims and harassment being posted on RationalWiki, as well as in Facebook groups and forums. According to StortBoard.mx’s list of daily top stories, articles written by Tolg topped the list of most shared articles in social media in Norway twice in 2016.\n\nThe website has been cited as the main player when for the first time in Norwegian history, in 2009 \"bloggers\" were credited for successfully setting the national political agenda. Document.no had criticized a government \"blasphemy bill\", a proposed extension of §185 with regards to \"hate speech so that the provision protects the need for a criminal law protection against qualified attack on religions and belief.\" The proposed bill was met with nearly no exposure in the mainstream media, until close to a month later, although it had been criticizised as an attack on democracy in Danish newspapers. Eventually the bill became criticized as attacking freedom of speech, and an online petition against it was supported by numerous notable figures and organisations in Norway. The pressure caused the government to later retract the proposal.\n\nNina Hjerpset-Østlie, writing for document.no was the first to break a scandal regarding an eight-minute news feature about a Roma woman in the state broadcaster NRK in January 2013. In the NRK-feature, Roma woman Mirela Mustata was presented as a victim of Norwegian law system prejudice against Roma people, however document.no could report that the woman who was presented as a victim had actually been convicted for co-conspiring to the rape of her own 11-year-old daughter, having received payment for it. It was later found that NRK had been aware of this, but chose not to report it in the feature because it, according to them, would make the case too complicated. The case was gradually rolled up by other commentators and gained widespread reporting in mainstream media, causing a major scandal for NRK. NRK later apologized for broadcasting the feature.\n\nThe site has been described by \"Aftenposten\" as \"an Islam-critical and Israel-friendly, so-called blue-blog\", and by \"Dagbladet\" as \"Islam-critical and socially conservative.\" \"Klassekampen\" has described it as a \"leading online magazine\" and has criticized it for not being transparent about the founding, and among the political right's \"most important arenas for debate\" around immigration and Islam. The Norwegian Centre Against Racism has described it as \"the closest to an intellectual arena of debate\" around the same topics for many on the political far right.\n\nHelge Øgrim, editor of \"Journalisten\", the journal of the Norwegian Union of Journalists, in July 2011 described document.no as an \"anti-immigrant forum which has evolved into a hotbed of galloping Islamophobia,\" but later backtracked in a comment on document.no, stating that he might have gone too far in his criticism of Rustad. Lars Gule described it in \"The Vancouver Sun\" as \"a far-right web forum\" that is \"dominated by Islamophobic and anti-immigration commentary\", while the conservative Muslim commentator Mohammad Usman Rana has called it \"a right-wing populist and Muslimphobic interest group\". Writer on right-wing extremism Øyvind Strømmen however rejects that the website is far-right, instead describing the authors as \"socially conservative immigration-opponents\". The Swedish \"Expo\" has described it as \"right-wing radical and Islamophobic\", but according to the Norwegian Centre Against Racism, although the website includes strong criticism of immigration and Islam, it cannot be labelled far-right or outright Islamophobic even if it on occasion has published texts considered Islamophobic.\n\nAccording to \"Klassekampen\", others have praised the site for being \"a serious and fact-based website\" for criticism of Islam. \"The New York Times\" has described document.no as \"a popular conservative Website.\" Yvonne Rundberg Savosnick, the former chairman of the Norwegian Union of Jewish Students, mentioned the site in a 2009 feature with the student newspaper at the University of Oslo, \"Universitas\", because of its \"critical view of the Norwegian press,\" although she stateed that she \"rarely agreed with everything\" on the website. Author and former Aschehoug editor Halvor Fosli has expressed support for many of the website's positions, and has been involved in some limited publishing cooperation. Elin Ørjasæter in 2013 wrote that the site includes \"journalistic pearls and fresh revelations\". \"Aftenposten\" columnist Bjørn Stærk in 2013 described document.no as \"one of Norway's most important media\", and as \"obligatory reading\" for everyone wanting to follow the immigration-debate.\n\nIn 2011, Hans Rustad complained to the Professional Committee of the Press over an article in the local newspaper \"Eidsvoll Ullensaker Blad\", which described Rustad as a chief exponent of the \"brown goo\", stating that \"it does not matter what the spill call themselves, this is very similar to Nazism\" and concluding that \"we do not want Behring Breivik, Rustad and other nutjobs to set the agenda\". The committee criticized the article, emphasizing that it mostly discouraged the use of the term \"Nazi\" when referring to individuals.\n\nAnders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, posted numerous posts on document.no (mainly in 2009) and praised the founder Hans Rustad. He also attended an open meeting of \"Documents venner\" (Friends of Document), affiliated with the website, in the fall of 2009. Breivik reportedly sought to start a Norwegian version of the Tea Party movement in cooperation with the owners of document.no, who initially expressed interest but ultimately turned down his proposal because he did not have the contacts he promised. Breivik eventually became disaffected with the website because he found it to be too moderate for his views. When Breivik was named as the arrested, the website became unreachable due to an extreme increase in traffic. Rustad expressed bleakness with inevitably having to be associated with Breivik, while maintaining that Breivik had disguised his extremist views through relatively moderate, non-violent user comments (which were compiled and made available on the site).\n\nIn 2013 Bjørn Stærk, a columnist in \"Aftenposten\", said that the most controversial contents of the website\"are the guest articles.

The term appears in the early 1970s when Osho's descriptions of his \"Rajneesh Dhyan Yoga,\" developed at meditation camps in the Indian mountains, were translated into English. His prototypical method is still named \"Dynamic Meditation.\"\n\nThe term has come into more general use to describe any approach to meditation that includes movement: examples are \"Sama\" and \"Haḍra\" among the Sufi mystics, the Gurdjieff movements, in the Dynamic Body Awareness ( or ) created in France by artist and anthropologist Martino Nicoletti and other sacred dances, \"Qigong\" and the many exercises developed in Buddhism and Taoism, in India those found in Yoga and Tantra, and the Latihan of Subud.\n\nMany cultures have traditions of meditative movement. Japan has Katsugen undō (regenerating movement exercise, 活元運動, かつげんうんどう), a Seitai exercise developed by Haruchika Noguchi in which one lets go of conscious control of the body and allows it to heal itself. In China there is also Zifagong, Re-do and Zi Ran Qigong and in Japan Seitai.\n\nIn Iran and Turkey there is Mevlevi Dervish or \"'Sufi whirling\" which originally was spontaneous and impromptu. The origin of Sama is credited to Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī (Persian: جلال‌الدین محمد رومی), Sufi master and founder of the Mevlevi Order. The story is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, \"la ilaha ilallah\" or in English, \"no god but Allah\" in the apprentices beating of the gold, and was so entranced in bliss he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle. With that the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi order were born.\n\nOsho believed that cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation; \"I never tell people to begin with just sitting. With a mad dance, you begin to be aware of a silent point within you; with sitting silently, you begin to be aware of madness.\" His \"dialectical\" methods alternate activity and passivity, adapting elements of \"mantra\" and \"pranayama\", \"latihan\", kirtan and psychotherapeutic catharsis. \n\n"}

It is a locality in the Cairns Region.\n\nFitzroy Island is a large tropical island, with a rainforest covering and its own fringe coral reef system. The island has a total area of 339 hectares (838 acres). The highest point of the island is 375 metres above sea level.\n\nFitzroy Island is a 45-minute ferry ride (about 30 km) from Cairns and is surrounded by a reef system that forms part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Nearly all of the continental island is protected within the Fitzroy Island National Park. It is covered in tropical rainforest. Four walking tracks have been established.\n\nFitzroy enjoys a typical North Queensland tropical climate but with the added advantage of the cooling effects of the prevailing southeasterly ocean breezes for the majority of the year. Temperatures range from 24 - 31 C (75 - 88 F) in summer and 19 - 25 C (66 - 77 F) in winter.\nThe island separated from the mainland about 8000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age. There were Aboriginal visits, mainly for visiting hunting trips and recreation.\n\nLieutenant James Cook named the island in 1770 after Augustus Henry Fitzroy. The island was used for a considerable time as a significant Chinese quarantine station for the Queensland goldfields. Subsequently it was used as a mission school and during World War II, as a coast watch station.\n\nThe island has also been important as a significant lighthouse base, with the last permanent lighthouse structures on the main island still being an important community attraction. Since its closure the marine community has been serviced with an automatic lighthouse based on the adjacent Little Fitzroy Island. There has been both a giant clam farm at Welcome Bay and now a tourist resort and day visitor centre.\n\nThe island is home to a 100-room resort. Property developer Doug Gamble bought and renovated the resort in 2010. The resort manages the camping area.\n\n"}
{"id": "16351170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16351170", "title": "Godianism", "text": "Godianism\n\nGodianism (also called Chiism) is a religious movement which was established in 1948 in Nigeria.\n\nThe founder and Supreme Spiritual Teacher of Godianism, Ahanyi, Kalu Onu Kama Onyioha, stated that he intends to correct the notion that African traditional religions are \"pagan\".\n\nAccording to Ahanyi, K.O.K. Onyioha, “Paganism and heathenism were two of the most common words used by western colonialists and their Christian missionaries who accompanied them, when referring to the religious beliefs that existed in Africa. This was because of their ignorance of the principles and the doctrines for which this religion stood. But at least now, they know and are aware that what they once mischievously labeled as paganism and heathenism were neither pagan nor heathen but a religion and spirituality, which had stimulated the growth of great cultures and civilizations in Africa.”\n\nGodianism has been the oldest spirituality of Africa. It is in the cradle of Chiism that the African people grew. The adherents of this religious movement believe that Godianism will help the children of Africa to rejuvenate themselves in unity and solidarity.\n\nGodianism does not look down upon or despise another religion, nor does it use force or coercion to impose its belief on others. With its message of universal unity and its philosophy of 'biri ka'm biri' (live and let live), it serves as an eye opener to those who still peddle religion in the market place by means fair and/or foul to win the world for this 'ism' or that 'ism'.Godianism on the other hand brings harmony and unity among the people of different religions in spite of their diversities. Humanity should eventually understand that harmony is the keynote of the universe. Equality in the universe throbs with a harmonious rhythm. Any disturbance of this rhythm will spell suffering and bring disorder and chaos.\n\nGodianism intends to bring this needed harmony first among the peoples of Africa and subsequently offer it to the world as food for thought.\n\nThe religion has since spread to other parts of West Africa, particularly Ghana. A former Catholic priest, and former member of the Provisional National Defence Council of Ghana after the coup by Jerry Rawlings in 1982, named Vincent Kwabena Damuah wrote a booklet entitled \"Miracle at the shrine:religious and revolutionary miracle in Ghana\" under the name Osofo Okomfo Damuah, which has been very influential in helping the new faith develop in Ghana.\n\nGodianism has, since its inception in Nigeria during the fight for independence from Great Britain, turned from one that was founded with pronounced political motives to a movement that has developed and displayed strong cultural and philosophical aspects, and is viewed as being a \"philosophical reflection on African traditional religious customs\".\n\nThe religion holds that Chineke is the creator of the universe. Igbo people of Eastern Nigeria believe the Igbo language as being one of the languages used by Chineke with which to communicate with mortals, including in the faith's book, called the \"Nkomii\".\n\nThe major Abrahamic faiths, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are all said to be derived from the original teachings contained in this book.\n\nThe purpose of Godianism is to renovate the person spiritually to enable him/her to co-relate in harmony with the rest of humanity. But the physical bearing of a person is not only the prima facie evidence of the complexion of that person's heart, but also offers for him/her the first attraction for acceptance into a harmonious relationship with others in the society. In efforts of Godianism to promote harmony among humanity every Chiist (Godian) encourages his/her neighbor to embrace personal cleanliness, and by refraining from such repulsive habits such as smoking and excessive drinking of intoxicants.\n\nTo thank God, the African ancestors would wish they could see God in person so that they could express their gratitude. But since that was not possible, it became their duty to create an artistic image of Him in the shape of a replica they fashioned from wood. This replication or God-symbol resembled their racial features—black color, woolly hair. By making this replica, they are expressing the fact that they do not know what God looks like, but that this is what they imagine him to be .\n\nThe entire spirit, philosophy and purpose of Godianism are compressed into the following creed of the Godian Religion:\n\nThe religion of Godianism believes in one part that the response to a threat is usually violent and that it is part of man, by nature, on the principle of self-preservation. To say that non-violence in a violent human society, in which society is ranged against man, oppression against freedom and repression against life itself, is to Godianism a clamor which does not accord with the fact of human nature and the law of self-preservation. Godianism teaches that man should forgive offenders. But that the law of karma, which is universal, governs the world. Good comes to those who do good and bad comes to those who do bad. Sinners will definitely face the consequences of their actions except they seek forgiveness from the offended person and truly from God. A genuine repentance purifies the human soul and therefore behaviour. Godianism believes that the human life is sacred and that it should not be destroyed under any circumstance.\n\nAccording to Godianism, the only way to non-violence is to reconstruct human society in the various fronts of human interactions into systems that conduce to harmonious relationship among men—into systems that do not expose man to any sense of insecurity or social injustice to stimulate the violence which is part of his nature dormant in the meantime.\n\nIt is a cardinal point in the aesthetics of Godianism that all Godians must at all times turn out neat. Clothings are to be well washed and clean, the hair on the head should be well-cut, and the beard should be clean-shaven. The Godian must observe proper hygiene and impeccable sanitation for his surroundings. The Godian woman must have her hair neatly plaited or set. It is believed that it would be undermining the objective of Godianism to promote harmonious relationships among men if Godians wore dirty looks.\n\n"}
{"id": "880065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=880065", "title": "Grand Mufti", "text": "Grand Mufti\n\nThe Grand Mufti ( ', \"general expounder\" or ', \"the great of expounders\") is the highest official of religious law in a Sunni or Ibadi Muslim country. The Grand Mufti issues legal opinions and edicts, fatwas, and interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence for private clients or to assist judges in deciding cases. The collected opinions of the Grand Mufti serve as a valuable source of information on the practical application of Islamic law as opposed to its abstract formulation. The Grand Mufti's fatāwā (plural of \"fatwā\") are non-binding precedents in areas of civil laws regulating marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In criminal courts, the Grand Mufti's recommendations are generally not binding either.\nMuftis are Muslim religious scholars who issue influential legal opinions (fatwas) interpreting Sharia (Islamic law). The Ottoman Empire began the practice of giving official recognition and status to a single mufti, above all others, as the Grand Mufti. The Grand Mufti of Istanbul had, since the late 16th century, come to be regarded as the head of the religious establishment. He was thus not only pre-eminent but bureaucratically responsible for the body of religious-legal scholars and gave legal rulings on important state policies such as the dethronement of rulers. This practice was subsequently borrowed and adapted by Egypt from the mid-19th century. From there, the concept spread to other Muslim states, so that today there are approximately 16 countries with sizeable Muslim populations which have a Grand Mufti. The relationship between the Grand Mufti of any given state and the state's rulers can vary considerably, both by region and by historical era.\n\nIn the Ottoman Caliphate, the Grand Mufti was a state official, and the Grand Mufti of Constantinople was the highest of these.\n\nThroughout the era of British colonialism, the British retained the institution of Grand Mufti in some Muslim areas under their control and accorded the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem the highest political stature in Palestine. During World War I (1914–1918), there were two competing Grand Muftis of Jerusalem, one endorsed by the British and one by the Ottoman Empire. When Palestine was under British rule, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was a position appointed by the British Mandate authorities. In the Palestinian National Authority, the administrative organization established to govern parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Grand Mufti is appointed by the president.\n\nThe Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, with office created in 1953, is appointed by the King.\n\nThe State Mufti of Brunei is nominated by the Sultan.\n\nAccording to Article 78 of the 2014 Constitution, the General Mufti of Tunisia is appointed and can be dismissed by the President of the Republic.\n\nIn countries such as Australia where the office of Grand Mufti receives no official seal of government imprimatur, clerics can be elected to the position by one segment of the Islamic community in that country and yet not be recognised by other Muslim communities in that country.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1515716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1515716", "title": "Iftar", "text": "Iftar\n\nIftar (or Fatoor) ( \"\" 'break fast') is the evening meal with which Muslims end their daily Ramadan fast at sunset. Muslims break their fast at the time of the call to prayer for the evening prayer. This is their second meal of the day; the daily fast during Ramadan begins immediately after the pre-dawn meal of Suhur and continues during the daylight hours, ending with sunset with the evening meal of Iftar.\n\nIftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. Iftar is taken just after the call to prayer \"Maghrib\", which is around sunset. Traditionally but not mandatory, three dates are eaten to break the fast in emulation of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, who broke his fast in this manner. Many Muslims believe that feeding someone iftar as a form of charity is very rewarding and that such was practised by the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAH Qasmi provides this information for breaking the fast to say this prayer at the time of Iftar: \n\naccording to a publication of South Africa:\n\nIn Afghanistan, Iftar usually includes the traditional dates, shorwa (soup), kebabs, du piyaza (meat stewed in an onion-based sauce), manto (seasoned, minced meat wrapped in pasta), kabuli palaw (rice with lentils, raisins, carrots, and lamb), shorm beray, bolani (fried or baked flat bread with a vegetable filling), and rice, as well as other dishes. Afghans also have an extensive range of sweet dishes and desserts.\n\nIn Bangladesh, a wide variety of foods is prepared to break the fast at Maghrib time. Some of the common iftar items from Bangladeshi cuisine include Piyajoo (made of lentils paste, chopped onions, green chilies, like falafel), Beguni (made of thin slices of eggplant dipped in a thin batter of gram flour), Jilapi, Muri ( puffed rice similar to Rice krispies), yellow lentil grains, usually soaked in water and spiced with onion, garlic, chilli and other iftar items), Halim, dates, samosas, Dal Puri (a type of lentil based savoury pastry), Chola (cooked chickpeas), kebab, mughlai paratha (stuffed porota with minced meat and spices), pitha, traditional Bengali sweets and different types of fruits such as watermelon. Bengalis open their fast with all their friends and family and eat together in a banquet with their array of food however savoury items are eaten before sweet.\n\nDrinks such as lemon shorbot and yoghurt sharbat(made of yoghurt, water, sugar and rooh afza) are common on iftar tables across the country. People like to have iftar at home with all family members and iftar parties are also arranged by mosques. According to the prophet Muhammed, you should first break your fast with something sweet or with a prayer. Many break their fasts in Bangladesh by eating a kajur or a date and by saying one of the surahs in the Qur'an. People often distribute iftar in mosques for the people praying to eat believing it is a good deed. After Iftar people pray maghrib and later Isha then many head straight for Taraweeh prayers where 20 rakats are performed to finish one Juz' of the Quran.\n\nIn Brunei Darussalam, iftar is locally referred to as \"sungkai\". Traditionally this is held at a regional or village mosque for those who have or will be performing the evening prayers. At the mosque, a mosque buffet is prepared by the local residents at which all are welcomed to break their fast together. Before the iftar, the \"beduk\" (a type of drum) must be heard as a signal to begin the sungkai. In the capital Bandar Seri Begawan, the firing of several cannons at the central business district also marks the sungkai. The sungkai is generally a welcomed time of the day, so Bruneians occasionally break their fast at restaurants along with their extended family. Additionally, only during the month of Ramadan, each district will be hosting an expansive network of \"tamu\" or Ramadan stalls with the exception of Brunei and Muara district, where freshly cooked local delicacies are sold more than other time of the year.\n\nIn India, almost every Muslim stops to rejoice for a few minutes following the iftar sirens and \"adhan\". Muslims break their fasts with family and friends, with most Mosques also arranging free 'iftar'. Preparations for iftar commence hours before, in homes and at roadside stalls. Iftar begins by eating dates or drinking water, but this is only the opening of a rich meal. The spread of 'iftar' can be grand, with both vegetarian to non-vegetarian dishes and a variety of juices and sherbets. Iftar usually is a heavy meal and is followed by a second, lighter dinner eaten before the night (isha) prayers and the taraweeh prayers.\n\nIn Hyderabad and nearby areas, people often break their fast with Haleem because it has a rich taste and is quite filling. In other southern states (Tamil Nadu and Kerala), Muslims break their fast with \"nonbu kanji\", a rich, filling rice dish of porridge consistency, cooked for hours with meat and vegetables. This is often served with bonda, bajji, and vadai. Vegetarians break their fast with a dish called surkumba, which is prepared from milk, and this is particularly popular in certain parts of Karnataka. In northern states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, the fast is typically ended with fresh dates, cut fresh fruits (sometimes served as chaat) and fruit juice along with fried dishes like samosas, pakodas etc.\n\nIn Indonesia iftar is called \"buka puasa\", which means \"to open the fast\". Markets sell various foods for iftar, including the date, which is popular, as well as unique Indonesian sweet food and drink such as kolak, es kelapa muda, es buah, es campur, cendol or dawet, etc. Most of them are only found easily in Ramadan. Iftar is usually begun by eating these sweets, as inspired by the Prophet's Sunnah of eating dates, and this small meal is known as Takjil.\n\nMaghrib time is traditionally marked by the Bedug, a traditional big Indonesian drum. After Asr prayers, traditional markets will begin to open. The food stalls generally sell many kinds of items that are specifically for \"iftar\". Traffic jams often occur leading up to Maghrib time. Sometimes people invite groups of orphans to eat with them. After Iftar and maghrib prayer which is usually done at the homes, people go to the mosque for Isha'a and Tarawih prayer, which in Indonesia, is often accompanied by a short sermon known as \"ceramah\" before the Tarawih prayer commence.\n\nIn Iran, a small selection of foods is prepared to break the fast at Maghrib time (just after sunset) and is summarily followed by a proper Persian meal. Most common iftar items are: Chai (tea, usually Darjeeling) with zulbia and bamiyeh, dates, halva, and other sweets, \"Noon\" (bread usually lavash or barbari) and \"paneer\" (cheese, usually feta) with greens and fresh herbs. Most family members will gather at one home for iftar.\n\nIn Malaysia, iftar is known as \"berbuka puasa\", which literally means \"to open the fast\". As usual, the Muslims break the fast with either dried or fresh dates. Various foodstuffs from the Malaysian cuisine tend to be readily available from \"Bazaar Ramadhan\"s, which are street food markets that are open during Ramadan; local favourites include bandung drink, sugarcane juice, soybean milk mixed with grass jelly, \"nasi lemak\", \"laksa\", \"ayam percik\", chicken rice, satay and popiah among others. Many high-end restaurants and hotels also provide special iftar and dinner packages for those who want to break the fast outside with families and friends. Furthermore, most mosques also provide free \"bubur lambok\" (a special type of rice congee) after Asar prayers.\n\nMost Muslims will usually have a special supper after performing their \"tarawih\" prayers called \"moreh\" (pronounced ). The light meal, taking place in mosque and prayer hall grounds, consists of local traditional snacks and hot tea.\n\nIn the Maldives, iftar is known as \"roadha villun\", which means \"break fast\". As usual, most Muslims break the fast with either dried or fresh dates. There are many exclusive restaurants and hotels providing special iftar and dinner packages for those who want to break the fast outside with the families and friends. All the mosques in the Maldives provide free dates and juice to break fast. At local homes you will find various cold fruit juices (water melon, mango, passion fruit, pineapple) sweet (boakiba, pudding) and salty shorteats called hedhika (boakiba, bajiya, gulha, masroshi, cutlets), the latter made with mainly fish, curries, roshi and salads made with local greens, chilli, onion and lemon.\n\nNigeria easily hosts the largest Muslim community in West Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Iftar (known in the Yoruba language as \"isinu\") holds the same importance in Nigeria's Sunni population as the rest of the Islamic world. Foods include Jollof rice, suya, ọbẹ̀ ẹgúsí, ewurẹ, àkàrà, dabinu/dabino, ọ̀pọ̀tọ́, etc.\n\nIn Pakistan, almost everybody stops to rejoice for a few minutes following the iftar sirens and adhan (call to prayer). Preparations for iftar commence about 3 hours before, in homes and at roadside stalls. The fast can be ended by eating dates, or simply by drinking water, if dates are not available. Many restaurants offer iftar deals, especially in the big cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. As a meal in Pakistan, iftar is usually heavy, consisting mainly of sweet and savoury treats such as jalebi (pretzel-shaped, deep-fried batter, soaked in sugar syrup), samosas (minced meat and/or vegetables, wrapped in dough and deep-fried or baked), pakora (sliced vegetables, dipped in batter and deep-fried) with ketchup or chatni, and namak para (seasoned cracker), besides the staple dates and water.\n\nOther items such as chicken rolls, spring rolls, Shami Kebabs, fruit salads, papad (sheets of batter that are then sun-dried, deep-fried or roasted until they have the texture of potato chips or crisps), chana chaat (chickpea salad), and dahi balay (or \"dahi baray\"—fried lentil dumplings served with yoghurt) are also very common. Amongst the Punjabi, Sindhi and Mohajir households, iftar is often followed up by a regular dinner later during the night. Those in the north and west, including Pashtuns, Balochis, and Tajiks, on the other hand combine dinner and iftar. Laghman soup (noodle soup), locally called Kalli, is an iftar staple in Chitral and parts of Gilgit.\n\nAfter iftar, Muslims rush to the mosques to offer Tarawih (an 8 or 20 rakat Muslim prayer during the month of Ramadan). Various television channels also stop their normal telecast and broadcast special Ramadan transmissions, especially at the time of Sehar and Iftar. The whole month of Ramadan is marked in Pakistan as a festive season when people make donations to the poor and give charity. Some organizations and companies also offer free iftar meals to the common people.\n\nIn Russia and Ukraine, Ramadan is observed mostly in Muslim-majority states: (Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia, Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, Crimea, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan). In Moscow and Kiev, it has become a tradition to open Ramadan Tent, a public iftar event organised by Russia's Mufti Council and Ukraine's Religious Administration of Muslims. In Dagestan, Muslims gather in Makhachkala Central Juma Mosque to break their fast and pray taraweeh prayers. Dates and fruits are preferred to break the fast, followed by soup, bread, and different local delicacies such as beşbarmaq, kurze and others. It is widely believed that Russian and Ukrainian traditional drink kvass is very good to quell the thirst.\n\nIn Singapore, iftar is called \"buka puasa\". It is usually accompanied with dates and sweet drinks such as Bandung, Chendol and Air Sirap. Singaporean Muslims usually eat an array of dishes ranging from rice and noodles. Many buy food from bazaars that can be found in different parts of the city state such as in Bugis, Kampong Glam, Geylang Serai and even in populated towns such as Tampines, Jurong East, Jurong West, Clementi and West Coast.\n\nMuslims in Sri Lanka make special snacks /appetisers at Muslim homes, such as samosas, cutlets, rolls, kanjee, falooda and many more dishes. They eat iftar with the family if possible. Muslims believe that giving to the poor is very rewarding. They eat a date and drink some water to break the fast or to perform iftar. Then they have the prepared meal. Some people like to prepare foods and give to the people performing iftar in the mosques.\n\nIslam is a growing minority religion in Taiwan. During Ramadan, major mosques around Taiwan are filled with Muslims going to have their iftar followed by Tarawih prayer. Muslims in Taiwan usually break their fast with dates and water.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago Muslims represent about 6% of the population. Iftar is traditionally performed in the social setting of the Masjid. Various food items showing the mixed ethnic nature of the country are usually available. Fare may include fried rice; roti; curried chicken, goat, and duck; curried channa; and alloo (potato). Depending on the persons presenting the meal, it may even include such non-traditional items as macaroni pie. The meal is usually served with persons sitting at tables with the components of the meal brought to the tables.\n\nIn Turkey and Northern Cyprus, the month of Ramadan is celebrated with great joy, and iftar dinners play a big part in this. In larger cities like Istanbul all of the restaurants offer special deals and set menus for iftar. Most of the set menus start with a soup or an appetiser platter called \"iftariye\". It consists of dates, olives, cheese, pastırma, sujuk, Ramazan pidesi (a special bread only baked during Ramadan), and various pastries called \"börek\". The main course consists of various Turkish foods, especially the Ottoman Palace Traditional Foods. A dessert called \"güllaç\"- is served in most places. Most of the fine-dining restaurants offer live musical performances of Ottoman classical music, Turkish music and Sufi music.\n\nMost of the Ramadan celebration practices in Turkey have their roots in the traditions of the former Ottoman Empire. At the minarets of mosques, lights called \"kandil\" are switched on from sunset to dawn. As soon as the sun sets, a traditional \"Ramadan Cannon\" is fired from the highest hill in every city as a signal to start eating the iftar.\n\nIn Istanbul, one of the more notable places to celebrate the iftar dinner is the Sultanahmet Square. Located near the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque) the Sultanahmet Square hosts many activities, including mini restaurants opened during the month of Ramadan, special shows, and traditional Ottoman theatrical shows.\n\nThe Tarawih prayer is mostly practised in Turkish mosques as 20 rekahs, broken into 5 groups of 4 rekahs. Between each set of 4 rekahs, a hymn composed by the Turkish musician Buhurizade Itri is sung by all people attending the prayer. The hymn is a prayer to praise the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nAs Ramadan is also the month of almsgiving, many people organise iftar dinners for the poor, students, guests, and foreigners. People can find Turkish food available in most mosques.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Turkish NGOs like the Journalists and Writers Foundation have recently started to organise Interfaith Dialogue Dinners to promote dialogue between those of different religious and cultural backgrounds. These high-profile events have started a whole new era of organising large dinner parties by the NGOs in Turkey for people from different cultures and understandings even if they are not Muslims. In recent years Turkish NGOs, such as the Peace Islands Institute (former Interfaith Dialog Center), all over the world have organised iftar dinners for inter-cultural and interfaith dialogue, which helps promote the true understanding of the month of Ramadan.\n\nIftar meals in the United States and Canada are often held at mosques, households, and Islamic community centres.\n\nOn 9 December 1805, President Thomas Jefferson postponed dinner at the White House until sunset to accommodate an envoy from Tunis, an event considered by many to be the first White House iftar.\n\nThe first official iftar was held at the White House in 1996, hosted by First Lady Hillary Clinton, and iftar meals were subsequently held annually at the White House and hosted by the U.S. President and the First Lady until 2016. President Donald Trump did not host an iftar dinner at the White House in 2017, his first year in office, but resumed the tradition on June 6, 2018, hosting friends and diplomatic staff of Muslim majority nations including Iraq, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSince 1996, the United States Department of State held an annual iftar dinner for local and national community leaders and faith groups as well as foreign policy officials.

Increase of the number of irreligious people is usually interpreted by the modernization marked with tendency of secularization and the progress of science and technology that directly affect human society.\n\nAlthough 2011 census showed that 4,57% of Croatian citizens considered themselves irreligious, Gallup polls conducted in 2007 and 2008 found that 30.5% of respondents do not consider religion important in their lives, responding negatively to the question \"Does religion has an important place in your life?\"\n\nJapanese research center Dentsu conducted survey in 2006 and concluded that 13.2% of the Croatian population declare themselves as irreligious. Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2010 questioned the religiosity in European countries on the basis of personal beliefs that \"God exists\", that \"there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and that \"there is no sort of spirit, God or life force\". 69% of respondents stated that they believed that God existed, 22% believed that there was some sort of spirit or life force, while 7% believed that there was none of the above.\n\nSome evidences suggests that irreligion is the fastest growing religious status in Croatia. Number of agnostics and skeptics rose more than 20 times in the last ten years, while the number of atheists almost doubled. Increase of the number of agnostics in Croatia is usually explained by the fact that many public figures, such as President Ivo Josipović, more often declare themselves as agnostics.\nSeveral organisations that promote irreligious or oppose religious belief, such as Protagora, David, Glas razuma - Pokret za sekularnu Hrvatsku, Nisam vjernik, were founded in the last decade. They organised several public actions such as the \"Conference of reason\" and campaign \"Without god, without a master\". \n\n2011 census revealed that there were 32,518 agnostics and skeptics and 163,375 atheists in Croatia. Slightly more than 93,000 refused to answer on question about their religion. In addition, religion is unknown for 12,460 citizens. Highest percentage of irreligious people in Croatia was recorded in Zagreb (11.56%). Istria, Primorje-Gorski Kotar and Split-Dalmatia are the only counties in which the number of irreligious people exceed 30.000. Looking at the relative share in the population by county, the highest number of irreligious people live in the northwest Croatia, namely in Istria (15.88%) and Primorje-Gorski Kotar (12.11%) counties and the City of Zagreb (11.56%). These three are the only counties where the proportion of irreligious people in the total population exceeds 10%.\n\nLocally, the largest share of irreligious people in Croatia is in Medulin municipality (23.51%), and from the cities, in Pula (23.01%). Town of Rovinj is the only town which has more than 20% of the irreligious people in addition to two Zagreb neighborhoods - Donji grad and \nGornji Grad–Medveščak. In the first 20 Croatian municipalities and cities with the highest proportions of irreligious population are mostly Istrian cities and municipalities of Istria and Primorje-Gorski Kotar counties, then central neighborhoods of Zagreb and the cities of Rijeka and Vis. Considering each county individually, it can be seen that the largest share of irreligious population generally lives in towns in several counties, often county seats. \n\nOn the other hand, Dalmatian municipalities Kijevo and Lokvičići have no irreligious residents. In 20 local administrative units with the lowest percentage of irreligious population (less than 0.33%), mostly are municipalities in southwestern and eastern Croatian counties, and the only city among them is the City of Otok in Vukovar-Srijem County with 0.28% of irreligious population.\n\nBased on official data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses, following data on the distribution of religious and irreligious population in Croatia can be ascertained.\n\nScientific researches of irreligion in Croatia are generally scarce, so it is not possible to know which and what are the differences between religious and irreligious population in for example work on public projects that are important to the community, membership in voluntary associations, going to public meetings, voting in local elections, attending protest demonstrations and political rallies, donating time and money to certain purposes including secular, etc. In addition, it is not researched nor how society perceives irreligious people as one of its component parts, what is their position in society, etc.\n\nInternational longitudinal research \"Aufbruch\" conducted in 1997 in ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe revealed that in Croatia, 31.5% of respondents considered themselves very religious, 42.6% somewhat religious, while the remaining 26% said either that they are not religious, or that they are somewhat or completely irreligious. On the question which examined the image of God, 25.6% of respondents said they sometimes do not believe in God or do not believe in him at all.\n\nInternational research ISSP that was conducted in 2008, explored the socio-demographic and religious characteristics of religious and irreligious people. Researches concluded that the level of education negatively correlated with the degree of religiosity, and that irreligious people largely live in the cities than in the countryside, while this difference is less pronounced with religious people. \n\nIn a research of attitudes of irreligious people towards religion and faith, it was revealed that all respondents differentiate religion and faith, and some church and religion. Attitudes toward religion vary from nothing positive to positive. Among the critics of religion, respondents usually cited control and deceive of the masses, financial interest action, fundamentalism arising from religion, aggressive intrusion into the social sphere, the separation of people and imposing one value system as the only correct one, while those who expressed a positive attitude emphasized that religion plays an important role in society and history. \n\nAlthough the connection between religious and political preferences was not examined, in five out of six presidential elections, Croatian voters elected presidents who declared themselves as irreligious or agnostics. Ivica Račan, 7th Prime Minister, Zoran Milanović, 10th Prime Minister, Vesna Pusić, former First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Milanka Opačić, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Policy and Youth, Šime Lučin, former Interior Minister, MP Marija Lugarić and others declared themselves as atheists. Some prominent leaders of New Atheist activist organizations, namely Neven Barkovich from \"Nisam vjernik\", publicly expressed support for US-led intervention against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2013.\n\n\n"}

He was of the Gagarin family, which traces its origin to the medieval rulers of Starodub-on-the-Klyazma. He was the founding editor of \"Études\".\n\nHe was the son of the Russian state-councillor, Prince Sergey Gagarin, and Varvara Pushkina. He entered the service of the state at an early age, and was first named attaché to his uncle, Prince Gregory Gagarin, at Munich, on whose death, in 1837, he acted as secretary to the legation at Vienna. He was afterwards transferred to the Russian embassy at Paris, where his services were requisitioned in a similar capacity.\n\nHe frequented the salon of his near relation, Madame Sophie Swetchine, and was on terms of familiar intercourse with Father de Ravignan, Lacordaire's successor in the pulpit of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\nHis conversion to Catholicism took place in 1842. On 19 April of that year Gagarin made his profession of faith, and was received into the Catholic Church by Ravignan. According to Russian law, this put an end to his diplomatic career, and he forfeited all rights to his inheritance.\n\nIn the latter half of 1843 he entered the Society of Jesus, and passed his novitiate at Saint-Acheul. He was afterwards sent to Brugelette (in Belgium) where the French Jesuits in exile had a High School. He then taught church history and philosophy, at the College of Vaugirard and the school of Ste-Geneviève, and at Laval. He spent some time in Versailles and, in 1855, was back at Paris. From this time onwards he wrote extensively in the Catholic cause.\n\nWhen the religious orders were expelled from France, Gagarin went to Switzerland, but soon returned to Paris, where he died.\n\nGagarin's literary output was considerable; many of his articles which appeared in current reviews and periodicals were afterwards collected and published in book form.\n\nAs a polemist Gagarin was thorough, and his work as a religious propagandist was of importance. His main object was win over Russia to the Catholic Church. In conjunction with Fr. Daniel, Gagarin founded (1856) the journal \"Etudes de théologie, de philosophie et d'histoire\" (merged into \"Etudes religieuses, historiques et littéraires\", 1862); he established the \"Œuvre de Prop. des Sts. Cyrille et Méthode\" (1858), to promote corporate union amongst the Churches; and contributed to the \"Contemporain\", \"Univers\", \"Ami de la Religion\", \"Précis historiques\", \"Correspondant\", \"Revue des questions historiques\", etc.\n\nThe \"Polybiblion\" (Paris, 1882), another review in which articles appeared from the pen of Gagarin, exhibits (XXXV, 166-188) a long list of his writings. These include: \n\nGagarin also spent several years in Constantinople, where he founded the Society of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, which aimed at reuniting the Greek and Latin Churches. With this object, too, he published:\n\n\nstudies on the Oriental Churches. Amongst works of Gagarin's later years are:\n\n\nAlmost all the above were published at Paris. A portion of his works were re-issued by Brühl, in \"Russische Studien zur Theologie und Geschichte\" (Münster, 1857); and by Huttler, in \"Katholike Studien\" (Augsburg, 1865).\n\n\n\n"}

He made his first on-screen appearance during the episode airing on 6 May 2007. The character departed on 3 June 2011 after four years on the show. Hawley made a short return to \"Coronation Street\" from 21 October 2011 until 28 October 2011 when he was killed off.\n\nThe character has been at the centre of some major storylines such as the kidnap of local teenager Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan), covering up Colin Fishwick's (David Crellin) death from a heart attack, the manslaughter of Joy Fishwick (Doreen Mantle) and the murder of Charlotte Hoyle (Becky Hindley). The character was married to Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) with whom he has a daughter called Hope. John died in October 2011 after crashing his car into the back of a lorry, during a car chase with Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell).\nThe actor Graeme Hawley also appeared in 1998 as a policeman who questioned Steve McDonald about Jim McDonald's fall off the scaffolding.\n\nJohn is organising a school play rehearsal, when he encounters his former girlfriend, Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine). John and Fiz begin dating. John starts tutoring Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) in English Literature. He meets her teenage daughter, Rosie (Helen Flanagan), and they begin a secret affair. The pair are almost caught together on several occasions and Fiz realises something is up with John. She wrongly accuses John and Sally of having an affair. John and Rosie's relationship is revealed on Christmas Day, after John mixes up Fiz and Rosie's presents. John is then attacked by Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). John is fired from his teaching job due to his relationship with Rosie. John gets a job at Street Cars and Fiz forgives him for cheating on her. John notices Rosie outside a nightclub one night and, blaming her for his misfortune, he kidnaps her. John locks Rosie in his grandmother's house for five weeks. Fiz comes to the house and finds Rosie, John is then arrested. He is sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nFiz learns John has been put on suicide watch, after being diagnosed with depression and she goes to visit him. John decides to give Rosie £150,000 from his inheritance as a form of compensation. Fiz asks John to marry her and he accepts. They are married in the prison with Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) as witnesses. John is later released from prison and moves in with Fiz. John is invited to his ex-colleague, Colin Fishwick's (David Crellin), leaving party. Colin explains that he is emigrating to Canada and is leaving the teaching profession. After being sacked from his job at an adult education centre, John decides to take Colin's identity and use it to start teaching again. Fiz agrees to go along with his plan and they keep it a secret from Chesney. Charlotte Hoyle (Becky Hindley) discovers what John is doing and she starts emotionally blackmailing him. John learns Colin is moving to Canada because he was having an affair with a married woman. The woman's husband tracks down John, thinking he is Colin, and punches him. Fiz asks John to quit teaching and he agrees, but decides to continue with the deception in secret.\n\nColin returns unexpectedly and confronts John and Charlotte. During an argument, Colin collapses and dies of a brain hemorrhage. John and Charlotte dispose of Colin's body in a hole in the floor of the Underworld factory. Fiz learns John is still teaching and threatens to leave him. She later tells John she is pregnant and John promises never to lie to her again. John is pursued by a stalker, who turns out to be Charlotte. She continues to blackmail him and John worries when she introduces him as her fiancé to her parents, Dorothy (Jean Fergusson) and Alan(Michael McStay). Colin's elderly mother, Joy (Doreen Mantle) comes looking for her son, but John tells her Colin has gone to Canada. John tells Charlotte that he has no intention of leaving Fiz for her. Charlotte gets angry and reaches for a hammer and swings it at John. He manages to wrestle it from her hands and as Charlotte goes to leave, John hits her. Believing her to be dead, John starts to call an ambulance, but is distracted by the sound of an explosion. He leaves the house and discovers a tram has crashed onto the street. Fiz goes into labour early and John goes to the hospital with her. She gives birth to a girl, who John and Fiz name Hope.\n\nJohn moves Charlotte's body out of the house and pretends to have found her in the wreckage of the tram. The paramedics find Charlotte's pulse and she is placed on a ventilator to help her breathe. However, John and her parents are told she will not regain consciousness due to heavy brain damage. They all decide to switch off the life support machine. John and Fiz worry for Hope when they learn she has a hole in her heart, which can be treated with medication. John begins visiting Joy and helping her with her shopping. John eventually confesses everything to Joy, who has an angina attack from the shock. Someone comes to the door and John panics and puts his hand over Joy's mouth to stop her screaming. Joy then dies and John leaves her house. John suffers a breakdown and is hospitalised. On his return, he holds his daughter for the first time and gets a job at the local betting shop. John stops taking his medication, but after learning Fiz has claimed Joy's inheritance fraudulently, he freaks out and barricades himself in his office. John disappears, but later returns and tells Fiz about how Charlotte was blackmailing him.\n\nChesney learns the truth about John's link to the Hoyle family and Dorothy realises John is not Colin. John takes all three of them hostage at the Hoyle's house. John tells Chesney's girlfriend Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote) that he has run away. John learns the factory floor is being dug up and he gets a job working for the local builder, Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies). One night, John returns to the factory and digs up Colin's body. However, Fiz follows him and is horrified when John confesses that the body is Colin. Fiz reluctantly agrees to help dispose of the body in the canal. Fiz follows John to the Hoyle's house and finds Chesney, Dorothy and Alan tied up in the basement. The police are called and John flees. When Fiz refuses to run away with him, John takes Hope. John discovers Fiz was run over while she was chasing after him. He visits her in hospital and returns Hope to her. The police arrive and John jumps off the hospital roof and disappears.\n\nA few months later, John returns to Weatherfield and kidnaps Rosie. John tells her he wants her to go to court and help Fiz, who has been arrested for the crimes he committed. John explains his version of events to Rosie and makes her recite them to him. Kevin and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) eventually find John and Rosie and John takes off in his car. Kevin follows and John crashes his car. He is taken to the hospital and Fiz and Hope come to visit him. Fiz forgives John and tells him she loves him. John makes a statement to the police and then dies from his injuries.\n\nThe character of John was created as a new love interest for established character Fiz Brown who was to split from her long term love interest Kirk Sutherland around whom most of her romance storylines were centred. It was shortly revealed thereafter that the character would feature in an affair plot with the character Rosie Webster, who was just over the legal age for sexual intercourse. The characteristics of John are a caring nature and the tendency to be charming to females. The actor said his character's personality and success with the female characters of the show is because of his charm: \"He's a bit of a charmer and finds it easy to relax with them and be in their company. He has this disarming charm about him. He's a good listener and talks a lot. That's what they like about him, and he has this 'everyman' quality about him.\" He has revealed himself to be an atheist.\n\nIn early 2008, it was announced that a big storyline for John was coming up involving him kidnapping Rosie Webster. \"Rosie is in for a shock when ex-lover John Stape forces her into a car to get her away from her new man. The tearaway teen, played by Helen Flanagan, is out on a date when the ex-teacher forces her home. John, played by Graeme Hawley, had an affair with the young temptress while he was dating The Street's Fiz. She's upset by his behaviour,\" a soap insider tells The Sun. \"Especially as she was just getting close to her new beau.\"\n\nIn early 2010, it was announced that John Stape is to conceal the body of his former friend Colin Fishwick in a forthcoming plotline, a report has claimed. The sinister storyline is thought to begin when Colin returns from Canada unexpectedly, throwing John's world into chaos because he has stolen his old acquaintance's identity to continue working as a teacher following his stint in jail. According to the Daily Star, Colin ends up dead after clashing with John, prompting the ex-convict to hide his corpse in Underworld, where renovation work is being carried out in the aftermath of Tony Gordon's siege explosion. Builders working at the factory go on to pour concrete over the spot where Colin is buried, leaving John - played by 36-year-old Graeme Hawley - to think he is in the clear. However, John's friend Charlotte Hoyle (Becky Hindley) is also involved in Colin's death and panics over the situation, claiming that the truth is \"bound to come out\". Meanwhile, another possible stumbling block for the teacher comes when factory boss Carla Connor (Alison King) spots him on the building site shortly after the concrete is spread.\n\nIn March 2011, it was announced that the conclusion to John Stape's storyline would see the character commit suicide. Fearing that Colin's remains will be uncovered, John decides to end his nightmare by taking his own life.\n\nIn August 2011, it was announced Hawley would be returning to \"Coronation Street\" in October for a short stint. Upon his return, John kidnaps Rosie Webster and tries to clear Fiz's name by confessing to the murders of Colin, Charlotte and Joy. His return aired from 21 October 2011.\n\nJohn was nominated in the category of \"Villain of the Year\" at the 2009 and 2011 British Soap Awards. Some of the viewing public became annoyed at one of the character's main storylines. Actor Graeme Hawley was blasted for his portrayal of the character stating that he gave the teaching profession a bad name. Hawley explained that: \"I have bumped into a few teachers who haven't been happy with me,\" Graeme told the Daily Record. \"They say, 'You know, we are not all like that.' And my answer to that is, 'I know at least three teachers who had affairs with their students when I was at school. You might not have done it, but don't tell me it doesn't happen.' \"\n\nThe actor was asked if he was heckled a lot in real life by the viewing public during an interview with British Entertainment and Media website Digitalspy on which Graeme had to say: \"There's been a lot of friendly banter really. It happens a lot in the street wherever I go. It's all good-natured, though. People are very complimentary about the storyline and character and asking when John was returning, so that's been lovely. It was nice to hear that people wanted to see more of John Stape back on the Cobbles.\"\n\n\n"}

In the early history of Chinese \"waidan\" (External Alchemy), Li is the only \"fangshi\" whose role is documented by both historical (for instance, \"Shiji\") and alchemical (\"Baopuzi\") sources. \n\nThe earliest record of Li Shaojun was contemporaneously written during the reign of his patron Emperor Wu (141-87 BCE): Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE \"Shiji\" (Records of the Historian) has nearly identical versions in the \"Annals of Emperor Wu\" (chapter 6) and \"The Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices\" (28, tr. Watson 1961: 3-52). In addition, the c. 111 CE \"Hanshu\" \"Book of Han\" (25A) has a \"closely parallel\" version (Campany 2006: 325).\nThe \"Shiji\" chronicles Li Shaojun as part of a lengthy debate on whether and how Emperor Wu should perform the \"Feng\" (封) and \"Shan\" (禪) state rituals on Mount Tai in honor of Heaven and Earth. Debaters were divided between two factions, the \"fangshi\" maintained that Wu should emulate the Yellow Emperor, their main deity, who obtained immortality through performing the rituals, while the Confucianist court officials such as Gongsun Hong suggested that the emperor should only express gratitude to Heaven and Earth (Pregadio 2006: 30).\n\nThe \"Liji\" narrative about Li Shaojun begins with his intentionally obscure origins and introduction to Emperor Wu, to whom he recommends \"cizao\" (祠灶, sacrifice to the furnace/stove) and \"gudao\" (穀道, the Way of [avoiding] grains, aka \"bigu\" 辟穀, Daoist grain avoidance) as methods to attain longevity/immortality. Li does not name which furnace gods to worship, but the Stove God Zaoshen is traditionally associated both with alchemy and \"bigu\", in Chinese raw/cooked logic, since cereal grains were cooked on the stove.\nIt was at this time also that Li Shaojun appeared before the emperor to expound the worship of the god of the fireplace and explain his theories on how to achieve immortality through dietary restrictions [祠灶穀道卻老方見]. The emperor treated him with great respect. Li Shaojun had formerly been a retainer of the marquis of Shenze and specialized in magical arts [主方]. He kept his real age and place of birth a secret, always telling people that he was seventy years old. Claiming that he could make the spirits serve him and prevent old age [能使物卻老], he travelled about to the courts of the various feudal lords, expounding his magic. He had no wife or children. When people heard of his power to command the spirits and drive away death [使物及不死] they showered him with a constant stream of presents, so that he always had more than enough food and clothing and money. Impressed that he seemed to enjoy such affluence without engaging in any business, and also not knowing where he was from, people put even greater faith in his claims and vied with each other in waiting on him. He relied wholly on his ability to work magic and was clever at making pronouncements that were later found to have been curiously apt [資好方善為巧發奇中]. (tr. Watson 1961: 25) \nCompare alternate translations of \"art of making offerings to the (spirit of the) Furnace (i.e. carrying on alchemical practices), and knew how to live without (eating) cereals and without growing old\" (Needham 1976: 29), and \"method of worshipping the furnace and abstaining from cereals to prevent old age\" (tr. Despeux 2008:233). \nBurton Watson translates \"shiwu\" (使物) as \" make the spirits serve him\" and \"command the spirits\", interpreting \"wu\" (物, thing, matter, phenomenon) as \"guiwu\" (鬼物, ghosts; spirits; divine beings); Joseph Needham translates \"using natural substances to bring about perpetual youth\", interpreting \"wu\" as \"yaowu\" (藥物, medicines; drugs) (1976: 29).\n\nSome commentators and most translators take wu here to mean \"guiwu\", ghosts and spirits, but we follow those who interpret it as \"yaowu\", chemical substances and drugs.\n\"wu\" (物, thing, matter, phenomenon), interpreted as \"guiwu\" (鬼物, ghosts; spirits; divine beings),\n\nSince Li intentionally kept his birthplace and age secret, little is certain about his life, even his name is a pseudonym: Li the Youthful Lord (Campany 2009: 117). Li (李, plum) is a very common Chinese surname and Shaojun (少君, Youthful Lord) is a courtesy name—also used by Dou Shaojun (竇少君) or Dou Guangguo (竇廣國, d. 151 BCE), the younger brother of Empress Dou. Compare the 2nd-century BCE \"fangshi\" spiritualist mentioned below, Li Shaoweng (李少翁, Li the Youthful Old Man) (Campany 2002: 225).\nThe \"Shiji\" context continues with two \"self-authenticating\" (Campany 2009: 146) stories about Li Shaojunbeing able to recall incidents of the distant past (Loewe 2000: 227). The former describes him at a party given by Empress Wang Zhi's half-brother Tian Fen (田蚡, d. 131 BCE), who was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Wu'an in 141 BCE.\nOnce when he was staying with Tian Fen, the marquis of Wu'an, and was drinking with the marquis and his friends, he told one of the guests, an old man of over ninety, that he had gone with the man's grandfather to such and such a place to practise archery. The old man had in fact, when he was a child, accompanied his grandfather, and remembered visiting the place that Li Shaojun mentioned. With this the whole party was struck with amazement. (tr. Watson 1961: 25) \nThe latter story narrates how Li recognized a ritual bronze that belonged to Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685-643 BCE).\nWhen Li Shaojun appeared before the emperor, the latter questioned him about an ancient bronze vessel which the emperor had in his possession. \"This vessel,\" replied Li Shaojun, \"was presented at the Cypress Chamber in the tenth year of the reign of Duke Huan of Qi (676 BC).\" When the inscription on the vessel was deciphered, it was found that it had in fact belonged to Duke Huan of Qi. Everyone in the place was filled with astonishment and decided that Li Shaojun must be a spirit who had lived hundreds of years. (Watson 1961: 25-26) \nEmperor Wu was convinced that Li Shaojun could prevent the onset of old age and achieve deathlessness,\n\nNext, the \"Shiji\" relates the emperor undertaking Li's convoluted, long-term alchemical project for achieving immortality through the same method as the Yellow Emperor (Pregadio 2006: 29-30). The alchemical process began with \"cizao\" (sacrificing to the furnace) in order to summon \"wu\" (物, thing; matter; phenomenon), interpreted again as \"guiwu\" (鬼物, ghosts; spirits; divine beings), who would transmute cinnabar into gold, which would gradually extend the emperor’s life long enough to meet the \"xian\" of Penglai Island, and thus learn to correctly perform the \"feng\" and \"shan\" ceremonies. Li Shaojun authenticates his plan by describing his own meeting with the legendary immortal Anqi Sheng on Penglai. Needham literally interprets \"wu\" as natural substances or phenomena and not spiritual beings, and translates \"zhiwu\" (致物)– as \"natural substances can be caused to change\" or \"natural phenomena can be caused to happen\" (1976: 29).\nLi Shaojun then advised the emperor, \"If you sacrifice to the fireplace you can call the spirits to you, and if the spirits come you can transform cinnabar into gold [祠灶則致物致物而丹沙可化為黃金]. Using this gold, you may make drinking and eating vessels, which will prolong the years of your life. With prolonged life you may visit the immortals who live on the island of Penglai in the middle of the sea. If you visit them and perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices, you will never die. This is what the Yellow Emperor did. Once I wandered by the sea and visited Master Anqi, and he fed me jujubes as big as melons. Master Anqi is an immortal who roams about Penglai. If he takes a liking to someone he will come to meet him, but if not he will hide.\" As a result, the emperor for the first time began to sacrifice in person to the fireplace. He dispatched magicians to set out on the sea in search of Master Anqi and the immortals of Penglai and attempted to make gold out of cinnabar sand and various kinds of medicinal ingredients. (tr. Watson 1961: 26) \nThe statement that Master Anqi will sometimes hide, \"accomplishes four things at once: it confirms Li’s own exalted status—for the clear implication is that Li has been deemed worthy of approach by An Qi; it portrays as restricted access to the sources of such methods as Li prescribes; it establishes a precedent for the contemporary adept’s withholding of esoterica from the unworthy; and it acts as a failsafe lest the emperor practice the method unsuccessfully.\" (Campany 2006: 325)\n\nLi Shaojun’s method shows that rituals were associated with Chinese alchemy since its earliest recorded beginnings. The Daoist Taiqing (太清, Great Clarity) tradition likewise summoned gods and other supernatural beings while making elixirs (Pregadio 2006: 32). However, in contrast to later practices of \"waidan\" External Alchemy. Li’s alchemical gold did not grant immortality, but only longevity, and his technique did not involve ingesting it but casting it into dishes and cups. This uncommon use of alchemical gold was mentioned in texts like the \"Jinye jing\" (金液經, Scripture of the Golden Fluid) (Pregadio 2006: 30). This episode represents the first instance of imperial patronage of \"waidan\" practices, which continued during the Six Dynasties and intensified in the Tang period (Pregadio 2008: 643). \n\nThe \"Shiji\" narrative concludes with Li Shaojun's reported death, or perhaps his simulated \"shijie\" escape from the corpse, and the aftermath.\nAfter some time, Li Shaojun fell ill and died [病死]. The emperor, however, believed that he was not really dead but had transformed himself into a spirit [化去不死], and he ordered Kuan Shu [寬舒], a clerk from Huangchui [黃錘], to carry on the magical arts which Li Shaojun had taught. None of the group sent out to search for Master Anqi in the island of Penglai succeeded in finding anything. After this, any number of strange and dubious magicians [怪迂之方士] from the seacoast of Yan and Qi appeared at court to speak to the emperor about supernatural affairs. (tr. Watson 1961: 26) \nThis \"Shiji\" passage about Emperor Wu and Li Shaojun, the earliest historically reliable document, is \"surprisingly dense, relating as it does waidan to mythology, hagiography, ritual, and even state ceremonies.\" It is unclear whether Li's elaborate method represented a long but undocumented tradition before him or simply reflects his attempt at picking as many features as possible that would capture the emperor’s interest and combining them into a secret \"alchemical recipe\" (Pregadio 2006: 31).\n\nThe skeptical philosopher and author Wang Chong's c. 80 CE \"Lunheng\" (Balanced Discourses) repeatedly mentions Li Shaojun in the \"Daoxu\" (道虛, Daoist Untruths) chapter to demonstrate that while some individuals have had very long lives, no one has ever become a Daoist \"xian\" immortal. Wang's narrative generally follows the \"Shiji\" biography of Li Shaojun but adds some reasons to doubt its veracity.\n\nThe \"Lunheng\" narrative of Li's introduction to Emperor Wu has some different vocabulary than the \"Shiji\", for instance, writing \"cizao\" (sacrifice to the furnace/stove) with the variant character \"zao\" (竈) in place of \"zao\" (灶) and using the common name \"bigu\" (辟穀, grain avoidance) instead of \"gudao\" (穀道, the Way of [avoiding] grains).\nAt the time of Han Wu Ti there lived a certain Li Shao Chün, who pretended that by sacrificing to the \"Hearth\" and abstaining from eating grain he could ward off old age [以祠竈辟穀卻老方見上]. He saw the emperor, who conferred high honours upon him. Li Shao Chün kept his age and the place where he was born and had grown up secret, always saying that he was seventy old, and could effect that things did not grow old. On his journeys he visited all the princes around and was not married. On hearing that he could manage that things did not age, people presented him with much richer gifts than they would otherwise have done. He had always money, gold, dresses, and food in abundance. As people believed that he did not do any business, and was yet richly provided with everything, and as nobody knew, what sort of a man he really was, there was a general competition in offering him services. (tr. Forke 1907: 343-344) \n\nThe \"Lunheng\" makes some minor changes in the two stories indicating that Li Shaojun was hundreds of years old. First, when Li meets the nonagenarian at the Marquis of Wu'an's party, instead of \"The old man had in fact, when he was a child, accompanied his grandfather, and remembered visiting the place that Li Shaojun mentioned.\" (\"Shiji\", tr. Watson 1961: 25), it says, \"Li Shao Chün indicated to him the places which his grandfather frequented, when shooting. The old man knew them, having visited them as a child with his father.\" (tr. Forke 1907: 344). Second, when Li recognizes the ancient bronze vessel, the \"Lunheng\" dates it from \"the 15th year\" (671 BCE) instead of \"the tenth year\" (676) of the reign of Duke Huan of Qi. \n\nMore significantly, the \"Lunheng\" omits both the entire passage about Li Shaojun's multipart proposal for the emperor to achieve immortality and the emperor's doubts that Li actually died. The Duke Huan story concludes, \"The whole Court was startled, and thought that Li Shao Chün was several hundred years old. After a long time he died of sickness.\" (tr. Forke 1907: 344). Wang Chong adds some reasons to doubt that Li avoided death through \"shijie\" corpse substitution. \nThose who now-a-days are credited with the possession of \"Tao\" are men like Li Shao Chün. He died amongst men. His body was seen, and one knew, therefore, that his nature bad been longevous. Had he dwelt in mountain-forests or gone into deserts, leaving no trace behind him, he would have died a solitary death of sickness amidst high rocks. His corpse would have been food for tigers, wolves, and foxes, but the world would again have believed him to have disappeared as a real immortal. The ordinary students of \"Tao\" have not Li Shao Chün’s age. Before reaching a hundred years they die like all the others. Yet uncultured and ignorant people still hold that they are separated from their bodies, and vanish, and that, as a matter of fact, they do not die. (tr. Forke 1907: 344) \n\nLastly, Wang Chong gives three reasons to doubt the \"Shiji\" narrative about Li Shaojun.\nThe Grand Annalist Sima Qian was a contemporary of Li Shao Chün. Although he was not amongst those who came near to Li Shao Chün’s body, when he had expired, he was in a position to learn the truth. If he really did not die, but only parted with his body [i.e., \"shijie\"], the Grand Annalist ought to have put it on record and would not have given the place of his death. The reference to the youth of the nonagenarian in the court would prove Li Shao Chün's age. Perhaps be was fourteen or fifteen years old, when the old man accompanied his grandfather as a boy. Why should Li Shao Chün not know this, if he lived 200 years? Wu Ti's time is very far from Duke Huan, when the bronze vase was cast, and Li Shao Chün cannot have seen it. Perhaps be heard once that in the palace there was an old vessel, or he examined the inscription beforehand to speak upon it, so that he was well-informed, when he saw it again. When our amateurs of to-day see an old sword or an antique crooked blade, they generally know where to place it. Does that imply that they saw, how it was wrought? … Li Shao Chün taught \"Tao\" and a method to keep off old age by means of sacrificing to the \"Hearth.\" He determined the period of a tripod cast under Duke Huan of Ch'i, and knew the places frequented, when hunting, by the grandfather of a nonagenarian, and yet he did not really attain to \"Tao\". He was only a long-lived man, who died late. (tr. Forke 1907: 345-346) \n\nThe Daoist scholar Ge Hong's c. 320 \"Baopuzi\" (Master who Embraces Simplicity) mentions Li Shaojun in three Inner Chapters passages. The longer one recounts his biography differently than the \"Shiji\", and two shorter ones mention him in context with the \"fangshi\" Luan Da (d. 112 BCE) who promised immortality to Emperor Wu but was executed after failing to provide it.\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" biography of Li Shaojun cites two Han dynasty historical sources that are no longer extant, adding that Li's poverty was the reason he went to Emperor Wu, and an imperial dream foretelling his death. Ge Hong also lists three levels of \"xian\" transcendents and concludes that Li must have used the lowest \"shijie\" \"liberation by means of a simulated corpse\" because his exhumed coffin did not contain a corpse.\nAccording to Dong Zhongshu's \"Family [Lineage?] Records of Li Shaojun\" (李少君家錄), \"Li Shaojun possessed an esoteric method for deathlessness, but since his family was poor he lacked the means to buy the ingredients. He therefore presented himself at the Han [court] in order to acquire funds. When his way was complete, he departed.\" Also, according to the \"Annotated Record of Activities at the Han Court\" (漢禁中起居註), '\"When Li Shaojun was about to depart, Emperor Wu dreamed that he was climbing Mount Songgao with him. Halfway up, a messenger riding a dragon and holding a tally descended from the clouds and announced that Taiyi had invited Li Shaojun. Then the emperor awoke, and told his retainers, 'If what I dreamed is true, Li Shaojun is about to abandon us and depart.' Several days later, Li announced that he was ill, and he died. Later, the emperor had someone open Li's coffin. There was no corpse inside, only his clothing and cap.\" Now, according to the \"Scripture on Transcendence\" (仙經), superior practitioners who rise up in their bodies and ascend into the void (\"juxing shengxu\" 舉形昇虛) are termed celestial transcendents (\"tianxian\" 天仙). Middle-level practitioners who wander among noted mountains are termed earthbound transcendents (\"dixian\" 地仙). Lesser practitioners who first die and then slough off are termed \"escape-by-means-of-a-simulated-corpse transcendents\" (\"shijiexian\" 屍解仙). Li's must clearly be a case of escape by means of a simulated corpse, then. (2, tr. Campany 2002: 227, cf. Ware 1966: 47 \"Corpse-freed Genii\") \nLi Shaojun's contemporary Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BCE) was a Confucianist official under Emperor Wu, see the \"Shenxian zhuan\" below.\n\nThe first \"Baopuzi\" context about Li Shaojun and Luan Da (欒大 miswritten as Luan Tai 欒太) says, \"The reason people of the world do not believe that transcendence may be practiced and do not grant that one's allotted life span may be lengthened is none other than that the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of the Han sought it without results and that Li Shaojun and Luan Tai [sic] practiced it ineffectively (為之無驗).\" (2, tr. Campany 2002: 227, cf. Ware 1966: 42). The second one concerns Ge Hong's contemporary Gu Qiang (古強), a charlatan healer who claimed to be a 4,000-year-old \"xian\", \"the wealth amassed by the recent, fraudulent practitioner Gu Qiang is said to be no less than that showered by the Han emperor on Luan Da and Li Shaojun.\" (20, tr. Campany 2002: 227, cf. Ware 1966: 321).\n\nBesides the \"Baopuzi\", Ge Hong also compiled the original c. 318 \"Shenxian Zhuan\" (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that gives a highly detailed hagiography of Li Shaojun, which Campany classifies in \"Group A\", the earliest-attested content from before 500 CE.\n\nThe \"Biographies of Divine Transcendents\" narrative begins with Li meeting Emperor Wu, adding information about his courtesy name \"Cloud Wing\" and birthplace in Qi (see Duke Huan above). While the \"Shiji\" mentioned Li Shaojun meeting Anqi Sheng, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" adds that he gave Li the immortality elixir formula.\nLi Shaojun, styled Yunyi 雲翼, was a native of Qi. At the time when Han Emperor Wu had issued his call for masters of esoterica, Li had received from Master An Qi 安期 an esoteric method for making an elixir over a furnace fire. Because his family was poor, he could not obtain the necessary medicinal ingredients. He said to his disciples, \"I'm about to become an old man. My capital is insufficient. Although I have worked hard behind the plow, it isn't enough to procure all the ingredients. But now the Son of Heaven loves the Dao. I would like to go and have an audience with him and ask him for the resources with which to synthesize the drug. Then I can do as I like.\" So he presented a method to the emperor, saying, \"From natural cinnabar may be produced yellow gold; and when the gold is completed and ingested, one ascends and becomes a transcendent. I have often traveled across the seas, I have met Master An Qi, and I have eaten jujubes as big as melons.\" The Son of Heaven greatly venerated and honored him and bestowed untold wealth on him. (tr. Campany 2002: 222)\n\nThe \"Shenxian zhuan\" narrative summarizes the two stories about Li remembering historical events, and also describes his youthful appearance.\nLi Shaojun was once drinking and dining with the Marquis of Wu'an. In the group was an elderly man over ninety. Li asked his name. He then commented that he had once traveled with the old man's grandfather, that he had one night seen a little boy following after the grandfather, and that the two of them were consequently former acquaintances. All present at the time were astonished. Also, during Li's audience with Emperor Wu, he noticed an ancient bronze vessel nearby. Recognizing it, he remarked, \"Duke Huan of Qi. displayed this vessel in his chamber of repose.\" The emperor checked his words against the inscription carved into the bronze, and it did indeed turn out to be an ancient Qi vessel. From this he realized that Li was several hundred years old. But he looked to be around fifty. His facial complexion was excellent, his flesh smooth and radiant, and his mouth and teeth were like those of a youth. When the princes, officials, and nobles [at court] heard that he could cause people not to die, they all esteemed him highly and gave him mountains of money. (tr. Campany 2002: 222) \n\nGe Hong adds the element of deception into the narrative. Having obtained imperial patronage to purchase the expensive alchemical ingredients, Li prepared the immortality elixir for himself, feigned illness, and performed \"shijie\" to escape from not only from death but also from his demanding patron (Campany 2002: 226).\nAnd so Li Shaojun secretly made the divine elixir. When it was completed, he said to the emperor: \"His majesty is incapable of distancing himself from luxury or of removing himself from music and sex. He cannot call a halt to killings and executions, nor can he overcome joy and anger. He cannot change the fact that for ten thousand \"li\" around there are homeless cloud-souls and in the cities and courts there are bloody punishments. Under such circumstances, the great way of the divine elixir cannot be completed.\" But he nevertheless gave a minor medicinal formula to the emperor. Li Shaojun then announced that he was ill. That same night [before the news had reached him] the emperor dreamed that he was climbing Mount Song with Li. When they were halfway up, a [celestial] messenger riding a dragon and holding a seal of office came through the clouds and said that the Grand Monad had invited Li [to ascend into the heavens]. Then the emperor awakened. At once he sent someone to inquire what Li was up to, and he said to his close advisers, \"Last night I dreamed that Li abandoned us.\" When it turned out that Li was ill, the emperor went to call on him, and he also designated someone to receive Li's esoteric methods. But before this matter was concluded, Li expired. The emperor said, \"Li hasn't died; he has intentionally departed by transformation, that's all.\" Meanwhile, the body was being shrouded when suddenly it disappeared. None of the inner and outer garments were unfastened; they were like a cicada shell. The emperor regretted that he had not sought [formulas] from Li more diligently. (tr. Campany 2002: 223) \n\nThis \"Shenxian zhuan\" hagiography gives a long account, possibly invented by Ge Heng (Campany 2002: 226), about Li Shaojun preparing a \"waidan\" alchemical elixir for his seriously ill friend Dong Zhongshu, who \"often scoffed at people of the world for ingesting drugs and practicing the Dao\". Li combined \"Polygonatum\" with several unidentifiable ingredients and \"cooked them in a bronze vessel during the first ten days of the tenth month; young boys who had bathed and purified themselves regulated the heat of the cooking flame.\" When the medicine was fully transmuted, ingesting one \"dose would cause one's body to become light; three doses would cause one's [old] teeth to fall out and new ones to grow in; a full five doses would cause one's allotted life span never to expire.\" Several months later when Dong's illness worsened, he finally took Li Shao Jun's medicine. First, he took less than half a dose and \"his body grew light and strong, and his illness was suddenly healed\". After taking a full dose, \"his breath and strength were as they had been when he was young. Only now did he believe that there was a way of long life and deathlessness.\" This experience convinced Dong Zhongshu to resign from the imperial court and spend the rest of his life unsuccessfully searching for a Daoist master who could reproduce Li's immortality elixir, and he remained healthy until his death at more than eighty years. On his deathbed, Dong told his son, \nWhen I was still young, I obtained Li Shaojun's esoteric medicine. At first I didn't believe in it; after I used it, I regained strength, but then I was never able to grasp [the method for making] it. I will carry this regret with me to the Yellow Springs [where the dead went]. You must go and search among people for a master of esoteric arts, someone who can explain the meaning of this method. If you persist in taking this medicine, you will certainly transcend the world.\" (tr. Campany 2002: 224) \nCampany notes the absence of independent evidence that Dong Zhongshu ever became a believer in Daoist transcendence techniques, although Ge Hong's \"Baopuzi\" cites a text titled \"Fami[y [or lineage?] Records of Li Shaojun\" and identifies Dong Zhongshu as its author (2002: 226).\n\nAlthough unattested before the Tang dynasty, later \"Shenxian zhuan\" editions of Li Xiaojun's hagiography add a narrative about his disciple, Li Shaoweng (李少翁, Li the Youthful Old Man), who also escapes through \"shijie\" by replacing his body with a bamboo tube simulacrum. Both of them stage their deaths in time to avoid being compelled to reveal fully their esoteric skills (Campany 2002: 226). Li Shaojun and Li Shaoweng are commonly confused or conflated.\n\nThe \"Shiji\", which does not mention Li Shaoweng being a student of Li Xiaojun, says Emperor Wu granted the title \"Wencheng jiangjun\" to the necromancer Li Shaoweng who performed the \"zhaohun\" (招魂, summon the \"hun\"-soul) ritual for Emperor Wu's beloved Consort Li (李氏, d. 150 BCE). Over time, Li Shaoweng's magical arts grew less and less effective, and he attempted to deceive the emperor by making an ox eat a message written on a piece of silk, and then announcing, \"There appears to be some strange object in this ox's belly!\" The ox was killed and cut open, revealing \"exceedingly strange\" words written on the silk, however, the emperor recognized Li's handwriting and had him secretly executed in 119 BCE (tr. Watson 1961: 28). \nAt this time there was the General of Civil Accomplishment (Wencheng jiangjun), who also obtained some of Li Shaojun's arts and served under Emperor Wu. Later, the emperor sent an envoy to have him killed. The general told the envoy: \"Please apologize on my behalf to the emperor. I cannot bear to lessen my days here and ruin my work on the Great Task. [That is, the work of synthesizing an elixir] If the emperor loves [arts of] caring for oneself, tell him to look for me thirty years hence on Mount Cheng. We can work on the esoteric method together, and thus he need not resent me.\" [He was then executed.] When the envoy returned, he relayed the message to the emperor, who ordered [the general's] coffin opened and inspected. There was nothing inside it but a bamboo tube. The emperor suspected that his disciples had stolen and hidden his body, so he had them rounded up and questioned. He was then very remorseful. After his execution of the general, he once again issued a call to all masters of esoterica, and he performed another sacrifice to the Grand Monad at Sweetwater Springs, where he set up another altar and presented offerings to the general. The emperor was in personal attendance at the ceremonies. (tr. Campany 2002: 225) \n\nNumerous Daoist texts repeated and expanded the early narratives about Li Shaojun, but his image in the later tradition is not always positive. For instance, the 7th-century commentary to the Taiqing school classic \"Jiudan jing\" (九丹經, Scripture of the Nine Elixirs) refers to Li’s method, saying that the gold of vessels used for eating and drinking \"affords longevity as it slowly saturates one’s stomach, permeating the system of transmutation of food into nutritional essences\". However, the commentary also blames Li Shaojun because his performance gave more importance to \"cizao\" offerings to the deity of the furnace, described as \"zuǒdào\" (左道, lit. \"Ways of the left\"; heterodox doctrine; a term often applied to magic), but did not address the \"correct\" \"waidan\" methods of highest Taiqing deities such as Taiyi Great One and the Yellow Emperor (Pregadio 2006: 32, Pregadio 2008: 643-644).\n\n"}
{"id": "8502708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8502708", "title": "List of biblical commentaries", "text": "List of biblical commentaries\n\nThis is an outline of commentaries and commentators. Discussed are the salient points of Jewish, patristic, medieval, and modern commentaries on the Bible. The article includes discussion of the Targums, Mishna, and Talmuds, which are not regarded as Bible commentaries in the modern sense of the word, but which provide the foundation for later commentary. With the exception of these classical Jewish works, this article focuses on Christian Biblical commentaries; for more on Jewish Biblical commentaries, see Jewish commentaries on the Bible.\n\nA visitor to Alexandria at the time when Christ was preaching in Galilee would find there and in its vicinity Jews using the Septuagint as their Bible, and could enter their Great Synagogue. Whoever had not seen it was not supposed to have beheld the glory of Israel. The members of their Sanhedrin, according to Sukkah, were seated on seventy-one golden thrones valued at tens of thousands of talents of gold; and the building was so vast that a flag had to be waved to show the people when to respond. At the head of this assembly, on the highest throne, was seated Alexander the Alabarch, the brother of Philo.\n\nPhilo himself was a man of wealth and learning, who mingled with all classes of men and frequented the theatre and the great library. Equally at home in the Septuagint and the Greek classics, he was struck and perplexed by the many beautiful and noble thoughts contained in the latter, which could bear comparison with many passages of the Bible. As this difficulty must have frequently presented itself to the minds of his coreligionists, he endeavoured to meet it by saying that all that was great in Socrates, Plato, etc. originated with Moses. He set about reconciling Pagan philosophy with the Old Testament, and for this purpose he made extensive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. He taught that many passages of the Pentateuch were not intended to be taken literally. In fact, he said that they were literally false, but allegorically true.\n\nHe did not make the distinction between natural and revealed religion. For example, Pagan systems may have natural religion highly developed, but, from a Judeo-Christian point of view, with much concomitant error. His exegesis served to tide over the difficulty for the time amongst the Hellenistic Jews, and had great influence on Origen of Alexandria and other Alexandrian Christian writers.\n\nFarrar, in his \"Life of Christ\", says that it has been suggested that when Christ visited the Temple, at twelve years of age, there may have been present among the doctors Jonathan ben Uzziel, once thought the author of the Yonathan Targum, and the venerable teachers Hillel and Shammai, the handers-on of the Mishna. The Targums (the most famous of which is that on the Pentateuch erroneously attributed to Onkelos, a misnomer for Aquila, according to Abrahams) were the only approach to anything like a commentary on the Bible before the time of Christ. They were interpretative translations or paraphrases from Hebrew into Aramaic for the use of the synagogues when, after the Exile, the people had lost the knowledge of Hebrew. It is doubtful whether any of them were committed to writing before the Christian Era. They are important as indicating the character of the Hebrew text used.\n\nShlomo Yitzchaki (1040-1105), more commonly known as Rashi (RAbbi SHlomo Itzhaki), was a medieval French rabbi and author of a comprehensive commentary on the Talmud and commentary on the \"Tanakh\".\n\nHillel and Shammai were the last \"pair\" of several generations of \"pairs\" (Zugot) of teachers. These pairs were the successors of the early scribes who lived after the Exile. These teachers are said to have handed down and expanded the Oral Law, which, according to the uncritical view of many Jews, began with Moses. This Oral Law consists of legal and liturgical interpretations and applications of the Pentateuch. As no part of it was written down, it was preserved by constant repetition (Mishna). On the destruction of Jerusalem several rabbis, learned in this Law, settled at Jamnia, near the sea, twenty-eight miles west of Jerusalem. Jamnia became the headquarters of Jewish learning until AD 135, due to the Third Jewish Revolt. Then schools were opened at Sepphoris and Tiberias to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The rabbis comforted their countrymen by teaching that the study of the Law (Oral as well as Written) took the place of the sacrifices. They devoted their energies to arranging the Unwritten Torah, or Law. One of the most successful at this was Rabbi Akiba who took part in the Third Jewish Revolt of Bar Kochba, against the Romans, and lost his life (135). The work of systematization was completed and probably committed to writing by the Jewish patriarch at Tiberias, Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi \"The Prince\" (150-210). He was of noble birth, wealthy, learned, and is called by the Jews \"Our Master the Saint\" or simply Rabbi par excellence. The compilation made by this Rabbi is the Mishna. It is written in Mishnaic Hebrew, and consists of six great divisions or orders, each division containing, on an average, about ten tractates, each tractate being made up of several chapters. The Mishna may be said to be a compilation of Jewish traditional moral theology, liturgy, law, etc. There were other traditions not embodied in the work of Rabbi, and these are called additional Mishna.\n\nThe discussions of later generations of rabbis all centred round the text of the Mishna. Interpreters or \"speakers\" laboured upon it both in Jerusalem and Babylonia (until 500), and the results are comprised in the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. The word Talmud means teaching, doctrine. Each Talmud consists of two parts, the Mishna (in Hebrew), in sixty-three tractates, and an explanation of the same (Gemara), ten or twelve times as long. The explanatory portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is written in NeoWestern Aramaic and that of the Babylonian Talmud in Eastern Aramaic, which is closely allied to Syriac or Mandaic. The passages in the Gemara containing additional Mishna are, however, given in New Hebrew. Only thirty-nine tractates of the Mishna have Gemara. The Talmud, then, consists of the Mishna (traditions from 450 BC till 200 AD), together with a commentary thereon, Gemara, the latter being composed about 200-500 AD. Next to the Bible the Babylonian Talmud is the great religious book of orthodox Jews, though the Palestinian Talmud is more highly prized by modern scholars. From the year 500 till the Middle Ages the rabbis (geonim) in Babylonia and elsewhere were engaged in commenting on the Talmud and reconciling it with the Bible. A list of such commentaries is given in \"The Jewish Encyclopedia\".\n\nSimultaneously with the Mishna and Talmud there grew up a number of Midrashim, or commentaries on the Bible. some of these were legalistic, like the halakhic sections of the Talmud but the most important were of an edifying, homiletic character (Midrash Aggadah). These latter, although chronologically later, are important for the corroborative light which they throw on the language of the New Testament. The Gospel of St. John is seen to be steeped in early Jewish phraseology, and the words of Ps. cix Hebrew Bible 110], \"The Lord said to my Lord\", etc. are in one place applied to the Messiah, as they are in (referenced from Psalm 110:1), though Rashi following the Rabbis interpreted the words in the sense of applying them to Abraham.\n\nAnan ben David, a prominent Babylonian Jew in the eighth century, rejected Rabbinism for the written Old Testament and became the founder of the sect known a Karaites (a word indicating their preference for the written Bible). This schism produced great energy and ability on both sides. The principal Karaite Bible commentators were Nahavendi (ninth century); Abu al-Faraj Harun (ninth century), exegete and Hebrew grammarian; Solomon ben Yerucham (tenth century); Sahal ben Mazliach (died 950), Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer; Joseph al-Bazir (died 930); Japhet ben Ali, the greatest Karaite commentator of the tenth century; and Judah Hadassi (died 1160).\n\nSaadiah of Fayûm (died 892), the most powerful writer against the Karaites, translated the Bible into Arabic and added notes. Besides commentaries on the Bible, Saadiah wrote a systematic treatise bringing revealed religion into harmony with Greek philosophy. He thus became the forerunner of Maimonides and the Catholic Schoolmen.\n\nSolomon ben Isaac, called Rashi (born 1040) wrote very popular explanations of the Talmud and the Bible.\n\nTobiah ben Eliezer a Romaniote scholar and paytan in 11th century Kastoria (Greece), wrote the \"Leḳaḥ Ṭov\" or \"Pesiḳta Zuṭarta\", a midrashic commentary on the Pentateuch and the Five Megillot.\n\nAbraham Ibn Ezra of Toledo (died 1168) had a good knowledge of Oriental languages and wrote learned commentaries on the Old Testament. He was the first to maintain that Isaiah contains the work of two prophets.\n\nMoses Maimonides (died 1204), the greatest Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages, of whom his coreligionists said that \"from Moses to Moses there was none like Moses\", wrote his \"Guide to the Perplexed\", which was read by St. Thomas. He was a great admirer of Aristotle, who was to him the representative of natural knowledge as the Bible was of the supernatural.\n\nThere were the two Kimchis, especially David (died 1235) of Narbonne, who was a celebrated grammarian, lexicographer, and commentator inclined to the literal sense. He was followed by Nachmanides of Catalonia (died 1270), a doctor of medicine who wrote commentaries of a cabbalistic tendency; Immanuel of Rome (born 1270); and the Karaites Aaron ben Joseph (1294), and Aaron ben Elias (fourteenth century).\n\nIsaac Abarbanel (born Lisbon, 1437; died Venice, 1508) was a statesman and scholar. None of his predecessors came so near the modern ideal of a commentator as he did. He prefixed general introductions to each book, and was the first Jew to make extensive use of Christian commentaries. Elias Levita (died 1549) and Azarias de Rossi (died 1577) have also to be mentioned.\n\nMoses Mendelssohn of Berlin (died 1786), a friend of Lessing, translated the Pentateuch into German. His commentaries (in Hebrew) are close, learned, critical, and acute. He had much influence, and was followed by Wessely, Jarosław, Homberg, Euchel, Friedlander, Hertz, Herxheimer, Ludwig Philippson, etc., called \"Biurists\", or expositors. The modern liberal school among the Jews is represented by Salomon Munk, Samuel David Luzzato, Leopold Zunz, Geiger, Julius Fürst, etc.\n\nRabbi Pesach Wolicki (born 1970) is a biblical scholar and commentator. His book, \"Cup of Salvation\", also known as \"Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise\", which was published by the Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) in 2017, is a devotional biblical commentary on Psalms 113-118 otherwise known as the Hallel.\n\nThe history of Christian exegesis may be roughly divided into three periods: the Age of the Fathers, the Age of Catenæ and Scholia (seventh to sixteenth century), and the Age of Modern Commentaries (sixteenth to twentieth century). The earliest known commentary on Christian scriptures was by a Gnostic named Heracleon in . Most of the patristic commentaries are in the form of homilies, or discourses to the faithful, and range over the whole of Scripture. There are two schools of interpretation, that of Alexandria and that of Antioch.\n\nThe chief writers of the Alexandrian School were:\nTo these may be added\n\nIts chief characteristic was the allegorical method. This was, doubtless, founded on passages in the Gospels and the Epistles of St. Paul, but it received a strong impulse from the writings of Alexandrian Jews, especially of Philo.\n\nThe great representative of this school was Origen (died 254). Origen was the son of Leonides of Alexandria, himself a saint and martyr. Origen became the master of many great saints and scholars, one of the most celebrated being St. Gregory Thaumaturgus; he was known as the \"\" on account of his incessant application to study, writing, lecturing, and works of piety. He frequently kept seven amanuenses actively employed; it was said he became the author of 6000 works (Epiphanius, Hær., lxiv, 63); according to St. Jerome, who reduced the number to 2000 (Contra. Rufin., ii, 22), he left more writings than any man could read in a lifetime (Ep. xxxiii, ad Paulam). Besides his great labours on the Hexapla he wrote scholia, homilies, and commentaries on the Old and the New Testament. In his scholia he gave short explanations of difficult passages after the manner of his contemporaries, the annotators of the Greek classics. Most of the scholia, in which he chiefly sought the literal sense, are unfortunately lost, but it is supposed that their substance is embodied in the writings of St. John Chrysostom and other Fathers. In his other works Origen pushed the allegorical interpretation to the utmost extreme. In spite of this, however, his writings were of great value, and with the exception of St. Augustine, no writer of ancient times had such influence.\n\nThe writers of the Antiochene School disliked the allegorical method, and sought almost exclusively the literal, primary, or historical sense of Holy Scripture. The principal writers of this school were\n\nThe great representatives of this school were Diodorus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and St. John Chrysostom. Diodorus, who died Bishop of Tarsus (394), followed the literal to the exclusion of the mystical or allegorical sense. Theodore was born at Antioch, in 347, became Bishop of Mopsuestia, and died in the communion of the Church, 429. He was a powerful thinker, but an obscure and prolix writer. He felt intense dislike for the mystical sense, and explained the Scriptures in an extremely literal and almost rationalistic manner.\n\nHis pupil, Nestorius, became the subject of the Nestorian controversy; the Nestorians translated his books into Syriac and regarded Theodore as their great \"Doctor\". This made Catholics suspicious of his writings, which were finally condemned after the famous controversy on The Three Chapters. Theodore's commentary on St. John's Gospel, in Syriac, was published, with a Latin translation, by a Catholic scholar, Dr. Chabot.\n\nSt. John Chrysostom, priest of Antioch, became Patriarch of Constantinople in 398. He left homilies on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked by one of his brethren whether he would not like to be the owner of Paris, so that he could dispose of it to the King of France and with the proceeds promote the good works of his order, he answered that he would prefer to be the possessor of Chrysostom's \"Super Matthæum\". St. Isidore of Pelusium said of him that if the Apostle St. Paul could have used Attic speech he would have explained his own Epistles in the identical words of St. John Chrysostom.\n\nOther writers combined both these systems, some leaning more to the allegorical and some to the literal sense. The principal contributors were\n\nJerome, besides his translations of Scripture and other works, left many commentaries, in some of which he departed from the literal meaning of the text. At times he did not always indicate when he was quoting from different authors, which according to Richard Simon accounts for his apparent discrepancies.\n\nThe medieval writers were content to draw from the rich treasures left them by their predecessors. Their commentaries consisted, for the most part, of passages from the Church Fathers, which they connected together as in a chain, a \"catena\".\n\n\nThe principal Latin commentators of this period were the Venerable Bede, Walafrid Strabo, Anselm of Laon, Hugh of Saint-Cher, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Nicholas de Lyra.\n\nThe Venerable Bede (seventh to eighth century), a good Greek and Hebrew scholar, wrote a useful commentary on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. It is in reality a catena of passages from Greek and Latin Fathers judiciously selected and digested.\n\nWalafrid Strabo (ninth century), a Benedictine, was credited with the \"Glossa Ordinaria\" on the entire Bible. It is a brief explanation of the literal and mystical sense, based on Rabanus Maurus and other Latin writers, and was one of the most popular works during the Middle Ages, being as well known as \"The Sentences\" of Peter Lombard.\n\nAnselm of Laon, professor at Paris (twelfth century), wrote the \"Glossa Interlinearis\", so called because the explanation was inserted between the lines of the Vulgate.\n\nHugh of Saint-Cher (Hugo de Sancto Caro), thirteenth century), besides his pioneer Biblical concordance, composed a short commentary on the whole of the Scriptures, explaining the literal, allegorical, analogical, and moral sense of the text. His work was called \"Postillæ\", i. e. \"post illa\" (\"verba textus\"), because the explanation followed the words of the text.\n\nThomas Aquinas (thirteenth century) left commentaries on Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Epistles of St. Paul, and was the author of the well-known \"Catena Aurea\" on the Gospels. This consists of quotations from over eighty Church Fathers. He throws much light on the literal sense and is most happy in illustrating difficult points by parallel passages from other parts of the Bible.\n\nNicholas de Lyra (thirteenth century), joined the Franciscans in 1291 and brought to the service of the Church knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinical learning. He wrote short notes or \"Postillæ\" on the entire Bible, and set forth the literal meaning with great ability, especially of the books written in Hebrew. This work was most popular, and in frequent use during the late Middle Ages, and Martin Luther was indebted to it.\n\nA great impulse was given to exegetical studies by the Council of Vienne which decreed, in 1311, that chairs of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic should be established at Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca.\n\nBesides the major writers already mentioned the following are some of the principal exegetes, many of them Benedictines, from patristic times till the Council of Trent:\n\n\nThe influx of Greek scholars into Italy after the fall of Constantinople, the Christian and anti-Christian Renaissance, the invention of printing, the controversial excitement caused by the rise of Protestantism, and the publication of polyglot Bibles by Cardinal Ximenes and others, gave renewed interest in the study of the Bible among Catholic scholars. Controversy showed them the necessity of devoting more attention to the literal meaning of the text, according to the wise principle laid down by St. Thomas in the beginning of his \"Summa Theologica\".\n\nIt was then that the Jesuits, founded in 1534, stepped into the front rank to counter the attacks on the Catholic Church. The Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits made it incumbent on their professors of Scripture to acquire a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental languages. Alfonso Salmeron, one of the first companions of Ignatius Loyola, and the pope's theologian at the Council of Trent, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and voluminous commentator. Bellarmine, one of the first Christians to write a Hebrew grammar, composed a valuable commentary on the Psalms, giving an exposition of the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Vulgate texts. It was published as part of Cornelius a Lapide's commentary on the whole Bible. Cornelius a Lapide, S. J. (born 1566), was a native of the Low Countries, and was well versed in Greek and Hebrew. During forty years he devoted himself to teaching and to the composition of his great work, which has been highly praised by Protestants as well as Catholics.\n\nJuan Maldonato, a Spanish Jesuit, born 1584, wrote commentaries on Isaias, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs, Canticles (Song of Solomon), and Ecclesiastes. His best work, however, is his Latin commentary on the Four Gospels, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the best ever written. When Maldonato was teaching at the University of Paris the hall was filled with eager students before the lecture began, and he had frequently to speak in the open air.\n\nGreat as was the merit of the work of Maldonato, it was equalled by the commentary on the Epistles by Estius (born at Gorcum, Holland, 1542), a secular priest, and superior of the College at Douai. These two works are still of the greatest help to the student.\n\nMany other Jesuits were the authors of valuable exegetical works, e.g.:\n\nThe Jesuits were rivalled by\n\nDuring the nineteenth century the following were a few of the Catholic writers on the Bible:\n\nCatholics have also published scientific books. There is the great Latin \"Cursus\" on the whole of the Bible by the Jesuit Fathers, Karl Cornely, Joseph Knabenbauer, and Franz Hummelauer. The writings of Marie-Joseph Lagrange (Les Juges), Albert Condamin (Isaïe), Theodore Calmes (Saint Jean), Albin van Hoonacker (Les Douze Petits Prophètes).\n\nFor a list of Catholic publications on the Scripture, the reader may be referred to the \"Revue biblique\", edited by Lagrange (Jerusalem and Paris), and the \"Biblische Zeitschrift', published by Herder (Freiburg im Breisgau). For further information concerning the principal Catholic commentators see respective articles.\n\nHaydock's Catholic Bible Commentary, 1859 edition.\nby Rev. Fr. George Leo Haydock, following the Douay-Rheims Bible.\nA Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture 1953 \nby Bernard Orchard (Editor), Edmund F. Sutcliffe (Editor), Reginald C. Fuller (Editor), Ralph Russell (Editor), Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster (Foreword) \n\n\nThe commentaries of the first Reformers, Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, Zwingli and their followers wrote on Holy Scripture during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.\n\n\nDuring the nineteenth century:\n\nThere were many commentaries published at Cambridge, Oxford, London, etc. (see publishers' catalogues, and notices in \"Expositor\", \"Expository Times\", and \"Journal of Theological Studies\").

Many of these works, especially the later ones, are valuable for their scientific method, though not of equal value for their views or conclusions.\n\nProminent series include: \n\nA notable recent specialist commentary is \"Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament\" (2007), edited by G. K. Beale and D. A. Carson.\n\nThe English deists included:\n\nThey were opposed by these writers:\n\nThe opinions of the English rationalists were disseminated on the Continent by Voltaire and others. In Germany the ground was prepared by the philosophy of Wolff and the writings of his disciple Semler. The posthumous writings of Reimarus were published by Lessing between 1774-78 (\"The Fragments of Wolfenbüttel\"). Lessing pretended that the author was unknown. According to the \"Fragments\", Moses, Christ, and the Apostles were impostors. Lessing was vigorously attacked, especially by Goeze. Eichhorn, in his \"Introduction to the Old Testament\" (Leipzig 1780-83, 3 vols.), maintained that the Scriptures were genuine productions, but that, as the Jews saw the intervention of God in the most ordinary natural occurrences, the miracles should be explained naturally.\n\nHeinrich Paulus (1761–1850), following the lead of Eichhorn, applied to the Gospels the naturalistic method of explaining miracles. G. L Bauer, Heyne (died 1812), and Creuzer denied the authenticity of the greater portion of the Pentateuch and compared it to the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The greatest advocate of such views was de Wette (1780–1849), a pupil of Paulus. In his \"Introduction to the Old Testament\" (1806) he maintained that the miraculous narratives of the Old Testament were popular legends, which in the course of centuries, became transformed and transfused with the marvellous and the supernatural, and were finally committed to writing in perfectly good faith.\n\nDavid Strauss (1808–74) applied this mythical explanation to the Gospels. He showed most clearly, that if with Paulus the Gospels are allowed to be authentic, the attempt to explain the miracles naturally breaks down completely. Strauss rejected the authenticity and regarded the miraculous accounts in the Gospels as naive legends, the productions of the pious imaginations of the early generations of Christians.\n\nThe views of Strauss were severely criticized by the Catholics, Kuhn, Mack, Hug, and Sepp, and by the Protestants Neander, Tholuck, Ullman, Lange, Ewald, Riggenbach, Weiss, and Keim.\n\nBaur originated a theory which was for a time in great vogue, but which was afterwards abandoned by the majority of critics. He held that the New Testament contains the writings of two antagonistic parties amongst the Apostles and early Christians. His principal followers were Zeller, Schwegler, Planck, Köslin, Ritsch, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, Tobler, Keim, Hosten, some of whom, however, emancipated themselves from their master.\n\nBesides the writers already mentioned, the following wrote in a rationalistic spirit:\n\nHoltzmann, while practically admitting the authenticity of the Gospels, especially of St. Mark, explains away the miracles. He believes that miracles do not happen, and that the scripture are merely echoes of Old Testament miracle stories. Holtzmann was severely taken to task by several writers in the \"International Critical Commentary\". The activity of so many acute minds has thrown great light on the language and literature of the Bible.\n\n\n\nWith the rise of the Internet, many Public Domain or otherwise free-use Bible commentaries have become available online. Here is a list of some of the commentaries:\n\nAdditionally, the Christian Classics Ethereal Library has presented a unified reference tool to access many commentaries from different traditions in their World Wide Study Bible.\n\nMany recently published commentaries are now available to view through the Google Books Project.

{"id": "6157905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6157905", "title": "Murari (film)", "text": "Murari (film)\n\nMurari is a 2001 Indian Telugu-language supernatural drama film written, and directed by Krishna Vamsi. The film features Mahesh Babu in the title role with Sonali Bendre, Lakshmi, Sukumari, Kaikala Satyanarayana and Gollapudi Maruthi Rao. Mani Sharma composed the music while Bhupati handled the cinematography. Peter Hein debuted as choreographer of action sequences with this film. The film marked the last on screen appearance of veteran Telugu actor Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry.\n\nThe film revolves around the happy-go-lucky Murari whose Zamindar ancestors have been victims of Goddess Durga's generational curse since the mid 19th century. Every 48 years the Royal Family's heirs lose their life in their early 30s due to this curse. No matter how many religious rituals are being performed since ages, the family loses their heirs. In this generation, Murari is the one to be succumbed by the curse. The film deals with Murari's redemption to overcome the curse through his spiritual will, and through his grand mother's self sacrifice. The film was released on 16 February 2001 to positive reviews, and became a super hit in Telugu cinema.\n\nThe film was later dubbed into Hindi as \"Rowdy Cheetah\" by Goldmines Telefilms in 2014.\n\nSet up in the 18th century, during Amavasya, the dark moon lunar phase, a greedy, and lavish alcoholic zamindar insults principal Deity Durga and attempts to steal the Panchaloha idol from the Royal Family's Temple in a state of inebriation so that he can repay his huge debt to the British officers. Subsequently, he along with the British officer's are killed by the enraged Goddess Durga. The goddess infuses a mythical curse on the family's heirs, and every 48 years on the day of Diwali, one male heir from the Royal Family is succumbed to death. The present year 2001 denotes end of another 48 years, and Murari (Mahesh Babu), the Grandson of Sabari whose husband died 48 years back because of the curse, is expected to be the next heir to be succumbed to the curse. Murari lives with his father Sattipandu, Sister-in-law Gopi, brothers Sreenayya, Baachi and Soori and their respective wives and kids along with Sabari. Murari is named after Sabari's husband and thus is called with utmost respect by all family members except Gopi who calls him either by his name or as Kanayya. She treats him like her son and even decides to go for abortion clandestinely so that she would not neglect him once she has her own offspring. Thus since his childhood Murari considers Gopi as his mother since his mother died giving birth to him.\n\nIn another village, a beautiful city-bred Agricultural student called Vasundhara lives along with her big combined family and is the cynosure of all eyes and affection in the family. Sattipandu and Vasundhara's father Chanti are blood related and actually Gopi is Chanti's adopted daughter. These two families are separated because of a feud at Gopi's marriage because of Chanti's evil son Rambabu. Every year, Gopi is allowed to go there without any escort from her husband and when a tussle happens regarding this, Sreenayya apologizes and tries to patch up with her. At that point, Murari comes to know about Gopi's sacrifice for him when he secretly listens their conversation. For the first time, Gopi gets an escort in the form of Murari after this incident. There after few incidents, Murari falls in love with Vasundhara but leaves the house because of a land dispute with Rambabu with Gopi staying back there for few more days. Vasundhara tries to convey her love but she had no chance and returns to Hyderabad.\n\nBack at Murari's home town, the temple priest Seshayya comes to know that Murari is going to be the victim of Devi's curse but he does not disclose the same to Sabari who goes for a pilgrimage. Meanwhile with assurance from his father, Murari goes to Hyderabad and unites with Vasundhara. They go back to Murari's house where Vasundhara lies that she came for Agricultural research. Slowly the couple gets the nod from all the members of both of the families. Meanwhile Sabari, who returns from the pilgrimage, upon being informed by Seshayya that Murari would be subjected to death by Devi this year, refuses for the marriage. Rambabu announces marriage of Vasundhara with her cousin Bullabbayi that day and when informed by Chanti, Murari tries to quit the temple to save her but is stopped by Sabari. Then she reveals the dark secret that is kept under wraps about Durga's curse to her family when they all are at the temple offering prayers for redemption. Murari promises to Sabari that he would come alive along with Vasundhara to complete his Abhisheka.\n\nMurari goes to Vasundhara's place and saves her from Bullabbayi but once they are about to leave, Murari is fatally stabbed by Bullabbayi unintentionally and thus runs away on seeing Murari bleeding. In extreme pain, Murari realizes this as Goddess Durga's ploy and with all strength he manages to come back to the temple along with Vasundhara. He manages to convince everyone that he is safe and sound as he covered his wounds with soil and a cloth but Soori notices blood stains. Before he could say anything, Murari tells him to call an ambulance immediately and takes part in the rituals despite extreme pain and internal bleeding. By the time the rituals of Abhisheka, Yajna, and Arti end, the blood of Murari spills over the Holy Idol invoking the soul spirit, and as a result Murari loses his consciousness and is in critical condition. Seeing this, Sabari drowns herself in the holy river as a sacrifice to the Goddess, and saves Murari's life. Murari revives and marries Vasundhara.\n\nWhen Krishna Vamsi visited a temple in a village, he came to know about a very famous person there whose three sons died under suspicious circumstances at regular intervals 4 years back. When he spoke to the local people, they said that the big man killed a worker from lower cadre by hiring some goons and the wife of that killed person came to this person's house and cursed that all his three sons would be dying with in six months. After listening to them, he was intrigued by all these incidents. As a part of his research, he visited temples and observed the architectures, sculptors and also read books like Yogi's Autobiography etc. He said \"I met highly qualified people like Sirivennela Sitaramasastri to enhance my knowledge in various things. I also studied the visions of our ancestors, who during their time have designed things like missiles, television, aircrafts etc\" in an interview. He added \"We always have an answer for any questions that start with 'what', 'how' and 'when'. But we do not have any reason or answer for questions starting with 'why'. I had this kind of backdrop in my mind and wanted to make a film. When a film in the combination of Mahesh Babu and Krishna Vamsi was announced, I though I should make all those mystic questions get a representation in this film.\" He wanted to incorporate Telugu culture and tradition with a festive mood and thus used a joint-family backdrop.\n\nInfluenced by Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 1971 film \"Anand\", Krishna Vamsi wanted to kill Mahesh Babu's character in this film as he felt that except \"Anand\", no other film introduced a hero who would be dying very soon. During the story discussions, when he said the same to his team, none accepted. He aimed to go in reverse trend and form the film's screenplay as story writers used to create a problem and then introduced the hero to solve it in Telugu cinema. After meeting Mahesh Babu, Krishna Vamsi decided to use the story of Krishna for the family part. He clarified that it was not a true adaptation of Lord Krishna's life but he got inspired by the characterizations in Krishna's story. According to Krishna Vamsi, the death points Murari faces in the film are inspired from the attacks of \"rakshasa\" on Krishna and the fatal attack in the climax was inspired from Lord Krishna's death in the hands of a \"Yadava\" hunter. Sri Sita Ramachandra Swamy temple at Ammapally near Shamshabad was selected for filming key scenes related to the curse part of the story and the temple gained prominence after the film's release. A strong belief in the film industry emerged that a film with scenes shot at the temple will do well at the box-office.\n\nMahesh Babu confessed that this film was a crucial one in his career and quoted the role of Murari as his favorite role in 2012. Sonali Bendre made her debut in Telugu with this film and it was her first collaboration with Krishna Vamsi. Lakshmi, Kaikala Satyanarayana, Prasad Babu, Gollapudi Maruthi Rao, Deekshitulu and Raghu Babu were a part of the film's principal cast. Ravi Babu played a negative role in the film. Actress Sukumari was selected to play the character of Sabari, Mahesh Babu's grandmother in the film which was one of her widely remembered role in Telugu cinema. Veteran film actor and religious guru Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry made a cameo appearance which was his last film.\n\nRegarding Mahesh's character in the film, Krishna Vamsi said \"During that time, I met Mahesh Babu a couple of times. He has a 'mugdha manohara mohana roopam' meaning that Mahesh has very beautiful look which can mesmerize anyone. I was impressed to such an extent that I wanted to add 'Krishna tatvam' to that film, as 'mugdha manohara mohana roopam' is the first quality of Lord Krishna. Just like the way Krishna had herd of cows, hero in this film had an animal (elephant). I wanted to create the atmosphere of \"Brindavanam\". That's the reason why Mahesh is shown to be moving along with and surrounded by girls/women and kids\". Sonali Bendre's characterization in the first half was based on Satyabhama and her characterization in the second half was based on Rukmini. Because of that, Krishna Vamsi incorporated a scene similar to \"Rukmini Kalyanam\" (Lord Krishna takes Rukhmini away from her place and marries her without the knowledge of her people) in the second half where Murari's character saves Vasundhara from her evil brother and takes away her from her village to marry her. Lakshmi character was based on Yasoda while Prasad Babu and Kaikala Satyanarayana's roles were partially inspired from Balarama's character. According to Krishna Vamsi, the other \"Yadavas\" in the film were the brothers and family members of hero while Ravi Babu's character was a mix of characterizations of Sisupala, Karna and Duryodhana. Two separated joint families like that of \"Pandavas\" and \"Kauravas\" were created though they are on good terms unlike the way portrayed in Lord Krishna's story. Prakash Raj played a cameo as the evil zamindar who was the first victim of the curse while Deekshitulu played the role of the temple's priest named Seshayya.\n\nThe music and background score was composed by Mani Sharma. This album consisted of 7 tracks. The soundtrack featured singers S.P.Balasubrahmanyam, K.S.Chitra, Jikki, Shankar Mahadevan, Udit Narayan, S. P. B. Charan, Sunitha Upadrashta, Anuradha Sriram and Harini. The lyrics were written by Veturi Sundararama Murthy, Sirivennela Sitarama Sastry, Chandrabose and Suddala Ashok Teja.\n\nThe film received positive reviews. \"idlebrain.com\" gave a review stating \"The credit for the success or failure of this film should go to the Krishna Vamsi. This film is bound get a little bit of dissent from the viewers of C class areas. But, this film is classic masterpiece for the class audience and highly recommended for the Mahesh and Krishnavamsi fans. This film will be a good fare for the people if they watch this film with no expectations. Just watch this film to experience Krishna Vamsi paint the silver screen with his classic strokes\" and rated the film 3.5/5. \"fullhyd.com\" gave a review stating \"Murari starts off on a good note with the desecration of the temple by Prakash Raj for money, and builds up an interesting story as to how three members of their family cursed by Devi Maa give up their lives. But the story soon loses its steam as we know for sure the sacrificial lamb. Murari is a typical Hum Aapke Hain Kaun kind of film with all the fun and laughter and the goodness among the people. It is good family movie with best cinematography and best performance by artists and rated the film 8/10.\n\n"}

The chief advocate for the shrine was Domoto Teiichi, who had been the Private Secretary to the Governor of the South Pacific Mandate since 1936.\n\nThe enshrinement ceremonies took three days, November 1–3, 1940 (\"Showa 15, 1st–3rd day of the 11th month\"). The shrine was situated at Koror because it was the Japanese colonial capital. From the outset, the Nan'yō Shrine was officially designated one of the \"Kanpei-taisha\" (官幣大社), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government-supported shrines. The shrine was construed by the Japanese government as marking \"a step forward in the sacred task of constructing a New East Asian Order.\"\n\nWhen the Allied forces threatened Palau in late 1944, the \"kami\" and sacred symbols of the shrine were evacuated to Japan by submarine. The shrine remained untouched by American bombing; but Japan's defeat in World War II ended this colonial administration and a sense of reverence for the shrine structures which were dismantled for use in rebuilding Koror. Only the stone steps to the upper platform and the great stone lanterns still remain as evidence of the former shrine precincts.\n\nIn 1983, plans were developed for a reconstruction of the shrine at its former site, and a miniature replica of the original shrine was completed with the funding of private sponsors from Japan in 1993.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13311966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13311966", "title": "Philippine Orthodox Church", "text": "Philippine Orthodox Church\n\nThe Philippine Orthodox Church is the government-approved and registered legal name of the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in the Philippines. Generally, it refers to the officially established Eastern Orthodox presence in the Philippines as a whole. Currently, there are only four Orthodox canonical missions in the Philippines:\n\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, Greek sailors settled in Legazpi, Albay on the island of Luzon. Their descendants now number no more than 10 families, who have kept their Greek surnames and have become distinguished public figures and intellectuals, including serving in the Greek consulate in Manila.\n\nOne of the first Orthodox Christian faithful to arrive in the province of Albay was Alexandros Athos Adamopoulos (later anglicised to Alexander A. Adamson), who came to Legaspi City in 1928. Together with his brother and cousin he co-founded Adamson University in 1932, which is now owned by the Vincentian Fathers of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nDuring the American colonial regime, some Russian émigrées fleeing the Russian Civil War arrived in the Philippines. In 1935, the Russian Orthodox Church established the first Orthodox parish in Manila, and the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia appointed Father Mikhail Yerokhin as vicar. The Episcopal Church then permitted Fr. Mikhail to use the north transept of their Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint John for worship. In 1937, the Russian Orthodox Church built the first Orthodox church in the Philippines, dedicated and named after the Iberian Icon of the Mother of God. Both the Episcopal Cathedral and the Russian Orthodox church in Manila were destroyed in 1945 by Allied bombardment during the city's liberation at the end of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1949, Archbishop John Maximovitch and 5,500 Russian Orthodox from China were relocated to Tubabao (now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar) in the Visayas, by the International Refugee Organization, with the permission of the newly-sovereign Republic of the Philippines. Archbishop Maximovitch then established a wooden church, orphanage, and other buildings in Tubabao exclusively for the Russian refugees.\n\nTubabao, however, was and still a small, underdeveloped island which is humid, prone to typhoons, and at times inaccessible due to the sea state conditions. When a Russian commented that they feared a typhoon would destroy their camp, Filipinos replied that there was nothing to worry about because \"your holy man blesses your camp from four directions every night.\" Anecdotally, there were no typhoons or floods while Archbishop Maximovitch was there.\n\nArchbishop Maximovitch did not preach the Orthodox faith to locals, and no Filipino was baptised, chrismated, ordained or consecrated during his stay. Through the persistent lobbying of Archbishop Maximovitch to the United States Congress, the refugees were allowed to settle in the United States and Australia beginning in 1951.\n\nIn 1989, Adamopoulos saw the need to establish the first Greek Orthodox church in the Philippines and thus established the Hellenic Orthodox Foundation, Inc., but he died in 1993 before the church was completed. The Annunication Orthodox Cathedral in Sucat, Parañaque City, Metro Manila, was finished in 1996. Constructed in true Byzantine style and with interior furnishings imported from Greece, it serves hundreds of Filipino Orthodox and Orthodox expatriates in the national capital. The church was consecrated by His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I on 5 March 2000, with Metropolitans Ioakeim and Nikitas, Bishop Dionysios, and a significant number of clergy from overseas assisting. During the service, the entire congregation followed the Patriarch in circumambulating the church. The Patriarch told the people present that the only thing which can really lead man to the land of gladness is the perfect love for his fellow man and for God. The message from the Church of Constantinople is one of love for the people of Southeast Asia, one which assures people everywhere of the immeasurable love of Christ.\n\nOn 20 April 1990, a Filipino hieromonk, Fr. Vincentius Escarcha (a former Benedictine Abbot and a Roman Catholic priest for more than 20 years in Bajada, Cataingan, Masbate), together with four nuns and faithful members of his community, were received into the Orthodox Church by Metropolitan Dionysios of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of New Zealand and assisted by Bishop Sotirios of Zelon. On 19 January 1994, Metropolitan Dionysios and Bishop Sotirios received several Filipino Christians in Manila by Holy Chrismation.\n\nIn 1996, the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia was created for the needs of the faithful under the Church of Constantinople. In 2004, the Theotokos Orthodox Church in Bajada was consecrated by Metropolitan Nikitas of Hong Kong and South East Asia. the nuns of the Theotokos Orthodox Monastery in Bajada ran a kindergarten.\n\nWithin the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, there are currently six (6) active Filipino Orthodox priests in the Philippines (Fr. Vincentius having already retired from active service), along with a couple of nuns, and are now administratively under Metropolitan Nektarios of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. In these communities, the Divine Liturgy and other Orthodox worship services are held in English, Greek and Filipino.\n\nOn February 28, 2008, after three months from its application, Metropolitan Archbishop Paul (Saliba), Primate of Australia and New Zealand of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All of the East, accepted the congregation of the Missionary Servants and Handmaids of St. Francis of Assisi together with Pentecostal Methodist Bishop Jeptah Aniceto, who was also appointed as the Vicar of the Davao Vicariate after his ordination to the Orthodox priesthood.\n\nFrom May 19 to 22, 2008 Metropolitan Archbishop Paul visited the Philippines for the second time, where he had a colloquium with twelve candidates for ordination to the diaconate and the priesthood in Cogeo, Antipolo City and visited the Antiochian Orthodox communities in Antipolo City (Cogeo Village with 500 members, Bagong Nayon 2 with 500 members, Pagrai with 500 members and Sirona with 500 members), San Jose Del Monte City (Feliciano Subdivision, Brgy. Muzon with 500 members, and Pleasant Hills Subdivision, Brgy. San Manuel with 300 members and Kalookan City (Pangarap Village with 500 members).\n\nArchbishop Paul ordained Pascualito D. Monsanto as the first Antiochian Orthodox priest in the Philippines and elevated him to the rank of Archpriest for the Manila Vicariate.\n\nHe also ordained Carlos R. Rafanan, a former SVD priest of the Roman Catholic to the Orthodox priesthood; Carlos G. Cabubas to the diaconate; and Abundio J. Delim, Jr., Michael A. Monsanto, Divino Z. Pedraza to the sub-diaconate. He deferred the ordination of the nine (9) candidates pending completion of the required studies on Orthodoxy.\n\nFrom May 23 to 26, 2008 Archbishop Paul traveled to Davao City to ordain convert Pentecostal Methodist Bishop Jeptah Aniceto as the third antiochian orthodox priest in the Philippines and elevated him to archpriest for the Davao Vicariate. This priest shortly after ordination left the Orthodox Faith. His followers left the Antiochian Church as well and scattered.\n\nIn August 2013 Metropolitan Hilarion, First Hierarch of the Russian Church Abroad, sent Archpriest Seraphim (Bell) and the then Deacon Silouan (Thompson) to help re-establish the Russian Orthodox Church and made the first Divine Liturgy, baptism of catechumens, trained chanters and the blessing of the first ROCOR mission in the Municipality of Sta. Maria, Davao del Sur . The chapel was dedicated to St. John Maximovitch in honor of the first Russian Orthodox saint who lived in the country. Fr. Seraphim then went to Tubabao Island where the Russian refugees camped. Before departing for Tubabao, Fr. Seraphim served Divine Liturgy in Palo, Leyte at the ROCOR mission dedicated to St. Nikolai Velimirovich, another ROCOR mission in the Philippines . They performed baptism in Palo to 10 catechumens , and finally they went to Tubabao Island. On the day of the Feast of the Vladimir icon of the Theotokos, a Divine Liturgy was served in the chapel of the Theotokos on Tubabao Island. The new chapel is located on the site of the previous chapel of the Mother of God, built by the Russian refugees who lived on the island from 1949–51; the same chapel in which St. John Maximovitch concelebrated during his stay there. This was the first Liturgy to be served on the island in 62 years .\n\nOn March 2014, the five province Diocese of Sarangani Province, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato and Maguindanao Province of the Philippine Independent Catholic Church (also known as Aglipayans) led by their two bishops Esteban Valmera and Rogelio Ringor together with thirteen (13) other Aglipayan clergy petitioned to His Holiness, Patriarch Kiril of Moscow and All Rus' to convert their entire diocese composed of 28 parishes to the Orthodox Church. Inspired by their moves and motives, another Aglipayan group called \"Aglipayan Christian Church\" under the leadership of their eight bishops and superiors, also write a petition to the Patriarch of Moscow that they also want to convert their entire group and embraced the Orthodox Faith.\n\nThe Moscow Patriarchate then reacted and sent Russian Orthodox missionaries to catechize the thousands of people embracing the Orthodox Faith. Among the missionaries who came to the Philippines are Fr. Kiril Chkarboul from Taiwan, Fr. Stanislav Rasputin and Fr. George Maximov from Russia as well as lay missionaries named Alexy (Russian), Timothy (American) and Sergey (Ukrainian). Presently, the Moscow Patriarchate is doing missions to more or less 60 visible parishes in the Philippines, making it instantly the strongest and largest Orthodox jurisdiction in the Philippines.\n\nOn September 18, 2014, the Moscow Patriarchate is registered in the government of the Philippines as the Philippine Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). On September 26, 2014, the Philippine Orthodox Church Deanery of St. John the Baptist based in Ladol, Alabel, Sarangani Province was registered and on September 29, 2014, the Philippine Orthodox Church Deanery of the Mother of God and Ever Virgin Mary based in Aglipayan Village, Sto. Niño, Tugbok, Davao City was also registered.\n\nThere are also some independent groups in the Philippines that use the term Orthodox in their names but are not a part of the Orthodox Church neither in communion with or are recognized by any of the 15 autocephalous canonical Orthodox jurisdictions throughout the world.\n"}

Her father was Michael (Meyer) Solomon, the first Jew to be honoured with the Freedom of the City of London; her mother was Catherine (Kate) Levy. Rebecca was a sister to her more famous painter brothers Simeon Solomon (1840–1905) and Abraham Solomon (1824–1862). There were five other children in the family: Aaron, Betsy, Isaac, Ellen, and Sylvester.\n\nInitially Rebecca was taught by her older brother Abraham and then took lessons at the Spitalfields School of Design. She exhibited at Royal Academy of Art between 1852 and 1868, and also at the Dudley Gallery and Gambart's French Gallery.\n\nRebecca worked in the studio of John Everett Millais, one of founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the best known example of her work is a version of Millais's \"Christ in the House of his Parents\". She also worked with the second wave Pre-Raphaelite artist, Edward Burne-Jones. As an artist in her own right, she painted works that often reflected gender and social class differences.\n\nRebecca was also active in contemporary social reform movements and in 1859 she joined a group of thirty-eight women artists petitioning the Royal Academy of Art to open its schools to women, which led to the first woman, Laura Herford being admitted to the Academy in 1860.\n\nIn 1886, Rebecca died aged 54, from injuries sustained after being run over by a hansom cab on the Euston Road in central London.\n\nSolomon's artistic style was typical of popular 19th-century painting at the time and falls under the category of genre painting. She used her visual images to critique ethnic, gender and class prejudice in Victorian England. When Rebecca started painting genre scenes, her work demonstrated an observant eye for class, ethnic and gender discrimination. One critic commented on the wholesome, moral and sometimes humanising sentiment in her art, not an uncommon element in Victorian painting. However, Rebecca's Jewish background was probably instrumental in developing her critical consciousness of difference and prejudice. Over the next ten to fifteen years, her artwork explored the plight of women and minorities, and the dominance of class discrimination in English society.\n\nIn the late 1850s Rebecca made a successful transition to classical and historical painting, the most highly valued art within the powerful art academies at the time. True to her vision, she continued to include images that reflected the historical foundations of nineteenth-century social injustice.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She continued working on \"Adventure Time\" until the show's fifth season, whereupon she left in order to focus on \"Steven Universe\". Her last episode for \"Adventure Time\" was \"Simon & Marcy\"; following that episode, working on both series simultaneously \"became impossible to do\". She had also previously encountered difficulty in the production of the \"Adventure Time\" episode \"Bad Little Boy\". Sugar returned temporarily to write the song \"Everything Stays\" for the seventh season miniseries \"Stakes\".\n\nA teaser for a \"Steven Universe\" television movie, called \"Steven Universe: The Movie\", was released during San Diego Comic-Con in the summer of 2018. A release date for the film has yet to be announced.\n\nSugar has discussed the importance of creating LGBT representation and content, especially in children's entertainment. On Cameron Esposito's podcast QUEERY, Sugar stated \"I want to champion LGBTQIA, all of it, content...in G-Rated, family entertainment. I want to do that forever\". She also explained that the show has helped her come to terms with her own identity as a bisexual woman. She believes that early and positive exposure to the LGBT community can help queer identifying children avoid experiencing shame in their own identities.\n\nSugar designed the album cover of \"True Romance\" for Estelle, the voice of Garnet on \"Steven Universe\".

{"id": "7174830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7174830", "title": "Religion in Italy", "text": "Religion in Italy\n\nReligion in Italy is characterised by the predominance of Christianity and an increasing diversity of religious practices, beliefs and denominations. Most Christians in Italy adhere to the Catholic Church, whose headquarters are in Vatican City, Rome.\n\nAccording to the 2012 \"Global Religious Landscape\" survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life (an American think tank), 83.3% of Italy's residents are Christians, 12.4% are irreligious, atheist or agnostic, 3.7% are Muslims and 0.6% adhere to other religions. Other sources give different accounts of Italy's Islamic population, usually around 2%. According to other sources, up to 10% of residents, including both Italian citizens and foreign residents, professes a faith different from Catholicism and the number of atheists and agnostics is rising. Among religious minorities, Islam is the largest, followed by Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, Protestantism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism.\n\nThe country's Catholic patron saints are Francis of Assisi and Catherine of Siena.\n\nThe 2012 \"Global Religious Landscape\" survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life (an American think tank) found that 83.3% of Italy's residents were Christians, 12.4% were irreligious, atheist or agnostic, 3.7% were Muslims and 0.6% adhered to other religions.\n\nRegarding Italian citizens in Italy, according to the 2005 Eurobarometer poll (conducted on behalf of the European Commission), 74% of Italians \"believe there is a God\", 16% \"believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 6% \"do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force\". According to a 2006 survey by (an Italian research centre), Catholics made up 87.8% of Italian citizens, with 36.8% describing themselves as observants. According to the same poll in 2010, those percentages fell to 76.5% and 24.4%, respectively. In 2016 Eurispes found that 71.1% of Italians were Catholic, 5 points down from 2010, but their religious practice was on the rise at 25.4%. According to (another Italian research centre) in 2014, 75% of Italians are Catholic. In the spring of 2016 the Pew Research Center found that 81.7% of the population of Italy was affiliated with the Catholic Church, out of a Christian population of 85.1%; non-religious people comprised the 11.6% of the total population and were divided in atheists (3.1%), agnostics (2.5%) and \"nothing in particular\" (6.0%). Finally, according to a 2017 poll by Ipsos (a France-based research centre), 74.4% of Italians are Catholic (including 27.0% engaged and/or observant), 22.6% are irreligious and 3.0% adhere to other denominations.\n\nAdditionally, there are significant differences in religious beliefs by gender, age and geography. For instance, according to a 2014 Doxa poll: 80% of women defined themselves as \"Catholic\", while 69% of men did so; 80% of the people in the age group above 55 defined themselves as Catholic, while 8% said to be irreligious or atheist and another 7% described themselves as \"without religious reference\"; among people aged between 15 and 34, percentages were 68%, 13% and 12%, respectively; in Southern Italy, 85%, 6% and 5%, respectively; in the North-West, 62%, 16% and 13%, respectively.\n\nThe headquarters of the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church, the State of Vatican City (see also Holy See), is an enclave within the city of Rome and, thus, the Italian territory. The Church's world leader, the Pope, is the Bishop of Rome, hence the special relationship between Italians and the Church—and the latter's entanglement with Italian politics (see Lateran Treaty and the section below on religion and politics).\n\nThe current Pope is Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who, before his election in 2013, is from Argentina and was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1998 to his installation. Francis is the third non-Italian Pope in a row, after John Paul II (1978–2005) from Poland and Benedict XVI (2005–2013) from Germany.\n\nMost of the leading Catholic religious orders, including the Jesuits, the Salesians, the Franciscans, the Capuchin Franciscans, the Benedectines, the Dominicans, the Divine Word Missionaries, the Redemptorists, the Conventual Franciscans and the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, have their headquarters in Rome too.\n\nThe Italian territory is divided in 225 Catholic dioceses (whose bishops have been organised, since 1952, in the politically influential Italian Episcopal Conference, CEI) and, according to Church statistics (which do not consider current active members), 96% of the country's population was baptised as Catholic.\n\nEcclesial life is somewhat vibrant and, despite secularization, some of the most active movements and associations are Catholic, including organisations as diverse as Catholic Action (AC), the Italian Catholic Association of Guides and Scouts (AGESCI), Communion and Liberation (CL), Neocatechumenal Way, the Focolare Movement, the Christian Associations of Italian Workers (ACLI), the Community of Sant'Egidio, etc., most of which have been involved in social activities and have frequently supplied Italian politics with their members.\n\nItaly's current President, Sergio Mattarella, and former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, have been AC and AGESCI leaders, respectively, while the current President of the CEI, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, has been a long-time AGESCI assistant.\n\nOther than that the Latin-rite Catholic Church, Italy has two more native churches: the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, one of the twenty-two Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with the Pope, and the Waldensian Evangelical Church, a Christian movement originated from Lyon in the late 12th century and turned Calvinist denomination since the Protestant Reformation (see also: Waldensians). The two churches include the majority of the population in Piana degli Albanesi, Sicily and Lungro, Calabria, and the so-called \"Waldensian Valleys\" (Val Pellice, Val Chisone and Valle Germanasca) of western Piedmont, respectively.\n\nMost historical or, to borrow an American term, mainline Protestants, including the Waldensians (30,000 members), the Baptists (Baptist Evangelical Christian Union of Italy, 20,000), the mostly German-speaking Lutherans (Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy, 7,000), the Methodists (Methodist Evangelical Church in Italy, 5,000) and minor Calvinist and Presbyterian communities, are affiliated to the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy, along with the Italian section of The Salvation Army and some minor Evangelical and Pentecostal denominations. In the Protestant context, it is also worth mentioning the Evangelical Christian Church of the Brethren (21,000) and the Italian section of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (20,000).\n\nItaly is home to around 45,000 Jews, who are one of the most ancient Jewish communities in the world. The Jewish presence dates to the pre-Christian Roman period and has continued, despite periods of extreme persecution and expulsions from parts of the country from time to time, until the present. Native Italian Jews, who form the core of the community in Rome, practice the Italian rite, but there are also Ashkenazi Jews, who have settled in the North, especially in the lands of the former Republic of Venice (Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and eastern Lombardy) and Piedmont, since the late Middle Ages, and Sephardi Jews, who have established themselves mostly in Livorno, Florence, Venice and several cities of Emilia, after their expulsion from the Kingdom of Naples. The Jewish community of Milan, the country's second largest after Rome's, is the most international in character and composition, notably including a substantial number of Mizrahi Jews originating from the Middle East. The twenty-one Jewish local communities are affiliated to the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, which counts 25,000 members.\n\nImmigration has brought to Italy many religious minorities, especially Islam and Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy. By the numbers, in 2015 the country was home to around 1,850,000 Muslims and virtually 1,700,000 Orthodox Christians. Among the latter, it is especially relevant the Romanian Orthodox Church, which has a diocese of Italy, and the Greek Orthodox Church (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople), whose Archdiocese of Italy and Malta and Exarchate of Southern Europe has its see in Venice. Massimo Introvigne, founder and director of CESNUR (an Italian think tank devoted to religious studies) and main author of \"L'enciclopedia delle religioni in Italia\", predicts that, thanks to continued immigration from Eastern Europe, Orthodox Christians could soon become the country's second largest religious group, overtaking Muslims.\n\nAlso Protestantism, especially in its evangelical and Pentecostal forms, is on the rise: Introvigne recalls how Giorgio Bouchard, a Waldensian pastor, told him that \"when he was born, the typical Italian Protestant was a man, lived in Piedmont, had a last name like Bouchard and was a Waldensian\", while \"today, the typical Italian Protestant believer is a woman, lives in Campania or Sicily, is named Esposito and is a Pentecostal.\" Not surprisingly the Assemblies of God in Italy (150,000 members), the Federation of Pentecostal Churches (50,000) and several smaller evangelical/Pentecostal denominations have the majority of their communities in the South. Additionally, several foreign-born churches, especially African initiated churches, most of which evangelical and/or Pentecostal, are taking roots in the country, especially in the North.\n\nAmong the fastest-growing new religious denominations in Italy a special place is held by the Jehovah's Witnesses (who count around 420,000 faithful, including both members and other people regularly attending the Congregation's meetings). Then, come four faiths professed mainly by immigrants: Buddhists (260,000), Hindus (180,000), Sikhs (150,000), and Latter-day Saints (26,000). According to Caritas Italiana (the CEI's charitable arm), in 2015 the immigrant population was 53.8% Christian (30.5% Orthodox, 18.3% Catholic, 4.3% Protestant and 0.7% other), 32.2% Muslim, 2.9% Hindu and 2.2% Buddhist. According to the same source, in 2012 Italy was home to 850 \"African Neo-Pentecostal churches\", 750 foreign-language Catholic communities, 655 mosques or other Islamic houses of worship, 355 Orthodox parishes, 126 Buddhist temples, 37 Sikh ones and 2 Hindu ones. The Mosque of Rome is one of the largest outside Muslim world.\n\nThe religious composition of the Italian population (2015 estimate: 60,795,612 people, including 55,782,575 Italian citizens and 5,014,037 foreign residents) is shown in the table below. The primary data source is the aforementioned CESNUR, which includes the data on foreign residents provided by Caritas Italiana.\n\nDue to the lack of a single, coherent and statistically accurate source, the figures are to be taken with a grain of salt and sums do not necessarily add up. The number of Catholics among Italian citizens is calculated using the latest Eurispes poll, released in January 2016: according to the survey 71.1% of Italians are Catholic. The numbers of Christians are consequently calculated, including that number and the data provided by CESNUR and Caritas Italiana.\n\nReligious denominations which have a relevant presence in the country, but for which there are no data, are included in the table.\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=left rowspan=2 valign=center|Religion / denomination\n!colspan=\"2\" align=center valign=top|Italian citizens\n!colspan=\"2\" align=center valign=top|Foreign residents\n!colspan=\"2\" align=center valign=top|Total population\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=left valign=top|Totals\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=right valign=top|55,782,575\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=right valign=top|100.0\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=right valign=top|5,014,037\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=right valign=top|100.0\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=right valign=top|60,795,612\n!rowspan=\"1\" align=right valign=top|100.0\n\nReligious practice, especially church attendance, is still very high in Italy, when compared to the average Western European country.\n\nThe Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) found in 2015 that 29.0% of the population went to church, synagogue, mosque, temple or another house of worship on a weekly basis. The share of practising believers was higher in Southern Italy (33.5%) than the North-West (27.7%), the North-East (26.8%) and the Centre (25.0%). Religious practice was particularly high in Sicily (37.3%); in Campania (35.4%), Calabria (34.8%), Apulia (32.6%) and Molise (30.9%) in the South; in Veneto (32.4%), once dubbed \"white Veneto\" because of Christian Democracy's strength there (white being the party's official colour), and Trentino (31.4%) in the North-East; in Marche (31.6%) in the Centre. It was particularly low in Liguria (18.6%), Aosta Valley (21.0%), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (21.9%), and Sardinia (21.9%) and the so-called \"red regions\" (long-time strongholds of the left-wing/centre-left, from the Italian Communist Party to the current Democratic Party), especially Tuscany (19.4%) and Emilia-Romagna (21.6%).\n\nAfter Italian unification, predominantly supported by secular and anti-clerical forces, and especially the capture of Rome in 1870, which marked the final defeat of the Papal States by the Kingdom of Italy and gave start to the so-called Roman Question over the temporal power of the Pope, Catholics largely self-excluded themselves from active politics. As a result, all the main political parties and parliamentary groupings were secular in character until the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1905 the Italian Catholic Electoral Union was formed in order to coordinate the participation of Catholic voters in the Italian electoral contests. The party had minor but significant results and, under the so-called Gentiloni pact in 1913, it entered in alliance with the establishment Liberals.\n\nAfter World War I, Catholics organised the Italian People's Party, as part of the Christian democracy movement.\n\nDuring the Fascist regime, the Roman Question was settled through the Lateran Treaty, signed by the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy in 1929. These gave birth to the State of Vatican City. Fascism persecuted religious minorities: on 9 April 1935, Guido Buffarini Guidi outlawed the Pentecostal faith, and during 1938-1939 Jews were targeted by the infamous racial laws and were victims of genocide in the context of the Holocaust.\n\nThe Italian resistance movement saw the participation of Catholics, Protestants (Waldensians were especially active in the Action Party), and Jews (through the Jewish Brigade) alike. In 1943 a group of Catholics, including several former Populars and many members of Catholic Action (a widespread lay association), formed the aforementioned Christian Democracy party and, with Alcide De Gasperi, led the Italian provisional government since 1945.\n\nAfter World War II, the Catholic Church, after some initial reservations (Pope Pius XII favoured a solution similar to that of the Church in Francoist Spain, while some cardinals wanted a plurality of Catholic parties, possibly including a communist one), actively supported De Gasperi's Christian Democracy, a Catholic-inspired but formally non-denominational party, and the so-called \"political unity of Catholics\". From 1946 to 1992 all Prime Ministers but two were Christian Democrats and Catholics.\n\nHowever, both Waldensians and the Jews have played an important role in Italian politics. While there have been several Catholic-inspired parties also after Christian Democracy's dissolution in 1994 (from Italian People's Party–1994 to Democracy is Freedom, from the Christian Democratic Centre to the Union of the Centre, from Forza Italia–1994 to Forza Italia–2013, Waldensians have been usually active in \"secular\" parties, especially the Italian Socialist Party, Italian Communist Party and, more recently, the Democratic Party, which is home to former Christian Democrats too. More recently, a group of conservative Pentecostals set up the Extended Christian Pact party. Also the Jews have been active mostly in \"secular\" parties, but recently have been more divided between the Democrats and Forza Italia.\n\nThe Constitution of Italy recognises the Catholic Church and the state as \"independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere\" (article 7), in respect of the principle of separation of church and state. In particular, the Lateran Treaty of 1929, which gave a special status to the Church, is recognised and modifications \"accepted by both parties\" to such treaty are allowed without the need of constitutional amendments. In fact, the treaty was later modified by a new agreement between the state and the Church in 1984 under which Catholicism ceased to be the state religion. Freedom of religion is also recognised, with \"all religious denominations\" having \"the right of self-organisation according to their own statutes, provided these do not conflict with Italian law\"; \"[t]heir relations with the state are regulated by law, based on agreements with\ntheir respective representatives\" (article 8). Since 1984, the Italian government has signed thirteen such agreements and eleven have been approved by the Italian Parliament and signed into law, including the following:\n\nAdditionally, there is one agreement endorsed by the government, but not yet signed into law:\n\nUnder the Eight per thousand system, Italian taxpayers can choose to whom devolve a compulsory 8‰ = 0.8% (eight per thousand) from their annual income tax return between an organised religion recognised by Italy or, alternatively, to a social assistance scheme run by the government. In the latest available year (2012), 15,226,291 taxpayers chose the Catholic Church, 562,313 the Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, 72,238 the Union of Jewish Communities in Italy, 47,859 the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy, 44,229 the Evangelical Christian Churches Assemblies of God in Italy, and 29,448 the Italian Union of Seventh-Day Adventist Christian Churches. The Eight per thousand tax has thus disproportionately helped some minor denominations, particularly the Waldensians.\n\n"}

At age 6, she began playing the piano, which she learned from the nuns at Sisters of St. Joseph Academy. She played in a country band in high school. Sylvia eventually graduated from the Conservatory of Music in Toronto. She later left the university of Toronto with a teaching degree and a masters in languages and while in school, she worked at a small local radio station and hosted her own radio show while in college in Toronto.\n\nShe decided she really wanted to try show business, and went out on the road. While she played in Indiana, a bandleader named Barney Rapp landed her audition as a staff vocalist, and before long Saucy went on the air at WLW in Cincinnati. At the time it was clear channel and could be heard all over the country.\n\nSylvia was a staff singer; at the time two young sisters also sang at the station Rosemary Clooney and Betty Clooney. Big names dropped by the \"Sylvia Show\" like Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington. At the same time, Sylvia played a steady gig at the La Normandie Restaurant for five years and eventually moved to Detroit, MI with her first husband Mike Stoun where she worked comedy in her act. She toured off and on and in Arizona, a promoter billed her as \"Saucy Sylvia\" on the marquee, giving Sylvia her first new name. After her husband died, she continued performing across the country. She recorded two albums \"Sex is the thing that started it all\" and \"0069\". She eventually moved to Newport, Rhode Island where she met her second husband Mike Mureddu.\n\nSaucy was known to engage her audience directly, making them part of the act. Women from all over the world (estimated over ½ million) wear \"I walk for Sauce\" buttons announcing their affiliation of the Saucy Sylvia fan club. The Walk for Sauce fan club song was sung and the celebration continued through almost three hours without a break. Saucy's memory was one of the things that made her so special. Part of her act involved asking audience members for their names and where they were from. She would then include each person's name in songs and comedy, no matter how large the audience. What was intriguing was her ability to capture all ages from college to seniors.\n\nFor Saucy, work was a labor of love. Saucy became the President of the Newport Federation of Musicians. She retained that role for more than 20 years working to finding work for area musicians in films and large venue shows. Saucy played the Auld Mug Lounge at the Goat Island Hotel which changed names ownership from Sheraton to the Double Tree, and now Hyatt. Saucy is known as an icon in Newport, Rhode Island and the Auld Mug lounge was her room for over 30 years where she entertained millions from around the work including national and international dignitaries and international celebrities. Saucy had one of the last live music radio shows \"The Miss Saucy Sylvia Show\" which aired on WADK every Sunday for 26 years. When she was first approached by the radio station to do the show, her husband Mike was all for it and was trying to convince her to say yes. She agreed on one condition. He wrote the show each week. Mike wrote, produced and directed and even became part of the act. The show went on for 26 years starting in 1976. The show featured many artist wither locally or coming in town for one of the music festivals. Saucy was inducted in the Newport Jazz Hall of Fame in 2002 along with Ella Fitzgerald and George Wein for their achievements.\n\nSaucy was very active in the American federation of Musicians and was the President of the Newport, Rhode Island Federation of Musicians. She started the music scholarship program for the Newport public schools. She won many awards for her achievements including proclamations from both the City of Newport and the State of Rhode Island for her work. In 2014, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter being widowed for three years, Saucy married Mike Mureddu, the father of eight children. Murredu died in May 2013. The couple had 21 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren. Sylvia died on May 25, 2017 at the age of 96.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

(The word enlightenment used here refers to the Indian notion of enlightenment.) The Shatsthala comprises the \"Bhakta Sthala\", \"Maheshwara Sthala\", \"Prasadi Sthala\", \"Pranalingi Sthala\", \"Sharana Sthala\" and the \"Aikya Sthala\".

{"id": "1766221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1766221", "title": "Sun dance", "text": "Sun dance\n\nThe sun dance is a ceremony practiced by some indigenous people of United States of America and Canada, primarily those of the Plains cultures. It usually involves the community gathering together to pray for healing. Individuals make personal sacrifices on behalf of the community. \n\nAfter European colonization of the Americas, and with the formation of the Canadian and United States governments, both countries passed laws intended to suppress indigenous cultures and encourage assimilation to majority-European culture. They banned indigenous ceremonies and, in many schools and other areas, prohibited Indigenous people from speaking their native languages. In some cases they were not allowed to visit sacred sites when these had been excluded from the territory of reservations. \n\nThe sun dance was one of the prohibited ceremonies, as was the potlatch of the Pacific Northwest peoples. Canada lifted its prohibition against the practice of the full ceremony in 1951. But in the United States, Indigenous peoples were not allowed to openly practice the sun dance or other sacred ceremonies until the late 1970s, after they gained renewed sovereignty and civil rights following a period of high activism, including legal challenges to the government. Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) in 1978, which was enacted to protect basic civil liberties, and to protect and preserve the traditional religious rights and cultural practices of American Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts, and Native Hawaiians.\n\nSeveral features are common to the ceremonies held by sundance cultures. These include dances and songs passed down through many generations, the use of a traditional drum, a sacred fire, praying with a ceremonial pipe, fasting from food and water before participating in the dance, and, in some cases, the ceremonial piercing of skin and a trial of physical endurance. Certain plants are picked and prepared for use during the ceremony. \n\nTypically, the sun dance is a gruelling ordeal for the dancers, a physical and spiritual test that they offer in sacrifice for their people. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, young men dance around a pole to which they are fastened by \"rawhide thongs pegged through the skin of their chests.\" \n\nWhile not all sun dance ceremonies include piercing, the object of the sun dance is to offer personal sacrifice for the benefit of one's family and community. The dancers fast for many days, in the open air and whatever weather occurs. \n\nAt most ceremonies, family members and friends stay in the surrounding camp and pray in support of the dancers. Much time and energy by the entire community are needed to conduct the sun dance gatherings and ceremonies. Communities plan and organize for at least a year to prepare for the ceremony. Usually, one leader or a small group of leaders are in charge of the ceremony, but many elders help out and advise. A group of helpers do many of the tasks required to prepare for the ceremony.\n\nAs this is a sacred ceremony, people are typically reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given a long history of cultural misappropriation, Indigenous people are suspicious that non-Indigenous people may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.\n\nIn 1993, responding to what they believed was a frequent desecration of the sun dance and other Lakota sacred ceremonies, US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota nations held \"the Lakota Summit V\". It was an international gathering of about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota. They unanimously passed the following 'Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality':\n\"Whereas sacrilegious \"sundances\" for non-Indians are being conducted by charlatans and cult leaders who promote abominable and obscene imitations of our sacred Lakota sundance rites; ... We hereby and henceforth declare war against all persons who persist in exploiting, abusing, and misrepresenting the sacred traditions and spiritual practices of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people.\" - Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (1993)\n\nIn 2003, the 19th-Generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe of the Lakota asked non-Indigenous people to stop attending the sun dance (\"Wi-wayang-wa-c'i-pi\" in Lakota); he stated that all can pray in support, but that only Indigenous people should approach the altars. This statement was supported by keepers of sacred bundles and traditional spiritual leaders from the Cheyenne, Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota nations, who issued a proclamation that non-Indigenous people would be banned from sacred altars and the Seven Sacred Rites, including and especially the sun dance, effective March 9, 2003 onward:\nThe \"Wi-wanyang-wa-c'i-p\"i (Sundance Ceremony): The only participants allowed in the centre will be Native People. The non-Native people need to understand and respect our decision. If there have been any unfinished commitments to the sundance and non-Natives have concern for this decision; they must understand that we have been guided through prayer to reach this resolution. Our purpose for the sundance is for the survival of the future generations to come, first and foremost. If the non-Natives truly understand this purpose, they will also understand this decision and know that by their departure from this \"Ho-c'o-ka\" (our sacred altar) is their sincere contribution to the survival of our future generations.\nThough only some nations' sun dances include the body piercings, the Canadian government outlawed that feature of the sun dance in 1895. It is unclear how often this law was actually enforced; in at least one instance, police are known to have given their permission for the ceremony to be conducted. The First Nations people simply conducted many ceremonies quietly and in secret. In 1951 Canada lifted its ban on the ceremony. The sun dance is practiced annually on many reserves and reservations in Canada.\n\nAlthough the Government of Canada, through the Department of Indian Affairs (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada), persecuted sun dance practitioners and attempted to suppress the dance, the ceremony itself was never officially prohibited. But Indian agents, based on directives from their superiors, did routinely interfere with, discourage, and disallow sun dances on many Canadian plains reserves from 1882 until the 1940s. Despite this, sun dance practitioners, such as the Plains Cree, Saulteaux, and Blackfoot, continued to hold sun dances throughout the persecution period. Some practised the dance in secret, others with permissions from their agents, and others without the body piercing. The Cree and Saulteaux have conducted at least one Rain Dance (with similar elements) each year since 1880 somewhere on the Canadian Plains. In 1951, government officials revamped the Indian Act, dropping the prohibition against practices of flesh-sacrificing and gift-giving.\n\nIn most sun dance cultures, it is forbidden to film ceremony or prayer. Few images exist of authentic ceremonies. Many First Nations people believe that when money or cameras enter, the spirits leave, so no photo conveys an authentic ceremony. But the Kainai Nation in Alberta permitted filming of their sun dance in the late 1950s. This was released as the documentary \"Circle of the Sun\" (1960), produced by the National Film Board of Canada . Manitoba archival photos show that the ceremonies have been consistently practised since at least the early 1900s.\n\n"}

Some of these are made by Christians in order to promote a specific doctrine or theological perspective, such as evolutionary creation. Other variations are sometimes intended for the purpose of satire. Both the traditional ichthys fish as well as its variations, are often seen adorning the bumpers or trunks of automobiles, often in the form of adhesive badges made of chrome-colored plastic. While the fish symbol dates back millennia, having its origins in pre-Christian religious imagery, the many variations known today first appeared in the 1980s.\n\nAn ancient Hellenistic Christian slogan espoused the Greek acronym/acrostic () for \" (\"), which translates into English as 'Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour'; the Greek word translating to 'fish' in English. The first appearances of fish symbols as adopted in Christian art and literature date to the 2nd century CE. Some modern fish symbol variations, called the \"Jesus fish\", contain the English word \"Jesus\" in the center, or are empty entirely.\n\nJeroen Temperman states that there are \"variations on this Ichthys symbol. Some variations add feet to the fish and inscribe \"Darwin\" in the body. Others make reference to sushi, sharks, the food chain, fast food, the devil or death. How are we to interpret these variations? These adaptations are themselves susceptible to multiple interpretations, ranging from humour to critique, to mocking derision, to blasphemy.\" Among such parodies are the \"Darwin fish\", often displayed by \"atheists and freethinkers\" in the United States, and the \"Fish-hungry shark\", displayed by Muslims in Egypt.\n\nThe Darwin fish is a fish symbol with \"evolved\" legs and feet attached, and often with the word \"Darwin\" inside (like the ΙΧΘΥΣ or Jesus found in some Christian versions). It symbolizes the scientific theories of evolution, for which Charles Darwin laid a foundation, in contrast with creationism, which is a hallmark of American Christianity. The Darwin fish bears a stylized resemblance to Tiktaalik or Ichthyostega, which are major examples of a transitional fossil of the first tetrapod that moved from sea to dry land during the Late Devonian period.\n\nClosely related to the original Darwin fish symbol is a fish with legs, the word \"evolve\", and a hand that is holding a wrench. Another variant, the Darwin Awards fish, is a \"dead fish\" floating belly-up with the words \"Darwin Awards\" inside.\n\nChristians, as well as the non-religious, have either responded to or made spin-offs of the Darwin fish. A design supporting a version of Old Earth Creationism that rejects biological evolution was made with a larger Jesus fish eating the Darwin fish. Sometimes, the larger fish contains letters that spell the word \"Truth\". A further development shows two fish, one with legs and labeled \"I evolved\", the other legless and labeled \"You didn't\".\n\nAnother variant has a Darwin fish with an open mouth, carrying away a smaller, dead Jesus fish by its tail. Other variants depict an \"Evolution\" or \"Darwin\" fish swallowing an \"ΙΧΘΥΣ\", \"Jesus\" or \"Truth\" fish; another version has a \"Science\" fish swallowing a \"Myth\" fish. Supporters of the theological concept of evolutionary creationism, also known as theistic evolution, have responded with a hybrid variant of the Jesus fish in which the word \"Jesus\" is written inside an ichthus fish with stylized feet.\n\nStill another variation has been offered by people who see no conflict between Christian belief and the evidence of science regarding evolution: a depiction of the Jesus fish and the Darwin fish kissing. Such images have been sold as bumper stickers and have also been improvised. The writer Michael Dowd, author of the book \"Thank God for Evolution\", has been among the more prominent promoters of this image.\n\nRhetorical scholar Thomas Lessl conducted a survey of users of the Darwin fish emblem. Based on their responses, he interprets the symbol as scientific \"blackface\", a parody that is one part mockery and one part imitation. Lessl suggests that the \"various ideas that users plainly compress into this emblem are suggestive of scientism\", and adds that the Darwin fish is an advertisement for the conflict thesis, an idea, which according to Lessl, is \"now thoroughly discredited by historians\".\n\nJonah Goldberg, in the \"Los Angeles Times\" criticized the Darwin fish, stating that:\n\nIn the \"National Review\", Goldberg further stated that \"one of the problems with the Darwin Fish is that it assumes all Jesus Fishers are Creationists. And I agree that this is one of the problems. But it is not the only one. The 'evolve' fish, I think has a double-meaning in that it suggests Christians should evolve from Christianity. I also think mucking about with the symbol of the fish is itself offensive because the symbol is sacred and has no secular counterpart.\"\n\nThe Science Fish is a parody of the traditional ichthys symbol that includes the addition of rocket stabilizer fins and is usually mounted or displayed at an angle as if launching into space.\n\nThe \"Trek Fish\" was designed by Eugene \"Rod\" Roddenberry Jr., the son of \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry. His motivations for doing so were as follows:\n\nAlthough still fish-shaped, with the legend \"TREK\" inside, the \"fins\" parody the iconic shape of the USS \"Enterprise\".\n\nAdvocates of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarianism, which was created in 2005 to protest the decision by the Kansas Board of Education to require the teaching of intelligent design, have designed their own version of the fish symbol, with the Flying Spaghetti Monster's characteristic \"noodly appendages\" and eye stalks. Another more complicated design features the previously-mentioned \"Jesus fish eating Darwin fish\" with the Flying Spaghetti Monster in turn attacking the Jesus fish.\n\nCthulhu is a fictional giant creature, one of the Great Old Ones in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. It is often cited for the extreme descriptions given of its appearance, size, and the abject terror that it invokes. Cthulhu is often referred to in science fiction and fantasy circles as a tongue-in-cheek shorthand for extreme horror or evil. It also has been depicted in a parody of the ichthys.\n\nThe German \"Artgemeinschaft\" group, promoting racist neopaganism, uses a registered symbol showing an eagle catching an ichthys fish.\n\nIn Egypt, many Coptic Orthodox Christians display the fish symbol on their vehicles as a sign of their faith, and Islamic fundamentalists responded with \"fish-hungry sharks\", some including the phrase \"no god but Allah\" within the body of the shark. One Egyptian Muslim was quoted in \"The Day\" as saying \"The Christians had the fish so we responded with the shark. If they want to portray themselves as weak fishes, OK. We are the strongest.\"\n\nA humoristic parody of the symbol is a fish with the word \"Gefilte\" (; from , \"filled fish\") written in letters stylized to resemble Hebrew calligraphy. This refers to gefilte fish, a common dish in Jewish cuisine; used on an automobile, it usually indicates that the driver of the car is culturally Jewish, if not religiously.\n\nA parody commonly seen in areas populated by those of Norwegian descent, is a fish containing the word \"Lutefisk\".\n\nAnother parody shows only the lower tail fin, and contains the words \"n'Chips\", a play on \"Fish and Chips\".\n\n\"Sushi\" written inside the fish is one more variant.\n"}
{"id": "29583069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29583069", "title": "Vegoia", "text": "Vegoia\n\nVegoia (Etruscan: \"Vecu\") is a nymph and/or sibyl within the Etruscan religious framework who is responsible for writing some parts of their large and complex set of sacred books, of initiating the Etruscan people to the arts, originating the rules and rituals of land marking, and presiding over the observance, respect and preservation of boundaries. Vegoia is also known as Vecu, Vecui, Vecuvia, Vegoe or else Begoe or even Bigois as it sometimes appears. (see: List of Etruscan mythological figures).\n\nThe actual Etruscan religious system remains mostly obscure. The Etruscan language is poorly understood, due to the lack of many bilingual documents comparable to the Rosetta stone. Therefore, the ancient Etruscan documents (8th, 7th, 6th centuries BCE) that would reflect their own proper conceptions do not yield much. Moreover, during the later period (5th through 1st centuries BCE) Etruscan civilization heavily incorporated elements of Greek civilization and eventually diluted itself in the Greco-Roman mixture of their powerful Roman neighbours. Lastly, while they formalized their religious concepts and practices in a series of \"sacred books\", most are no longer extant and known only through commentaries or quotes by Roman authors of the late 1st century:\nand hence may be biased.\n\nTwo mythological figures have been set by the Etruscans as presiding over the production of their sacred books: a female figure, Vegoia, and a monstrous childlike figure gifted with the knowledge and prescience of an ancient sage, Tages. Those books are known from Latin authors under a classification pertaining to their content according to their mythological author (whether delivered through speeches or lectures, such as Tages, or inspiration).\n\nThe figure of Vegoia is almost entirely blurred in the mists of the past. Vegoia is mostly known from the traditions of the Etruscan city of Chiusi (Latin: Clusium; Etruscan: Clevsin; Umbrian: Camars) (now in the province of Siena). The revelations of the prophetess Vegoia are designated as the \"Libri Vegoici\", which included the \"Libri Fulgurales\" and part of the \"Libri Rituales\", especially the \"Libri Fatales\".\n\nShe is barely designated as a “nymph”, as the writer of the \"Libri Fulgurales\", which give the keys to interpreting the meaning of lightning strokes sent by the deities (using a cartography of the sky, which, as a sort of property division, was attributed to Vegoia; this assignment of sectors of the horizon to various deities is paralleled in the microcosm that is the liver of a sacrificed animal. The sacred divisions seem also to have a correspondence in the measurement and division of land, which since the very dawn of Etruscan history obeyed religious rules), as teaching the correct methods of measuring space in the \"Libri Rituales\", and as lording over their observation under threat of some dire woe or malediction, thus establishing her as a power presiding over land property and land property rights, laws and contracts (as distinct of commercial contracts laws).\n\nShe is also indicated as having revealed the laws relative to hydraulic works, thus having a special relationship to \"tamed\" water.\n\nSuch an imposing system of \"revealing\" and \"sacred texts\" would be expected to have left some imprint on the neighboring italic peoples. Indeed, there is ample evidence of the Etruscan culture having heavily permeated their less-advanced Latin and Sabine neighbours' communities. This is for instance reflected in the Etruscan alphabet, itself derived from the Greek one, being solidly established as having inspired the Latin one. Also, the principles and architecture rules of their decimal numerals system are likewise at the origin of the Roman one, actually a simplified version (see: Etruscan numerals). Plus the symbols of supreme power (see Etruscan civilization), or the structure of the calendar in Rome (“itis” or “itus”, the Etruscan notion for the middle of the lunar month has given the Roman \"Ides\", \"Kalendae\", the Etruscan word for calendar, has given \"calendae\", the first day of the month; the Etruscan \"Craeci\" has given the word “Greeks” while those people named themselves \"Hellenes\", etc.).\n\nWhile the Roman religion has precious little written bases, they nonetheless had a kind of very abstruse set of texts known as the Sibylline Books, which were under the exclusive control of special 'priests' (duumviri, then decemviri) and were solely resorted to in times of ultimate crisis; the devolution of these 'books' to the Romans was, through some rocambolesque scene, attributed to Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the legendary kings of Rome, himself an Etruscan.\n\nLikewise, one may suspect that the legend of Egeria, the nymph that inspired Numa Pompilius (the second legendary king of Rome that succeeded its founder Romulus; Latin \"numen\" designates \"the expressed will of a deity\") the establishment of the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome, also associated with \"sacred books\". Numa is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in \"sacred books\" that he made bury with him. When some chance accident brought them back to light some 400 years later, they were deemed by the Senate inappropriate for disclosure to the people and destroyed by their order. What made them inappropriate was certainly of \"political\" nature but apparently has not been handed down by Valerius Antias, the source that Plutarch was using. They were the same that interpreted for him the abstruse omens of gods (episode of the omen from Faunus), and also associated to beneficial water, would have some link with the figure of Vegoia.\n"}
{"id": "19559106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19559106", "title": "Virgin of Mercy", "text": "Virgin of Mercy\n\nThe Virgin of Mercy is a subject in Christian Art, showing a group of people sheltering for protection under the outspread cloak, or pallium of the Virgin Mary. It was especially popular in Italy from the 13th to 16th centuries, often as a specialised form of votive portrait, and is also found in other countries and later art, especially Catalonia and Latin America. \n\nUsually the Virgin is standing alone, though if angels hold up the cloak, she is free to hold the infant Christ. The people sheltered normally kneel, and are of necessity shown usually at a much smaller scale. These may represent all members of Christian society, with royal crowns, mitres and a papal tiara in the front rows, or represent the local population. The subject was often commissioned by specific groups such as families, confraternities, guilds or convents or abbeys, and then the figures represent these specific groups, as shown by their dress, or by the 15th century individual portraits. Sometimes arrows rain down from above, which the cloak prevents from reaching the people.\n\nIn Italian it is known as the Madonna della Misericordia (Madonna of Mercy), in German as the Schutzmantelmadonna (Sheltering-cloak Madonna), in Spanish Virgen de la Merced or Nuestra Señora de la Merced (Our Lady of Mercy), in French as the Vièrge au Manteau or Vierge de Miséricorde (Virgin with a cloak or Virgin of Mercy) in Catalan as the Mare de Déu de la Mercè and in Greek Orthodox Catholicism as Panagia tou Eleous or Merketta (Μερκέττα).\n\nProbably the oldest version known is a small panel by Duccio of c. 1280, with three Franciscan friars under the cloak, in the Pinacoteca in Siena. Here the Virgin sits, only one side of the cloak is extended, and the Virgin holds her child on her knee with her other hand. \n\nA miniature of c. 1274 from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia also shows a variant of the motif, as do 13th century paintings in Cyprus, such as an icon in the Byzantine Museum in the Archbishop's Palace, Nicosia. \n\nThe common factor between all these is the influence and presence of Western mendicant orders, especially the Franciscans, who appear to have been important in spreading this form of iconography.\n\nThe immediate inspiration of the iconography comes from a vision reported in the \"Dialogus Miraculorum\" of the Cistercian Caesarius of Heisterbach which circulated widely from about 1230. Beyond that, the origins of the image may relate to rituals and a vision or miracle connected with a famous icon in the Blachernae Church in Constantinople. \n\nThis gave rise in the Byzantine Rite (Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches) to the Pokrov icons, although the image is not found in Byzantine art. In the Pokrov icons the thought is similar, but the image is usually less literal — the veil with which the Virgin protects mankind is small and held either in her hands or by two angels, though the Western version with a larger cloak is found in some Eastern Orthodox icons, one of a number of Western iconographic features that infiltrated Orthodox art, whether in Cyprus under the Crusaders or 16th-century Eastern Europe. \n\nThe image also fits well with the words of the ancient hymn \"Sub tuum praesidium\", probably composed in the 3rd century, and used in most pre-Reformation churches of both the Western and Eastern churches.\n\nUsually the image, whether in sculpture or painting, stands by itself. Nevertheless, in the most famous example, the Madonna della Misericordia altarpiece (1445-1462) in Sansepolcro by Piero della Francesca, the subject is the central panel of a large altarpiece, with a smaller Crucifixion above it, and many other panels. \n\nThe image came in for special derision from Martin Luther, who compared it to \"a hen with her chicks\".\n\nIn the Spanish \"The Virgin of the Navigators\" of the 1530s, where those sheltered are a group connected with the Spanish voyages to the New World, including American indigenous peoples, the group is shown over a panorama of ships at rest in a harbour.\n\nIn Germany during the Middle Ages, an almost identical image was used featuring Saint Ursula, usually holding her attribute of an arrow to avoid confusion.\n\nIn this pictorial tradition, also the iconography of the Works of mercy alludes sometimes to the Virgin of Mercy, such as Caravaggio in his huge painting in Naples, because in 1606/07 it was commissioned for the church of the Confraternita del Pio Monte della Misericordia.\n\nThe liturgical feast day of Our Lady of Mercy is celebrated annually in the Latin Catholic calendar on September 24.\n\nOur Lady of Mercy is the co-patroness, along with St. Mark, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Venice in Florida.\n\nChurches dedicated to her include the cathedral of Guasdualito in Venezuela and the National Shrine of La Virgen de las Mercedes, also known as \"El Santo Cerro\" in La Vega, Dominican Republic. \n\nThe term \"Virgin of Mercy\" is found in a number of other contexts not directly related to the image. It is a common translation of the Eleusa type of icon of the Virgin and Child. \n\nThe Virgin of Mercy is patron saint of Barcelona, celebrated in the week-long La Mercè festival each year, but in this role is not especially associated with this type of image. The Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, founded, also in Barcelona, in 1218 by Saint Peter Nolasco, has used the image but is not particularly associated with it.\n\nIn Santería, the Virgin of Mercy is syncretized with Obatala.\n\n"}
