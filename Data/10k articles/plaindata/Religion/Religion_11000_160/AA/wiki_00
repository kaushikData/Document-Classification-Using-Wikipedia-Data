In 1599 he moved to Palestine and settled in Hebron.\nIn Hebron, Azulai wrote a commentary on the Zohar under the title \"Kiryat Arba\" (City of Arba (in Hebrew four); Gen. xxiii.2). The plague of 1619 drove him from his new home, and while in Gaza, where he found refuge, he wrote his Kabalistic work \"Chesed le-Abraham\" (Mercy to Abraham; Micah vii.20). It was published after the author's death by Meshullam Zalman ben Abraham Berak of Gorice, in Amsterdam, 1685. The work is a treatise with an introduction, (\"The Cornerstone\"; see Talmud Yoma 53b), and is divided into seven \"fountains\" (see Zecharia iii.9), each fountain being subdivided into a number of \"streams.\" A specimen of the work Chesed Le-Avraham, taken from the fifth fountain, twenty-fourth stream, p. 57d, of the Amsterdam edition:\n\nOn the mystery of Gilgul (reincarnation) and its details: Know that God will not subject the soul of the wicked to more than three migrations; for it is written, \"Lo, all these things doth God work twice, yea thrice, with a man\" (Job xxxiii. 29). Which means, He makes him appear twice and thrice in a human incarnation; but the fourth time he is incarnated as a clean animal. And when a man offers a sacrifice, God will, by miraculous intervention, make him select an animal that is an incarnation of a human being. Then will the sacrifice be doubly profitable: to the one that offers it and to the soul imprisoned in the brute. For with the smoke of the sacrifice the soul ascends heavenward and attains its original purity. Thus is explained the mystery involved in the words, \"O Lord, thou preservest man and beast\" (Psalms xxxvi.7 [R. V. 6]).\n\nHe died in Hebron on November 6, 1643 and is buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Hebron.\n\nOne of the manuscripts that he left to his descendant, Hayyim Joseph David is also published.

Their patients are usually common folk who have trouble affording legitimate medical services, or those who are very traditional and/or superstitious. Many people trust them not only because of tradition, but because they usually have better bedside manners, or show more care and concern for their patients, than doctors in hospitals.\n\nDuring the pre-historic period, the function of an arbularyo was fulfilled by the Babaylan, a shamanic spiritual leader of the community.\n\nAt the beginning of the Spanish Era in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the suppression of the Babaylans and native Filipino animist beliefs gave rise to the albularyo. By exchanging the native pagan prayers and spells with Catholic \"oraciones\" and prayers, the arbularyo was able to syncretise the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.\n\nAs time progressed, the arbularyo became a more prominent figure in most rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the arbularyos to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.\n\nHowever, the arbularyo's role was slowly shadowed with the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the arbularyos with the newer technologies offered by the medical field.\n\nStill, arbularyos flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.\n\nMost arbularyos use herbs, alum, coconut oil, and other substances in their healing practices. In many cases, arbularyos will also employ various prayers, chants and \"supernatural\" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes.\n\n"}

Today there is a seven-storey building on this site.\n\nWith the increase in the Indian population in Nairobi, the need for educational facilities grew and the Arya Samaj started the first school for girls in Nairobi in 1910. Later three more schools were established by the Arya Samaj in Nairobi. Admission to these schools was open to students of all races and students were mostly exempt from paying fees.

Flinders Petrie in his 1923 expedition to the Saqqara (also spelt Sakkara) found several references to Ash in Old Kingdom wine jar seals: \"I am refreshed by this Ash\" was a common inscription.\n\nIn particular, he was identified by the Ancient Egyptians as the god of the Libu and Tinhu tribes, known as the \"people of the oasis\". Consequently Ash was known as the \"lord of Libya\", the western border areas occupied by the Libu and Tinhu tribes, corresponds roughly with the area of modern Libya.\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, as god of the oases, Ash was associated with Set, who was originally a god of the desert. The first known reference to Ash dates to the Protodynastic Period, and he continued to be mentioned as late as the 26th Dynasty.\n\nAsh was usually depicted as a human, whose head was one of the desert creatures, variously being shown as a lion, vulture, hawk, snake, or the unidentified Set-animal.\n\nSome depictions of Ash show him as having multiple heads, unlike other Egyptian deities, although some compound depictions were occasionally shown connecting gods to Min. In an article in the journal \"Ancient Egypt\" (in 1923), and again in an appendix to her book, \"The Splendor that was Egypt\", Margaret Murray expands on such depictions, and draws a parallel to a Scythian deity, who is referenced in Sebastian Münster's \"Cosmographia universalis\".\n\nThe idea of Ash as an import god is contested, as he may have been the god of the city of Nebut, now known as Naqada, before Set's introduction there. One of his titles is \"Nebuty\" or \"He of Nebut\", indicating this position.\n\nAsh is sometimes seen as another name for Set.\n"}
{"id": "4792802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4792802", "title": "Ayla (Earth's Children)", "text": "Ayla (Earth's Children)\n\nAyla is the main character of Jean Auel's Earth's Children novels. She is a Cro-Magnon woman who was raised by Neanderthals. Ayla was played by Daryl Hannah in the 1986 movie \"The Clan of the Cave Bear\". Ayla's character has been described as an example of the \"rebellious primordial\" that conquers adversity with wit and will.\n\nAyla is orphaned as a young Cro-Magnon child when an earthquake opens a fissure in the ground into which the camp of her mother falls and is destroyed. It was mentioned a few times that the location of the camp was odd and not near known Cro-Magnon settlements. The facts that no father or other family members were mentioned and the odd location of the mother’s camp suggest that the mother either chose or was forced not to live with her clan. Ayla is swimming nude in the river beside the campsite when the earthquake starts and watches the tragedy in horror. Wandering aimlessly, alone, frightened, hungry and helpless, Ayla eventually encounters a cave lion which chases her into a narrow crack in a rock wall. Attempting to pull Ayla out, the lion gashes open Ayla's leg, leaving four deep parallel wounds on her thigh. After a day spent hiding in terror and driven by thirst, Ayla, emerges from her hiding place to drink at the nearby stream and then collapses, delirious from fever and starvation. There she is found by a group of Neanderthals, a \"Clan\" led by Brun, and is adopted by Iza, that Clan's medicinewoman or healer. Though neither Iza, Ayla's adoptive mother, nor Creb, the \"Mog-ur\" (a Shaman-like character) her adoptive father, know Ayla's age for certain, author Jean Auel places Ayla at the age of five years in the book's second paragraph, and her foster family eventually guesses her age accurately.\n\n\"See The Clan of the Cave Bear, The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters, The Plains of Passage, The Shelters of Stone and The Land of Painted Caves for a detailed synopsis of Ayla's life.\"\n\nAyla is described as tall, with blonde hair, gray-blue eyes, a well-toned body, and a strangely accented voice (actually a speech mannerism). She has been raised with Clan customs, sign language instead of speech, not to laugh or smile, and not to cry. Almost every male Cro-Magnon character in the series finds Ayla exceptionally beautiful, though Ayla describes herself as \"big and ugly\" because she was regarded by the Clan as ugly. Another word frequently used to describe her is 'exotic', indicating that she seems a bit foreign to everyone who meets her, and that her own people live somewhere else.\n\nOne of Ayla's most important insights is the concept that men have something to do with the conception of children. Clan people believe that pregnancy and birth are a matter of spirit totems competing; when a woman menstruates, it means her totem has fought off another and has won, but if a woman gets pregnant it means her totem has been overcome. Ayla suspects that this all has something to do with sex, or the \"relieving of a man's needs\" with a woman. She comes to think of this as a combination of male and female \"essence.\"\n\nAyla has a longstanding problem with Broud, the son of the leader's mate while she lives with the Clan, who is jealous of the attention she receives. His envy causes him to behave in a disgraceful manner; while women expect to be ordered around, Broud also beats and rapes her, impregnating her at the age of eleven. These actions cause his mother's mate to question whether Broud is fit to be leader. Upon becoming leader after the former tribal head believes he is ready, Broud orders a death curse on Ayla and forces her to leave the Clan forever, leaving her son Durc behind.\n\nThroughout the series, there are many references to Ayla's having great spiritual and intellectual powers, many of which actually may be simple reasoning and common sense. She does have a knack for inventing things, and is credited with many innovations actually made over thousands of years of human history.\n\nAyla earns her name during her first waking meeting with the Clan members; they cannot pronounce her birth name, and their approximation, \"Ayla,\" becomes her given name. Auel uses the term \"polysyllabic\" to describe Ayla's birth name, implying it is more than two syllables long. This is may be further supported by Creb's first try at pronouncing her name, \"Aay-rr,\" which could be an attempt to say \"Aela.\" However, Auel does not explicitly state the name of Ayla's birth.\n\nAs a child among the Clan, she is described as lucky, favored by the spirits. Iza later surmises that Ayla was born to a medicine woman of the Others (Cro-Magnons), though Ayla has very little memory of her birth mother and knows nothing of the tribe of the Others to whom she was born. This passage may be a hint by the author of the reason for Ayla’s mother’s camp to be in such an odd location, with no other mentioned people around. Although Ayla lacks the Clan's ability to access ancestral memories, Iza succeeds in training her as a medicine healer. In her childhood and young adulthood she invents several things previously unknown, as well as innovations to existing tools and their uses (see below.) It is here that we see her winning combination of the Clan's detailed factual knowledge, and the Others' innovative and flexible thinking.\n\nWhen Ayla acts as the medicine woman at the Clan Gathering and prepares the sacred herb for the Mog-urs' ceremony, she ingests some of the juice from the root and is strongly affected by its psychotropic properties. Creb makes telepathic contact with her, and she follows him through his psychic exploration of the Clan \"memories.\" She then follows the path of the Others' divergence from the Clan, and among other things sees a glimpse of the future: \"Boxlike structures...long ribbons of stone...strange animals crawling at great speeds...huge birds that flew without flapping their wings.\" Apparently Auel intended to describe Ayla seeing a glimpse of the modern era, and even beyond to the next stage of human evolution. Creb has seen all these things with her, and telepathically orders her out of the cave when she returns to her own mind, knowing in his heart that only the Others will continue to evolve and that the Clan will die out.\n\nAlone in a secluded valley where she has fled after being expelled from the Clan, Ayla adopts and raises a cave lion cub she calls Baby and a horse she calls Whinney. She originally stops in the valley to stay for the winter, but stays to take care of the animal friends. She learns that to survive on her own, she must break many Clan traditions she had previously been raised under. She meets Jondalar when he is attacked and mauled by Baby and tends his wounds. He begins teaching her his language. Some weeks or months later she dreams of her own mother speaking to her and of an earthquake (which betoken tragedy and upheaval to Ayla). After this dream, Ayla suddenly speaks Jondalar's language fluently even to the idioms, where before she had spoken only in broken sentences. Auel may have meant this event as a partial recovery of repressed memories, but Ayla still does not remember her own or her mother's name, her language, or anything of her past before her adoption. Jondalar recovers and takes Ayla, Racer (Whinney's offspring), and Whinney with him while he completes the pilgrimage he is on, intending to bring her home to meet his family.\n\nAyla continues to have psychic and prophetic experiences linked to the rituals used by the Mamutoi people. She dreams that she has two sons, Durc and an unknown son who appears to have no Clan lineage at all; they are on the verge of open conflict, and Ayla struggles to reach them in time to prevent the destruction of one son by the other. It is suggested that the meaning of the dream has less to do with her 'children' than the evolution of the Others and decline of the Clan. she becomes promised to Ranec who comes to believe that she is an incarnation of what he calls the \"Spirit Woman,\" the perfect spirit model of a woman in whose image all are made, and that she may even be the Earth Mother incarnate. Shaman Mamut indicates to Jondalar, Ranec, and Vincavec, another Mamutoi shaman who wants to marry Ayla, that Ayla has some great purpose. Vincavec attempts to hypnotize Ayla, but she is able to resist him, as well as the spiritual influences of others. Though Ayla contends that her ability to tame and win the loyalty of animals is only a matter of time, patience and proper handling, her gift for making friends of numerous animals is considered a sign of her supernatural gifts.\n\nOn the journey back to the Zelandonii territory, Jondalar's home, many of the tribes Ayla encounters mistake Ayla's extreme creative intelligence and even her common-sense reasoning for supernatural powers. Jondalar and Ayla both insist that she has no such gifts, but they do not stay in one place long enough to convince anyone otherwise. Ayla continues to have prophetic dreams.\n\nUpon arriving at the Ninth Cave, Jondalar's dwelling, Ayla realizes that this cave is identical to one she's been seeing in her dreams. Her dreams and waking psychic visions become more frequent and more powerful, and the female shaman Zelandoni can sense them. However, Ayla rejects Zelandoni's offers to train her as a priestess, saying she merely wishes to live a normal life. Zelandoni finally convinces Ayla to join the spiritual devotees, known as \"Those Who Serve the Mother.\"\n\nPublished March 29, 2011. The last book In the \"Earth's Children's Series\", Ayla is now about 25 years old and training to become a spiritual leader of the Zelandonii. Her training includes a series of harrowing journeys and gives her problems when trying to balance her work and her family life.\n\n\nBorn to Ayla while she still lived among the Clan, Durc is considered half-caste: part “other,” part Clan. His father is Broud, the brutish son of the Clan leader who repeatedly raped Ayla as a form of punishment. He displays physical characteristics of both Clan (Neanderthal) and the Others (Cro-Magnon); like Ayla he can vocalize. Although the concept of interbreeding between Neanderthal and other early humans is debated by scientists to this day, remains at several sites indicate that it happened. Durc’s fate is bound up in the Clan; when Ayla is cursed with death (outcast) for the second time when she defies Broud who has been named the new leader, she leaves the Clan and her son behind. Readers around the world express their desire to learn what fate has in store for Durc.\n\nAyla's infant daughter, in the \"Shelters of Stone\" fathered by Jondalar.

The battle was one of the bloodiest fought by the British East India Company. Both armies held their positions at the end of the battle and both sides claimed victory. The battle was a strategic check to immediate British ambitions in India and a shock to British military prestige.\n\nThe Second Anglo-Sikh war broke out in the Punjab, which had recently lost much of its independence to the British East India Company following the First Anglo-Sikh War, in April 1848, when the city of Multan rebelled under Dewan Mulraj. The East India Company's Commissioner for the Punjab, Frederick Currie, sent several forces of locally raised troops to help quell the revolt. One of these forces consisted largely of Sikhs, formerly from the Sikh Khalsa Army, under Sher Singh Attariwalla. Some junior British Political Officers viewed this development with alarm as Sher Singh's father, Chattar Singh Attariwalla, was known to be plotting sedition in Hazara, north of the Punjab.\n\nOn 14 September, Sher Singh's army also rebelled. Other than opposition to the British, Mulraj and Sher Singh had no aims in common. Sher Singh decided to move his army north, to join that of Chattar Singh, who had also rebelled. However, some British officers had taken steps to secure vital fortresses. For the time being, Chattar Singh was unable to leave Hazara, as the British held Attock on the Indus River, and the passes over the Margalla Hills separating Hazara from the Punjab. Instead, Sher Singh moved a few miles north and fortified the crossings over the Chenab River, while awaiting events.\n\nThe East India Company responded by announcing their intention to depose the young Maharaja, Duleep Singh, annexe the Punjab and confiscate the lands of any landholders who joined the revolt. While an army under Major General Whish resumed the Siege of Multan, the company ordered the formation of an Army of the Punjab under the veteran Commander in Chief, Sir Hugh Gough. However, both Gough and the Governor General, the 37-year-old Lord Dalhousie, delayed operations until after the end of the monsoon season, allowing Sher Singh to gather reinforcements and establish strong positions.\n\nGough took charge of the Army on 21 November. The next day, he attacked Sher Singh's bridgehead on the left bank of the Chenab at Ramnagar but was repulsed, raising Sikh morale. On 1 December, a cavalry division under Major General Joseph Thackwell crossed the Chenab upstream from Ramnagar. Sher Singh advanced against him, resulting in a day-long artillery duel at Sadullapur. Gough meanwhile bombarded the empty Sikh positions at Ramnagar, and postponed a general attack until the next day. During the night, Sher Singh withdrew to the north.\n\nGough then halted, awaiting further instructions from Dalhousie. Early in January 1849, news came that the British had recaptured the city of Multan (although Mulraj still defended the citadel), but also that the Muslim garrison of Attock had defected to Amir Dost Mohammad Khan of Afghanistan, who was half-heartedly supporting Chattar Singh. The fall of Attock nevertheless allowed Chattar Singh's army to leave Hazara and move south. Dalhousie ordered Gough to seek out and destroy Sher Singh's main army before the Sikh armies could combine, without waiting for reinforcements from the army at Multan.\n\nOn 13 January, Gough's army was marching towards the reported Sikh position at Rasul, on the left bank of the Jhelum River, about north-west of Lahore. At noon, they drove a Sikh outpost out of the village of Chillianwala. At this point, Gough intended to march round to the north of the Sikh position and attack its left flank on the following day, but from the vantage point of a mound near Chillianwala, it was apparent that the Sikhs had advanced from their original positions along ridges close to the Jhelum. Sher Singh's army had originally occupied a position six miles long, too extended for their numbers and vulnerable to a flank attack such as Gough proposed. By advancing, Sher Singh made a British flank march too risky and forced the British to make a frontal attack.\n\nIt was estimated by Frederick Mackeson, Gough's attached political officer, that Sher Singh's army numbered 23,000 (although most later British historians put it at 30,000 or more), including 5,000 irregular cavalry, with some 60 guns. However after the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Khalsa was reduced to 12,000 infantry and 60 guns in total, so some historians have stated the Sikh army could not have been more than 10,000 on the day.\n\nThe Sikh army consisted of three main bodies of troops. On the left under Sher Singh himself were one cavalry regiment, nine infantry battalions, some irregulars and 20 guns, occupying some low hills and ridges. In the centre under Lal Singh were two cavalry regiments, ten infantry battalions and 17 guns, mostly concealed in or behind belts of scrub and jungle. On the right was a brigade which formerly had garrisoned Bannu, consisting of one cavalry regiment, four infantry battalions and eleven guns, anchored on two villages. Other irregulars extended Sher Singh's left flank.\n\nGough intended to delay the attack until the following day, but as his army prepared to pitch camp, hitherto concealed Sikh artillery opened fire from positions much closer than had been anticipated. Gough later wrote that he feared the Sikhs might bombard his encampments overnight, though some of his officers believed he had merely been stung into hasty action.\n\nGough's army was composed of two infantry divisions, each of two brigades, each in turn of one British and two Bengal Native infantry battalions, with a total of 66 guns from the Bengal Artillery and Bengal Horse Artillery. The 3rd Division under Sir Colin Campbell, with two field artillery batteries and three horse artillery troops, was deployed on the left, while the 2nd Division commanded by Major General Sir Walter Gilbert was deployed on the right with a field artillery battery and three horse artillery troops. Gough also had a cavalry division under Major General Joseph Thackwell, but this was split, with one brigade on each flank; Brigadier White's on the left, Brigadier Pope's on the right. Gough deployed two heavy artillery batteries with eight 18-pounder guns and four 8-inch howitzers in the centre. A brigade of Bengal Native troops under Brigadier Penney was in reserve.\n\nGough ordered the advance to commence at about 3:00 pm. From the outset, the right-hand brigade of Campbell's division, commanded by Brigadier Pennycuick, was in difficulties. Because the jungle made it difficult for Campbell to coordinate his two brigades, he assumed personal command of the left hand brigade under Brigadier Hoggan, while ordering Pennycuick to attack with the bayonet. The British regiment of Pennycuick's brigade was the 24th Foot, which had only recently arrived in India. They advanced very rapidly, but lost cohesion and also lost touch with the rest of the brigade in the thick scrub. Trying to attack Sikh guns head-on, they suffered heavily from grapeshot. When they reached the main Sikh positions, Sikh resistance was desperate and the 24th were driven back. The Queen's colours were lost, although the Sikhs never claimed to have captured them and they were either destroyed or conceivably buried with the officer who had carried them. Pennycuick's brigade eventually became completely disorganised and had to make its way back to the start line in small parties. Pennycuick himself was killed.\n\nCampbell's left hand brigade (under Brigadier Hoggan and Campbell himself) had greater success. The 61st Foot captured several guns and even an elephant, and Brigadier White's cavalry followed up with an effective charge. Hoggan's troops eventually met the left-hand brigade of Gilbert's division, commanded by Brigadier Mountain, behind the Sikhs' centre positions.\n\nOn Gough's right however, his troops had met with disaster. While Gilbert's two brigades had at first successfully driven the Sikhs before them, capturing or spiking several guns, on their right flank, Brigadier Pope (who was almost an invalid) first ordered an ineffective cavalry charge through thorn scrub which threw his brigade into confusion, and then panicked and ordered a retreat. One of his British cavalry regiments, the 14th Light Dragoons, routed. The Sikhs followed up the fleeing cavalry and captured four guns. They then attacked Gilbert's right-hand infantry brigade, commanded by Brigadier Godby, from the rear, forcing him to withdraw under heavy pressure until Penney's reserve brigade came to his aid.\n\nBy now, darkness was approaching. The Sikhs had been driven from many of their positions with heavy casualties, but were still fighting strongly. With some of his formations rendered ineffective, or having to fight their way out of encirclement, Gough ordered a withdrawal to the start line. Although his units brought back as many wounded as they could, many of them could not be found in the scrub. Many of the abandoned wounded were killed during the night by roving Sikh irregulars. Gough's retreat also allowed the Sikhs to recapture all but twelve of the guns the British had taken earlier in the day.\n\nThe final losses to Gough's army were 757 killed, 1,651 wounded and 104 missing for a total of 2,512. A comparatively high proportion of the casualties (almost 1,000) were British rather than Indian. This was mainly a result of the disaster which befell the 24th Foot, which suffered 590 casualties, over 50 percent.\n\nSikh casualties were 4,000 dead and wounded.\n\nAn obelisk later erected at Chillianwalla by the British government preserves the names of those who fell in the battle.\n\nBoth armies held their positions at the end of the battle and Sher Singh withdrew to the north. Both sides claimed a victory. The Sikhs claimed that they forced the British to retreat but the British forces actually withdrew three days after the battle ended; however, this was due to the rains which separated the two armies for that duration. Since the Sikhs disengaged first, the British claimed the victory, although they admitted that the Sikhs missed an opportunity to gain a victory. However, the repulse of the British, together with the loss of several guns and the colours of the 24th and two other regiments, and the rout of the 14th Light Dragoons, dealt a blow to British morale and is testament to the tenacity and martial skill of the Sikh army.\n\nA testimony left by a British observer says: \nThe Sikhs fought like devils, fierce and untamed... Such a mass of men I never set eyes on and a plucky as lions: they ran right on the bayonets and struck their assailants when they were transfixed.\n\nTwo later editorials by the military historian Major A.H. Amin stated:\nAt Chillianwala a British Army which had a high European troop component large number Sepoy (regiments), sufficient artillery, two heavy cavalry brigades to ensure that no one could surprise the British army, excellent logistics, little campaign exhaustion having fought no major battle since assumption of hostilities...failed to defeat the Sikhs.\n\nThe Battle of Chillianwala fought on 13 January 1849 is, however, one odd exception and stands out as a battle in which the British failed to defeat their opponents despite having the advantages of weight of numbers (sic), ideal weather and terrain, superior logistics etc\n\nGough was criticised for his handling of the battle, and was relieved of command and was superseded by General Charles James Napier. Before Napier could arrive from England to take over command, Gough had fought the decisive Battle of Goojerat (or Gujrat, Gujerat).\n\nThe loss of British prestige at Chillianwala was one of the factors which contributed to the Indian rebellion of 1857 some nine years later. However the Sikh soldiers serving in the British army remained loyal to Britain and helped crush the rebellion.\n\nWithin the British Army, such was the consternation over the events at Chillianwala that, after the disastrous Charge of the Light Brigade, when Lord Lucan remarked \"This is a most serious matter\", General Airey replied, \"These sort of things will happen in war. It is nothing to Chillianwala.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most notably Buraq carried the Islamic prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem and back during the Isra and Mi'raj or \"Night Journey\", as recounted in hadith literature.\n\nThe \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", referring to Al-Damiri's writings, considers Buraq to be a derivative of \"barq\" \"lightning\".\nAccording to \"Encyclopædia Iranica\", \"Boraq\" is the Arabized form of \"Middle Persian *\"barāg\" or *\"bārag\", 'a riding beast, mount' (New Pers. \"bāra\")\".\n\nNear East and Persian art almost always portrays Buraq with a human face, a portrayal that found its way into Indian and Persian Islamic art. Yet no hadiths or early Islamic references allude to it having a humanoid face. This may have been originated from a misrepresentation or translation from Arabic to Persian of texts and stories describing the winged steed as a \"beautiful faced creature\".\n\nAn excerpt from a translation of Sahih al-Bukhari describes Buraq:\nAnother describes the Buraq in greater detail:\nIn the earlier descriptions there is no agreement as to the sex of the Buraq. It is typically male, yet Ibn Sa'd has Gabriel address the creature as a female, and it was often rendered by painters with a woman's head. The fact that \"al-Buraq\" is a mare is also noted in the book The Dome of the Rock, in the chapter \"The Open Court\", and in the title-page vignette of Georg Ebers's \"Palestine in Picture and Word\".\n\nAccording to Islam, the Night Journey took place ten years after Muhammad became a prophet, during the 7th century. Muhammad had been in his home city of Mecca, at his cousin's home (the house of Fakhitah bint Abi Talib). Afterwards, Muhammad went to the Great Mosque of Mecca. While he was resting at the Kaaba, the angel Jibril appeared to him, followed by Buraq. Muhammad mounted Buraq, and in the company of Jibril, they traveled to the \"farthest mosque\".\n\nThe location of this mosque was not explicitly stated but is generally accepted to mean al-Aqsa Mosque at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. At this location, he dismounted from Buraq, prayed, and mounted Buraq, who took him to the various heavens, to meet first the earlier prophets and then God. God instructed Muhammad to tell his followers that they were to offer prayers fifty times a day. At the urging of Musa (Moses), Muhammad returns to God and eventually reduces it to ten times, and then five times a day as this was the destiny of Muhammad and his people. Buraq then transported Muhammad back to Mecca.\n\nAccording to ibn Ishaq, Buraq transported Ibrahim (Abraham) when he visited his wife, Hagar, and son, Ismail (Ishmael). That tradition states that Abraham lived with one wife, Sarah, in Syria, but Buraq would transport him in the morning to Mecca to see his family there and take him back in the evening to his wife in Syria.\n\nVarious scholars and writers, such as ibn al-Faqih, ibn Abd Rabbih, and Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, have suggested places where Buraq was supposedly tethered in stories, mostly locations near the southwest corner of the Haram. However, for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq Mosque, just inside the wall at the south end of the Western Wall plaza. The mosque sits above an ancient passageway that once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel remains visible below the Maghrebi gate. Because of the proximity to the Western Wall, the area next to the wall has been associated with Buraq at least since the 19th century.\n\nWhen a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:\nCarl Sandreczki, charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles William Wilson's Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the \"Hosh\" (court/enclosure) of \"al Burâk\", \"not \"Obrâk\", nor \"Obrat\"\". In 1866, the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote: \"The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su'ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above.\"\n\nThe name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson's 1865 survey, its revised editions in 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century. In 1922, the official Pro-Jerusalem Council specified it as a street name.\n\nThe association of the Western Wall area with Buraq has played an important role in disputes over the holy places since the British mandate.\n\n\" on the proposed official seal of the province's government.\n\n"}

Starting with Param Poojya Parijnanāshram I Swamiji in 1708, the Parampara (lineage) continues through to the present \"Mathādhipati\" of the Chitrāpur Math Param Poojya Sadyojāt Shankarāshram Swamiji. He is currently the 11th \"Mathādhipati\" of the Shri Chitrapur Math.\n\nThis chart shows the lineage of Paramparas. It shows the reigning period of each \"Mathādhipati\" along with his place of birth as well as place where his shrine (\"samādhi\") is located.\n\"Saraswat ()\" is the generic term for the Brahmins or learned people who inhabited the fertile basin between the ancient rivers of Saraswati and Drishadawati in Kashmir. But usually Saraswat refers to the Saraswat Brahmins who come under the \"Chitrāpur Matha\" at Shirāli and are hence called Chitrāpur Sāraswat Brahmins (Bhānaps or Smārtha Sāraswats). Due to drought and famine, they migrated southwards towards Goa and Maharashtra. But Portuguese invasion of Goa forced the Sāraswats established neat Gomantak region to migrate further south towards Karnataka and settled down in the Kanara regions of Karnataka. Their superior intelligence and administrative experience helped them attain several important posts in the regions in which they migrated to.\n\nThe Bhanap people are a very small community that is scattered in all parts of the globe. The common thread that binds all these people is the \"Guru Parampara\" and the \"Chitrapur Math\"\n\nDuring the reign of the Hindu chiefs of Nagar or Keldi (1560–1768) in the Kanara regions of Karnataka, the Smartha Saraswats held esteemed positions in the government. These were a variety of administrative and accountancy positions. Since they were established in villages of the region, they adopted the names of the villages as their surnames.\n\nTheir superior intelligence and high efficiency of work created envy among the local people there. Their jealousy went to such an extent that they wanted to remove the Saraswats from their highly respective posts. For this they went and complained to the King of Nagar that the Saraswats did not have a Guru and hence did not have a spiritual existence of their own.\n\nThe King heeded the words of these envious people and issued an official decree whereby \"If the Saraswats did not show him their \"Guru\", a heavy penalty would be imposed upon them\". It so happened that the Guru of the Shenvis had left for Benaras. The representative of the Saraswat community made this point to the King but he was not satisfied with it.\n\nThe Saraswat Brahmins were aghast. All the elders of the community held a \"dharan\" (community prayer) at the Temple of Lord Mahābaleshwar (\"Bhavānishankar\") at Gokarna. The intensity of prayer is as quoted:\n\n\"The Saraswats gathered together,<br>And prayed in all humility,<br>Giving up hunger,thirst and sleep...\"<br>\n\"Such was the intensity\"\n\n\"The devotees with prayers in their hearts,<br>Unceasingly for long nights and days,<br>Surrendered unto Lord Mahabaleshwar,<br>At Gokarn,that sacred place.\"\n\nLord Bhavānishankar is said to have answered their prayers. In a dream he appears and assures his devotees that a Sanyasi would arrive at the banks of the \"Kotiteerth\"the next day and that he would guide the community as their Guru.\n\nAs the dream had proclaimed, a \"sanyasi\" clad in saffron robes and carrying the \"vigraha\" (idol) of Lord Bhavānishankara in his cloth pouch arrived at the banks of the \"Kotiteerth ()\", the village tank.\n\n\"Sacred ash smeared on the forehead,<br>The Guru arrived,the Benevolent One,<br>Clad in flaming saffron robes,<br>Resplendent like the Sun!\nA 'Danda' adorned in one hand,<br>A 'Kamandalu' in another,<br>The brilliance of Shankara on his face,<br>The gentle smile of a mother!\nA 'rudraksha mala' adorned his nech,<br>A 'Jholi' by His side,<br>Carried the 'Vigraha' of Lord Bhavanishankara,<br>Our Gurudev had come down to guide.\"\n\nThis great one was Parijñānāshram I, the first Guru, who established in 1708, the glorious \"Guru parampara\" in which the present guru Sadyojāt Shankarāshram is the eleventh in succession\n\nThe Sāraswats have lived a glorious period of over 300 years under the \"Guru Parampara\". Each swamiji has contributed in his own way to the development of the community. The divine powers possessed by the greats and their deeds towards humanity are stuff of legends.\n\nThe Saraswat installed Swami Parijñānāshram I at the \"Sri Vishveshwar Vithal\" Temple and brought him to Nāgar and before the king. But the king refused to accept him as their guru until and unless the \"Shankarāchārya\" of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham gave his consent.\n\n\"Parijñānāshram Swamiji\" travelled from Gokarna to Shringeri. At first he was denied entry into the temple by the priests there. In the night \"Jagadguru\" had a dream where he saw that idol of Sharada Devi had lost its lustre as she was upset as her son was denied entry into the temple. In the morning the \"Jagadguru\" realised this when he saw the idol and immediately called for Parijnanashram Swamiji and gave his consent to the new Swamiji. He was also awestruck by Parinanashram swamiji's piety, yogic abilities and his knowledge. The King wholeheartedly welcome the new \"Mathādhipati\" of the Sāraswats. Thus the Guru parampara was established.\n\nThe Swamiji consented to stay on at the \"Sri Vishweshwar Vithal\" Temple on the banks of the Kotiteerth in Gokarna which became the first \"Math\" or monastery (The \"Adi Matha\") of the Sāraswats. He led the community till 1720 when Shankārashram I Swami became the \"Mathādhipati\" (head of the \"matha\": generic name for head of the community). He attained \"Mahāsamādhi\"(death) on the \"Krishna Chaturdashi\" day of the month of \"Chaitra\" in 1720. His \"samādhi\" is located at the Adi Matha, Gokarna\n\nSwami Shankarāshram was the \"mathādhipati\" from 1720 until his \"Mahāsamadhi\" in 1757. Under his leadership, the Chitrāpur Math at Shirāli became the head \"math\" (monastery) of the Sāraswats. His divinity has many popular folklore attached to it. Many devotees in grief and sorrow attained happiness due to his divine grace (see Swamiji's Miracles). Swamiji suddenly suffered from an untimely illness and succumbed to it and attained \"Mahāsamādhi\" in 1757. His \"samādhi\" is located at Shirali. He had not adopted a \"shishya\" (disciple) to continue the lineage or \"parampara\".\n\nWith \"Shankarāshram I Swamiji\" attaining \"samādhi\" without ordaining a new successor, the community was again put into a state of peril. The King had again seized the assets of the math with the condition that a new \"mathadhipati\" had to be installed.\n\nThe elders of the community gathered together and sought to resolve the impending peril. They went to a saintly person, who practised yoga, from the \"Pandit\" family in Kollur and asked him if he would take up the reins of the \"Mathādhipati\". He graciously accepted and thus was ordained as Parijñānāshram II Swamiji.\n\nNot being the type who liked to wield power, Swamiji accepted a \"shisya\" (disciple) very soon and spent most of his time practising yoga at Kollur. He attained \"Mahāsamādhi\" in 1770 leaving behind his successor \"Shankarāshram II\". His \"samādhi\" is located at Shirali\n\nSwami Shakarāshram II was considered as the \"avatār\"(incarnation) of \"Lord Dattātreya\". He was a true \"Jñāni\" (knowledgeable one) and people from all parts of the country flocked to hear his spiritual discourses. Very many miracles have been attributed to him (\"see Miracles\").\n\nIn 1781, swamiji accepted a \"shishya\" (disciple) and christened him \"Keshavāshram\". In 1785 swamiji attained \"Mahāsamādhi\" and \"Swami Keshavāshram\" became the fifth \"mathādhipati\" of the Sāraswat Brahmins. The \"samādhi\" of His Holiness Shankarāshram Swamiji is located at the small hamlet of Mallāpur in Karnataka at the Mallāpur Math.\n\nKeshavāshram Swamiji took charge of the math in 1785. He was a very learned person and a scholar in the Sanskrit scriptures. Knowing that education was the key to success, Keshavāshram Swamiji encouraged the Sāraswats to have English education during British rule. Thus when the other communities ostracized the English language, the Saraswats got well-educated in English and thus could hold positions of high esteem even under the British.\n\nHe is attributed with very many miracles (see Miracles) and the popularity of the \"matha\" got a tremendous boost under his \"Ādhipatya\" (governance). He accepted a \"shishya\" in 1804 and ordained him Vāmanāshram. Thus another sacred link was added to the \"Guru parampara\".\n\nIn the year 1823, Keshavāshram Swamiji attained \"Mahā-samadhi\". His \"samādhi\" is located at Shirali\n\nVāmansāshram Swamiji became the \"mathadhipati\" in 1823. Vāmanāshram Swamiji had the distinction of serving as the \"shishya\" of Keshavāshram Swamiji for 19 years. He was a person who was more involved in spiritual pursuits than in administration. To reduce the burdens of administration, he accepted a \"shishya\". This shishya was ordained as \"Krishnāshram\" in the year 1836.\n\nAfter accepting a \"shishya\" Vamanāshram Swamiji gave up the administrative responsibilities and took the path of \"Tyāga\" (sacrifice) in 1836. Stories of his divine powers and intensity of prayer are legends among the Sāraswats (see Miracles). Swamiji attained \"Mahā-samādhi\" in 1839. His \"samādhi\" stands at Mangalore within the premises of the Mangalore Math.\n\nParam Poojya Krishnāshram Swamiji gained control over the \"matha\" in 1839. He was a dynamic and able administrator. His contributions to architecture and infrastructure still stand today. He ordered the construction of temples and \"mathas\", set right existing ones and gradually got over many people from their Vaishnava practises.\n\nSwamiji accepted a \"shishya\" in 1857 and ordained him as \"Pāndurangāshram\". With the dynamism of youth in Pādurangāshram swami, Swami Krishnāshram could introduce many reforms for the benefit of the community.\n\nSwami Krishnāshram attained \"Maha-samadhi\" in 1863. His \"samadhi\"(shrine) is located at Shirali.\n\nParam Poojya Pāndurangāshram took charge of the \"math\" in 1863. He is the longest serving \"Mathādhipati\" till date (52 years). He is considered one of the most brilliant of all the swamis and his mastery over Sanskrit and Logic was unquestionable. Even after taking charge of the \"matha\", he continued to learn the Vedanta and the Upanishads. He stressed on the need for education in the community. Under his guidance, a school was established and he brought about the development of general infrastructure of Shirāli.\n\nSwamiji stressed Dharma (the right way to live) and encouraged a sense of patriotism in his country. He came under criticism for imposing a ban on foreign travel. Anyone who went abroad or anyone who associated with a person who went abroad were excommunicated. Overall, the period under the leadership of Swami \"Pāndurangāshram\" is called the \"Glorious Age\" of the Saraswats.\n\nMiracles have been attributed to swamiji. Swamiji was reluctant in adopting a \"shishya\" because of the lack of discipline within the community. Eventually when swamiji was very sick, he relented to the pressure of the people and accepted a \"shishya\". The new \"shishya\", who was just 8 years old, was ordained as \"Ānandāshram\". Thus a sacred link in the \"Guru Parampara\" could be established. Pāndurangāshram Swamiji attained \"Mahā-samādhi\" in 1915. His \"samādhi\" is at Shirāli.\n\nĀnandāshram Swamiji had served as \"mathādhipati\" for a glorious period of 51 years. Those were the years when India went through turbulent times of the Independence struggle. Under Ānandāshram Swamiji the Sāraswat community developed at a rapid rate. The financial development was given top priority as the community was facing a financial crisis during the early parts of his reign. He brought about many social reforms like permission to go abroad and taking back the people from the community who had been ostracized for foreign visits. The community underwent tremendous progress economically and morally under his regime.\n\nSwami Anandashram accepted a \"shishya\" in 1959 and ordained him as Parijñānāshram. Swamiji attained \"Mahā-samādhi\" in 1966. His \"samadhi\" is in Shirali.\n\nParijñānāshram Swamiji took charge of the \"matha\" after the glorious years under Swami Ānandāshram. He was very intelligent, had a progressive outlook and a keen thirst for knowledge — Vedic as well as technical. His dynamic approach to matters regarding the \"matha\" brought back the financial stability it needed. His scientific temper resulted in the establishment of a printing press, Observatory and other technical advancements.\n\nHe was responsible for the starting of cottage and small-scale industries like printing press, handlooms and powerlooms, agro-industries in the regions around the \"math\". With the financial stability regained, the \"Rathōtsav\" (Car Festival) was restarted; it had been stopped under Swami Ānandāshram due to acute financial strain.\n\nHis far-sighted and monumental development ideas did not go well with the \"orthodox\" members of the community. This resulted in a rift in the community. It also led to an open display of disrespect toward this Swamiji by certain lobbies. \"Swamiji\" true to his divine grace made the ultimate \"Tyāga\" (sacrifice) by giving up the administration of the \"matha\" in 1981. This was reminiscent of Swami Vāmanāshram who had done the same in 1836. Swami Parijñānāshram III attained \"Mahā-samādhi\" in 1991. His \"samādhi\" is at Karla in Maharashtra.\n\nAfter the Samadhi of Parampoojya Parijnanashram Swamiji, the Karla Math continues to be managed by the Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin community, under guidance from His successor, H H Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji, the 11th Guru in the Chitrapur Saraswat Guruparampara and spiritual head of the institutions running the Karla Math.\n\nAfter a 6-year search for a Guru, (1991–1997) the Sāraswat community was blessed with a Mathādhipati and Guru - H H Param Poojya Sadyojāt Shankarāshram Swamiji. In Him the community found an erudite Vedic Scholar, an exponent of the advaitic Philosophy of Adi Shankaracharya,Teacher, reformist leader. and much more. Ordained into Sanyas by HH Swami Ishwarānanda Giriji Maharaj as Sadyojāt Samvat Giri[59][60]., He took up the reins of Shri Chitrapur Math in February 1997 as Sadyojat Shankarashram Swami at a well attended, elaborate Ceremony graced and blessed by H H Shankaracharya of Shringeri Shardamba Peetham.\n\nUnder Swami Sadyojāt Shankarāshram's guidance, the Shrivali Trust was established which has provided high quality medical care and drinking water to the people. Free value-based education is provided at the Shrivali School . Temples have been reconstructed from the state of ruin and general infrastructure developed. The Shri Chitrapur Math Charitable Trust today works for the empowerment of the villagers providing livelihood to the underprivileged. Swamiji has stressed the development of the youth as a force and has resulted in the conducting of very many \"Shibhirs\" (youth camps) for the physical, mental and spiritual development of the youth in the community.\n\nThe \"Guru Parampara\" of the Sāraswat Brahmins is something that they cherish and will always remain as the vital link that connects this small community of people, living in different parts of the globe, together.\n\n"}

The term is often used by Christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used (by analogy) to refer to buildings of other religions. In traditional Christian architecture, the church is often arranged in the shape of a Christian cross. When viewed from plan view the longest part of a cross is represented by the aisle and the junction of the cross is located at the altar area.\n\nTowers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring visitors. Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and conversely many original church buildings have been put to other uses.\n\nThe earliest identified Christian church building was a house church founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across Western Europe. A cathedral is a church building, usually Roman Catholic, Protestant (Anglican), Eastern Orthodox, or Oriental Orthodox, housing a cathedra, the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop.\n\nIn Greek, the adjective \"kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón\" () means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a \"Kyrios\"\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by early Christians of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord Jesus Christ: hence \"Kyriakós oíkos\" () (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"Kyriakē\" () (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. Sunday), or \"Kyriakē proseukhē\" () (the \"Lord's Prayer\").\nIn standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" (, \"ekklesía\", literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"church\"), and the overall community of the faithful (the \"Church\"). This usage was also retained in Latin and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French \"église\", Italian \"chiesa\", Spanish \"iglesia\", Portuguese \"igreja\", etc.), as well as in the Celtic languages (Welsh \"eglwys\", Irish \"eaglais\", Breton \"iliz\", etc.) and in Turkish (\"kilise\").\n\nIn the Germanic and some Slavic languages, the word \"kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón\" was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof. In Old English the sequence of derivation started as \"cirice\", then Middle English \"churche\", and eventually \"church\" in its current pronunciation. German \"Kirche\", Scots \"kirk\", Russian (\"tserkov\"), etc., are all similarly derived.\n\nAccording to the New Testament, the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes (Acts 17:5, 20:20, 1 Corinthians 16:19) or in Jewish worship places like the Second Temple or synagogues (Acts 2:46, 19:8). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a house church (\"domus ecclesiae\"), the Dura-Europos church, founded between 233 and 256. In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the first purpose-built halls for Christian worship (\"aula ecclesiae\") began to be constructed. Although many of these were destroyed early in the next century during the Diocletianic Persecution, even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the Emperor Constantine the Great.\n\nFrom the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches occurred across Western Europe. In addition to being a place of worship, the cathedral or the parish church was used by the community in other ways. It could serve as a meeting place for guilds or a hall for banquets. Mystery plays were sometimes performed in cathedrals, and cathedrals might also be used for fairs. The church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain.\n\nBetween 1000 and 1200 the romanesque style became popular across Europe. While the name of the romanesque era refers to the tradition of Roman architecture, it was actually a West- and Central European trend. Romanesque buildings appear rather bulky and compact. Typical features are circular arches, round or octagonal towers and cushion capitals on the pillars. In the early romanesque era, coffering on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, groined vault was more popular. The rooms became wider and the motivs of sculptures became more epic.\n\nThe Gothic style emerged around 1140 in Île-de-France and spread through all of Europe. The gothic buildings were less compact than they had been in the romanesque era and often contained symbolic and allegoric features. For the first time, pointed arches, rib vaults and buttresses were used, with the result that massive walls were not longer needed to stabilise the building. Due to that advantage, the area of the windows became bigger, which resulted in a brighter and more friendly atmosphere inside the church. The nave became higher and so did the pillars and the church steeple. The amibition to test out the limits of the architectural possibilities resulted in the collapse of several towers. In Germany and the Netherlands, but also in Spain, it became popular to build hall churches, in which every vault has the same height.\n\nCathedrals were built in a very lavish way, as in the romanesque era. Examples for that are the Notre-Dame de Paris and the Notre-Dame de Reims in France, but also the San Francesco d’Assisi in Palermo, the Salisbury Cathedral and the Wool Church in Lavenham, England.\n\nMany gothic churches contain features from the romanesque era. Some of the most well-known gothic churches stayed unfinished for hundreds of years, after the gothic style was not popular anymore. About half of the Cologne Cathedral was for example build in the 19th century.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the Renaissance and the Reformation also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The basilica was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead hall churches were built. Typical features are columns and classical capitals.\n\nIn Protestant churches, where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the pulpit.\n\nThe baroque style was first used in Italy around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence.The use of forms known from the renaissance were extremely exaggerated. Domes and capitals were decorated with moulding and the former stucco-sculptures were replaced by fresco paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the rococo era.\n\nThe Protestant parishes preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the pulpit and the altar.\n\nA common architecture for churches is the shape of a cross (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the altar space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a dome or other large vaulted space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an octagon or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the spire, a tall tower on the \"west\" end of the church or over the crossing.\n\nAnother common feature of many Christian churches is the eastwards orientation of the front altar. \nOften, the altar will not be oriented due east, but in the direction of sunrise. This tradition originated in Byzantium in the 4th century, and becomes prevalent in the West in the 8th to 9th century. \nThe old Roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the 11th century even in areas of northern Europe under Frankish rule, as seen in Petershausen (Constance), Bamberg Cathedral, Augsburg Cathedral, Regensburg Cathedral, and Hildesheim Cathedral.\n\nThe Latin word basilica (derived from Greek, \"Basiliké Stoà\", Royal \"Stoa\") was originally used to describe a Roman public building (as in Greece, mainly a tribunal), usually located in the forum of a Roman town.\n\nAfter the Roman Empire became officially Christian, the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the Pope. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.\n\nA cathedral is a church, usually Catholic, Anglican, Oriental Orthodox or Eastern Orthodox, housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from \"cathedra\", or Bishop's Throne (In ). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.\n\nA church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building. It might be as small as Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford, England, Sacred Heart Cathedral in Raleigh, United States, or Chur Cathedral in Switzerland. However, frequently, the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches, was the largest building in any region.\n\nA pilgrimage church is a church to which pilgrimages are regularly made, or a church along a pilgrimage route, often located at the tomb of a saints, or holding icons or relics to which miraculous properties are ascribed, the site of Marian apparitions, etc.\n\nA conventual church (or monastery church, minster, \"katholikon\") is the main church building in a Christian monastery or abbey.\n\nA collegiate church is a church where the daily office of worship is maintained by a college of canons, which may be presided over by a dean or provost.\nCollegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church, or by tithe income from appropriated benefices. They commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community.\n\nOld and disused church buildings can be seen as an interesting proposition for developers as the architecture and location often provide for attractive homes or city centre entertainment venues On the other hand, many newer churches have decided to host meetings in public buildings such as schools, universities, cinemas or theatres.\n\nThere is another trend to convert old buildings for worship rather than face the construction costs and planning difficulties of a new build. Unusual venues in the UK include an old Tram power station, a former bus garage, an old cinema and bingo hall, a former Territorial Army Drill Hall, and a former synagogue. A windmill has also been converted into a church at Reigate Heath.\nThere has been an increase in partnerships between church management and private real estate companies to redevelop church properties into mixed uses. While it has garnered criticism from some, the partnership offers congregations the opportunity to increase revenue while preserving the property.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "727889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=727889", "title": "Dor Daim", "text": "Dor Daim\n\nThe Dardaim or Dor daim (), are adherents of the Dor Deah movement in Orthodox Judaism . (; Hebrew: \"generation of knowledge\", an allusion to the Israelites who witnessed the Exodus.) That movement took its name in 1912 in Yemen under Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, and had its own network of synagogues and schools, although, in actuality, the movement existed long before that name had been coined for it. According to ethnographer and historian, Shelomo Dov Goitein, author and historiographer Hayyim Habshush had been a member of this movement before it had been given the name \"Dor Deah\", writing, “...He (i.e. Hayyim Habshush) and his friends, partly under European influence, but driven mainly by developments among the Yemenite Jews themselves, formed a group who ardently opposed all those forces of mysticism, superstition and fatalism which were then so prevalent in the country and strove for exact knowledge and independent thought, and the application of both to life.” It was only some years later, when Rabbi Yihya Qafih became the headmaster of the new Jewish school in Sana'a built by the Ottoman Turks and where he wanted to introduce a new curriculum in the school whereby boys would also learn arithmetic and the rudiments of the Arabic and Turkish languages that Rabbi Yihya Yitzhak Halevi gave to Rabbi Qafih's movement the name \"Daradʻah\", a word which is an Arabic broken plural made-up of the Hebrew words \"Dör Deʻoh\", and which means \"Generation of Knowledge.\"\n\nIts objects were:\n\nToday there is no official Dor Dai movement, but the term is used for individuals and synagogues within the Yemenite community (mostly in Israel) who share the original movement's perspectives. There are also some groups, both within and outside the Yemenite community, holding a somewhat similar stance, who describe themselves as \"talmide ha-Rambam\" (disciples of Maimonides) rather than \"Dor Daim\".\n\nSince the early Middle Ages the Yemenite Jewish community followed the teachings of Maimonides on almost all legal issues, and their prayer book was substantially identical to the text set out in his \"Sefer Ahavah\". This is attested by the writings of several well known Rabbis such as Nahmanides, Obadiah of Bertinoro and the Maharitz. The Yemenite tradition is therefore separate from both the Sephardi and the Ashkenazi streams in Judaism.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the teachings of the Kabbalah, especially in the form advocated by Isaac Luria and his school, became increasingly popular in Yemen as in other countries. This did not always mean a change in the liturgy; Luria himself held that it was essential to keep to the form of prayers inherited from one's ancestors, so that one's prayers reached the gate in Heaven appropriate to one's tribe. However, many individuals and communities around the world (principally Mizrahi Jews but also Ḥasidim) discarded their ancestral rites in favor of the modified Sephardic rite used by Luria and his immediate circle, on the reasoning that this form of prayer reached a \"thirteenth gate\" for those who did not know their tribe.\n\nThis division would be reflected among the Yemenite Jews. The Shami sub-group adopted a Sephardic-influenced rite, in no small part due to its essentially being forced upon them. Others retained the Yemenite ancestral liturgy, whether or not they accepted the Zoharic/Lurianic Kabbalah theologically. In the 18th century, to ensure the continued use of the Yemenite's original text, Rabbi Yiḥyah Salaḥ (known as the Maharitz) promoted compromise and introduced a new edition of the Yemenite Jewish prayer book which he created. It substantially followed the traditional Yemenite (Maimonidean) ritual, but made some concessions to the Kabbalists, for example by incorporating the hymn Lechah Dodi. This new standard became known as \"Baladi\" (meaning \"of the country\", i.e. Yemen), in contrast to the adopted Lurianic-Sephardic ritual which was known as \"Shami\" (literally \"northern\", meaning Palestinian or Damascene). The distinction also affected questions of Jewish law, with the Baladi community continuing to follow Maimonides almost exclusively while the Shami community also accepted the Shulchan Aruch.\n\nOver time more and more Kabbalistic practices became popular among the Yemenite Jews to the point that the \"Baladi\" community became localized as a significant population only around the area of Yemen's capital city, Sana'a. Today, with the majority of Yemenite Jewry being outside of Yemen and in closer contact with Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, it could be perceived that the proportion with which the Dor Daim perspective is spreading (though in a different form than the original) is not much different from the rate at which Yemenite Jews as a whole are giving up their unique traditions and assimilating into mainstream Judaism.\n\n\"Dor Daim\" emerged as a recognizable force in the later part of the 19th century. The Dor Daim movement was formed by individuals who were displeased by the influence of Kabbalah which had been introduced to Yemen in the 17th century. They believed that the core beliefs of Judaism were rapidly diminishing in favor of the mysticism of the Kabbalah. Displeased by the direction that education and the social development of Yemen was taking, they opened their own educational system in Yemen (see Dor Daim and Iqshim). They were also unhappy with the influence that Kabbalists (mystics) were having on various customs and rituals (e.g. the text of the prayer book), in addition to a strong superstitious influence which they saw as contrary to Maimonides. For example, Rabbi Yosef Qafeh relates one of many Yemenite customs for \"חינוך הבית\" whereby they would bake plain bread without salt and prepare \"the table of appeasement.\" Inviting more than 10 children aged seven or eight who waited outside, they set the table, scattering thin-ash upon it; crumbled the plain bread into bits, placing them upon the table holding the ashes; and exited the kitchen stating, to the demons (Hebrew: שדים), \"this is your portion.\" Shortly thereafter they would abruptly open its doors, whereupon the children burst in, grabbing the saltless pieces and eating them. Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafeh sharply opposed these \"minhagim\" being of the opinion that, in addition to the stupidity of the matter, they are Biblically forbidden because of \"darchei haEmori\".\n\nThe Dor Daim considered the Kabbalists to be irrational in attitude and felt that they were thereby contributing to a decline in the social and economic status of the Yemenite Jews. The above-mentioned issues led Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ to spearhead the Dor Daim movement. Among its goals was the revival and protection of what it saw as the original form of Judaism as codified by the Sanhedrin during the 1st through 3rd centuries.\n\nThe movement was not well received by some scholars in Yemen and Israel. Especially controversial were the views of the Dor Daim on the most popularized book of Kabbalah known as the Zohar. These views are put forth in a book called \"Milhamoth HaShem\" (Wars of the Lord). A group of Jerusalem rabbis published an attack on Rabbi Qafiḥ under the title of \"Emunat Hashem\" (Faith of the Lord), taking measures to ostracize members of the movement; notwithstanding, not even the Yemenite rabbis who opposed the dardaim heeded this ostracism. Instead, they intermarried, sat together in \"batei midrash\", and continued to sit with Rabbi Yiḥyeh Qafeh in \"beth din\".\n\nFrom this time Yemenite Jews may be classified as Shami, mainstream Baladi and Dor Dai or \"Rambamist\". A term frequently used by Dor Daim for Yemenites who accept the Zohar is \"Iqq'shim\" (Hebrew: עִקְּשִׁים), i.e., \"obscurantists\".\n\nAn important later Yemenite authority was Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ's grandson, Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ, who edited many important works by Maimonides and Saadia Gaon (see his published works) as well as issuing two new editions of the Baladi prayer book. Unlike his grandfather he avoided expressing any opinion on the Zohar, beyond saying that it was preferable to draw one's spiritual sustenance from the works of Maimonides. There is therefore some doubt about whether Rabbi Qafiḥ junior should be regarded as a Dor Dai or as a mainstream Baladi. His intention was probably to reconcile the two groups, in the same way as the Maharitz tried to reconcile traditionalists and Kabbalists.\n\nThere is no official Dor Dai organization thus they are hard to identify. Many individuals are reluctant to identify themselves by that name for fear of persecution. Some of the original Dor Dai synagogues in Israel survive, but have moved nearer to the mainstream Baladi tradition in the same way as Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ. Similarly, there is no universally recognized leader for the movement. The successor of Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ as leader of the Yemenite community as a whole is generally considered to be Rabbi Ratzon Arusi of Qiryat Ono.\n\nToday's adherents have great respect for the Yemenite tradition in general however, they are not exclusively Yemenite in origin and may describe themselves as \"talmide ha-Rambam\" (disciples of Maimonides) rather than as \"Dor Daim.\" In 2005, there was a widely publicized gathering of hilltop settlers of Yemenite descent describing themselves as \"Dor Daim\", but it is unclear how far these represent the historic Dor Dai movement.\n\nDor Daim place particular importance on the Jewish doctrine of the absolute unity of God, which they believe has been compromised by the popular forms of Kabbalah prevalent today. In support of this, they appeal to the philosophical writings of various Geonim and Rishonim such as Saadia Gaon, Rabbenu Bahya ibn Paquda, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi and Maimonides. The following points concerning the Almighty's Unity are in particular emphasized both by Dor Daim and \"talmide ha-Rambam\":\n\nNote: None of these are controversial - mainstream Judaism has substantially the same beliefs.\n\n\nIn the book \"Milhamoth HaShem\", one finds that possibly the most fundamental issue the Dor Daim had (and have) with the popularly accepted understanding of Kabbalah concerns the absolute transcendent Singularity/Oneness of the Creator and the laws against \"avodah zarah\" (forbidden forms of devotion/idolatry). The Dor Daim believe that the popular forms of Kabbalah prevalent today are contrary to the absolute and incomparable Unity of the Creator and violate various laws against idolatry and polytheism, in particular the prohibition against \"Ribbuy Reshuyoth\" (worshipping or conceiving of a multiplicity of reigns) referred to by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah.\n\nThe issue is not the existence of Kabbalah as such. The \"word\" \"Kabbalah\" is used in older Jewish sources and by Maimonides to simply mean \"tradition\" and need not refer to mysticism of any kind. Furthermore, Dor Daim accept that in Talmudic times there was a secret mystical tradition in Judaism, known as \"Maaseh Bereshith\" (the work of creation) and \"Maaseh Merkavah\" (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these as respectively referring to something similar to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah. They simply reject the notion that this tradition is represented by the ideas popularly referred to as Kabbalah in our days.\n\nNeither Dor Daim nor \"talmide ha-Rambam\" are against mysticism per se. Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ, for example, published the ancient mystical text \"Sefer Yetzirah\" together with his translation of Saadia Gaon's commentary. Likewise, Bahya ibn Paquda and Abraham son of Maimonides (sometimes described as \"Jewish Sufis\") are especially respected among Dor Daim and \"talmide ha-Rambam\".\n\nIn particular a Dor Dai is not bound to reject the theory of the ten Sefirot, as set out in the \"Sefer Yetzirah\". In the \"Sefer Yetzirah\", unlike in later Kabbalah, there is no question of the Sefirot being Divine entities or even attributes: they are simply the numerals, considered as the dimensional parameters used in the creation of the world.\n\nWhat they view as the problem comes in with the Sefer ha-Bahir and the Zohar, where the Sefirot have become hypostatized as Divine attributes or emanations, and it seems that religious devotions can never be addressed directly to the \"En Sof\" (the Absolute) but only through one or other of the Sefirot; and in modern \"Edot ha-Mizrach\" prayer books each occurrence of the Divine Name is vocalized differently in a kind of code to show which Sefirah one should have in mind. This problem is compounded in the teachings of Isaac Luria as found in the writings of Ḥayim Vital, where it is held that as a result of some catastrophe in Heaven, the Sefirot vessels have fractured and their channels re-formed into a variously stated number of inter-relating personalised aspects within God's Manifestation known as Partzufim (from Greek προσωπα, faces), teaching that the purpose of each religious observance is to assist their unification. This is felt as being uncomfortably close to polytheism.\n\nThe original Dor Daim, such as Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, condemned the Zohar as an outright forgery and as filled with idolatry. Some of today's Dor Daim take a somewhat more moderate stance, allowing that the Zohar may contain elements of authentic Midrash together with a great deal of later interpolation, while considering the Zohar in its present form to be an unsafe guide, both to theology and to practice. Other segments of Orthodox Judaism which share this perspective of the Dor Daim, while not necessarily rejecting the Zohar itself, include most \"talmide ha-Rambam\" (disciples of Maimonides), as well as portions of the Modern Orthodox community and others. Those among these groups who do not reject the Zohar assert that the Kabbalah as popularly taught today represents a distortion of the Zohar's intended teachings. However, the specific issues identified by the Dor Daim remain in all current and older editions of the Zohar.\n\nA figure spoken of frequently in the esoteric works on Kabbalah, particularly in the Zohar, is what has come to be known as the \"lesser countenance\" (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), or the Demiurge, which term and its usage is believed to have been of Gnostic church origin, although in later years was seen by the kabbalists as one of the angels in heaven associated with the emotive faculties of the soul and with the concept of \"finite power.\" The same figure is also known in Latin writings as \"Microprosopus\", derived from the Greek \"mikros\" small + \"prosopon\" face, and is said to have a father. Certain kabbalists allege that our prayers and our worship go unto the \"lesser countenance\", and that the world was created by him. To Rabbi Yehiya al-Qafih, such statements amounted to heresy, since there was none other but God who created the universe and unto whom, alone, we are to pray.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Rabbi Avraham Isaac Kook, the chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine, Rabbi Yihya Qafih argues effectually that such beliefs stand in contradiction to the Law bequeathed to us by Moses. He levels harsh criticism against the Zohar for its endorsement of heretical teachings, such as that of the \"lesser countenance\" (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), as well as against the new kabbalists who claim that \"lesser countenance\" is our God and we are his people, such as described by \"Sefer HaBrit\" (Article 20, item # 15) and by \"Yosher Levav\" (page 4), and who allege wrongly that it was he who brought us out of the land of Egypt, and that his wife (who is \"Malkhut\") was she who smote the Egyptians in Egypt and at the sea, while it was he who revealed himself unto Israel at Mount Sinai and gave to us his Divine Law All these things, Rabbi Qafih alleged, should be expunged from our religion, since the import of the Torah is clear that only God, and God alone, had done all these things for Israel.\n\nAnother matter of dispute between Dor Daim and the Kabbalists concerns the Dor Daim's rejection of reincarnation. They support their rejection with writings of Saadia Gaon (892-942) who dismissed reincarnation as an unauthentic Jewish belief. This perspective is shared not only by non-Dor Dai disciples of Rambam (Maimonides) but also by many in mainstream Orthodox Judaism.\n\nDor Daim also disapprove of requesting from any unseen force other than the Almighty. They are against soliciting angels or Jewish leaders who have died. They disapprove of such practices regardless of one's location, and even if the individual desires that the angel or saint intercede with God. Dor Daim, indeed all \"Meqoriim\", consider such practices absolutely antithetical to the most essential principles of what they believe to be historical Judaism: to serve the One Incomparable Creator without joining partners or mediators together with Him in our prayers and worship. This is based on their understanding of the books mentioned above, and specifically on the laws concerning mediator (\"sarsur\") or an advocate (\"melitz\") mentioned in the Mishneh Torah and the fifth of the Thirteen Principles of Faith. Prayer, in Judaism, is a form of worship: as the ancient sages of Israel are well known to have stated, \"What is the service of the heart? This is prayer.\"\n\nIn addition to the issue of invoking forces other than the Almighty, Dor Daim and \"Meqoriim\" in general disapprove of the common practice of visiting the graves, shrines, or monuments of saints, even if an individual does not request from a force other than the Almighty. Basing themselves on Talmudic sources codified in the Mishneh Torah, they believe this to be a prohibition instituted by the Sages of the Great Court established under Moses - the Sanhedrin. They generally consider this prohibition to have been instituted as a means to distance the people of Israel from the possibility of transgressing what \"Meqoriim\" consider to be the Biblical-prohibitions of establishing a \"monument\" (prohibited even without any connection to idolatry) and from invoking any force other than the Almighty. This, they point out, is the very same reason Jewish tradition explains why Moses' burial place was left unknown according to the Biblical record.\n\nDor Daim disapprove of what they believe to be an abandonment of a number of Talmudic practices on the part of a large portion of the Jewish world in favor of newer customs and innovations, some of which, in their opinion, are even contrary to Talmudic law. In particular this disapproval is aimed at customs derived from the Kabbalah, but it is not confined to them. In their view, and still more in the view of the \"talmide ha-Rambam\", there is simply no constitutional authority in Jewish law to institute new rules or practices, whether in the direction of leniency or of severity, since the demise of the Sanhedrin in 425 CE, or at the latest the closure of the Talmud, and the role of later rabbis is confined to teaching and codification of the law as it stood at that date. They do not claim that this position is ideal, and would gladly see a revived Sanhedrin sort out the problems in Jewish law, provided that it was itself established in strict conformity to law.\n\nIn their view, the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides is the most accurate and therefore most authoritative statement of Talmudic law, and is in itself a sufficient reference without resort to any other source. Maimonides writes that if the Mishneh Torah was intended to be explained by the Talmud he wouldn't have written the Mishneh Torah. Furthermore, the current text of the Talmud is fairly corrupt with numerous textual variants; from this, coupled with Maimonides' indications that he had far more accurate and complete Talmudic texts available to him, they conclude that the Mishneh Torah provides the best access to what the Talmud must originally have intended.\n\nUnlike many of the later \"talmide ha-Rambam\", the original Dor Daim were not committed to the view that all local custom, whether Sephardi or Ashkenazi or from any other source, is totally illegitimate to the extent that it differs from normative Jewish law (as best stated, in their view, by Maimonides), so they preserved certain non-Maimonidean Yemenite peculiarities in minor matters. However they did believe, in reliance on old authorities such as Joseph Caro and David ibn abi Zimra, that the views of Maimonides ought to be authoritative not only in Yemen but also in Eretz Yisrael, Egypt and the Near East generally.\n\nThere is a link between the Dor Daim's stance on Jewish law and on the other issues, as one argument for accepting the Mishneh Torah as the best restatement of Jewish law is that most of the later codifiers, including Joseph Caro, were believers in Kabbalah and should therefore not be accepted as authorities. As against this, many (e.g. Yeshayahu Leibowitz) argue that Caro and the others were operating within the rigorous rules of halachic reasoning and that their conclusions were in no way affected or invalidated by their personal theological views (just as, from the opposite perspective, Maimonides' status as a halachic authority is not affected by his acceptance of Greek philosophy). The Dor Daim reply to this is that Caro specifically allows the Zohar as a (limited and subordinate) source of rulings in Jewish law, so that his code includes practices found in Kabbalistic texts without basis in Talmudic texts.\n\nThose aspects of Jewish/Talmudic law which Dor Daim may emphasize, be particularly passionate about, and/or consider to have been cast aside by large portions of the Jewish world include:\n\n\nDor Daim usually use Yosef Qafiḥ's edition of the Baladi prayer book. This is on the lines of the prayer book of the Maharitz, and therefore contains some Kabbalistic insertions, enabling the book to be used by mainstream Baladi Jews. However, these insertions are clearly marked by footnotes as being later additions. Dor Daim can therefore use this prayer book and simply omit these additions.\n\nAs previously explained, the Baladi/Shami distinction does not always coincide with the Dor Daim/Iqshim distinction. That is, while a Dor Dai is necessarily a Baladi, and a Shami is necessarily an Iqshi (Kabbalist), most Baladim occupy an intermediate point on the spectrum and may or may not accord some validity to Kabbalah.\n\nThe distinguishing mark of a Baladi individual or community is the use of the traditional liturgy, regardless of the underlying theological or intellectual orientation. Some Baladim may sympathize to a greater or lesser extent with the Dor Dai distrust of Zoharic and Lurianic Kabbalah. Others may accept the Lurianic version of Kabbalah but retain the ancestral liturgy on the ground that, even according to Luria, this is the Kabbalistically correct thing to do. Others again may have no particular views one way or the other. However, Baladim of all shades uniformly accept the Mishneh Torah rather than the Shulchan Aruch as their authority on Jewish law.\n\nOutwardly the practices of Baladi Jews and Dor Daim are almost identical, apart from some Kabbalistic insertions to be found in the Baladi prayer book. However most Baladim, while holding that the Mishneh Torah is the best interpretation of Jewish law, are content to preserve it as the particular custom of their group and do not seek to delegitimize the customs of other Jewish communities. (How far the Dor Daim seek to do this is a matter of debate.)\n\nSeveral of the above-listed distinctions between Dor Daim and the majority of world Jewry are shared by all traditional Baladi Yemenite Jews, and not just by Dor Daim. On matters of law and practice as opposed to theology, the only difference between Dor Daim and the rest of Baladi Yemenite Jews appears to be the level of zeal in preserving the above listed practices, although exceptions do exist.\n\nDor Daim are regarded as part of a wider trend within Judaism known as \"talmide ha-Rambam\" (pupils of Maimonides), not necessarily confined to the Yemenite community. It is important to note that although Dor Daim always identify with the Rambam's legal and theological perspectives on Judaism (\"hashkafa\"), Dor Daim and \"talmide ha-Rambam\" are not necessarily one and the same. That is, a disciple of the Rambam may or may not be a Dor Dai; however, a Dor Dai will always be (in a broader sense) a disciple of the Rambam.\n\nToday's \"talmide ha-Rambam\" differ from the original Dor Daim in two ways.\n\n\nIn short, \"talmide ha-Rambam\" are less extreme than Dor Daim about the Zohar and more extreme about \"Maimonides-only\" jurisprudence. Nevertheless, the similarities between the two groups, as expressed in the list of beliefs and practices above, overwhelmingly outnumber the differences.\n\nMany members of the small and slowly growing Dor Dai community claim a fear of persecution and therefore maintain an almost secret existence. It is very likely that the entire movement of Dor Daim, together with some of their well-known leaders, has helped, and continues to help, fuel the rapidly growing community of \"talmide ha-Rambam\". It is undeniable that, while there are sometimes differences between Dor Daim and \"talmide ha-Rambam\" as a whole—over certain details of practical Jewish law and the issue of the Zohar—the two communities continue to have strong links.\n\nAs stated, \"talmide ha-Rambam\" differ from Dor Daim in that they are not confined to the Yemenite community and need not be committed to specifically Yemenite customs. Nonetheless Yemenite scholarship and practice are still a major resource for them. Two good examples of this are seen in the works of Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ and of Mechon-Mamre.org. \n\nDor Daim and \"Rambamists\" are most easily recognized by the manner in which their Tzitzit are tied (according to the Rambam, despite slight variations in understanding). Temani/Rambam Tzitzit can be distinguished from those of the many 'knitted kippa' youths who have adopted the same style, but have added Tekhelet. Rambamists and Baladim are also noticeable by the fact that they wear their Tallit in a different manner from non-Yemenite Jews, and even wear it on Friday nights/Erev Shabbath, which is almost unheard of in non-Yemenite synagogues (apart from a handful of Hasidim in Jerusalem, referred to as \"Yerushalmis\", who wear it very discreetly so as to not look arrogant).\n\nDor Daim as well as non-Yemenite or non-Dor Dai students of the Rambam all find a certain level of commonality with individuals who sometimes call themselves \"Gaonists\". \"Gaonists\" aim at applying Jewish law in everyday life according to the writings of the Geonim as a whole without singling out any one particular Gaon or codification of Jewish law over another. The commonality between all of these groups is sourced in their shared pursuit of living according to the original understanding of Talmudic law as much as possible with as little influence from the effects of almost 2,000 years of exile as possible. These groups together are sometimes referred to as \"Meqoriim\" (originalists/followers of the originals).\n\nThe dispute between Dor Daim and \"Aqashim\" has some similarities to that between Mitnaggedim and Hasidim, with the Vilna Gaon and his heirs standing for Talmudic intellectualism and a Halachic worldview like Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ. However, mainstream Litvish Jews venerate the Zohar and Luria, and like the Hasidim their elite write Kabbalistic commentaries. Joseph Dan writes that there is no truth to the popular notion that the Mitnaggedim were more rationalist than the Hasidim; Lurianic notions dominate in the theologies of both camps. Their dispute can be seen as a battle within two conceptions of Lurianic kabbalah; the Mitnaggedim being faithful to received Kabbalah, while the Hasidim introduced new conceptions into theirs, particularly new conceptions of mystical leadership. On the whole, Mitnagdic-Litvish Judaism accepted Kabbalah, but had a distinctive \"intellectualist\" understanding of it.\n\nDifferent interpretations of Luria arose among his followers regarding whether tzimtzum (withdrawal of Divinity from Creation) should be taken literally or metaphorically. Hasidism read it metaphorically and immanently, leading to Panentheism. Mitnaggedism read it transcendentally in relation to Man, leading to Theism, though allowing validity to Panentheism solely from the Divine perspective. Shneur Zalman of Liadi accused the Vilna Gaon of taking tzimtzum literally and not following Luria fully, though Mitnaggedic Kabbalists rejected this. It seems that the Vilna Gaon, who wrote extensive Kabbalistic works, followed the Lurianic system, but diverged from Luria when he felt the Zohar lent itself to another approach. The issue is the subject of forewords to the main texts of Lithuanian Kabbalah: the introduction, by Rabbi Ḥayyim of Volozhin, to the Vilna Gaon's commentary to the \"Sifra di-Tsniuta\" and Rabbi Yitzchak Eizik Chaver's \"Pitchei Shearim\".\n\nIn his \"Nefesh HaHayyim\", Hayyim Volozhin, founder of the Litvish Yeshiva movement and main theorist of Mitnaggedism, responds to the theology of Schneur Zalman's \"Tanya\" based on different interpretation of the same Kabbalistic sources. Their difference revolves around alternate identifications between Divine Immanence/Transcendence and Divine Monism/Pluralism. For Hayyim Volozhin and Mitnaggedic-Litvish Judaism: Man relates to transcendent Theism intellectually through Talmud and Halacha, rather than to immanent Panentheism through Hasidic devekut. Kabbalah is reserved for the elite, rather than popularised in Hasidism. Elite Mitnaggedic prayer uses Kabbalistic worldview to relate to the ultimate non-existence of Creation from the Divine perspective. For the mainstream, spirituality is through Talmudic study and Halachic worldview for its own sake.\n\nRegarding Jewish Law, those of the Vilna Gaon's successors who were associated with the Volozhin yeshiva, such as the Brisker group and in particular Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, had a very high regard for the Mishneh Torah and held it as the best tool for the theoretical understanding of the Talmud and of Jewish law generally. When however it came to practical legal rulings, an activity of which they steered clear when possible, they adhered to the normative Ashkenazi version of Halakha, as set out in the Shulchan Aruch and the glosses of Moses Isserles.\n\nThere are various groups in Israel today which claim to follow the Vilna Gaon. These may be found in places as diverse as the Neturei Karta and the fringes of Religious Zionism, the latter group being represented by the Aderet Eliyahu yeshiva. Their intellectualist orientation has some similarities to that of the Dor Daim, though also venerating Kabbalah.\n\nSome thinkers of a \"mitnagged\" cast of thought, however, such as Yeshayahu Leibowitz, reject Zoharic Kabbalah and praise the work of Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ.\n\nDor Daim and other Yemenite \"talmide ha-Rambam\" like to compare themselves to the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, and think of them as \"the other Rambam Jews\". This is largely because of their shared scepticism about the Zohar. The resemblance has however been exaggerated.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews preserve an early form of the Sephardic liturgy from before the expulsion from Spain, which reflected some, but only very limited, influence from the Kabbalah and the Zohar. In the 16th and early 17th centuries they adopted a certain number of Lurianic observances in a piecemeal fashion, for example the Tu Bishvat seder. After the Sabbatai Zevi debacle these observances were largely dropped, because it was felt that Lurianic Kabbalah had contributed to the disaster. The arguments against the authenticity of the Zohar advanced by Jacob Emden and Leone di Modena were also influential. At the present day the general Spanish and Portuguese attitude to the Kabbalah is one of indifference rather than hostility. As Spanish and Portuguese communities act as hosts for Sephardi Jews of many other backgrounds, there would be no bar on individuals regarding Kabbalah more positively. In particular, the Lurianic Kabbalah had a following in the Jewish community of Livorno, which falls within the Spanish and Portuguese group but was the main point of contact between it and the Levantine Sephardim. The Spanish and Portuguese group's closest resemblance would therefore be not to Dor Daim but to mainstream Baladi Yemenites.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews admire Maimonides and identify with the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. However, they cannot be classified as \"Rambamists\" in the sense required, as their religious law is based squarely on the \"Bet Yosef\" of Joseph Caro, subject to certain liturgical customs peculiar to themselves. It could even be argued that they follow Caro more closely than any other group, as many other Sephardim, especially the eastern communities influenced by the Ben Ish Chai, regard Isaac Luria as having equal or even greater authority than Caro.\n\nThe above describes the attitude of traditional communities such as London and Amsterdam. In some newer communities, in particular among the followers of José Faur and Yaakov Oliveira, a more purist and principled attitude has evolved, which does place considerable emphasis on the Mishneh Torah; however they also utilize the Shulchan Aruch in their lectures in order to help promote the study of practical Jewish law amongst the greater Jewish community.\n\n1. There are those who would claim that Dor Daim and even all students of the Rambam are heretics by reason of their non-acceptance of Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah. This claim depends on the assumption that the Lurianic Kabbalah is a dogma of Judaism binding upon all Jews. Not only the Dor Daim and \"talmide ha-Rambam\", but many other Orthodox groups, such as the followers of the Vilna Gaon along with many of the non-Hasidic Orthodox, would disagree with this assumption, regardless of whether or not they personally accept the Lurianic Kabbalah. Such a view, according to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, does not make the Dor Daim heretics. Moreover, Rabbis Eliyahu Dessler and Gedaliah Nadel maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship. Already over 200 years ago the Noda Bihudah, in his sefer \"Derushei HaTzlach\", argued that the Zohar is to be considered unreliable as it came into our hands many hundreds of years after Rashbi's death and in the absence of an unbroken \"mesorah\", among other reasons.\n\nThe Dor Dai response is that whether a person or school is heretical is a question of law, to be decided according to authoritative works of halakha: one is not a heretic simply for disagreeing with a widely held aggadic interpretation, unless the \"halakha\" specifically says so. The Mishneh Torah is comprehensive in scope and is, at the very least, \"one\" of the authoritative sources of \"halakha\", so to follow it must be an acceptable way of doing Judaism. Accordingly, since the Dor Daim assert nothing that is not found within the four corners of the Mishneh Torah, and the Mishneh Torah cannot be interpreted as actually requiring belief in anything approaching Zoharic or Lurianic Kabbalah, they cannot be heretics - unless the Mishneh Torah itself is heretical, which is not held by any mainstream Jewish group.\"\n\n2. Others believe that the main problem is not that Dor Daim do not follow Kabbalah for themselves, but that they delegitimize those who do follow it. Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, for instance, held that one must not use parchments written by, or eat meat slaughtered by, believers in Kabbalah because these are dedicated to \"Zeir Anpin\" (one of the \"partzufim\" of the 10 sephirot), a concept apparently distinct from the Unfathomable Almighty Creator.\n\nFew Dor Daim take such an extreme view today, as most consider that the above reasoning makes Jewish law too uncertain in practice. Those who do take such a view would argue that it is not at all uncommon in Judaism for one group to treat as invalid the ritual acts or objects of another for technical or doctrinal reasons. That does not amount to an attempt to exclude the other group from Judaism.\n\n3. A third criticism is that Dor Daim take works of Kabbalah too literally: it is intended to be myth and metaphor, and to subject it to rigorous analysis as the Dor Daim do is like trying to construe a work of poetry as if it were a statute. Works of Kabbalah themselves contain warnings that the teachings should not be exposed to common view or read too realistically, and that to do so is indeed to incur the danger of falling into heresy or idolatry.\n\nThe Dor Dai response to this is that, however this may be in theory, these warnings have not been observed. Kabbalah, in its most literal and \"realistic\" sense, has in fact been extensively popularised, with the result that many otherwise pious Jewish groups are now permeated with superstition, so that the whole enterprise is now more trouble than it is worth. Further, the claim that these works, on their true interpretation, are harmless metaphorical imagery fully compatible with monotheism is disingenuous: the origins of most Kabbalistic concepts in pagan systems such as Neoplatonism and Gnosticism are too glaringly obvious to be ignored. (Dor Daim do not claim that Kabbalists are in fact polytheists: only that they are inconsistent.)\n\n4. A fourth criticism is that it is a stultification of Jewish law to regard any authority, even one as eminent as Maimonides, as final. The essence of Oral Law is that it is case law rather than code law, and needs to be interpreted in each generation: otherwise the Mishneh Torah could simply have been handed down as part of the written Torah. For this reason, it is a principle of Jewish law that \"Jephthah in his generation is as Samuel in his generation\": one is bound by the current authorities, rather than by previous authorities however objectively superior.\n\nThe Dor Dai response to this is that the acceptance of Maimonides in the Yemenite community has always been regarded as a legitimate version of Jewish law, and that they are no more stultified by the authority of Maimonides than other Jewish communities are by the authority of the Shulchan Aruch. From the practical point of view Jewish law as codified by Maimonides is as compatible with modern conditions as any later code: if anything more so, as later Jewish law has become enmeshed in many unnecessary intellectual tangles. If there are practical problems caused by this \"static\" view of Jewish law, that is part of the price of exile: the question is not whether a given reform would be desirable, but whether there is constitutional authority to make it, and in their view there is not.\n\n5. A final criticism is that the Dor Dai version of Judaism is disquietingly reminiscent of militant Islamic trends such as Salafism. Both started out as modernising movements designed to remove some of the cobwebs and allow the religion to compete in the modern world, and both have ended up as fundamentalist groups lending themselves to alliances with political extremism. Both disapprove of mysticism (Kabbalah or Sufism) and praying at tombs; both tend to dismiss more moderate coreligionists as unbelievers (see Takfir); both cut out centuries of sophisticated legal scholarship in favour of an every-man-for-himself \"back to the sources\" approach.\n\nThe Dor Daim answer to this is:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8642050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8642050", "title": "Espiritismo", "text": "Espiritismo\n\nEspiritismo (Portuguese and Spanish for \"Spiritism\") is a term used in Latin America and the Caribbean to refer to the popular belief that good and evil spirits can affect health, luck and other aspects of human life.\n\nEspiritismo shares many of its fundamental concepts with 19th century Spiritualism as was practiced in the United States and Europe. During this period, several books on mediumship and spiritual practices became available in the Caribbean and Latin America. As many Native Americans and people of African descent had long standing traditions of ancestor worship and trance possession, Spiritualism was readily absorbed into and adapted to these pre-existing belief systems.\n\nMany \"espíritas\" or \"espiritistas\" (Espiritismo practitioners) communicate with spirits in a gathering of like-minded believers known as a \"misa\" (mass, in Spanish). Most practitioners will have an altar called a \"mesa\" (table, in Portuguese) ou \"mesas brancas\" (white table, in Portuguese). These sessions are somewhat akin to the séances of American-style Spiritualism of the 19th to the present. Many Espiritistas' practices, however, have elements of magic ritual which are not traditionally found in mainstream Spiritualist denomimations, but are often found in Spiritualist denominations associated with the spiritual church movement.\n\nA tenet of Espiritismo is a belief in a supreme God who is the omnipotent creator of the universe. There is also a belief in a spirit world inhabited by entities that can gradually evolve intellectually and morally. Espiritistas believe these beings can influence the world in various ways and that the espiritistas, in turn, can also influence the actions of the spirits.\n\nEspiritismo has never had a single leader nor center of practice, and as such its practice varies greatly between individuals and groups. In all cases, Espiritismo has absorbed various practices from other religious and spiritual practices endemic to Latin America and the Caribbean, such as Roman Catholicism, Curanderismo, Afro-Brazilian Macumba, Santería, Vodou, Shinto, and Neo-Pagan cults like Antinous.\n\nAn example of this syncretism is a magical spell that involves asking Saint Martha to exert one's will over that of another person by burning a specially prepared candle, saying certain prayers, and wearing an amulet tied with a red ribbon around one's waist.\n\nIn other cases, the goals and methods of the Espiritista are less obviously in the realm of magic and might be considered a form of folk medicine or alternative medicine. Whatever the desired effect, the equipment and materials used for Espiritismo may often be purchased at a botánica within the practitioners' community.\n\nThe Espiritismo differs from the Spiritism as the first consist of the syncretic religious practices described above while the second is the established religion-doutrine itself, directly based coding Allan Kardec's and other mediums' books, such as those from Francisco Xavier and Divaldo Franco.\n\nDuring Cuba's first war of independence (1868–1878), certain Cubans began to prefer the Espiritismo to the conservative style of Catholicism. Those who suffered the greatest in the war, particularly those living in the east, abandoned their belief system and turned to Espiritismo. As a result, Cuban Catholicism was criticized and discarded by ma Cubans. The straightforward rituals and the possibility of a connection with the spirits of the deceased appealed to many Cubans during this period of hardships and social discontent. \n\nThis form of Espiritismo was largely contained to the urban areas of Cuba. Its followers would study the writings and concepts of Kardec. During the rituals, its members are seated around a white linen covered table in an attempt to connect with spirits within a séance. The spirit usually enters the body of the medium that is present at the table. At this time, those individuals seated around the table have the ability to ask questions to spirits who have entered the world through the mediums. Furthermore, the spirit(s) is seen as a source to possible solutions to problems that are plaguing people. In addition, the spirit will manifest itself in a variety of ways dependent on the level of intensity of the spirit.\n\nThose participating in the rituals have certain duties they must fulfill prior to and during the ritual. They must remain in a mediated position and will most likely use prayers, hymns and music from Kardec's works. Many times, these rituals involve a small group of people, but private rituals do exist.\n\nThe origin of this branch of Espiritismo is derived from its ritual. The ritual associated with Espiritismo de Cordon is physically, mentally and emotionally difficult. Those participating in the ritual stand in a circle holding hands while walking in a counterclockwise fashion. At the same time, they are chanting and beating the floor with their feet and swinging their arms forcefully until they fall into a trance. The heavy breathing and stamping serve one specific purpose. The noises that are made create a hypnotic noise that leads the medium into a trance. Upon reaching this particular state of mind, the medium can contact the spirits for solutions to problems or aliments.\n\nThe main focus for this particular branch of Espiritismo is healing. The ranking of the mediums that are required in the rituals is rather simple. Their achievements to solve problems and heal people will allow them to have a higher ranking. There is no clergy found within Espiritismo de Cordon. The Head Medium is generally in charge of the ritual space, but does not always participate in the ritual chain itself. Instead, the Head Medium acts as the guide during the actual ritual. The altar, which is used in Espiritismo de Cordon, takes up a rather large area. The space is usually purified to drive out any evil spirits and welcome good spirits. The entrance is protected by a large bowl of water and all who enter must wash their hands to prevent the spread of evil spirits. Espiritismo de Cordon is different from other religions in the sense that it does not have a set doctrine of beliefs. The religion is open to everyone and does not require new participants to partake in an initiation process.\n\nSome have said that Espiritismo de Cordon has three influences on its practices and doctrines: folk Catholicism, Kardecian Spiritism and African creeds, but the most recent investigations have determined that what was thought to be African roots are in fact the remaining of Taíno religious rituals and dances called \"areítos\".\n\nPuerto Rican Espiritismo shares many similarities in its origins to Cuban Espiritismo. The religious movement encountered many setbacks in its early years in Puerto Rico. Those who were caught practicing it were punished by the government and ostracized by the Catholic Church. Allan Kardec's books made their way into the country and were received well by the educated class. The movement did not despite all the roadblocks, which had been set up to prevent its spread in the country. There were two divisions within Puerto Rican Espiritismo. The first division was a middle class movement, which utilized the Kardecian methods in an attempt to enhance the development of the country. The other division applied towards to lower classes in both the rural and urban settings. This division is known as \"Indigenous Espiritismo\" and is synonymous to Puerto Rico and is the most popular in the country.\n\nPuerto Rican White Table Espiritismo follows the same ritual practices as found in Cuba. The attempt to achieve spiritual communication through a medium was widely practiced all over the island.http://www.dictionary.com/browse/spiritual\n\nThis religious practice is a result of the merging of both Espiritismo and Santería. There are distinct African influences found within this religion though the orishas that are used to communicate to the spirit world. During the rituals, the mediums have the ability to communicate with spirits but are possessed by the dead who are messengers of the orishas. Who many mistake to be the orishas themself.\n\nIn Santerismo, the leader is known as the Godfather (padrino) or Godmother (madrina) as seen in the Santería religious practices. The leader prays at the altar before taking his or her place beside the medium at the table. The leader is present when the possession takes place while religious music or Afro-Cuban chants are played to praise the orishas. Before to the ceremony, there is a religious cleansing of the area to remove any evil spirits. A prayer is said to Elegua to protect the entranceways from any unwelcome or evil spirits. Shortly after, prayers are recited to attract good spirits for the ritual. The ritual may end with an exorcism which can be acquired a number of ways. One way to achieve purification is through a sahumerio. A sahumerio requires the burning of charcoal, garlic, incense and herbs to extract evil spirits from the place as well as a washing with holy water.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "645516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=645516", "title": "Euronymous", "text": "Euronymous\n\nØystein Aarseth (; 22 March 1968 – 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem and was the only constant member from the band's formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete.\n\nEuronymous professed to be a Satanist and was known for making extreme misanthropic statements. He presented himself as leading a militant cult-like group known as the \"Black Metal Inner Circle.\" \n\nIn August 1993, he was murdered by fellow musician Varg Vikernes.\n\nAarseth formed Mayhem in 1984 along with bassist Jørn \"Necrobutcher\" Stubberud and drummer Kjetil Manheim. At the time he was going by the stage name Destructor but later changed his name to Euronymous, derived from the demon Eurynomos which had inspired the Hellhammer song of the same name.\n\nIn summer 1986, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and Jon \"Metalion\" Kristiansen visited the German thrash metal band Assassin and recorded the \"Metalion in the Park\" demo under the name Checker Patrol, Metalion contributing background vocals to the title song \"Metalion in the Park.\"\n\nIn 1988, Per \"Dead\" Ohlin became Mayhem's vocalist and Jan Axel \"Hellhammer\" Blomberg became its drummer. By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kråkstad, which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous \"got on each other's nerves a lot\" and \"weren't really friends at the end.\" Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun. Varg Vikernes claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.\n\nOn 8 April 1991, Dead was found dead by Euronymous at his home with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead's death was considered suicide. Before calling the police, he went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: \"Dawn of the Black Hearts\". Necrobutcher recalls how Euronymous told him of the suicide:Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, \"Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself\". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, \"Relax, I have photos of everything\". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, \"OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures\".\n\nEuronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's \"evil\" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become \"trendy\" and commercialized. In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull. The band later denied the former rumor but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård \"Faust\" Eithun and Metalion.\n\nNecrobutcher later speculated that taking the photographs and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend dead. He claimed that Euronymous \"went into a fantasy world.\" Faust of Emperor believes that Dead's suicide \"marked the point at which, under Euronymous' direction, the black metal scene began its obsession with all things satanic and evil.\" Kjetil Manheim said that, after the suicide, Euronymous \"tried to be as extreme as he had talked about.\" The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior afterwards. Necrobutcher ended his friendship with Euronymous. Thus, after the suicide, Mayhem was left with only two members: guitarist Euronymous and drummer Hellhammer. Stian \"Occultus\" Johannsen was recruited as Mayhem's new singer and bassist. However, this was short-lived; he left the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous.\n\nDuring May–June 1991, Euronymous opened a record shop named \"Helvete\" (Norwegian for \"hell\") at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. Norwegian black metal musicians often met in the shop's basement, including the two members of Mayhem, the members of Emperor, Varg \"Count Grishnackh\" Vikernes of Burzum, and Snorre \"Blackthorn\" Ruch of Thorns. Euronymous also started an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, and Swedish bands Merciless and Abruptum. Euronymous, Varg, and Emperor guitarist Tomas 'Samoth' Haugen all lived at Helvete at various times. Emperor drummer Faust also lived and worked there. The shop's walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and picture discs, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.\n\nAccording to Occultus, the space that Euronymous rented \"was far too big and the rent was too high. That's the reason why it never did well.\" Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself. Nevertheless, it became the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Metalion, writer of the fanzine \"Slayer\", said that the opening of Helvete was \"the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene.\" Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,\nWithin just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, Thou Shalt Suffer turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, Old Funeral's guitar player Kristian (later renamed as Varg) Vikernes had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.\n\nEuronymous helped many younger bands in the scene, especially Emperor and Enslaved, both of whom he recommended to Candlelight Records. Ihsahn of Emperor said that \"if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted\" by the Helvete scene. Euronymous \"took Vikernes, who was five years younger than him, under his wing: inviting him to play bass with Mayhem and offering to release his music as Burzum\". However, it has been claimed that their friendship turned to rivalry. Looking back, Faust said: \"It sounds really silly, but I think there was a little bit of a contest between them to see who could be more evil. It created a very difficult situation, especially for Euronymous, who wanted the glamour and the showbiz. With him, there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire\".\nOn 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen was destroyed by arson. Vikernes is strongly suspected as the culprit but was never convicted. There followed a wave of church burnings across Norway perpetrated by musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene. Euronymous was present at the burning of Holmenkollen Chapel together with Vikernes and Faust, who were convicted for the arson after Euronymous was dead. Faust says he believes that Euronymous got involved because he \"felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background.\" To coincide with the release of Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover. Euronymous' death in August 1993 put an end to this plan and stalled the album's release. In a 1993 interview on a Swedish radio show, Euronymous said of the church burnings:They [Christians] must feel that there is a dark, evil power present that they have to fight, which…will make them more extreme. We also believe that when a church burns it's not only Christians who suffer, but people in general. Imagine a beautiful old stave church...what happens when it burns? The Christians feel despair, God's house is destroyed and ordinary people will suffer from grief because something beautiful was destroyed. So you end up spreading grief and despair, which is a good thing.\n\nIn January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, \"Bergens Tidende\", brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Varg Vikernes (using his pseudonym Count Grishnackh) gave an anonymous interview to a journalist from the newspaper, in which he claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Vikernes himself was released in March 1993, also for lack of evidence. That month, \"Kerrang!\" published an article about the Norwegian black metal scene. In it, Euronymous and Vikernes presented themselves as leaders of a militant, cult-like group of \"Satanic terrorists.\" Euronymous claimed that Helvete helps fund its activities, but said that he is not directly involved in its crimes, because if he was caught the organization would fall apart.\n\nAfter the \"Bergens Tidende\" episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. Vikernes and the authors of \"Lords of Chaos\" claim that Euronymous' parents pressured him into shutting Helvete.\n\nIn early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, as well as between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene as a whole.\n\nOn the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre \"Blackthorn\" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation began, and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.\n\nIt has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at \"outdoing\" the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up, and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me.\" He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \"panicked\" and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene.\n\nAccording to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\". Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, \"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein\". Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \"defense […] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\".\n\nVikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.\n\nAt Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was rerecording the bass parts, but I never did.\" The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.\n\nA part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used Satan to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death.\" A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said, \"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop.\" After his death, a \"cult developed around the memory of Euronymous,\" and he was hailed by some as \"the King\" or \"Godfather of Black Metal.\" \n\nA new generation of musicians also tried to gain credibility by riding on the back of his legacy. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference.\" \"Lords of Chaos\" remarks: \"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another.\" In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences.\" He added: \"I think many people felt relief once he was gone.\" Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying, \"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone.\"\n\nThe book \"Lords of Chaos\" says of Euronymous:He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical\".\n\nIn interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1992 interview, he said \"The hardcore [punk] pigs have correctly made themselves guardians of morality, but we must kick them in the face and become guardians of anti-morality.\" The following year, he told \"Kill Yourself\" zine, \"There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted\" and claimed \"I have no problem with killing someone in cold blood.\" Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him his best friend) said Euronymous \"was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme\". Euronymous' shop attracted a lot of new young fans, many of whom looked up to and even idolized him.\n\nHowever, some who knew Euronymous claim that \"the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that — a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality.\" They include Necrobutcher, Kjetil Manheim, Vikernes and Blackthorn. Faust said that with Euronymous, \"there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire.\" When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: \"I think that was very much to create fear among people.\" He added that the scene \"wanted to be in opposition to society\" and \"tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy.\" Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (Euronymous' friend from 1983 until his death) described him as \"health oriented ... A nice guy, a family guy,\" but said that when his older friends weren't around, \"he could play out his role.\" Manheim claimed that Euronymous became \"extreme\" towards the end of his life: \"He liked telling people that they were worthless; that he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' … I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a megalomaniac.\" In the documentary \"Pure Fucking Mayhem\", he said \"Øystein's daily life was a total theater\" that was based on the black metal \"archetype\" of Euronymous.\n\nIn interviews, Euronymous said he was a theistic Satanist.\nIn an interview by Esa Lahdenperä conducted in August 1993, Euronymous stated:\nI believe in a horned devil, a personified Satan. In my opinion all the other forms of Satanism are bullshit. [...] Satanism comes from religious Christianity, and there it shall stay. I'm a religious person and I will fight those who misuse His name. People are not supposed to believe in themselves and be individualists. They are supposed to OBEY, to be the SLAVES of religion. \n\nThe theistic Satanism espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of Roman Catholic dogma, and he claimed \"We praise the evil and we believe blindly in a godly creature just like a Christian.\" On the relationship between religion and science, he said: \"Scientists can't disprove [...] religion. No matter how hard you try, you can't explain the universe. You can't leave out a religious belief.\"\n\nHe opposed the Satanic and occultist teachings of Anton LaVey and Aleister Crowley, for unlike Euronymous, they promoted what he saw as \"peace\" and commercial frivolity, as well as individualism in contrast to dogma. He said he would \"never accept any band which preaches Church of Satan ideas, as they are just a bunch of freedom and life-loving atheists, and they stand exactly the opposite of me.\" When asked what he thought of Crowley's code of \"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law\", he answered, \"People shall do what WE want them to do. We're against freedom, and forced a band from Rogaland in Norway—Belsebub—to split up.\"\n\nAs noted earlier, some of those who knew Euronymous claim that his \"extreme Satanic image\" was an act. While Mortiis said that Euronymous \"was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it,\" in the black metal documentary \"Until the Light Takes Us\", Varg Vikernes claimed that Euronymous was not a Satanist. He said: \"To Aarseth everything was about image and he wanted to appear extreme. He wanted people to think of him as being extreme; the most extreme of them all. But he didn't want to \"be\" extreme and he wasn't \"really\" extreme.\" While Metalion, who was friends with both Vikernes and Euronymous when the latter died, and called Euronymous his best friend, wrote that \"some people in our scene read a few books and considered themselves Satanists,\" he made no such statements about Euronymous. Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt) from the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that \"back then, in 1991, things mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism […] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in '93\".\n\nOver time, some members of the Norwegian scene began to follow Paganism. Vikernes later claimed that Euronymous—\"obsessed with this 'Satanist' thing\"—disapproved of Vikernes promoting paganism. Euronymous showed no explicit disapproval of paganism though, and released the pagan band Enslaved's first album, \"Vikingligr Veldi\", on Deathlike Silence Productions.\n\nEuronymous said that the term \"black metal\" can apply to any kind of metal so long as it is \"Satanic\" and \"heavy\". He said, \"If a band cultivates and worships Satan, it's black metal,\" and that \"in a way, it can be ordinary heavy metal or just noise. What's important is that it's Satanic; that's what makes it black metal.\" He rejected bands like Immortal being called black metal, \"as they are not Satanists,\" but supported the band nonetheless. As noted earlier, bands who had LaVeyan beliefs were also rejected. When it was pointed out that Venom (the band that coined the term \"black metal\") only used Satanism as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the Black Circle \"choose to believe otherwise.\"\n\nLikewise, Euronymous said that the term death metal can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band \"cultivates and worships death.\" Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal. He said \"Real Death Metal should be something normal people are afraid of, not something mothers can listen to,\" and \"Death Metal is for brutal people who are capable of killing, it's not for idiotic children who want to have [a] funny hobby after school\".\n\nLike many others in the black metal scene, Euronymous originally believed that black metal should stay underground. However, he later changed his mind. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from hardcore punk, and said, \"Those who scream most about being in 'underground' is also often those who make so bad music that they don't have a chance to get big themselves.\" He added: \"I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change my ways of thinking and being. […] If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us\".\n\nEuronymous was interested in totalitarian communist states such as the Soviet Union under Stalin and Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu. He collected Eastern Bloc memorabilia, and in the '80s, he was a member of the Norwegian communist youth group Rød Ungdom, which was Marxist-Leninist at the time. He left Rød Ungdom, allegedly because he came to realise that they were \"just a bunch of humanists.\" He said \"as I HATE people I don't want them to have a good time, I'd like to see them rot under communist dictatorship.\" He had a fascination with the idea of mass surveillance, secret police and forced disappearance. Mayhem's Attila Csihar said Euronymous was not a communist \"in the political sense\" but was fascinated by the power communist dictators had over their people.\n\nIn a private letter written in the early '90s, Euronymous claimed that \"almost all\" Norwegian black metal bands at the time were \"more or less Nazis,\" including Mayhem. He did not, however, use the music of Mayhem to promote any kind of politics.\n\nEuronymous played a Standard sunburst Gibson Les Paul guitar, which can be seen in many pictures of him playing. He stated in various interviews that his and Mayhem's main influences were Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer, Sodom and Destruction, whilst he also liked Iron Maiden, Kiss, Celtic Frost and Metallica. He played through a slightly modified 1981 Marshall Super Lead tube amp and used an Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal, as well as an Arion Metal Master distortion pedal.\n\nEuronymous was ranked No. 51 out of \"The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time\" by \"Guitar World\".\n\nIn March 2012, low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle set up a public poll asking customers to pick a famous Norwegian historic figure whose picture would decorate the aircraft's tail fin. Aarseth was leading the poll, but his name was removed from the campaign after his family's request.\n\nEuronymous played guitar on the following albums except where noted, any additional instruments or credits in notes.\n\n"}
{"id": "43047687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43047687", "title": "Fornication", "text": "Fornication\n\nFornication is generally consensual sexual intercourse between two people not married to each other. When one of the partners to consensual sexual intercourse is a married person, it may be described as adultery.\n\nFor many people, the term carries an overtone of moral or religious disapproval, but the significance of sexual acts to which the term is applied varies between religions, societies and cultures. In modern usage, the term is often replaced with a more judgment-neutral term like \"extramarital sex\".\n\nIn the original Greek version of the New Testament, the Greek term \"porneia\" (πορνεία) (or its variants) is used 25 times. \"Porneia\" meant prostitution, a usage still in use today.\n\nIn the late 4th century, the Latin Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Greek texts, translated the term as fornicati, fornicatus, fornicata, and fornicatae. The 1611 King James Version used the term fornication. Other translations have used terms such as \"whoredom\", \"sexual immorality\" (e.g., ) or simply \"immorality\". \n\nIn Latin, the term \"fornix\" means arch or vault. In Ancient Rome, prostitutes waited for their customers out of the rain under vaulted ceilings, and \"fornix\" became a euphemism for brothels, and the Latin verb \"fornicare\" referred to a man visiting a brothel. The first recorded use in English is in the \"Cursor Mundi\", c. 1300; the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records a figurative use as well: \"The forsaking of God for idols\". \"Fornicated\" as an adjective is still used in botany, meaning \"arched\" or \"bending over\" (as in a leaf). John Milton plays on the double meaning of the word in \"The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty\" (1642): \"[She] gives up her body to a mercenary whordome under those \"fornicated [ar]ches\" which she cals Gods house.\"\n\nThe Pauline epistles contain multiple condemnations of various forms of extramarital sex. The First Epistle to the Corinthians states \"Flee from sexual immorality\" and lists adulterers and \"those who are sexually immoral\"/practicing-fornicators in a list of \"wrongdoers who... will not inherit the kingdom of God\". First Corinthians and the Epistle to the Galatians also address \"fornication\". The \"Apostolic Decree\" of the Council of Jerusalem also includes a prohibition of \"fornication\".\n\nThroughout history, most theologians have argued that any and all forms of premarital sex are immoral. An historical example is the medieval English monastic, John Baconthorpe. A more contemporary example is the modern-day theologian Lee Gatiss who argues that premarital sex is immoral based on scripture. He states that, from a Biblical perspective, \"physical union should not take place outside a \"one flesh\" (i.e. marriage) union... In [1 Corinthians] chapter 7 Paul addresses the situation of two unmarried Christians who are burning with passion (7:8–9) who should either exercise self-control or be permitted to marry (cf. verses 36–38). The underlying assumptions are the same as those in Deuteronomy 22.\"\n\nHowever, a minority of theologians have argued in more recent times that premarital sex may not be immoral in some limited circumstances. An example is John Witte, who argues that the Bible itself is silent on the issue of consensual, premarital sex between an engaged couple. In other words, Witte claims that the Bible excludes premarital sex from its list of unlawful sexual relations (Leviticus 18) though Leviticus 18 is not the only such list, nor does Leviticus 18 claim to be exhaustive being devoted largely to forms of incest.\n\nSome of the debate arises from the question of which theological approach is being applied. A deontological view of sex interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of whether the couple are married or non-married. What makes sex moral or immoral is the context of marriage. By contrast, a teleological view interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of the quality of the relationship (how well it reflects God's glory and Christian notions of a committed, virtuous relationship.)\n\nThe debate also turns on the definition of the two Greek words \"moicheia\" (μοιχεία, adultery) and \"porneia\" (, with meaning of prostitution, from which the word pornography is derived). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse; however, the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity, although many scholars hold that the Septuagint uses \"porneia\" to refer specifically to male temple prostitution. Elsewhere in First Corinthians, incest, homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations) and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name.\n\nPaul is preaching about activities based on sexual prohibitions laid out in Leviticus in the context of achieving holiness. One theory therefore suggests that it is these behaviours, and only these, that are intended by Paul's prohibition in chapter seven. However, most mainstream Christian sources believe that porneia encompasses all forms of premarital sex. For instance, in defining \"porneia\"/fornication, Kittel and Friedrich's 1977 \"Theological Dictionary of the New Testament\" states that \"The NT is characterized by an unconditional repudiation of all extra-marital and unnatural intercourse\". Likewise, Friberg's \"Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament\" defines \"porneia\" as being \"generally, every kind of extramarital, unlawful or unnatural sexual intercourse\".\n\nLee Gatiss also argues that \"porneia\" encompasses all forms of premarital sex. He states that \"the word 'fornication' has gone out of fashion and is not in common use to describe non-marital sex. However, it is an excellent translation for porneia, which basically referred to any kind of sex outside of marriage ... This has been contested ... but the overwhelming weight of scholarship and all the available evidence from the ancient world points firmly in this direction. \"Flee sexual immorality (porneia) and pursue self-control\" (cf. 1 Thess 4:1–8) was the straightforward message to Christians in a sex-crazed world.\"\n\nAttitudes towards marriage and sexuality at the time of Jesus stemmed from a blend of Roman and Jewish ideas. For instance, during the lifetime of Jesus, there was a strong social disapproval among Romans of polygamy. This made its way into Judaism and early Christianity, despite the Old Testament portraying examples of this behaviour among patriarchs and kings.\n\nJewish marriage in the time of Jesus was a two-stage process. First, there was a betrothal in which the man claimed the woman to be his only bride. Secondly, there was the marriage contract that specified what the bride and groom's families would give the couple and what the bride would obtain if she divorced. \"At the time of Jesus, and in rural areas like Galilee, a young couple might well cohabit before the contract was signed 'in order to get acquainted'. The betrothal was held to be enough of a marriage that a divorce would be needed if the couple split up between betrothal and contract.\"\nThe early Church's statements on marital affairs mainly concerned acceptable reasons for divorce and remarriage. Whilst Paul, in his epistles to early believers, emphasised that both celibacy and marriage were good forms of life, after his life the Church felt that celibacy was more virtuous and liberating. This focus came about because the early church was very ascetic, possibly due to the influence of Greek philosophical thought. The focus on celibacy meant that other issues relating to sexual morality for the non-celibate remained under-developed.\n\nAugustine of Hippo's views strongly influenced how later Christians thought about sex. Before becoming a Christian, he had taken a concubine in defiance of his (Christian) mother's anxious warning to him \"not to commit fornication\". \"Though sinful in acting out his erotic desires, Augustine gives himself some credit, writing that \"the single desire that dominated my search for delight was simply to love and be loved.\"\" Reflecting much later, he believed that the problem was that his love had \"no restraint imposed [on it] by the exchange of mind with mind.\" Hence, pure love was perverted by its misdirection toward lust whereas a Godly relationship should focus on a loving, rational partnership instead.\n\nIn his later writings, Augustine was \"deeply suspicious of sexual passion\" and this has influenced the outlook of all the major Christian denominations down to the present day. Augustine considered fornication to have two definitions: the first was \"cleaving to a prostitute\" and the second, broader and more precise one was \"what men who do not have wives do with women who do not have husbands\". Augustine believed fornicators were sinful because they corrupted their own selves, their image of God and the temple of God.\n\nAccording to Susan C. Karant-Nunn and Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks in their book, \"Luther on Women\", Martin Luther felt that \"The sex act was of course sinful outside of marriage.\" In his sermon on the Epistle to the Ephesians Chapter 5, Luther stated:\n\nOn another occasion, Luther wrote, \"I... pass over the good or evil which experience offers, and confine myself to such good as Scripture and truth ascribe to marriage. It is no slight boon that in wedlock fornication and unchastity are checked and eliminated. This in itself is so great a good that it alone should be enough to induce men to marry forthwith, and for many reasons... The first reason is that fornication destroys not only the soul but also body, property, honor, and family as well. For we see how a licentious and wicked life not only brings great disgrace but is also a spendthrift life, more costly than wedlock, and that illicit partners necessarily occasion greater suffering for one another than do married folk. Beyond that it consumes the body, corrupts flesh and blood, nature, and physical constitution. Through such a variety of evil consequences God takes a rigid position, as though he would actually drive people away from fornication and into marriage. However, few are thereby convinced or converted.\"\n\nExploring this matter in more depth when writing on 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5, Luther advises, \"All young people should avoid casual sex and preserve their purity. They should resolve to strengthen themselves against lust and sexual passions by reading and meditating on a psalm or some other portion of God's Word... If your sexual appetites continually tempt you, be patient. Resist them as long as necessary, even if it takes more than a year. But above all, keep praying! If you feel that you can't stand it any longer, pray that God will give you a devout spouse with whom you can live in harmony and true love... I have known many people who, because of their crude and shameful fantasies, indulged their passion with unrestrained lust. Because of their insatiable desires, they abandoned self control, and lapsed into terrible immorality. In the end, they had to endure dreadful punishment. Blinded to the realities of married life, some of them took unsuitable mates and ended up in incompatible relationships. They got what they deserved. You must pray diligently and strive to resist the desires of your corrupt nature. Ask God to give you a Rebekah or Isaac instead of a Delilah or Samson-or someone even worse. Finding a devoted, loyal wife or husband isn’t a matter of good luck. It’s not the result of good judgment, as unbelievers think. Rather, a devout spouse is a gift from God.\"\n\nLuther however, in contrast to his Roman Catholic opponents, believed that it was not the Church's business to define marriage law. He understood marriage to be a legal agreement rather than a sacrament. He stated that marriage was instituted by God but its regulation was the business of the State, not the Church. Luther defined marriage as \"the God-appointed and legitimate union of man and woman in the hope of having children or at least for the purpose of avoiding fornication and sin and living to the glory of God. The ultimate purpose is to obey God, to find aid and counsel against sin; to call upon God; to seek, love, and educate children for the glory of God; to live with one's wife in the fear of God and to bear the cross...\"\n\nMartin Bucer argued that sexual intimacy belonged in marriage and that, in marriage, the man becomes \"the head and saviour of the wife and forms one flesh with her in order to avoid fornication and that the wife is the body and help of her husband, again to avoid fornication\". Marriage for him, though, not only meant the avoidance of sin and procreation of children but social and emotional bonding resulting in a fellowship. As Selderhuis notes, for Bucer, \"When people conduct themselves lasciviously, either as married or unmarried folk, they fall under divine judgement... Marriage... [is] the context in which sexual intimacy should have its place... Marriage is, after all, the only framework within which sexual desires can be legitimately satisfied.\"\n\nImmanuel Kant, who was raised as a Pietist, considered sex before marriage to be immoral. He argued that sexual desire objectifies the person you crave and, since no logically consistent ethical rule allows you to use a person as an object, it is immoral to have sex (outside marriage). Marriage makes the difference because, in marriage, the two people give all of themselves to create a union and, thus, now have rights over each other as each now belongs to the other. As Kant himself puts it, \"The sole condition on which we are free to make use of our sexual desires depends upon the right to dispose over the person as a whole – over the welfare and happiness and generally over all the circumstances of that person… each of them... [are obliged] to surrender the whole of their person to the other with a complete right to disposal over it.\"\n\nToday, the Lutheran Church of Australia asserts that premarital sex is sinful. It believes that sexual activity belongs within the marriage relationship only and that the practice of pre-marital sex is in \"violation of the will of God\".\n\nIn the United States, pastors of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod undertook a survey on premarital sex among their congregations in 2010. \"These Lutheran pastors reported that over 57 percent of the couples they now marry are living together prior to the wedding, and that the rate of cohabitation in their congregations is increasing.\" Despite this trend, the Synod believes that \"Regardless of the reasons given for living together, cohabitation is simply wrong for Christians.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) takes the view that \"Any use of the gift of sex aside from the marriage bond is adultery, whether this is premarital or extramarital ... To engage in premarital or extramarital sex, before or outside of marriage, is to sin in God's sight. That is precisely the point of Hebrews 13:4, a verse often referred to in this kind of discussion. \"Marriage\" and the marriage bed ... go together and are to be kept pure. Using the \"bed\" aside from \"marriage\" is sin that God will judge... The counsel given in 1 Corinthians 7:9 makes the same point. If a person has sexual urges and the sex drive (a good gift from God in itself) expresses itself within a person, that person has a God-pleasing remedy identified: to be married and thus obtain the right to be sexually active. Before or outside of marriage, sinful lust is sinful lust.\"\n\nElsewhere on its official site, WELS states that \"Even though our unbelieving society embraces living together outside marriage as an acceptable lifestyle, it is still a sinful arrangement. A pastor or congregation will deal patiently with cohabitating people who are seeking spiritual guidance... [and a]... Christian life of sanctification. This is done by firmly yet gently confronting them with their sin... and then guiding them to change their behavior to show their love for Christ.\"\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) delivered a detailed document, entitled \"A Social Statement on Human Sexuality\", in 2009. With regard to sex before marriage, the document, declares that \"Because this church urges couples to seek the highest social and legal support for their relationships, it does not favor cohabitation arrangements outside marriage. It has a special concern when such arrangements are entered into as an end in themselves. It does, however, acknowledge the social forces at work that encourage such practices. This church also recognizes the pastoral and familial issues that accompany these contemporary social patterns. In cases where a decision is made for cohabitation, regardless of the reasons, this church expects its pastors and members to be clear with the couple regarding the reasons for the position of this church and to support the couple in recognizing their obligation to be open and candid with each other about their plans, expectations, and levels of mutual commitment. Some cohabitation arrangements can be constructed in ways that are neither casual nor intrinsically unstable... This church believes, however, that the deepest human longings for a sense of personal worth, long-term companionship, and profound security, especially given the human propensity to sin, are best served through binding commitment, legal protections, and the public accountability of marriage, especially where the couple is surrounded by the prayers of the congregational community and the promises of God.\"\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland's stance on the issue is ambiguous. It strictly condemns extramarital sex but in relation to pre-marital sex it states only that \"Sexuality disconnected from love and from responsibility enslaves people, bringing harm to themselves and others.\"\n\nAccording to the Kinsey Institute, \"Today, the Swedish Lutheran Church is very liberal in action, but careful not to take formal stands in most sexual issues, such as premarital sex, cohabitation, and sex education.\"\n\nThe Lutheran Church in Germany (EKD) has noted that all forms of long-term cohabitation are vulnerable and that legislators must give due recognition to the fundamental significance of marriage. The Church has further stated that \"Marriage and family alone can be considered as role models for living together.\"\n\nThe Australian non-denominational Christian teen sex education website, \"Boys Under Attack\", cites Lutheran sources to assert that people should maintain virginity until marriage. The site asserts that all sexual activity – including oral sex and mutual masturbation – between unmarried persons is a sin.\n\nCalvinism has traditionally always asserted that engaging in premarital sex is a sin. Calvin himself said little on why he thought engaged couples should not have sex and Witte believes his rationale for the prohibition was vague but he did seek to reduce the length of engagements among couples in Geneva to less than six weeks, to reduce the temptation of premarital sex. He agreed, though, with Luther that marriage was a legal matter for the state, not a sacramental matter for the church.\n\nJohn Witte, Jr. has written a study on John Calvin and marriage and family life. In it, he notes that, \"For Calvin, the Commandment against adultery was equally binding on the unmarried, and equally applicable to both illicit sexual activities per se, and various acts leading to the same. Calvin condemned fornication sternly—sexual intercourse or other illicit acts of sexual touching, seduction, or enticement by non-married parties, including those who were engaged to each other or to others. He decried at length the widespread practice of casual sex, prostitution, concubinage, pre-marital sex, nonmarital cohabitation and other forms of bed hopping that he encountered in modern day Geneva as well as in ancient Bible stories. All these actions openly defied God's commandment against adultery and should be punished by spiritual and criminal sanctions. Calvin preached against fornication constantly... He often led the Consistory in rooting out fornicators and subjecting them to admonition and the ban, and to fines and short imprisonment.\" Theodore Beza likewise strictly condemned it.\n\nRaymond A. Mentzer notes that, \"Wherever Calvinism took root – Geneva and France, the Low Countries and Rhine Valley, Scotland, England and New England – an element of moral rigor... accompanied it. Churches fashioned in the Calvinist tradition have typically set extremely high standard of behavior and, more particularly, sought to compel a strict morality within the community...\" Sin, including sexual sin, was not simply considered a private failing; it affected the whole congregation. E. William Monter asserts that, \"The supposedly repressive dimension of Calvinist morality affected women's lives in ways which were often beneficial... Each year the [Genevan] Consistory judged a half-dozen cases of fornication by engaged couples and as many accusations of illicit sex between masters and servants.\" In the 1560s, a consistory met for the first time in Nîmes. The town soon had a Protestant majority but it still faced an enormous task in cleaning up morals as one of the first Protestant-controlled societies in France. According to Mentzer, one third of excommunications in Nîmes between the 1560s and the 1580s were due to improper sexual behaviour. At this time, proper conduct was considered as much a public matter as a private matter. The struggle against worldly dissoluteness, and the enforcement of respect for the family and the pacification of society were setting Nîmes \"on the path towards social reform and, by extension, modernity itself.\"\n\nAs a result of this new moral rigour, there were remarkably low rates of premarital conceptions and illegitimate births among Huguenots by the seventeenth century in France compared to the rates among their Roman Catholic opponents, from whom the Reformed sought to distinguish themselves by their moral holiness. The low illegitimate birth rate indicates that the Calvinists had internalised the values that condemned premarital sex as immoral.\n\nAn interesting case is that of Pierre Palma Cayet, who scandalously wrote a book in which he provided a scriptural defence of brothels, prostitution and fornication, which led to him being deposed as a Huguenot pastor. Shortly afterwards, in 1595, he re-converted to Roman Catholicism. He was readily accepted back into that church as a priest.\n\nAccording to scholar Nicholas Must, \"Marriage was, in the equations of Huguenot ministers... a means to avoid promiscuity and lechery. As a result of this, many sermons that dealt with marriage were also an opportunity to announce the dangers of illicit sex while, at the same time, offering a relatively positive appraisal of conjugal sex. For instance, Jean Mestrezat declares simply that marriage is the recommended solution for illicit sexuality, since God hates all impurities, especially paillardise [sexual immorality]... In another sermon, [Pastor Jean] Daillé provides a close hermeneutical reading of paillardise in a sermon on 1 Corinthians 10:8 when he states that it includes \"all the species of this sin, that is to say all the faults of this nature, which are committed by any person, whether married or not, simple fornication as well as adultery\".\" To the Huguenot, “simple fornication” is a \"grave sin\".\n\nThroughout the centuries, French Huguenots have remained strictly opposed to fornication in all circumstances. An example is the famous French Protestant pastor, André Trocmé, (active in the 1940s), who is on record as having been against all premarital and extramarital sex.\n\nToday, French Calvinists maintain very high ethical standards and feel themselves to be different from their French Roman Catholic neighbours, in terms of their attitudes and higher standards of behaviour, including sexual behaviour. Indeed, French Reformed Christians \"are widely regarded as having particularly high standards of honesty and integrity\". Even one of France's most liberal Reformed Calvinist churches, L'Oratoire du Louvre in Paris, today still condemns premarital sex, including casual sex and sex with prostitutes in all circumstances.\n\nThe famous Swiss Huguenot theologian, Karl Barth, discussed sexual morality in his magnum opus, \"Church Dogmatics\". He stated that \"Coitus without coexistence is demonic\" (\"demonic\", in Christianity, simply meaning any sphere that does not submit to God.) Barth goes on to state that \"the physical sexuality of man should form an integral part of his total humanity as male or female, and that the completion of the sexual relation should be integrated into the total encounter of man and woman. All right or wrong and therefore salvation or perdition in this matter depends on whether it is viewed in isolation and abstraction or within this whole... If it is not, if physical sexuality and sex relations have their own right and authority in which man and woman and their encounter may be controlled and fulfilled, then it is a demonic business. Naturally, the command of God will always resist any such idea of sovereign physical sexuality.\" For Barth, to engage in sex outside marriage is not only rebellious but dehumanising as it puts humans on the level of animals, driven by passion and a search for self-gratification.\n\nFurthermore, for Barth, \"A wedding is only the regulative confirmation and legitimation of a marriage before and by society. It does not constitute a marriage.\" Sex within marriage can be sinful as well unless it affirms the coexistence of the couple. This opens the door to a more holistic understanding of sex.\n\nHowever, a few modern Swiss Reformed theologians, such as Michel Cornuz, take the teleological view that premarital sex is permissible if the sexual activities take a form which respects the partner and helps the relationship grow in intimacy. These theologians hold that it is when a relationship is exploitive that it is sinful. (Hence, engaging in sex with prostitutes is always sinful as it is an exploitive relationship and does not allow the participants to grow in dignity.) This change has come about within the last two generations in Switzerland. Prior to that, the cultural norm was that the couple would not engage in sex before marriage. Hence, the modern Reformed theologians have endeavoured to meet the challenge of applying Christian teaching to this massive cultural change in Switzerland.\n\nEssentially, Cornuz and his colleagues feel that one should always be true to one's individual conscience, so if the person feels sex before marriage is sinful, that person should listen to his or her conscience and abstain. The key thing is that it is up to the couple themselves to decide if engaging in premarital sex or remaining virgins is the best way for them to reflect the love of God in their relationship.\n\nAccording to Mentzer, during the first fifty years of the Scottish Reformation, \"more than two-thirds of the cases brought before the Consistory involved illicit sex... everything else paled before the apparent obsession of Scots Calvinists with sex\". This contrasted strikingly with the data from Germany, the Netherlands and France. For the parish of Saint Andrews, fornication accounted for 47.4% of all cases heard between 1573 and 1600. 986 were charged with fornication (sexual intercourse between two single persons) and 813 with \"fornication antenuptial\" (sexual intercourse between two people who were engaged to each other but not yet married). Between 1595 and 1597, the fornication levels in Saint Andrews plummeted. \"The only... explanation for the relative absence of sexual offences, improbably though it may seem, is that a... genuine \"reformation of manners\" took place in the burgh.\" Mentzer and Graham argue that this focus on sex may actually be due to the Kirk's early weakness. \"Since there is strong sentiment in Western societies today that governments should stay out of the private lives of citizens, the church courts today seem nosy or even voyeuristic to our modern eyes. But this was no all-powerful Big Brother peering into bedroom windows. Rather the Kirk's obsession with sex was more a sign of its weakness than its strength... The need to discourage illicit sexuality was accepted by nearly all powers... even when they could agree on little else.\" Only when ministers and presbyters gradually gained a stronger position were they able to gradually turn their focus to other disciplinary breaches surrounding the Sabbath, superstitious practices, neighborly disputes and so forth.\n\nScottish Calvinists today remain deeply opposed to any kind of sex outside marriage. In 2008, the Scottish health minister, Shona Robison noted, \"There are deeply-held views on moral issues and cultural and lifestyle issues... The Highlands in general ... have a strong Calvinistic streak, a prudish thing that sees sex as something that happens behind closed doors and drawn curtains. As a consequence of this and because of lack of a scene for gay people, both straight and gay people are being driven out into these isolated areas to have [casual] sex.\"\n\nThe American Presbyterian Church, \"like other Christian bodies, has viewed marriage as a prerequisite to sexual intercourse and considered sex outside marriage a sin\".\n\nThe prominent conservative American Calvinist theologian, R. C. Sproul, opposes premarital sex on the grounds that the marriage covenant is an essential legal safeguard, protecting both members of the couple from each other's sinfulness.\n\nThe American Methodist theologian and pastor, Ben Witherington III, believes that \"virginity in a woman was highly valued before marriage [in Biblical cultures]... In early Jewish law if you had sex with a woman you were considered married to her or you had shamed her. See the story of Mary and Joseph. Porneia can refer to all sorts of sexual sin including deflowering a virgin... there was no dating or physical intimacy prior to an arranged marriage in the vast majority of cases. The notion of dating doesn't exist in Jesus and Paul's world. Second, honor and shame cultures placed a high value on sexual purity. Notice how prostitutes were stigmatized. Women were mainly blamed for sexual immorality. Finally Jesus gave his disciples two choices in Mt. 19—fidelity in heterosexual marriage or being a eunuch! This means no sex outside marriage.\"\n\nThe position of the United Methodist Church in the United States on the issue is as follows: \"Although all persons are sexual beings whether or not they are married, sexual relations are only clearly affirmed in the marriage bond.\"\n\nThe Uniting Church in Australia is still formulating its views on the subject. It recognises the changes in marriage practice and lifestyle that have resonated throughout society and that the UCA is perceived by the public of being more accepting of the realities of humanity than many other denominations. A report noted that scripture is not really about marriage as understood in contemporary western societies and, in fact, has very little to say about it. In the report, the church also acknowledged that many unmarried people had sex but neither condemned nor endorsed it, instead noting that there were many different views within the church.\n\nStanley Hauerwas argues that questions about sex before marriage need to be reframed in terms of the narrative of the church. He asks individuals to consider if it is a pure or licentious lifestyle that will best prepare the Christian to live out and serve in the narrative of the church. Doctor Hauerwas goes on to conclude, \"For the issue is not whether X or Y form of sexual activity is right or wrong, as if such activity could be separated from a whole way of life... The issue is not whether someone is chaste in the sense of not engaging in genital activity, but whether we have lived in a manner that allows us to bring a history with us that contributes to the common history we may be called upon to develop with one another. Chastity, we forget, is not a state but a form of the virtue of faithfulness that is necessary for a role in the community... what the young properly demand is an account of life and the initiation into a community that makes intelligible why their interest in sex should be subordinated to other interests. What they, and we, demand is the lure of an adventure that captures the imagination sufficiently that conquest means more than the sexual possession of another. I have tried to suggest that marriage and singleness for Christians should represent just such an adventure, and if it does not, no amount of ethics or rules will be sufficient to correct the situation.\"\n\nMennonites believe that sex outside marriage is sinful. The Mennonite \"Confession of Faith\" states \"According to Scripture, right sexual union takes place only within the marriage relationship. Scripture places sexual intimacy within God's good created order. Sexual union is reserved for the marriage bond.\"\n\nQuakers are essentially non-judgemental about sex and relationships outside marriage.\n\nThe official resolutions of the Anglican Church are produced by the bishops in attendance at the Lambeth Conferences, which are held every ten years. The 1988 Lambeth Conference made this declaration in its \"Resolution on Marriage and Family\": \"Noting the gap between traditional Christian teaching on pre-marital sex, and the life-styles being adopted by many people today, both within and outside the Church: (a) calls on provinces and dioceses to adopt a caring and pastoral attitude to such people; (b) reaffirms the traditional biblical teaching that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship; (c) in response to the International Conference of Young Anglicans in Belfast, urges provinces and dioceses to plan with young people programmes to explore issues such as pre-marital sex in the light of traditional Christian values\" (Resolution 34).\n\nA subsequent resolution was made at the 1998 Lambeth Conference. This sitting of the Conference resolved, \"In view of the teaching of Scripture, [the Anglican Church] upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage\" (Resolution I.10). This Resolution also commended a report on human sexuality entitled \"Called to Full Humanity\" which stated that, \"The Holy Scriptures and Christian tradition teach that human sexuality is intended by God to find its rightful and full expression between a man and a woman in the covenant of marriage, established by God in creation, and affirmed by our Lord Jesus Christ. Holy Matrimony is, by intention and divine purpose, to be a lifelong, monogamous and unconditional commitment between a woman and a man. The Lambeth Conference 1978 and 1998 both affirmed 'marriage to be sacred, instituted by God and blessed by our Lord Jesus Christ'. The New Testament and Christian history identify singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like ways of living.\"\n\nIn the United States, the Episcopal Church only approves \"of sex between men and women who are married. In 1979, the U.S. church's governing body voted down a resolution to approve other sexual activity.\"\n\nHistorically, the English reformers had taken a stern view of adultery and fornication, which Homily 11 of the First Book of Homilies (1547) defined to include \"all unlawfull use of those parts, which bee ordeyned for generation\".\n\nPrior to the \"Marriage Act 1753\" (commonly known as the Hardwicke Act), British couples could live together and have sex after their betrothal or \"the spousals\". Theologian Adrian Thatcher claims that, before the Act was introduced, in the United Kingdom the betrothal was a formal, preliminary stage of marriage involving vows. During this stage, the marriage would become permanent and indissoluble if sexual intercourse occurred or when final vows were taken, whichever came first. Either of these would render \"the conditional promise unconditional\". Hence, having sex would automatically turn the betrothal into a finalized, indissoluble marriage. Betrothal vows were given in the future tense, hence sexual intercourse \"activated\" them, signalling the beginning of the binding marriage.\n\nThe Council of Trent in the Roman Catholic Church and the above-mentioned Marriage Act in the United Kingdom eliminated the tradition of the betrothal stage of marriage. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, betrothal still exists but it has been combined into the wedding ceremony, rather than remaining as its own separate stage of the marriage process.\n\nThatcher notes that, today, \"Non-nuptial cohabitation is unlikely ever to be thought consistent with Christian faith if only because God wills only what is best for us, and there [are] good reasons for thinking that these arrangements are not the best for us.\" He outlines some of the damage he believes is caused by cohabitation outside marriage in his paper, supported by empirical data.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, whilst the State defined who was married, it was the Anglican Church that was given the responsibility to police this law for the State. Today, Britain remains abnormal among European nations in having Church weddings whereas most other nations on that continent insist on civil registrations leaving it up to the couple if they choose to have a religious ceremony as well.\n\nThe 1984 English Anglican booklet \"Forward to Marriage\" showed a tolerance of premarital sex but strongly endorsed marriage as \"a necessary commitment for a long-term relationship\".\n\nIn 1987, the American Bishop John Shelby Spong's Newark Diocese had commissioned a report that concluded that the \"Episcopal Church should recognize and bless committed non-marital sexual relationships between homosexuals, young adults, the divorced and widowed...\" The report aimed \"to ignite a new debate on sexual ethics among leaders of the nation's 3 million Episcopalians in the hope that they will amend church doctrine to embrace all believers... Spong, an advocate of the recommendations... said his views are a minority position in the church.\"\n\nAlso in 1987, the General Synod of the Church of England asserted \"(1) that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship, (2) that fornication and adultery are sins against this ideal, and are to be met by a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion\".\n\nThe 1996 National Church Life Survey in Australia found that Australian Anglicans were more liberal about premarital sex than churchgoers from other denominations but more conservative than the general [non-church going] population. The survey noted a divide between Anglicans who wanted to support sexually active unmarried couples in their churches and others who did not. A 2009 survey found that Anglicans (along with Baptists, Roman Catholics and Uniting Church members) had become a little more accepting of premarital sex compared to a 1993 survey, whereas Pentecostal Christians had become markedly more conservative. 54% of Australian church attenders felt pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong, whereas only 3% of non-church attenders thought it was always or usually wrong. Among those who attended church on a weekly basis, the percentage of those who thought pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong rose to 67%.\n\nA 2002 survey by the \"Church Times\" in England found that less than half of the 5,000 readers questioned said it was wrong for men and women to have sex before they married. Over 25% also said it was acceptable for a couple to live together without ever intending to marry.\n\nThe 2003 report, \"Cohabitation: A Christian Reflection\", produced by the Diocese of Southwark, found that the Church's traditional teaching that sex before marriage is wrong has been inherited from a different form of society than that which exists today. However, the report then cited research that illustrates the problems that accompany cohabitation, particularly with regard to raising children. It concluded that marriage is \"a much more satisfactory social convention than cohabitation\", but says that the Church has failed to present marriage in a way that captures the imagination of young people and that the Church needed to rise to the challenge and rediscover its confidence in marriage. The report noted that Paul gave a \"cautious welcome\" to marriage, but that there was also a \"militant apostolic view\" that favoured celibacy, which \"was seen as more noble than marriage\" by many early Christians. The report also noted that \"the strict sexual codes of the earliest Christian communities helped to give them a separate identity distinct from the sexual hedonism of the pagan world.\"\n\nThe report ultimately rejected the possibility that cohabitation with no intention to marry is acceptable for members of the Christian Church.\n\nIn a 2004 interview, the Anglican Primate of Australia, Archbishop Peter Carnley, noted that heterosexual de facto relationships and a disinclination to commit were more serious worries for him than the same-sex marriage movement. When asked if he thought sexual morality was subjective, he disagreed, stating \"I think it's possible to say, for example, that it is objectively quite clear that promiscuity is a bad thing.\"\n\nIn 2009, N. T. Wright noted that, in popular discourse, there has been a \"supposed modern and scientific discovery of a personal 'identity' characterised by sexual preference, which then generates a set of 'rights'... Without entering into discussion of the scientific evidence, it must be said that the Christian notion of personal identity has never before been supposed to be rooted in desires of whatever sort. Indeed, desires are routinely brought under the constraints of 'being in Christ'. This quite new notion of an 'identity' found not only within oneself but within one's emotional and physical desires needs to be articulated on the basis of scripture and tradition, and this to my mind has not been done... The church has never acknowledged that powerful sexual instincts, which almost all human beings have, generate a prima facie 'right' that these instincts receive physical expression. All are called to chastity and, within that, some are called to celibacy; but a call to celibacy is not the same thing as discovering that one has a weak or negligible sexual drive. The call to the self-control of chastity is for all: for the heterosexually inclined who, whether married or not, are regularly and powerfully attracted to many different potential partners, just as much as for those with different instincts.\"\n\nOn another occasion, Wright stated, \"We need to remind ourselves that the entire biblical sexual ethic is deeply counter-intuitive. All human beings some of the time, and some human beings most of the time, have deep heartfelt longings for kinds of sexual intimacy or gratification (multiple partners, pornography, whatever) which do not reflect the creator's best intentions for his human creatures, intentions through which new wisdom and flourishing will come to birth. Sexual restraint is mandatory for all, difficult for most, extremely challenging for some. God is gracious and merciful but this never means that his creational standards don't really matter after all.\"\n\nThe former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, have expressed tolerance of cohabitation. In 2011, John Sentamu, commenting on Prince William and Catherine's decision to live together before their wedding, said that the royal couple's public commitment to live their lives together today would be more important than their past. Sentamu said that he had conducted wedding services for \"many cohabiting couples\" during his time as a vicar in south London. Rowan Williams stated he did not personally believe sex outside marriage to be a sin and noted in 2002 that he found it hard to reconcile his liberal personal beliefs with the public stance of the Church. However, in 2008, Doctor Williams said, \"Sex outside marriage is not as God purposes it... I always find it difficult to condense sexual ethics into a soundbite... All I can say is where the Church stands – it's not a question of what Rowan Williams's view is... the biblical view of sexual relations is consistently within the pattern of absolute mutual commitment, reflecting God's commitment to his people. And the assumption of the Bible is that that commitment is heterosexual. That is the framework we work in.\"\n\nIn his earlier 1997 essay, \"Forbidden Fruit: New Testament Sexual Ethics\", Dr Williams had noted, \"I can't see that the New Testament easily allows any straightforwardly positive evaluation of sexual intimacy outside a relationship that is publicly committed [in marriage].\"\n\nIn 2013, Doctor Williams' successor, Justin Welby, stated that \"My understanding of sexual ethics has been that, regardless of whether it's gay or straight, sex outside marriage is wrong.\" He reiterated this belief again later in 2013, further noting that, \"To abandon the ideal simply because it's difficult to achieve is ridiculous.\" After Welby made his first statement, a \"Sunday Times\" poll found that \"A majority of adults (69%, including 76% of those professing no faith) believe Justin Welby to be wrong in condemning sex outside marriage, while 17% think he is right (including 30% of Anglicans), and 13% are unsure.\"\n\nThe Kinsey Institute comments that \"Prior to the 1950s, the religious influences forming sexual constructs [in Britain] came almost exclusively from \"the official church\" of England, and \"unofficially\" from the other Christian denominations. In recent decades, the picture has become more complex. Since midcentury, the Church of England's approach to social morality and sexuality has fluctuated between two poles, the traditionalists and the modernists, or the \"permission givers\" and the \"orthodox moral directors\". With the national religious scene resembling the circular approach of the politicians to sexual knowledge and attitudes, the sociosexual control and influence appears to bounce back and forth between church and state according to a mutually cooperative formula... This doctrinal \"pendulum\" is confusing for the majority of the population who are not experts at moral and theological niceties and subtleties. The people themselves are part of the system of confusion: While expecting clear and definite moral messages from both establishment and Church, they reserve the right to judge the validity of those messages, even when they are biblically based.\"\n\nThe 2013 British Social Attitudes survey found that members of the Church of England have become more accepting of pre-marital sex over the past 30 years. In 1983, 31% of British Anglicans surveyed thought that pre-marital sex was \"always\" or \"mostly\" wrong whereas, in 2012, only 10% thought this was the case. Likewise, in 1989, 78% of Anglicans surveyed thought that people should marry before having children. In 2012, this had declined to 54%.\n\nCatholicism equates premarital sex with fornication and ties it with breaking the sixth commandment (\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\") in its Catechism:\n\nFornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there is corruption of the young.\n\nIn his book, James F. Keenan reports studies by some academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are \"simply not true\". After examining seven medieval text about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, \"far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible\". He calls the tradition's teaching of the Church \"incoherent\". Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that tradition itself is \"not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.\" Keenan, however, says that studies of \"manualists\" such as John T. Noonan Jr. has demonstrated that, \"despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition.\" Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at \"areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not\".\n\nThe Catholic Church did not pro-actively condemn men for pre-marital sex until the twelfth century. The Third Council of Aachen had previously noted that it was almost unheard of for a man to remain a virgin until his wedding but males remained largely immune to punishment whereas females were heavily penalized for sexual misdemeanours. Despite the Church's disapproval of nonmarital sex, fornication continued to be commonplace in the early medieval period.\n\nIn the twelfth century, the Paris-based \"Reform Church\" movement was a Catholic faction that attempted to refocus society's moral compass with a particular emphasis on sex and marriage. The movement sent priests to Wales where it was, up until that time, the norm for Christians to live together prior to marriage.\n\nUp until this period, marriage was considered a private contract between two people. They would make a pledge to each other and, from that moment on, they were considered married. This pledge could take place anywhere; it did not have to occur in a church and neither the church nor the state were involved. It was during the twelfth century that the Catholic Church took control of the process of marriage. From that point on, to be legally recognised, a marriage had to take place in a church with a formal service conducted by a priest. Hence all marriage and sexual activity now came under the control of the Church.\n\nAt the time of the Reformation, the Catholic Church \"officially advocated celibacy for the religious, and prohibited marriage, but allowed fornication and concubinage\". For instance, in 1527 all but 10 out of 200 Catholic clergymen in Thuringia were living with women outside marriage.\n\nThe Council of Trent (which began in 1545 in reaction to the Protestant Reformation) formally ratified the Catholic view that marriage was a sacrament and set strict guidelines around what constituted a legitimate marriage in Catholic eyes.\n\nIn his 1930 encyclical, \"Casti connubii\", Pope Pius XI strongly condemned premarital sex and all forms of \"experimental\" marriage.\n\nThe Catholic belief that premarital sex is sinful was reasserted in Pope John Paul II's 1993 encyclical, Veritatis Splendor.\n\nIn 2012, Pope Benedict XVI claimed that premarital sex and cohabitation were \"gravely sinful\" and \"damaging to the stability of society\". The Catholic Church continues to portray premarital sex as a shameful act and believes that sexual relations are only acceptable between a married couple.\n\nThe 2012 British Social Attitudes survey showed that only one in ten British Catholics and Anglicans thought that pre-marital sex was wrong (however, of those who attended Church on a weekly basis, only 23% thought it was permissible).\n\nA 1994 study of French Catholics showed that 83% preferred to listen to their consciences rather than to the official position of the Catholic Church when making major decisions in their lives, leading to 75% of Catholics, by 2003, to say that cohabitation outside marriage is a personal matter and 13% to say whether it is right or not depends on circumstances.\n\nA 2004 survey showed vastly different attitudes among Catholics in different nations. For instance, in Germany, 76% of Catholics agreed or strongly agreed that cohabitation before marriage was acceptable. In Spain, that number was 72%, in the Czech Republic it was 66% and in France it was 62%. At the other end of the spectrum, only 32% of Australian Catholics thought it was acceptable, followed by 39% in the Philippines and 43% in the United States.\n\nThe same survey sought to show the number of Catholics who believed that premarital sex is \"not wrong at all\" or \"wrong only sometimes\". In the Czech Republic, 84% of Catholics believed this, in France it was 83% and in Germany it was 80%. At the other end of the scale, in the Philippines it was 21%, in Ireland it was 51% and in Australia and the United States it was 64%. The survey also claimed that 40% of Catholic women in the United States have cohabited outside marriage.\n\nThe 2013 British Social Attitudes survey showed that Catholics have become even more accepting than Anglicans of having children outside wedlock: in 1989, 73% of British Catholics thought people should marry before having children; whereas, by 2012, just 43% thought so.\n\nA 2014 survey showed that most German Catholics also disputed the Church's ruling against premarital sex.\n\nIn his book \"Forbidden Fruit: Sex & Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers\", sociologist Mark Regnerus notes that \"Evangelical Christian teens are more likely to have lost their virginity earlier than mainline Protestants. They start having sex on average at age 16.3 and are more likely than other religious groups to have had three or more sexual partners by age 17.\"\n\nA 2012 study, the National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge, found that 80% of young American evangelical Christians aged between 18 and 29 are having pre-marital sex.\n\nA 2012 survey found 56% of unmarried evangelical Christians between the ages of 18 and 29 were never sexually active. Unlike previous studies, this survey did not rely on respondents simply identifying themselves as \"evangelical\" but also had to attend a Protestant church at least once a month, believe that they will go to heaven when they die because they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior, strongly agree that the Bible is the written word of God and is accurate in all that it teaches, that their personal commitment to Jesus Christ is still important to their lives today, that eternal salvation is possible only through Jesus Christ, and that they personally have a responsibility to tell others about their religious beliefs. The same survey also found higher religiosity, as measured by frequency of Bible reading, was correlated with a lower rate of non-marital sexual activity. \n\nA 2014 press release from online dating websites announced the results of a poll of 2,600 Americans in their attitudes towards dating and sex. The poll found that 61 percent of Christians believed they would have sex before marriage. Fifty-six percent found it appropriate to cohabit with a romantic partner after dating for a time between six months and two years.\n\nThe American Baptist pastor and assistant professor, Jennifer Knust, believes that the Bible is contradictory on the subject of premarital sex and that some Bible texts, notably the Book of Ruth, present it as a source of God's blessing.\n\nA 2013 study of 151 newly married young adults at nine Southern Baptist churches in Texas found that over 70% of respondents reported having had premarital vaginal or oral sex. The Southern Baptist scholar Frank Stagg interpreted the New Testament as saying that sex is reserved for marriage. He maintained that the New Testament teaches that sex outside marriage is a sin of adultery if either sexual participant is married, otherwise the sin of fornication if both sexual participants are unmarried.\n\nThe Southern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberties Commission also condemns premarital sex on the grounds of their interpretation of the Bible. Feeling that marriage is a \"divine institution\" the Southern Baptist position is closer to that of Roman Catholic sacramentalism than that of Luther and Calvin who maintained marriage was a legal agreement and the business of the State.\n\nIn Australia, Pentecostals are increasingly opposed to the concept of premarital sex. In 1993, 62% of Australian Pentecostals felt that sex before marriage was wrong. By 2009, that figure had jumped to 78%.\n\nBahá'ís are required to be \"absolutely chaste\" before marriage. To Bahá'ís this means not only abstaining from fornication, but also abstaining from hugging and kissing before marriage. The most holy book of the Bahá'í Faith, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, punishes fornication with fines which double with every offense (as in the wheat and chessboard problem). The Arabic word used in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas for this sin is zina, which can refer to either fornication or adultery, depending on context, but `Abdu'l-Bahá has clarified that in this context the word zina refers to fornication. `Abdu'l-Bahá further states that the purpose of this punishment is to shame and disgrace fornicators in the eyes of society.\n\nBuddhism disapproves of extramarital sex and adultery, which is considered sexual misconduct. The precepts of Buddhism denounces fornication for the monastics. Sexual activities between lay people however are left to their own discretion so long as it is not sexual misconduct such as adultery: fornication in itself is not considered sexual misconduct.\n\nHindu texts present a range of views on sex. The hymn 4.5.5 of the \"Rigveda\" calls adultery as \"pāpa\" (evil, sin). According to the Indologist Wendy Doniger, the Vedic texts, including the \"Rigveda\", the \"Atharvaveda\" and the Upanishads, also acknowledge the existence of male lovers and female lovers as a basic fact of human life, followed by the recommendation that one should avoid such extra marital sex during certain ritual occasions (yajna). A number of simile in the Rigveda, states Doniger, a woman's emotional eagerness to meet her lover is described, and one hymn prays to the gods that they protect the embryo of a pregnant wife as she sleeps with her husband and other lovers.\n\nMandagadde Rama Jois translates verse 4.134 of \"Manusmriti\" as declaring adultery to be a heinous offense, and prescribes severe punishments. The verse 8.362 of \"Manusmriti\" exempts the rules on adultery for women who earn their own livelihood or are wives of traveling performances, where the woman enters into sexual liaisons on her own volition or with the encouragement of the husband. The \"Manusmriti\", states Doniger offers two views on adultery. It recommends a new married couple to remain sexually faithful to each other for life. It also accepts that adulterous relationships happen, children are born from such relationships and then proceeds to reason that the child belongs to the legal husband of the pregnant woman, and not to the biological father. Other \"dharmasastra\" texts describe adultery as a punishable crime but differ significantly in the details. For example, adultery is not a punishable offence if \"the woman's husband has abandoned her because she is wicked, or he is eunuch, or of a man who does not care, provided the wife initiates it of her own volition\", states Indologist Richard Lariviere.\n\nAccording to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law. The \"Kamasutra\", a Hindu text on love and sex, Vatsyayana discusses the merits of adultery. For example, states Ariel Glucklich, the sexual liaison is taught as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, working against his enemies and facilitating his successes. It also explains the many signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into a sexual relationship outside of marriage, and when she does not want to commit adultery.\n\nOther Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, states Wendy Doniger, Krishna commits adultery and the \"Bhagavata Purana\" justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled. According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is \"prema\" or \"selfless, true love\" and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value.\n\nIn traditional Islamic law unlawful sexual intercourse is called \"zināʾ\" (زِنَاء) or \"zina\" (زِنًى or زِنًا). Classification of homosexual intercourse as zina differs according to legal school. The Quran disapproved of the promiscuity prevailing in Arabia at the time, and several verses refer to unlawful sexual intercourse, including one that prescribes the punishment of 100 lashes for fornicators. Four witnesses are required to prove the offense. Zina thus belong to the class of \"hadd\" (pl. \"hudud\") crimes which have Quranically specified punishments.\n\nAlthough stoning for zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of hadith that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender is \"muhsan\" (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios. The offenders must have acted of their own free will. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later. The Maliki legal school also allows an unmarried woman's pregnancy to be used as evidence, but the punishment can be averted by a number of legal \"semblances\" (\"shubuhat\"), such as existence of an invalid marriage contract. These requirements made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice. Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules. Making an accusation of zina without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called \"qadhf\" (القذف), which is itself a \"hadd\" crime.\n\nThe Torah explicitly forbids adultery. All women were expected to be virgins upon marriage. In the case they were found not to be by a betrothed husband, the punishment was death if the man to whom she married was not the man to whom she lost her virginity. Also if a man and a virgin had sex prior to marriage, then they were forced to marry.\n\nTo quote two sources, \"The Torah does not outlaw it—as it does many other types of sexual relationships—and the child of such a union is not considered a \"mamzer\" (illegitimate). Nonetheless, marital sex is considered ideal, and premarital sex is traditionally not approved of. The negative attitude toward premarital sex, to a large degree, reflects the overwhelmingly positive attitude toward sex within marriage.\" Likewise, \"The only limits placed on sexual activities in the Torah are prohibitions against adultery and incest. In Biblical times, a man was not prohibited from having sexual relations with a woman, as long as it led to marriage. The Bible never explicitly states a woman and man may not have sexual intercourse prior to marriage; therefore, no sanction was imposed for premarital sex, but it was considered a violation of custom.\"\n\nDespite the fact it is not condemned in the Torah, Orthodox Jews are opposed to premarital sex.\n\nSikhism condemns any type of adultery and pre-marital sex. This falls under the Sikh tenant of kaam, which translates to lust or greed.\n\nA survey undertaken by the \"American Sociological Review\" between 2000 and 2008 covering 31 developing countries found that \"94 percent of Jews... reported having premarital sex, compared to 79 percent of Christians, 65 percent of Buddhists, 43 percent of Muslims and 19 percent of Hindus.\"\n\nDuring the sixth century, Emperor Justinian formulated legislation that was to become the basis of Western marriage law for the next millennia. Under his laws, cohabiting couples were no longer recognised as married and their children were regarded as illegitimate, with the same status as the children of prostitutes. However, the status of illegitimate children could be updated if the parents later married.\n\nIn the 1170s, \"it was common practice for ordinary couples to cohabit before marriage and for cousins to marry one another\" and there was very little stigma around bastards at any social level in medieval England. For instance, William the Conqueror's right to succeed to the throne of Normandy was never questioned on the grounds he was a bastard nor, in his conflict with Harold Godwinson over who should rule England, was this issue raised as an argument against him. However, attitudes shifted a few generations later when bastards were no longer able to claim the English throne.\n\nDuring the ascendancy of the Puritans, an Act for suppressing the detestable sins of Incest, Adultery and Fornication was passed by the English Council of State in 1650. At the Restoration in 1660, this statute was not renewed, and prosecution of the mere act of fornication itself was abandoned. However, notorious and open lewdness, when carried to the extent of exciting public scandal, continued to be an indictable offence at common law.\n\nPrior to the passing of the Marriage Act 1753, laws against bastard children became more strict during the 1730s and 1740s.\n\nIn the Victorian era, however, the English working class continued to have a different set of sexual mores from the upper-middle and upper classes. Premarital intercourse was considered acceptable for the working class but only after an extended period of courtship and occurred infrequently even then. The couple were expected to marry, though. Disgrace only arose if the female became pregnant and the couple did not marry.\n\nEthical issues arising from sexual relations between consenting heterosexuals who have reached the age of consent have generally been viewed as matters of private morality, and so, have not generally been prosecuted as criminal offenses in the common law. This legal position was inherited by the United States from the United Kingdom. Later, some jurisdictions, a total of 16 in the southern and eastern United States, as well as the states of Wisconsin and Utah, passed statutes creating the offense of fornication that prohibited (vaginal) sexual intercourse between two unmarried people of the opposite sex. Most of these laws either were repealed, were not enforced, or were struck down by the courts in several states as being odious to their state constitutions. See also \"State v. Saunders\", 381 A.2d 333 (N.J. 1977), \"Martin v. Ziherl\", 607 S.E.2d 367 (Va. 2005).\n\nSome acts may be prohibited under criminal laws defining the offense of sodomy, rather than the laws defining the offense of fornication. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (2003) rendered the states' remaining laws related to sodomy unenforceable. \"Lawrence v. Texas\" is also presumed by many to invalidate laws prohibiting fornication: the decision declared sodomy laws unconstitutional, saying that they interfered with private, consensual, non-commercial intimate relations between unrelated adults, and therefore were odious to the rights of liberty and privacy, such rights being retained by the people of the United States.\n\nA 2003 survey reported that most non-religious Australians thought that premarital sex was acceptable. It showed that there was a correlation between liberalism, education levels, lack of religious beliefs and a permissive attitude to premarital sex.\n\nIn some Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Sudan, Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.\n\nAside from \"a few rare and isolated\" instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, there is no historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out. Zina became a more pressing issue in modern times, as Islamist movements and governments employed polemics against public immorality. During the Algerian Civil War, Islamist insurgents assassinated women suspected of loose morals, the Taliban have executed suspected adultresses using machine guns, and zina has been used as justification for honor killings. After sharia-based criminal laws were widely replaced by European-inspired statutes in the modern era, in recent decades several countries passed legal reforms that incorporated elements of hudud laws into their legal codes. Iran witnessed several highly publicized stonings for zina in the aftermath the Islamic revolution. In Nigeria local courts have passed several stoning sentences, all of which were overturned on appeal or left unenforced. In Pakistan, the Hudood Ordinances of 1979 subsumed prosecution of rape under the category of zina, departing from traditional judicial practice, and making rape extremely difficult to prove while exposing the victims to jail sentences for admitting illicit intercourse. Although these laws were amended in 2006, they still blur the legal distinction between rape and consensual sex. According to human rights organizations, stoning for zina has also been carried out in Saudi Arabia.\n\n"}

According to director Rohit Dhawan, the film is inspired from a village folk tale about a Brahmin, though most reviewers noted that the film's story-line has similarities with the 2003 Hollywood comedy \"Bruce Almighty\", starring Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston. However the film performed poorly at the box office.\n\nArun Prajapati (Salman Khan) has been trying to be a successful TV anchor, but success has always eluded him. He blames God (Amitabh Bachchan) for this lack of success. Arun is head over heels in love with Alia Kapoor (Priyanka Chopra), who is a TV anchor and a well-known star working in the same channel, but he has never been able to express his love for her.\n\nWhen Rocky (Sohail Khan) is appointed as an anchor for the channel, Arun starts believing that Rocky will win Alia. Later, Arun is sacked from the channel. He has nobody to blame but God Himself, whom he later meets in person. An argument ensues between the two, at the end of which God then decides to give Arun the power over all things for ten days, wherein Arun may prove that he is a better operator of the universe.\n\nArun uses this power to put Rocky into an uneasy spot and win Alia's heart. After God scolds him for only making things better for himself, Arun starts listening to people's prayers. He later realizes that considering each person's wishes individually would be too time-consuming, so to save time and effort he grants \"everybody's\" wishes, including the wish of criminals to be free and Rocky's wish that Alia marries him.\n\nArun later asks God why is everything happening to him. God explains it is his own fault and that everyone cannot blame Him for this. Arun feels bad, but God forgives him and starts his life over again. During the game show, he tricks Rocky into lying about loving Alia Kapoor (who was present on the show, as it was the channel \"Zoop\"'s first game show), and Alia turns on him. Arun wins the heart of Alia.\n\n\n\"God Tussi Great Ho\" was not considered commercially successful. However the movie has emerged as a moderate success on the home video circuit.\n\nThe music of the film is composed by Sajid-Wajid, and the lyrics are penned by Jalees Sherwani, Shabbir Ahmed and Deven Shukla.\n\n"}

The island of Réunion is home to approximately 200,000 Indian descendants amongst the roughly 800,000 strong population. .Estimates of practicing Hindus vary from 6.7% to 10.7%. .Yet, uncertainty as to the exact number of Hindus in the country results from the fact that many of the members of the Indian population cross-identify with Roman Catholic, Muslim and Hindu faiths.\n\nThe history of Hinduism in Réunion stretches back to the mid- and late-nineteenth century. Many early Indian arrivals took on Christian names and had their children baptised in the Catholic Church at the insistence of their employers, owners or the government administration. Even so, they did not abandon Hinduism in the process.The missionaries argued that the custom of lighting camphor before the Hindu God was an illustration of black magic, whereas lighting candle in the Church was a sure way to salvation.\n\nWith the exception of the Muslims who came to the island from Gujarat, all Indians were routinely reassigned as Catholics, more or less by force. Many of them appear to have been converted to that faith during the period of indenture.\n\nAlthough many have converted to Christianity,in the rear portion of every Tamil Christian house, there was a small structure dedicated to the Hindu goddess Mariamman where they worship.Several Hindu traditions have been subsumed by Christian traditions. The cult of Mariamman has been absorbed into the worship of Virgin Mary. Janmashtami, birth day of God Krishna, is considered to be the date of birth of Jesus Christ. Saint Expedit, worshipped locally, is identified with Goddess Kali.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a revival of Hinduism among members of the Tamil community. This has led to the establishment of many temples and ashrams. Some Gurukkals (Temple priests) were also brought from Tamil Nadu as a part of this.However the revival of Hinduism is fading.Dr Kalai Selvam Shanmugam, President of Tamil Sangham, Reunion said that Temple priests brought from Tamil Nadu were more interested in making money than in spreading the gospels of Hinduism. An interesting feature, likely peculiar to Réunion, is the simultaneous observance by some ethnic Indians of both Catholic and Hindu rites, a practice that has earned them the sobriquet of being \"socially Catholic and privately Hindu.\"\n\nThe French government gathers no statistics on religious affiliation. Because of this, it is impossible to know accurately how many Hindus there are in Réunion. Most of the large towns have a functioning Hindu temple.\n\nAbout 59% of the Gujarati,40% of the Punjabis,10% of the Tamils in Réunion are Hindus.\n\n\n"}

The broad concept encompasses the idea that the Christian worldview, faith, and practices of the student should be deeply connected within the learning experience. That said, different educators build their own visions of education onto the concept, what some call conceptions of faith learning integration. This idea is commonly found in Christian colleges in the United States, and is considered by some to be the essence of Christian higher education. PABATS, the accrediting association for Bible colleges in the Philippines has also shown interest in faith-learning integration. Christian Colleges of Southeast Asia, Southern Philippines Baptist Theological Seminary, Halls of Life Bible College, Davao Bible College and Koinonia Theological Seminary are now practicing faith and learning integration.\n\nHigher education in the United States began largely as a Christian endeavor. Nearly all of the colleges founded during the colonial period were founded and supported by the dominant Christian denominations of the time.\n\nSome scholars claim that the current model of American higher education is convoluted because it has worked to separate faith from learning.\n\n"}

{"id": "22771067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22771067", "title": "Jewish views on sin", "text": "Jewish views on sin\n\nJudaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an inclination to do evil \"from his youth\". Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin can't be a sin if the one who did it didn't know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.\n\nSins between people are considered much more severe in Judaism than sins between man and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repentance in Judaism, can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend. Eleazar ben Azariah derived [this from the verse]: \"From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed\" (Book of Leviticus, 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.\n\nWhen the Temple yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer Karbanot (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of \"karbanot\" is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, \"karbanot\" only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by error. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, \"karbanot\" cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, \"karbanot\" have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation.\n\nThe completely righteous (means a man who did nothing wrong in his life) enjoy in this life and in the life after. The not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for their sins in this world in order to atone for their sins through the humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them. If the repentance is not complete in this world, the suffering will continue in the life after (hell). After the repentance is complete they join the righteous. The completely wicked (a man who did nothing good in his life) cannot correct their sins in this world or in the other, and hence do not suffer for them here, but in \"gehinom\" (hell). The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave \"gehinom\", because they don't or can't repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this, but God's justice is long, precise and just.\n\nThe first mention of sin as a noun is a zoomorphism, with sin (\"hattath\") crouching at Cain's door. The first as a verb is Abimelech being prevented from sinning (\"khata\") against God in a dream. In fact the whole Tanakh is full of references to sins committed by leading people. This is to teach us that no one is perfect, everyone standing in trials/tests, and the thing is to try your best to learn from their mistakes.\n\nPeople do have the ability to master this inclination () and choose good over evil (conscience)(). Judaism uses the term \"sin\" to include violations of Jewish law that are not necessarily a lapse in morality. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia: \"Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will (\"behirah\"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: \"For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth\" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed people to repent and be forgiven.\" Judaism holds that all people sin at various points in their lives, and hold that God tempers justice with mercy.\n\nHebrew has several other words for sin beyond \"hata\", each with its own specific meaning. The word \"pesha\", or \"trespass\", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word \"aveira\" means \"transgression\". And the word \"avone\", or \"iniquity\", means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as \"sin\", \"hata\", literally means \"to go astray.\" Just as Jewish law, \"halakha\", provides the proper \"way\" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path.\n\nJudaism teaches that humans are born with free will, and morally neutral, with both a \"yetzer hatov\", (literally, \"the good inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a \"yetzer hara\", (literally \"the evil inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). The yetzer hara in some forms of Judaism means that Satan is merely an idiom or parable, rather than the fallen angel of traditional Christianity.\n\nObadiah ben Jacob Sforno suggests that the verse about a leader begins with the term \"when,\" which implies that committing a sin is inevitable because powerful and wealthy people—the leaders—are also likely to sin. This Torah verse concludes with the words \"realizes his guilt\" (Leviticus 4:22) because it is essential that powerful people acknowledge and feel remorse for their sin, lest they sin again.\n\nThe generic Hebrew word for any kind of sin is \"avera\" (literally: transgression). Based on verses in the Hebrew Bible, Judaism describes three levels of sin. There are three categories of a person who commits an avera. The first one is someone who does an avera intentionally, or \"B'mezid.\" This is the most serious category. The second is one who did an avera by accident. This is called \"B'shogeg,\" and while the person is still responsible for their action it is considered less serious. The third category is someone who is a \"Tinok Shenishba\", which is a person who was raised in an environment that was assimilated or non-Jewish, and is not aware of the proper Jewish laws, or halacha. This person is not held accountable for his or her actions.\n\nJudaism holds that no human being is perfect, and all people have sinned many times. The Talmud says: \"Everyone is responsible to be as great as Moses\", But then the Torah tells us in Deuteronomy 34:10 that \"No one will ever be as great as Moses\". This is to clarify that Moses fulfilled his own personal potential, so too we are expected to fulfill ours. Each person is born with a unique set of talents and tools. Some are rich, others are poor. Some are tall and some are short. One person can sing, another can write, etc. But these qualities are not what determine your greatness. Rather, it's how you deal with your particular circumstances. That's why Judaism says: It's not important where you are on the ladder, but how many rungs you've climbed. The crucial concept is the effort.\n\nThe story is told of Zusha, the great Chassidic master, who lay crying on his deathbed. His students asked him, \"Rebbe, why are you so sad? After all the mitzvahs and good deeds you have done, you will surely get a great reward in heaven!\". \"I'm afraid!\" said Zusha. \"Because when I get to heaven, I know God's not going to ask me 'Why weren't you more like Moses?' or 'Why weren't you more like King David?' But I'm afraid that God will ask 'Zusha, why weren't you more like Zusha?' And then what will I say?!\" \n\nJoseph Hertz said that sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of flesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake off its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An ancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous magnetic rocks of such terrific power that wreck and ruin would befall any ship venturing near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the ship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force, the vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and all on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that, likewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints of past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the billows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s barque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those mountains of destruction, darkness, and death.\n\nBased on the views of Rabbeinu Tam in the Babylonian Talmud (tractate Rosh HaShanah 17b), God is said to have Thirteen Attributes of Mercy:\n\n\nAs Jews are commanded in \"imitatio Dei\", emulating God, rabbis take these attributes into account in deciding Jewish law and its contemporary application.\n\nJews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jews have believed that right action (as opposed to right belief) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. Midrash \"Avot de Rabbi Natan\" states the following:\n\nIn Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult. There is almost always a \"way back\" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)\n\nSins between people are considered much more severe in Judaism than sins between man and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repent in Judaism can atones for Sins between man and God, but not for Sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.(Mishnah, Yoma,8:9). Eleazar ben Azariah derived [this from the verse]: \"From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed\" (Book of Leviticus,16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.\n\nThe Gemara (87a) continues: \"R. Yitzchak said: Whoever aggravates his fellow even through words is required to placate him… R. Yosi bar Chanina said: Whoever beseeches forgiveness from his friend should not beseech him more than three times. And if he died, [the offender] brings ten people and must stand them by his grave and he says, \"I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and so-and-so whom I wounded.\"\"\n\nTwo Jews came to a Chassidic Rabbi to ask advice about sins they had committed. One had committed a great sin for which he was sure God would never forgive him; the other was less worried, because he had never been guilty of anything so grave, but only of the normal collection of lesser sins. The Rabbi told them to go out to a field and select stones corresponding to the size and number of their sins, and later to return to the field and scatter the stones. This done, they came back to the Rabbi. “Now go to the field once more,” he told them both, “pick up the stones you scattered, and bring them to me.”\n\nHe who had committed the one big sin knew at once which was his stone, and brought it to the Rabbi. The other, however, had scattered so many little stones that he could not be certain of identifying them again. He had a most difficult time in finding his stones and bringing them to the Rabbi. The Rabbi then told them: “Your deeds are like your stones. You who brought one large stone, committed a grave sin. But you were conscious of what you had done, and with a determined effort at repentance you could be forgiven by God. But you, whose sins were many and small, like those of most human beings, have found how hard it is to catch up with one’s minor lapses. And no repentance of yours can possibly be effective until you realise that small things matter.”\n\nThe rabbis recognize a positive value to the \"yetzer hara\": one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was \"very good\" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as \"good\") and explain that without the \"yetzer ha'ra\" there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that \"yetzer ha'tov\" and \"yetzer ha'ra\" are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.\n\nOr as Hillel the Elder famously summarized the Jewish philosophy:\n\nAnother explanation is, without the existence of the \"yetzer ha'ra\", there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was \"good\" before, it became \"very good\" when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's \"mitzvot\" (commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud teaches that \"Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests].\" (Tractate Berachot, 55a.)\n\nRepentance in itself is also a means of atonement (See Ezekiel 33:11, 33:19, Jeremiah 36:3, etc.) The Hebrew word for repentance is \"teshuvah\" which literally means to \"return (to God).\" The prophet Hosea (14:3) said, \"Take with you words, and return to God.\"\n\nJudaism teaches that our personal relationship with God allows us to turn directly to Him at any time, as Malachi 3:7 says, \"Return to Me and I shall return to you,\" and Ezekiel 18:27, \"When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.\" Additionally, God is extremely compassionate and forgiving as is indicated in Daniel 9:18, \"We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy.\"\n\nThe traditional liturgy of the \"Days of Awe\" (the High Holy Days; i.e. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) states that prayer, repentance and tzedakah (charitable actions) are ways to repent for sin. In Judaism, sins committed against people (rather than against God or in the heart) must first be corrected and put right to the best of a person's ability; a sin which has not also been put right as best as possible cannot truly be said to be repented.\n\nTo a man who says “I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent,” the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness. For sins against God the Day of Atonement brings forgiveness; for sins against one’s fellowman, the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness till he has become reconciled with the fellowman he wronged (Mishnah Yoma 8:9).\n\nAccording to Maimonides in order to achieve true repentance the sinner must abandon his sin and remove it from his thoughts and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts” (Isaiah 55:7). Likewise must he regret the past, as it is said: “Surely after I turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18). He must also call Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again.\n\nAtonement for sins is discussed in the Hebrew Bible, known to Christians as the Old Testament. Rituals for atonement occurred in the Temple in Jerusalem, and were performed by the \"Kohanim\", the Israelite priests. These services included song, prayer, offerings and animal sacrifices known as the \"korbanot\". The rites for Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, are prescribed in the book of Leviticus chapter 16. The ritual of the scapegoat, sent into the wilderness to be claimed by Azazel, was one of these observances (Lev. 16:20-22).\n\nThe liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) states that prayer, repentance and tzedakah (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word \"T'shuvah\" used for atonement actually means \"to return\". Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too.\n\nA number of animal sacrifices were prescribed in the Torah (five books of Moses) to make atonement: a sin-offering for sins, and a guilt offering for religious trespasses. The significance of animal sacrifice is not expanded on at length in the Torah, though Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17 suggest that blood and vitality were linked. Conservative Jews and Christians argue at the present era that the Jews never believed that the aim of all sacrifice is to pay the debt for sins - only the sin offering and the guilt offering had this purpose; modern scholars of early Jewish history, however, often disagree and argue that this division came later.\n\nLater Biblical prophets occasionally make statements to the effect that the hearts of the people were more important than their sacrifices - \"Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams\" (I Samuel 15:22); \"For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings\" (Hosea 6:6); \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart\" (Psalm 51:17) (see also Isaiah 1:11, Psalm 40:6-8).\n\nAlthough the animal sacrifices were prescribed for atonement, there is no place where the Hebrew Bible says that animal sacrifice is the \"only\" means of atonement. Hebrew Bible teaches that it is possible to return to God through repentance and prayer alone. For example, in the books of Jonah and Esther, both Jews and gentiles repented, prayed to God and were forgiven for their sins, without having offered any sacrifices. Additionally, in modern times, most Jews do not even consider animal sacrifices.\n\nOn the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur - also known as the Day of Atonement-, and the ten-day period between these holidays, repentance of sins committed is based on specialized prayers and hymns, while some Jews continue the ancient methods of sacrifice. An example of a common method of \"sacrificing\" for the sake of repentance is simply to drop bread into a body of water (as in the ceremony of Tashlikh), to signify the passing of sins and the hope for one to be written into the Book of Life by God once again. This is especially emphasized on what is arguably the holiest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur.\n\n"}
{"id": "4092672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4092672", "title": "Johann Andreas Eisenmenger", "text": "Johann Andreas Eisenmenger\n\nJohann Andreas Eisenmenger (1654 in Mannheim – December 20, 1704 in Heidelberg) was a German Orientalist from the Electorate of the Palatinate, now best known as the author of \"Entdecktes Judenthum\" (\"Judaism Unmasked\").\n\nThe son of an official in the service of the Elector of the Palatinate Charles I Louis (who had, in 1673, offered Spinoza a chair in philosophy at Heidelberg), Eisenmenger received a good education, despite the early loss of his father to plague when he was 12 years old. He distinguished himself at the Collegium Sapientiae at Heidelberg by his zeal for Hebrew studies and Semitic languages. He eventually mastered Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic. He was sent by the Elector to England and Holland to pursue his studies there. He studied rabbinical literature with Jewish assistance for some 19 years both at Heidelberg and Frankfort-on-the-Main, under the pretense, it was rumoured, of wishing to convert to Judaism. In Holland he established amicable relations with figures like Rabbi David ben Aryeh Leib of Lida, formerly of Lithuania, and then head of the Ashkenazi community in Amsterdam. An intended sojourn in Palestine was interrupted by the death of his sponsor in 1680, who died in August of that year.\n\nLater scholars cite two episodes during his sojourn in Amsterdam, which may or may not be apocryphal, to account for the formation of his anti-Judaic outlook. It is said that he was a witness, in 1681, to \"otherwise unknown\" attacks against Christianity by a senior rabbi there, identified as David Lida, and that he grew indignant on finding that three Christians he met had had themselves circumcised and converted to Judaism. Anti-Christian polemics were, uniquely to Europe, published in Amsterdam and Eisenmenger's anger was aroused when Lida quoted Rabbi Isaiah ben Abraham Horowitz to the effect that the archangel Samael, king of the devils, was a celestial representation of Christians.\n\nThe method Eisenmenger employed in this work has been called both 'coarsely literalist and non-contextual' and 'rigorously scholarly and exegetical', involving the use only of Jewish sources for references, without forging or inventing anything. Having collected citations from 193 books and rabbinical tracts not only in Hebrew and Aramaic but also in Yiddish, all accompanied by German translations ranging over legal issues, cabala, homiletics, philosophy, ethics and polemics against both Islam and Christianity, he published his \"Entdecktes Judenthum\" (English titles include \"Judaism Unveiled\", \"Judaism Discovered\", \"Judaism Revealed\", and \"Judaism Unmasked\", with the latter title most commonly used), which has served as a source for detractors of Talmudic literature down to the present day. Eisenmenger made considerable use of works written by Jewish converts to Christianity, such as Samuel Friedrich Brenz's \"Jüdischer abgestreiffter Schlangen-Balg\" (\"Jewish cast-off snakeskin\", 1614), to bolster his anti-Jewish charges.\n\nThe work, in two large quarto volumes, appeared in Frankfurt in 1700, and the Elector, Prince Johann Wilhelm, took great interest in it, appointing Eisenmenger professor of Oriental languages in the University of Heidelberg. Eisenmenger's purpose, he avowed, was to have Jews recognize the errors of their ways and what he conceived to be the truth of Christianity. To this end he urged that several measures be undertaken, including restricting their economic liberties and rights, banning them from writing criticisms of Christianity, and proscribing both their synagogues and law courts.\n\nThe book was designed not only to reveal to Christians the existence of elements in Jewish rabbinical thought which Eisenmenger thought injurious to the Christian faith, but also to appeal to a free-thinking secular public, and to enlightened Jews whom he wished to shock by his revelations. In particular he hoped to use his evidence in order to promote the conversion of 'honest Jews' to his own faith. Paul Lawrence Rose writes:\n\n'Eisenmenger proceeded to amass quotations from the Talmud and other Hebrew sources revealing to all how the Jewish religion was barbarous, superstitious, and even murderous. All this was done in an apparently scholarly and reasonable way that belied the author's evident preoccupation (like Luther) with tales of Jewish ritual murder of Christian children and poisoning of wells. While piously insisting that the Jews must not be converted by cruel methods, Eisenmenger blithely recommended abolishing their present 'freedom in trade,' which was making them 'lords' over the Germans. He demanded too an immediate ban on their synagogues, public worship, and communal leaders and rabbis.'\n\nA further, if minor, element in his polemic consisted of an argument that Germans were a distinct people within Christianity, descended from the Canaanites, whom 'the Jews' were intent on destroying in accordance with Deuteronomy 7:16.\n\nInfluential Jewish members of the Court of the House of Habsburg, fearing that the book's publication would give additional strength to the prejudice against them, denounced it as a malicious libel, and the financier and rabbi Samson Wertheimer successfully petitioned Emperor Leopold I to have Eisenmenger's book suppressed. Only a year previously, riots against the Jews had occurred in the diocese of Bamberg, and that in the same year (July 21) a mob had, with the Court's permission, sacked the house of the Jewish Factor (\"Hoffaktor\") to the Court in Vienna, Samuel Oppenheimer. The aim of the riot was to pressure him over huge debts the Court had contracted for his services in financing the Habsburgs. Oppenheimer in turn succeeded in procuring an order of confiscation from the emperor, who commanded that the whole edition of 2,000 copies be placed under lock and key. However, the State refused to honour its debts to him. With him others worked for the same end, including Juspa van Geldern the great-grandfather of Heinrich Heine's mother. The Jesuit order, according to Hartmann, also complained about the book on the grounds that it slandered Catholicism. The anecdote perhaps is intended to suggest that the success of the Jewish request for the book's suppression depended on its association with the Jesuits' criticism\n\nAccording to one report written some decades later, the Jews had offered Eisenmenger the sum of 12,000 florins if he would suppress his work; but he was rumored to have demanded 30,000 florins, ostensibly in compensation for the considerable outlay from his own savings which the publication of the book had caused him to contribute. If any such proposed transaction was negotiated, nothing came of it. Eisenmenger died suddenly of apoplexy, some say induced by grief over the suppression of his book. in 1704.\n\nMeanwhile, two Jewish converts to Christianity in Berlin had brought charges against their former co-religionists of having blasphemed Jesus. King Frederick William I took the matter very seriously, and ordered an investigation. Eisenmenger's heirs applied to the king; and the latter tried to induce the emperor to repeal the injunction against the book, but did not succeed. He therefore ordered in 1711 a new edition of 3,000 copies to be printed in Berlin at his expense, but as there was an imperial prohibition against printing the book in the German empire, the title page gave as the place of publication Königsberg, which was beyond the boundaries of the empire. Almost forty years later the original edition was released.\n\nOf the many polemical works written by non-Jews against Judaism, Eisenmenger's has remained the most thoroughly documented one. Precisely because of its extensive citations of primary sources in their original languages, with facing translations, it has long furnished antisemitic journalists and pamphleteers with their main arguments. Eisenmenger undoubtedly possessed a great deal of knowledge. Jacob Katz writes:\n\n‘Eisenmenger was acquainted with all the literature a Jewish scholar of standing would have known ... [He] surpassed his [non-Jewish] predecessors in his mastery of the sources and his ability to interpret them tendentiously. Contrary to accusations that have been made against him, he does not falsify his sources.\"\n\nThere is no serious challenge to the authenticity of the sources Eisenmenger cited. What are often challenged are the many inferences he made from these texts, his tearing of citations from their context, the correctness of specific interpretations and, more importantly, his use of a relatively small number of texts within the huge chain of rabbinical commentary to characterise Judaism as a whole. In regard to the first two points, Siegfried, for one, argued that:\n\nIn regard to the third point, G. Dalman wrote that:\n\nThe Catholic theologian August Rohling exploited the material in Eisenmenger's book in order to construct the infamous fabrications of his influential antisemitic polemic \"Der Talmudjude\" (1871). The Lutheran biblical scholar Franz Delitzsch subjected Rohling's book to a close examination and found that he not only drew on Eisenmenger, but introduced many significant distortions. Rohling's book however coincided with a rise in antisemitism and often influenced humanist critics and/or antisemites, who often cite him, rather than Eisenmenger's own voluminous treatise. One such example is afforded by Sir Richard Francis Burton, who, in his antisemitic volume \"The Jew, Gypsy, and El Islam\" (1898), relied in part on Rohling's text. In recent decades the kind of material from rabbinical sources which Eisenmenger exploited to attack Judaism in general has been often discussed in contextualising certain extremist currents in modern Jewish fundamentalism, of the kind observed in religious-political movements like those associated with the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Meir Kahane, Abraham Isaac Kook and his son Zvi Yehuda Kook, such as Kach and Gush Emunim.\n\nAn English abridgment of Eisenmenger's volumes was published by John Peter Stehelin in 1748 under the title \"The Traditions of the Jews, with the Expositions and Doctrines of the Rabbins\".\n\nA 19th century German edition of \"Entdecktes Judenthum\", edited by Otto Brandner, was published by F. X. Schieferl, Dresden, 1893.\n\nEisenmenger edited with Johannes Leusden the unvocalized Hebrew Bible, Amsterdam, 1694, and wrote a \"Lexicon Orientale Harmonicum\", which to this day has not been published.\n\n\nFrom a polemical point of view:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "183955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183955", "title": "Jules Ferry", "text": "Jules Ferry\n\nJules François Camille Ferry (; 5 April 183217 March 1893) was a French statesman and republican. He was a promoter of laicism and colonial expansion.\n\nBorn in Saint-Dié, in the Vosges department, France, he studied law, and was called to the bar at Paris in 1854, but soon went into politics, contributing to various newspapers, particularly to \"Le Temps\". He attacked the Second French Empire with great violence, directing his opposition especially against Baron Haussmann, prefect of the Seine department. A series of his articles in \"Le Temps\" was later republished as \"The Fantastic Tales of Haussmannlaxupa\" (1868).\n\nElected republican deputy for Paris in 1869, he protested against the declaration of war with Germany, and on 6 September 1870 was appointed prefect of the Seine by the Government of National Defense.\n\nIn this position he had the difficult task of administering Paris during the siege, and after the Paris Commune was obliged to resign (5 June 1871). From 1872 to 1873 he was sent by Adolphe Thiers as minister to Athens, but returned to the chamber as deputy for the Vosges, and became one of the leaders of the Opportunist Republicans. When the first republican ministry was formed under W. H. Waddington on 4 February 1879, he was one of its members, and continued in the ministry until 30 March 1885, except for two short interruptions (from 10 November 1881 to 30 January 1882, and from 29 July 1882 to 21 February 1883), first as minister of education and then as minister of foreign affairs. A leader of the Opportunist Republicans faction, he was twice premier (1880–1881 and 1883–1885). He was an active Freemason initiated on July 8, 1875, in \"La Clémante amitiée\" lodge in Paris the same day as Émile Littré. He became a member of the \"Alsace-Lorraine\" Lodge founded in Paris in 1782.\n\nTwo important works are associated with his administration: the non-clerical organization of public education, and the major colonial expansion of France. Following the republican programme, he proposed to destroy the influence of the clergy in the university and found his own system of republican schooling. He reorganized the committee of public education (law of 27 February 1880), and proposed a regulation for the conferring of university degrees, which, though rejected, aroused violent polemics because the 7th article took away from the unauthorized religious orders the right to teach. He finally succeeded in passing his eponymous laws of 16 June 1881 and 28 March 1882, which made primary education in France free, non-clerical (laïque) and mandatory. In higher education, the number of professors, called the \"Republic's black hussars\" () because of their Republican support, doubled under his ministry.\n\nThe education policies establishing French language as the language of the Republic have been contested in the second half of the 20th century insofar as, while they played an important role in unifying the French nation state and the Third Republic, they also nearly caused the extinction of several regional languages.\n\nAfter the military defeat of France by Prussia in 1870, Ferry formed the idea of acquiring a great colonial empire, principally for the sake of economic exploitation.\nIn 1882 Jules Ferry, as Minister of Public Instruction, decided to create a mission to explore the Regency of Tunisia.\nThe expedition was headed by the botanist Ernest Cosson and included the botanist Napoléon Doumet-Adanson and other naturalists.\nIn 1884 a geological section under Georges Rolland was added to the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission.\nRolland was assisted by Philippe Thomas from 1885 and by Georges Le Mesle in 1887.\n\nIn a speech on the colonial empire before the Chamber of Deputies on 28 March 1884, he declared that \"it is a right for the superior races, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races.\" Ferry directed the negotiations which led to the establishment of a French protectorate in Tunis (1881), prepared the treaty of 17 December 1885 for the occupation of Madagascar; directed the exploration of the Congo and of the Niger region; and above all, he organized the conquest of Annam and Tonkin in what became Indochina.\n\nThe last endeavor led to a war with Qing dynasty China, which had a claim of suzerainty over the two provinces. The excitement caused in Paris by the sudden retreat of the French troops from Lạng Sơn during this war led to the Tonkin Affair: his violent denunciation by Clemenceau and other radicals, and his downfall on 30 March 1885. Although the treaty of peace with the Chinese Empire (9 June 1885), in which the Qing dynasty ceded suzerainty of Annam and Tonkin to France, was the work of his ministry, he would never again serve as premier.\n\nThe desire for a monarchy was strong in France in the early years of the Third Republic – Henri, Count of Chambord having made a bid early in its history. A committed republican, Ferry proceeded to a wide-scale \"purge\" by dismissing many known monarchists from top positions in the magistrature, army and civil and diplomatic service.\n\nThe key to understanding Ferry's unique position in Third Republic history is that until his political critic, Georges Clemenceau became Prime Minister twice in the 20th century, Ferry had the longest tenure as Prime Minister under that regime. He also played with political dynamite that eventually destroyed his success. Ferry (like his 20th century equivalent Joseph Caillaux) believed in not confronting Wilhelmine Germany by threats of a future war of revenge. Most French politicians in the middle and right saw it as a sacred duty to one day lead France again against Germany to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine, and avenge the awful defeat of 1870. But Ferry realized that Germany was too powerful, and it made more sense to cooperate with Otto von Bismarck and avoid trouble. A sensible policy – but hardly popular.\n\nBismarck was constantly nervous about the situation with France. Although he had despised the ineptness of the French under Napoleon III and the government of Adolphe Thiers and Jules Favre, he had not planned for all the demands he presented the French in 1870. He only wished to temporarily cripple France by the billion franc reparation, but suddenly he was confronted by the demands of Marshals Albrecht von Roon and Helmut von Moltke (backed by Emperor Wilhelm I) to annex the two French provinces as further payment. Bismarck, for all his abilities regarding manipulating events, could not afford to anger the Prussian military. He got the two provinces, but he realized it would eventually have severe future repercussions.\n\nBismarck was able to ignore the French for most of the 1870s and early 1880s, but as he found problems with his three erstwhile allies (Austria, Russia, and Italy), he realized France might one day take advantage of this (as it did with Russia in 1894). When Ferry came up with a radically different approach to the situation and offered an olive branch, Bismarck reciprocated. A Franco-German friendship would alleviate problems of siding with either Austria or Russia, or Austria and Italy. Bismarck approved of the colonial expansion that France pursued under Ferry. He only had some problems with local German imperialists who were critical that Germany lacked colonies, so he found a few in the 1880s, making certain he did not confront French interests. But he also suggested Franco-German cooperation on the imperial front against the British Empire, thus hoping to create a wedge between the two Western European great powers. It did as a result, leading to a major race for influence across Africa that nearly culminated in war in the next decade, at Fashoda in the Sudan in 1898. But by then both Bismarck and Ferry were dead, and the rapproachment policy died when Ferry lost office. As for Fashoda, while it was a confrontation, it led to Britain and France eventually discussing their rival colonial goals, and agreeing to support each other's sphere of influence – the first step to the Entente Cordiale between the countries in 1904.\n\nFerry remained an influential member of the moderate republican party, and directed the opposition to General Boulanger. After the resignation of Jules Grévy (2 December 1887), he was a candidate for the presidency of the republic, but the radicals refused to support him, and he withdrew in favour of Sadi Carnot.\n\nOn 10 December 1887, a man named Aubertin attempted to assassinate Jules Ferry, who later died from complications attributed to this wound on 17 March 1893. The Chamber of Deputies gave him a state funeral.\n\n\n\nChanges\n\n\n"}

The inscription, written in a mix of the Old Malay language using the Old Kawi script, was first deciphered by Dutch anthropologist and Hanunó'o script expert Antoon Postma in 1992.\n\nThe LCI documents the existence of several early Philippine polities as early as AD 900, most notably the Pasig River delta polity of Tondo. Scholars believe that it also indicates trade, cultural, and possibly political ties between these polities and at least one contemporaneous Asian civilization—the Medang Kingdom of the island of Java.\n\nThe inscription was written in Kawi script—a writing system developed in Java, and using a mixture of languages including Sanskrit, Old Javanese, and Old Malay. This was a rare trace of Javanese influence, which suggests the extent of interinsular exchanges of that time.\n\nPrior to the European colonialism, South East Asia including Malaysia were under the influence of Indosphere of greater India, where numerous Indianized principalities and empires flourhised for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term \"indianization\". French archaeologist, George Coedes, defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit dialect. This can be seen in the Indianization of Southeast Asia, spread of Hinduism and Buddhism. Indian diaspora, both ancient (PIO) and current (NRI), played an ongoing key role as professionals, traders, priests and warriors. Indian honorifics also influenced the Malay, Thai, Filipino and Indonesian honorifics. Examples of these include Raja, Rani, Maharlika, Datu, etc which were transmitted from Indian culture to Philippines via Malays and Srivijaya empire.\n\nThe pre-colonial native Filipino script called Baybayin (), known in Visayan as badlit (), as kur-itan/kurditan in Ilocano and as kudlitan in Kapampangan, was itself derived from the Brahmic scripts of India and first recorded in the 16th century.\n\nThe Laguna Copperplate Inscription was found in 1989 near the mouth of the Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay, by a man who was dredging sand to turn into concrete. Suspecting that the artifact might have some value, the man sold it to an antique dealer who, having found no buyers, eventually sold it to the National Museum of the Philippines, where it was assigned to Alfredo E. Evangelista, head of its anthropology department.\n\nA year later, Antoon Postma noted that the inscription was similar to the ancient Indonesian script of Kawi. Postma translated the script and found the document dated itself to the Saka year 822, an old Hindu calendar date which corresponds to 900 AD. This meant that the document pre-dated the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 and is from about the same time as the mention of the Philippines in the official Chinese Song dynasty \"History of Song\" for the year 972.\n\nThe inscription is on a thin copper plate measuring less than 20 × 30 cm (8 × 12 inches) in size with words directly embossed onto the plate. It differs in manufacture from Javanese scrolls of the period, which had the words inscribed onto a heated, softened scroll of metal.\n\nInscribed on it is year 822 of the Saka Era, the month of Waisaka, and the fourth day of the waning moon, which corresponds to Monday, April 21, 900 AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The text is Old Malay with numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin may be Old Javanese. Some contend it is between Old Tagalog and Old Javanese. The document states that it releases its bearers, the children of \"Namwaran\", from a debt in gold amounting to 1 \"kati\" and 8 \"suwarnas\" (865 grams; 27.8 troy ounces).\n\nPostma, who first translated the LCI, notes that place names and personal names in the LCI need to be carefully studied by scholars because “\"they furnish vital clues regarding the political & topographic background\"” of the world around the time of the LCI.\n\nGoing into the specifics of the text, he notes that: \"“the toponyms or placenames are: Pailah (lines 4 and 6); Tundun (line 3); Puliran (line 6) and Binwangan (line 7). Dewata (line 8) and Mdang (line 8) could be either personal names or toponyms.”\"\n\nPostma identified three of these toponyms, Binwangan, Pailah and Puliran, as Malayo-Polynesian (most likely Filipino) in origin, and three other toponyms, Tundun, Dewata and Mdang, as Sanskrit in origin.\n\nAfter carefully considering possible interpretations of the text, including the possibility that Pailah and Puliran were located in the Laguna Lake region, Postma concluded that he was confident that Binwangan, Pailah, and Puliran: \"“find their equivalents within the limited area of what is now known as Bulacan Province in the Philippines, [and that] the text of this same LCI can be considered to refer indeed to these places, already existing already under identical names in the tenth century.”\"\n\nPostma emphasized that his interpretation of the LCI placenames being in Bulacan puts these named settlements on key locations on Central Luzon’s river systems, which he referred to as \"“waterhighways”\" which allowed \"“an effective (and often only) means of transportation and communication between the different settlements”\" as well as \"“offering the seafaring traders of China and Southeast Asia of early times an easy access to interior trading centers via these riverine communication-lines.”\" He also noted that Central Luzon’s rivers were \"“much deeper and certainly were more navigable than they are today.”\"\n\nPostma’s assertions have been challenged a number of times, notably by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson. But these challenges have not been fully resolved by Philippine historiographers’ process of peer review.\n\nPostma asserted that he was fairly certain that four words in the LCI were place names, or toponyms: \"Pailah (lines 4 and 6); Tundun (line 3); Puliran (line 6) and Binwangan (line 7).\"\n\nTundun, whose name Postma believed to be \"Sanskrit in origin\", was referenced in line 3 of the LCI. It is the most easily recognizable of the toponyms identified by Postma in the LCI, and scholarly consensus generally agrees with Postma’s original identification of the LCI’s Tundun as Tondo, the polity located on the northern seaside of the Pasig River delta, where the Pasig River empties into Manila Bay.\n\nPostma left an avenue for an alternative interpretation open however, saying that Mdang and Tondo: \"“because of their lingual consonants (n and d) that are of Sanskrit origin might originally be toponyms existing on the Island of Java.”\"\n\nPostma identified Pailah, whose name he believed to be Malayo-Polynesian (and probably Filipino) in origin, as a \"“locality with its own leader.”\" It was referenced twice, in lines 4 and 6 of the LCI. Locating its possible location in Bulacan, Postma proposed its site to be \"“the village of Paila, in Barangay of San Lorenzo at the eastern part of the municipality of Norzagaray, with coordinates 14-54.5 & 121-06.9.”\"\n\nPostma identified Puliran, whose name he believed to be Malayo-Polynesian (and probably Filipino) in origin, as a \"“locality with its own leader”\" referenced in line 6 of the LCI. Postma asserted that Puliran was probably located in modern-day Bulacan, on the current site of \"“Pulilan, along the Angat (pronounced: Anggat) River…north of Manila, (coordinates: 14-54.2 & 120-50.8)”\"\n\nPostma believed that the place-name of Binwangan, referenced in line 7 of the LCI as a locality with its own leader, was Malayo-Polynesian (and probably Filipino) in origin. Locating its possible location in Bulacan, Postma proposed its site to be \"“the village of Binwangan, belonging to the municipality of Obando, situated at the mouth of the Bulacan River, with coordinates 14-43.2 & 120-543.”\"\n\nBased on linguistic analysis, Postma concluded that the words Dewata and Mdang \"“could be either personal names or toponyms.”\" He noted that their names seemed to be Sanskrit in origin, but did not go into a deep discussion of where they might have been located, other than to say Mdang was already known as a place name in Indonesia.\nAbinales and Amoroso (2005) note that the leaders of Dewata and Mdang (if these words are indeed to be accepted as toponyms) were not present for the transaction but were rather invoked as authorities in certifying the cancellation of the debt in question:\"“Jayadewa invokes the authority of the chief of Dewata, who in turn represents the chief of Medang.”\"\n\nPostma’s paper proposing his translation and interpretation of the LCI mentions that his search of the Indonesian toponym listings developed by Damais and Darmosoetopo, as well as his consultation with the 14th Congress of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association (IPPA) in August 1990, determined that Mdang was the only (possible) toponym in the LCI which matched with known Indonesian place-names.\n\nAbinales and Amoroso (2005), citing Patanñe (1996) note that this seems to refer to \"a temple complex in Java, where the kingdom of Mataram was a rival to Srivijaya.\"\n\nScholars after Postma, such as Patanñe (1996) and Abinales and Amoroso (2005) have come to identify the Dewata of the LCI as a settlement in or near \"“present-day Mt. Diwata, near Butuan”\"\n\nWhile it is clear in the text of the LCI that Jayadewa of Tondo is invoking the authority of the Chief of Dewata, the precise relationship between Dewata and Mdang is less clear. E.P. Patanñe notes: \"\"This relationship is unclear but a possible explanation is that the chief of Dewata wanted it to be known that he had a royal connection in Java.”\"\n\nPostma’s assertions regarding the exact locations of \"Pailah\" and \"Puliran\" and \"Binwangan\" have been challenged by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson, who assert that the place names \"Pailah\" and \"Puliran\" are more likely to refer to places close to where the plate was found - in Lumban, Laguna - given that archeological findings in nearby Pila show the presence of an extensive settlement during precolonial times.\n\nAccording to Tiongson's interpretation: \"Pailah\" refers to Pila; \"Puliran\" refers to Puliran, the old name of the territory that occupied the southeastern part of Laguna de Bay at the time; and \"Binwangan\" refers to modern day Barangay, Binawangan in Capalonga, Camarines Norte.\n\nThe Laguna Copperplate Inscription, among other recent finds such as the Golden Tara of Butuan and 14th century pottery and gold jewellery in Cebu, is highly important in revising the ancient Philippine history, which was until then considered by some Western historians to be culturally isolated from the rest of Asia, as no evident pre-Hispanic written records were found at the time. Philippine historian William Henry Scott debunked these theories in 1968 with his \"Prehispanic Source materials for the Study of Philippine History\" which was subsequently published in 1984.\n\nThe inscription is a document demonstrative of pre-Hispanic literacy and culture, and is considered to be a national treasure. It is currently deposited at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.\n\nThe transliteration of the inscription shows heavy Sanskrit, Old Javanese and Malay linguistic influences. Among the observations made by Antonio Pigafetta in the 16th century Boxer Codex was that Old Malay had currency amongst classical period Filipinos as a \"lingua franca\".\n\nThe use of Hindu references in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription could also suggest that the author or authors of the inscription were adherents of Hinduism. The Golden Tara statue, an ancient artifact discovered in Butuan, Agusan del Norte, dates from the same period and strongly suggests the presence of Hindu-Buddhist beliefs prior to the introduction (and subsequent subscription) to Roman Catholicism and Islam amongst Filipinos.\n\n"}

{"id": "4398216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4398216", "title": "Mount Penglai", "text": "Mount Penglai\n\nPenglai (Traditional Chinese: 蓬萊仙島 (\"lit. Penglai Immortal Island))\" is a legendary land of Chinese mythology. It is known in Japanese mythology as Hōrai.\n\nAccording to the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\", the mountain is said to be on an island in the eastern end of Bohai Sea, along with four other islands where the immortals lived, called Fāngzhàng (), Yíngzhōu (), Dàiyú (), and Yuánjiāo ().\n\nVarious theories have been offered over the years as to the \"real\" location of these places, including Japan, Nam-Hae (南海), Geo-Je (巨濟), Jejudo (濟州島) south of the Korean Peninsula, and Taiwan. Penglai, Shandong exists, but its claimed connection is as the site of departures for those leaving for the island rather than the island itself.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, the mountain is often said to be the base for the Eight Immortals, or at least where they travel to have a banquet, as well as the magician Anqi Sheng. Supposedly, everything on the mountain seems white, while its palaces are made from gold and platinum, and jewelry grows on trees.\n\nThere is no pain and no winter; there are rice bowls and wine glasses that never become empty no matter how much people eat or drink from them; and there are magical fruits growing in Penglai that can heal any disease, grant eternal youth, and even raise the dead.\n\nHistorically, Qin Shi Huang, in search of the elixir of life, made several attempts to find the island where the mountain is located, to no avail. Legends tell that Xu Fu, one servant sent to find the island, found Japan instead, and named Mount Fuji as Penglai.\n\nThe presentation of Mt. Hōrai in Lafcadio Hearn's \"\", is somewhat different from the earlier idyllic Chinese myth. This version, which does not truly represent the Japanese views of Horai in the Meiji and preceding Tokugawa periods, rejects much of the fantastic and magical properties of Hōrai. In this version of the myth, Hōrai is not free from sorrow or death, and the winters are bitterly cold. Hearn's conception of Hōrai holds that there are no magical fruits that cure disease, grant eternal youth or raise the dead, and no rice bowls or wine glasses that never become empty.\n\nHearn's incarnation of the myth of Hōrai focuses more on the atmosphere of the place, which is said to be made up not of air but of \"quintillions of quintillions\" of souls. Breathing in these souls is said to grant one all of the perceptions and knowledge of these ancient souls. The Japanese version also holds that the people of Hōrai are small fairies, and they have no knowledge of great evil, and so their hearts never grow old.\n\nIn the \"Kwaidan\", there is some indication that the Japanese hold such a place to be merely a fantasy. It is pointed out that \"Hōrai is also called Shinkiro, which signifies Mirage—the Vision of the Intangible\".\n\nYet uses of Mount Hōrai in Japanese literature and art of the Tokugawa period (1615–1868) reveal a very different view than Hearn's Victorian-influenced interpretation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100293", "title": "Mouride", "text": "Mouride\n\nThe Mouride brotherhood (, \"aṭ-Ṭarīqat al-Murīdiyyah\" or simply , \"al-Murīdiyyah\") is a large \"tariqa\" (Sufi order) most prominent in Senegal and the Gambia with headquarters in the city of Touba, Senegal, which is a holy city for the order. Adherents are called Mourides, from the Arabic word \"murīd\" (literally \"one who desires\"), a term used generally in Sufism to designate a disciple of a spiritual guide.The beliefs and practices of the Mourides constitute Mouridism. Mouride disciples call themselves \"taalibé\" in Wolof and must undergo a ritual of allegiance called \"njebbel\", as it is considered highly important to have a sheikh \"spiritual guide\" in order to become a Mouride. The Mouride brotherhood was founded in 1883 in Senegal by Amadou Bamba. The Mouride make up around 40 percent of the total population in Senegal. Their influence over everyday life can be seen throughout Senegal.\n\nThe Mouride brotherhood was founded in 1883 in Senegal by \"Shaykh\" Aḥmadu Bàmba Mbàkke, commonly known as Amadou Bamba (1850–1927). In Arabic, he is known as Aḥmad ibn Muhammad ibn Habīb Allāh or by the nickname \"Khadīmu r-Rasūl\" (\"Servant of the Prophet\"). In Wolof he is called \"Sëriñ Tuubaa\" (\"Holy Man of Touba). He was born in the village of Mbacké in Baol, the son of a marabout from the Qadiriyya, the oldest of the Muslim brotherhoods in Senegal.\n\nAmadou Bamba was a Muslim mystic and ascetic \"marabout\", a spiritual leader who wrote tracts on meditation, rituals, work, and \"tafsir\". He is perhaps best known for his emphasis on work, and his disciples are known for their industriousness. Although he did not support the French conquest of West Africa, he did not wage outright war on them, as several prominent Tijani \"marabouts\" had done. He taught, instead, what he called the \"jihād al-akbar\" or \"greater struggle,\" which fought not through weapons but through learning and fear of God.\n\nBamba's followers call him a \"mujaddid\" (a \"renewer of Islam\"). Bamba's fame spread through his followers, and people joined him to receive the salvation that he promised. Salvation, he said, comes through submission to the \"marabout\" and hard work.\n\nThere is only one surviving photograph of Amadou Bamba, in which he wears a flowing white kaftan and his face is mostly covered by a scarf. This picture is venerated and reproduced in paintings on walls, buses, taxis, etc. all over modern-day Senegal.\n\nAt the time of the foundation of the Mouride brotherhood in 1883, the French were in control of Senegal as well as most of West and North Africa. Although it had shared in the horrors of the pre-colonial slave trade, French West Africa was managed relatively better than other African regions during the Scramble for Africa and ensuing colonial era. Senegal enjoying small measures of self-rule in many areas. However, French rule still discouraged the development of local industry, preferring to force the exchange of raw materials for European finished goods, and a large number of taxation measures were instituted.\nAt the end of the 19th century, French colonial authorities began to worry about the growing power of the Mouride brotherhood and its potential to resist French colonialism. Bamba, who had converted various kings and their followers, could probably have raised an army against the French had he wanted. Fearful of his power, the French sentenced Bamba to exile in Gabon (1895–1902) and later Mauritania (1903–1907). However, Bamba's exile fueled legends about his miraculous ability to survive torture, deprivation, and attempted executions, and thousands more flocked to his organization. For example, on the ship to Gabon, forbidden from praying, Bamba is said to have broken his leg-irons, leapt overboard into the ocean, and prayed on a prayer rug that miraculously appeared on the surface of the water. In addition, when the French put him in a furnace, he is said to have simply sat down and had tea with The Prophet Muhammad. In a den of hungry lions, it is said the lions slept beside him.\nBy 1910, the French realized that Bamba was not waging war against them and was in fact quite cooperative. The Mouride doctrine of hard work served French economic interests, as addressed below. After World War I, the Mouride brotherhood was allowed to grow and in 1926 Bamba began work on the great mosque at Touba where he would be buried one year later.\n\nAmadou Bamba was buried in 1927 at the great mosque in Touba, the holy city of Mouridism and the heart of the Mouride movement. After his death Bamba has been succeeded by his descendants as hereditary leaders of the brotherhood with absolute authority over the followers. The \"caliph\" (leader) of the Mouride brotherhood is known as the \"Grand Marabout\" and has his seat in Touba. The caliphs up to Serigne Saliou Mbacké have all been sons of Bamba, starting with his oldest son:\n\nThe \"Grand Marabout\" is a direct descendant of Amadou Bamba himself and is considered the spiritual leader of all Mourides. There is a descending hierarchy of lower-rank \"marabouts\", each with a regional following.\n\n\"Dahiras\" are urban associations of Mourides-based either on shared allegiances to a particular marabout or common geographical location, for example, a neighborhood or city-specific dahira.\n\n\"Daaras\" are \"madrassas\" or quranic schools. They were originally founded by the shayh, his descendants, or disciples to teach the Quran and the Khassida as well as cultivating the land. Hence they have grown to be associations of Mourides, generally based on shared allegiance to a particular \"marabout\".\n\nOne famous disciple of Bamba, Ibrahima Fall, was known for his dedication to God and considered work as a form of adoration. Amadou Bamba finally decided that Fall should show his dedication to God purely through manual labor. Ibrahima Fall founded a sub-group of the Mouride brotherhood called the Baye Fall (), many of whom substitute hard labor and dedication to their marabout for the usual Muslim pieties like \"salah\" and \"sawm\".\n\nSheikh Ibrahima Fall was one of the first of Amadou Bamba's disciples and one of the most illustrious. He catalysed the Mouride movement and led all the labour work in the Mouride brotherhood. Fall reshaped the relation between Mouride \"talibes\" (disciples) and their guide, Amadou Bamba. Fall instituted the culture of work among Mourides with his concept of \"Dieuf Dieul\", (\"you reap what you sow\"). Ibra Fall helped Amadou Bamba to expand Mouridism, in particular with Fall's establishment of the Baye Fall movement. For this contribution, Serigne Fallou, the second \"Caliph\" (leader) after Amadou Bamba, named him \"Lamp Fall\" (the light of Mouridism). In addition, Ibrahima Fall earned the title \"Bab al-Murīdīna\", \"Gate of the Mourides.\"\n\nThe members of the Baye Fall dress in colorful ragged clothes, wear their hair in dreadlocks which are called \"ndiange\" (\"strong hair\"), which they decorate usually with homemade beads, wire or string. They also carry clubs, and act as security guards in the annual \"Grand Magal\" pilgrimages to Touba. Women usually are covered in draping coverings including their heads and occasionally are known to wear highly decorative handmade jewelry made from household or natural items. In modern times the hard labor is often replaced by members roaming the streets asking for financial donations for their \"marabout\". Several Baye Fall are talented musicians. A prominent member of the Baye Fall is the Senegalese Musician Cheikh Lô.\n\nCheikh Ahmadou Bamba taught the Three Pillars of Mouridism:\nIn summary, a Mouride aspires to achieve Islam by following the basic recommendations of \"Shariat\". This includes (but is not limited to) performing individual obligations (\"Fard Ayn\") such as prayer, ablution, fasting, pilgrimage and giving charity. A Mouride aspires to achieve \"Iman\" by the Six Articles of Faith: Belief in Allâh, his Angels, the Prophets, the revealed Holy Books, the Day of Judgment and the Divine Decree. A Mouride aspires to achieve \"Ihsan\" by the path of \"Tasawwuf\" (Sufism) through taking initiation (\"Bayat\") with a Sheikh of the \"Tariqat\".\n\nAdditionally to the Three Pillars of Mouridism, the Mourides follow what is called the Mouride Triangle:\n\nAmadou Bamba is considered a \"mujaddid\" (renewer of Islam) by his followers, citing a \"hadith\" that implies that God will send renewers of the faith every 100 years. The members of all the Senegalese brotherhoods claim that their founders were such renewers. The Mouride beliefs are based on Quranic and Sufi traditions and influenced by the Qadiri and Tijani brotherhoods, as well as the works by the scholar al-Ghazali. Amadou Bamba is known to have written more than 1000 books in Classical Arabic, all of which are based on the Quran and \"Hadith\". Ahmadou Bamba is known to have said \"If it's not in the Qur'an or Hadith, it's not from me\".\nMourides sometimes call their order the \"Way of Imitation of the Prophet\". Parents sometimes send their sons to live with the \"marabout\" as \"talibes\" rather than giving them a conventional education. These boys receive Islamic training and are instilled with the doctrine of hard work.\n\nMany Mourides consider the city of Touba as equally or even more important than Mecca. Pilgrims regularly come to Touba all year round, but the peak of the year is a mass pilgrimage called the Grand Màgal, which celebrates Bamba’s return from exile.\n\nSenegalese politicians have courted the Mouride brotherhood since independence. Even before independence, French colonial administrators recognized that the Mouride brotherhood was well-respected among the Senegalese and partnered with them to promote political and social order. Traditional Wolof aristocrats had proven problematic as intermediaries for the colonial authorities, and they hoped that Mouride leaders would be more effective and legitimate. When the Senegalese population was allowed to elect a deputy to the French Assembly during the 19th century, the Mouride brotherhood played a key role in shaping who that deputy was. This was the first instance of their role in politics. During the French colonial reign, the \"marabouts\" usually gave their support to politicians based upon their support of the brotherhood's leaders and interests. This successful partnership lead to future cooperation between the Senegalese government and the Mouride brotherhood.\n\nAfter universal suffrage was given in 1956, Senegal saw a rapid increase in the number of voters, almost triple the number just 10 years prior. This swift increase meant more power for the marabout whose outreach spread largely over the rural and peasant communities, which now had the opportunity to vote. A loyal follower of the Mouride is ideologically required to follow his religious leaders instructions, if the follower decided to disregard his instructions, the follower is at risk of losing any material support that would have been given to him. Because of the \"marabouts\" far reaching influence in Senegal, politicians made a considerable effort to attain the support from these religious leaders for their personal advancement. In order to attain their support in elections, bribes and material incentives were given to marabouts from political parties and potential candidates. Many believed that no party could hope to attain political power if the marabouts were completely opposed to it, and any party who rose to power had to comply with the Marabout’s demands or lose their political support.\n\nWhile the political elite finds itself regularly in the position of working through the \"marabouts\", their ultimate goal is to function without them. \"Marabouts\" for their part seek to maintain and ensure that the state remains dependant on them for influential control over citizens. Besides their influence over many rural and peasant communities, the religious leaders also have other means of maintaining political influence. One such mean is the power the religious leaders have as magicians. In exchange for political favors, these magicians give political leaders a powerful amulet which is thought to bring advancement for oneself or disaster for ones enemies. This power is believed in by many and is sought after by ministers, civil servants, and followers alike. Another aspect of influence that the religious leaders have is the material means to influence local leaders and politicians. The shaikh (religious leaders) can seek to buy the agreement through gifts and help to promote the career or threat to ruin the career of these local politicians and leaders.\n\n\"Marabout\" very rarely themselves participate directly in the political process. What is more common is to see them exert their influence over their followers and use this in return to gain a larger presence in the Senegalese politics. Such things as withholding seed from granaries, unless followers purchase party cards, is a way that some marabouts exert their influence in the region to attain votes. Other marabout may actually seek out political office, but most prefer to use their influence as an intermediary of politics in Senegal.\n\nAlthough recently Mourides have become more involved in the highest level of politics. Abdoulaye Wade who is the immediate former president of Senegal is also a devout Mouride. The day after his election in 2000 Wade travelled to Touba to seek the blessing of the \"Grand Marabout\", Serigne Saliou Mbacké.\n\nGroundnuts are the third largest export from Senegal after fish and phosphates. The amount of groundnut crop which the Mourides produce has been estimated to range from one-third to three-quarters of Senegalese groundnut production, although others have now estimated it to equal around one-half of the national total of groundnuts produced. This partnership between the Brotherhood and the government stems from the French colonial administrators, who had viewed the production of groundnuts by the Mourides as a means of economic advantage through the increasing production of crops for export.\nDue to this high proportion of groundnut crop produced by the Mouride, the brotherhood has always seemed to have a large influence in the groundnut market and the economy. Economic involvement is in fact encouraged by the religious leaders to their disciples through the use of ideology that places great value on the production labor which is performed in the service of God. Thus the Mourides devoted themselves to prayer and unpaid agricultural labor in service to their religious leaders. They cultivated the marabout’s fields for a decade, and then returned all land profits earned from the groundnut production. After ten years of dedicated work, laborers then received a share of land (large estates were divided up among the laborers). They continued to turn a share of their agricultural output over to their spiritual guide, as groundnut production was the community’s only means of sustenance.\n\nThe large share of the Mouride's control over the groundnut production has placed them in the center of the nation's economy. The government's economic planners in turn have kept the brotherhood in their minds when establishing policies about groundnut production. Although the government places an importance on the Mouride cultivators, the disciples do not have efficient ways of cultivating groundnuts, and their techniques are often destructive to the land. Rather than looking out for the best use of the land, the Mouride cultivators are more interested in a fast payback. The methods used by the marabout have led to a constant depletion of the forests in Senegal and have taken much of the nutrients out of the soil. Government agencies have made attempts to help the marabout become more efficient in groundnut production, such as providing incentives for the workers to slow down their production.\n\nBecause of their emphasis on work, the Mouride brotherhood is economically well-established in parts of Africa, especially in Senegal and the Gambia. In Senegal, the brotherhood controls significant sections of the nation's economy, for example the transportation sector and the peanut plantations. Ordinary followers donate part of their income to the Mouridiya.\n\nIslam is central to the political sociology of Senegal: the religious elite carry great weight in national politics; political discourse is replete with references and appeals to Islam. There is virtually no opposition to the principle of the secular state, socio-political cleavages based on religion, whether between Muslim and non-Muslim or between Sufi orders, are also virtually non-existent. Within Muslim discourse we find constant reference to such concepts as Islamic government, Islamic economics, or Islamic social order. The essential Islamic core lies in the shared belief in the fundamental unity of the Muslim world. The sense of belonging to a larger community, felt by many Muslims, is reinforced by the common use of Arabic as the language of prayer and religious learning.\n\nIslam is a powerful mobilization instrument and provides the rhetoric for the formulation of ideological movements, and serves as a force for mobilizing people in the pursuit of goals defined by those movements. The role of local Islamic social structures, the nature of leadership and the relations between leaders and followers, the nature and sources of power and authority and the limits and constraints of the economy are all factors, which mediate and direct the impact of Islam on Politics. Senegalese elites have not found appeals to ethnic solidarity a productive means of building a mass following. Common religious affiliation has played a role in defusing the potential for tensions that arise from other social cleavages. There however remains a potential for ethnic and caste divides to enter the Senegalese socio-political organization.\n\nThe Senegalese have a mystical aspect to Islam, much like other Sufism brotherhoods. In Senegal, Islamic practice usually requires membership in religious brotherhoods that are dedicated to the marabouts of these groups. Marabouts are believed to be the mediators between Allah and the people. The people seek the help of marabouts for protection from the evil spirits, to improve one’s status (in terms of career, love or relationship, finances etc.), to obtain a cure or remedy for sickness, or even to curse an enemy. Marabouts are believed to have the ability to deal with the spirit world and seek the spirits’ help in things impossible for humans. The spirits’ help is sought since they are thought to be a source of much \"baraka\" \"blessings, divine grace\".\n\nThe marabouts of the Mouride Brotherhood devote less time to study and teaching than other brotherhoods. They devote most of their time to ordering their disciples’ work and making amulets for their disciples' work and making amulets for their followers. Devout Mourides’ homes and workplaces are covered with pictures and sayings of their marabout, and they wear numerous amulets prepared by them. These acts are believed to bring them a better life and solve their problems as well. Even taxi and bus drivers fill their vehicles with stickers, paintings and photos of the marabouts of their particular brotherhoods.\n\nThe marabout-talibe relationship in Senegal is essentially a relationship of personal dependence. It can be a charismatic or a clientelistic relationship. In a charismatic relationship demonstrations of devotion and abnegation towards the marabouts can only explained because their talibes see them as intercessors or even intermediaries with god. This charismatic relationship is reinforced and complemented by a parallel clientelistic relationship between marabout and follower. The results is that marabouts are expected to provide certain material benefits to their follower in addition to the spiritual ones.\n\nThis patronage function has been important in the distribution of land, especially during periods of expanding peanut cultivation. Mouride social organization was developed in the context of the expanding peanut economy and its unique formulation was adapted to the economic imperatives of that context. The most distinctive institutional expression of Mouride agro-religious innovation is the daara, an agricultural community of young men in the service of a marabout. These collective farms were largely responsible for the expansion of peanut cultivation. A Mouride peasant may submit to a marabout’s organization of agricultural work because it is the best option available to him, independently of the ideology which supports it.\n\nIn contrast to a vision of masses blindly manipulated by a religious elite, the ties of talibes to their marabouts are frequently far more contingent and tenuous than assumed. As a result, marabouts confront the problem of recruiting and retaining followers. People at times confront a choice of which marabout to follow, the level of attachment to that marabout, and the domains or situations in which to follow him. While there is a widespread belief in the marabout system in Senegal and a strong commitment to it, it is not necessarily accompanied by an absolute attachment to any one living marabout.\n\nThe brotherhood has a sizable representation in certain large cities in Europe and the United States. Most of these cities with a large Senegalese immigrant population have a \"Keur Serigne Touba\" (Residence of the Master of Touba), a seat for the community which accommodates meetings and prayers while also being used as a provisional residence for newcomers. In Paris and New York City, a number of the Mouride followers are small street merchants. They often send money back to the brotherhood leaders in Touba.\n\nIn 2004 Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour released his Grammy Award winning album \"Egypt\", which documents his Mouride beliefs and retells the story of Amadou Bamba and the Mouridiya.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5252615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5252615", "title": "Off the derech", "text": "Off the derech\n\nOff the derech (OTD), from the Hebrew word (meaning 'path'), is an expression used to describe someone who leaves an Orthodox Jewish community. The term applies to a broad range of ex-Orthodox Jews, including those who leave Hasidic communities, ultra-Orthodox or Haredi communities, and Modern Orthodox communities. At times, individuals who move from a stricter form of Orthodoxy to a more lenient form of Orthodoxy are considered \"off the derech\" by their original communities.\n\nOTD is not a movement per se, as there are no leaders, established groups, single philosophy, or organized outreach. OTD individuals find their own paths in life, ranging in degrees of connection to Judaism or to spirituality, while some embrace other religions and some are secular and/or atheist.\n\nThere are three broad groups of those who have left Orthodoxy. There are the \"kids at risk\" – those people who behave badly, do drugs, engage in criminal activity, and do not keep halacha; those who are well-adjusted and have stopped keeping halacha; and those who still keep halacha, but do not share the beliefs of their previous form of Orthodoxy.\n\nThe term was originally derogatory, coined by Orthodox Jews to denote that someone had left what they considered to be the one true path. However, OTD individuals and groups have reclaimed the term and often use it to describe themselves, despite the previous negative connotations. Some use it simply as a convenient shorthand, while others use it in the sense of being off a narrow path and on a wider one. Some use \"OTD\" to cheekily mean ' the derech', arguing that they have found their own paths. Within the broad range of OTD individuals and groups, there is a difference of opinion on whether it is better to reclaim the term or to use a new one altogether. One alternative is \"XO\", a term coined by an OTD individual to signify 'ex-Orthodox' while also playing on a term for 'love'.\n\nThough people have left religious Judaism throughout history, the term is anachronistic if used to describe an individual who lived before the 20th century. The contemporary phenomenon of OTD shares some similarities with the Haskalah movement in its disaffection with traditional modes of religion, its secularization and interest in secular education, and in experimenting with a secular Jewish culture. Like Haskalah, its members tend to be secularists and religious decentralists.\n\nNishma Research carried out a survey of OTD individuals in 2016, which revealed a widely-varied and complex set of reasons people leave, and the process in which they do so. \n\nThe dominant Orthodox perspective is that people leave because of \"ta'avos\", temptations, which they are too weak to resist. The Nishma study, as well as a study by Faranak Margolese, found that not to be the case. Rather, \"Most formerly observant Jews today seem to have left, not because the outside world pulled them in, but rather because the observant one pushed them out. They experienced Judaism as a source of pain ... so they did what was natural: run in the other direction.\"\n\nOther studies point to the social and emotional aspect of Orthodox Judaism, and individuals' feelings of being silenced, marginalized, or ignored within the rigid social structure.\n\nEmotional and intellectual factors in an individual's decision to continue practicing Orthodox Judaism or to leave cannot be separated. As Margolese writes, \"Observance = Positive feelings + Belief + Ability to implement (in that order).\"\n\nSome selected reasons revealed by these studies:\n\nOne study by Roni Berger found four milestones common in the narratives of study participants: 1) initial questioning; 2) growing doubts; 3) beginning to share selectively with a small group of trusted others; 4) revealing a new and altered identity. This process of religious disaffiliation is echoed by Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh (1988) in an article about ex-nuns. In the case of nuns, Ebuagh says the process is 1) first doubts; 2) seeking and weighing role alternatives; 3) a turning point; 4) establishing an ex-role identity.\n\nLynn Davidman's book acknowledges the often messy process of leaving, including a period of \"passing\" when individuals would move between two worlds. This period is characterized by confusion, doubts, depression, and defiance, but also by self-confidence and courage to leave the regimented world they grew up in and begin to live in another world.\n\nIndividuals who leave Orthodox Judaism often face rejection from friends and family members. This knowledge often leads individuals who have doubts to first try to reconcile their doubts, in order to avoid the risk of losing family and friends. At this stage, individuals often experience anxiety and depression.\n\nLeaving any faith-based community has its traumatic effects, including the need to come to grips with losing a sense of reliance on a god, and reconciling one's self to the idea that one must stand on one's own two feet. OTD individuals also struggle with ideas ingrained about god's punishment, often leading to extreme feelings of guilt.\n\nLeaving a close-knit community where every member of the community is taken care of is often financially challenging as well.\n\nThe suicide rate among those who have left Orthodox Judaism is disproportionately high. Faigy Mayer's 2015 suicide was covered by many media outlets, which led to a spate of think-pieces about OTD suicides.\n\nIndividuals who leave Orthodox communities often have difficulty extricating themselves from the religious life while still maintaining contact with families, and they often have difficulty adjusting to the secular world after leaving the insularity of the Orthodox enclaves. Many individuals form groups of friends who get together for shabbat dinners and other practices with cultural significance.\n\nSome Haredi Jews never leave the community despite losing their faith, and they are sometimes referred to as Reverse Marranos, double-lifers, or Orthoprax Jews. The decision to stay is often influenced by fear of being ostracized and having to rebuild community, or by fear of losing one's spouse and/or children.\n\nMany OTD individuals become activists for various causes. Some examples: ZAAKAH works to prevent child sexual abuse, YAFFED advocates for basic secular education among ultra-Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, and JQY focuses on LGBTQ+ causes. Many OTD individuals are also involved in \"Unchained at Last\", Unchained at Last which works to end child marriages and forced marriages.\n\nThe perspective of Orthodox individuals and leaders toward those who left range from considering them apostates to be shunned and derided, to wayward people in pain who need to be shown love.\n\nAgudath Israel of America, a leading ultra-Orthodox organization, addresses the topic of individuals leaving Orthodox Judaism often. At their national conventions in 2015 and 2016, they addressed the topic in panels titled \"OTD: Why Do They Leave? And What Can We Do About It?\" and \"Diving Off The Derech The Emerging Adult At Risk Phenomenon.\"\n\nAd-hoc OTD communities have developed, with the most established being Footsteps, founded in December 2003 to help orthodox Jews who want to explore the option of leaving their insular communities. Informal communities have developed on websites, blogs and Facebook groups as well.\n\n\nA few stories have been recorded, as in the documentary film One of Us and in a trending New York Times piece by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. Off the Derech profiles OTD individuals' stories, and many blogs detail the process and journey of questioning, struggling with doubt, leaving, and adjusting to secular society.\n\nOTD individuals in the public eye include:\n\n\n"}

A pure, inner type of thought focus may thus arise.\n\nThe technique is also widely practised in a number of martial arts notably Chinese systems such as Baguazhang, T'ai chi ch'uan, and other styles of Kung Fu.\nThe reverse breathing is believed to activate healing and protective Chi as the practitioner is consciously controlling the breath in a way opposite to normal breathing.

They were suspected in the disappearances of 18 women in Illinois in 1981 and 1982.\n\nThe first victim of the gang was 28-year-old Linda Sutton, who was abducted on May 23, 1981. Ten days later, her body was found in a field in Villa Park, Illinois. Her body had been mutilated and her left breast amputated. It was almost a year before the gang struck again. On May 15, 1982, they abducted Lorraine Borowski, just as she was about to open the realtor's office where she worked. Her body was discovered five months later, in a cemetery in Clarendon Hills. On May 29, they abducted Shui Mak from Hanover Park, a village northwest of Villa Park. Her body was not found for four months. Two weeks after they abducted Mak, they picked up Angel York in their van, handcuffed her and slashed her breast before throwing her out of the van, still alive. Unfortunately, York's description of her attackers failed to produce any leads. \n\nThe gang did not strike again for two months. On August 28, 1982, the body of Sandra Delaware was discovered on the bank of the Chicago River. She had been stabbed, strangled, and her left breast was amputated. On September 8, 31-year-old Rose Davis was found in an alley, having suffered almost identical injuries as Delaware. A month later, the gang committed their last crime. Their victim, Beverley Washington, was found by a railroad track on December 6. In addition to other injuries, her left breast had been amputated and her right breast was severely slashed. She survived the attack, and was able to give descriptions of her attackers and the van they had used to abduct her.\n\nThe men were suspects in the disappearance of Carole Pappas, wife of Chicago Cubs pitcher, Milt Pappas. She disappeared on September 11, 1982. Her body was recovered five years later, and the death was ruled an accident.\n\nWhen Gecht was first arrested, he had to be released because the police had little evidence connecting him to the crimes. After further investigation, though, the police discovered that in 1981, he had rented a room in a motel along with three friends – each with adjoining rooms. The hotel manager said that they had held loud parties and appeared to be involved in some kind of cult. Police then tracked down the other men, Edward Spreitzer and the Kokoraleis brothers. When interrogated, Thomas Kokoraleis confessed that he and the others had taken women back to Gecht's place – what Gecht called a \"satanic chapel.\" There they had raped and tortured the women, and amputated their breasts with a wire garrotte. Kokoraleis went on to say that they would eat parts of the severed breasts as kind of a sacrament, and that Gecht would masturbate into the breasts before putting them in a box. Kokoraleis claimed that he once saw 15 breasts in the box.\n\nThe Kokoraleis brothers and Spreitzer confessed to their crimes, but Gecht protested his innocence. After a series of trials, Thomas Kokoraleis was convicted of murder but only sentenced to life imprisonment as his reward for his initial confession. Since then his life sentence has been commuted and he was scheduled to be released on September 29, 2017, but his parole was denied by Illinois officials. His current release date is September 30, 2020. He is currently located in the Illinois River Correctional Center. Gecht is serving 120 years in the Menard Correctional Center for the attempted murder and rape of Beverly Washington and will be eligible for parole in 2022. Andrew Kokoraleis was sentenced to death and was executed by lethal injection on March 16, 1999.\n\nEdward Spreitzer was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted in George H. Ryan's last-minute commutation of all death sentences in Illinois in 2003. Incidentally, Andrew Kokoraleis' was Governor Ryan's only execution, just over two months into his administration. Kokoraleis was also the last inmate executed in Illinois, almost 12 years before Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation to abolish the death penalty on March 9, 2011, and commuted 15 death sentences to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nThe Kokoraleis brothers were raised Greek Orthodox. The Orthodox Church attempted unsuccessfully to keep Andrew Kokoraleis from being executed. Dimitrios Kantzavelos, at that time a chancellor (later a bishop) of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of Chicago, became an anti-death-penalty activist as a result of the execution, and helped lobby in favor of ending the death penalty in the state.\n\n"}

They pointed out one of these occultists, the very center of all superstition they disliked: a woman known as \"The Soulmother\" or \"The mother of souls\" in Küssnacht. Her case is a known example of a witch trial toward a medium.\n\nThis woman, whose real name is not known, had for a period of thirteen years, since 1560, had a lucrative business as a medium. It is said that when someone died the mourners ran to the soulmother, who had visions and could speak to the dead and tell the mourners how to set the dead to rest. Through the spirits with whom she spoke she received news from the other world about what the customers asked her about and then recommended what they should do. When the customers arrived, she could tell them what they wanted before they had the time to state their business, and then she consulted the spirits during the following nights, while the clients stayed the night at the boarding-house of her companion, Verena Lifibach.\n\nWhen she summoned a spirit, she measured the windows and the doors with thread, holy water and palms were placed out, if it was Saturday, a circle was drawn out, and then with fifteen words \"out of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ\", the spirit was summoned. According to her assistant Riss, the good spirits were white, the evil ones yellow. \n\nThe Soulmother received visitors every day and had a very lucrative business. Her reputation had been damaged lately during a consultation when she claimed she saw a missing man as dead, after which he returned alive to his home six months later.\n\nThe bishop of Konstanz contacted the governments of Luzern and Schwyz, and she was put before the council of Schwyz for her \"non Christian fantasies\". The court first thought the accusations were slander. But after having questioned her, they dealt swiftly with her. She was tortured to confess to witchcraft. Although she tried to claim that she was not as dangerous as a known alleged witch, the so-called Die Sagerin, she was judged guilty. She was burned alive at the stake in November 1577. \n\nVerena Liefbach was banished, and assistant Riss, who seems to have been released, was arrested again a couple of years later accused of claiming to be able to tell the cause of a miscarriage or stillbirth by burning the hair of the dead infant in the light of a candle: if it was human, the hair turned blue when it burned, if it was a spirit, the hair turned black.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48682704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48682704", "title": "The Satanic Temple", "text": "The Satanic Temple\n\nThe Satanic Temple is a nontheistic religious and political activist group based in Salem, Massachusetts. The Temple has several chapter groups, the largest of which is in Detroit, Michigan. The group uses Satanic imagery to promote egalitarianism, social justice, and the separation of church and state. Their stated mission is \"to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people\". The group was co-founded by Lucien Greaves, the organization's spokesperson, and Malcolm Jarry. The Satanic Temple has utilized satire, theatrical ploys, humor, and direct legal action in their public campaigns to generate attention and prompt people to reevaluate fears and perceptions, and to highlight religious hypocrisy and encroachment on religious freedom.\n\nThe organization actively participates in public affairs that have manifested in several public political actions and efforts at lobbying, with a focus on the separation of church and state and using satire against Christian privilege that it says interferes with personal religious freedom. It considers marriage a religious sacrament that should be governed under the First Amendment's protection of religious liberty, and which should prevail over state laws. Because the group regards inviolability of the body as a key doctrine, it also views all restrictions on abortion, including mandatory waiting periods, as an infringement on the rights of Satanists to practice their religion. The Satanic Temple does not believe in a supernatural Satan. The Temple uses the literary Satan as a metaphor to promote pragmatic skepticism, rational reciprocity, personal autonomy, and curiosity. Satan is thus used as a symbol representing \"the eternal rebel\" against arbitrary authority and social norms.\n\nIn an interview with \"The New York Times\", co-founder Malcolm Jarry stated that the idea of starting a Satanic faith-based organization was first conceived as one \"that met all the Bush administration's criteria for receiving funds, but was repugnant to them\". The idea was inspired by then–president George W. Bush's formation of White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, for which he thought something should be done to counter it. The Satanic Temple was founded in 2012, and began public demonstrations in 2013.\n\nThe Satanic Temple describes its mission as follows:\nThe Satanic Temple has seven fundamental tenets:\nValerie Tarico of \"Salon\" wrote that the tenets were egalitarian and \"truer to the words of Jesus than most Christians,\" referring to the tenets as expressing the primacy of compassion and empathy and conducive to a path to equanimity. This sentiment was echoed in an article for \"Patheos,\" wherein editor Michael Stone called the tenets \"morality superior to [the] Ten Commandments,\" referring to them as \"a more moral, and more optimistic stance, emphasizing positive, pro-social values.\"\n\nIndividual chapters hold gatherings with rituals and activities designed to highlight and push back against the right-wing religious establishment and archaic traditions and norms. For example, one group in Detroit held a gathering that included dance music, a porn room, \"surprisingly good hors d'oeuvres\", and \"a statue that's either a penis and testicles or a woman gazing into a mirror, depending on your point of view\", and a wine ceremony involving three naked participants. The Satanic Temple has taken part in several public activities that have been the focus of public scrutiny.\n\nThe Grey Faction is a project of The Satanic Temple with the goal of exposing malpractice and pseudoscience associated with Satanic ritual abuse conspiracy theories. The Grey Faction protests medical conferences, initiates legal action, and petitions medical boards. The faction has protested conferences held by the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, which advocates for the discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy. The group has also petitioned for investigation into the killing by Gigi Jordan of her child, which was connected to the discredited practice of facilitated communication.\n\nThe organization first gained media attention in January 2013 after a group of Satanists assembled at the Florida State Capitol to show their approval over a bill Governor Rick Scott signed into law the prior year, Senate Bill 98, which allowed student-led prayer at school assemblies. The group further stated that as the bill did not specify a religion, the prayers could be led by a student from any religion—including Satanism. The TST members announced they \"were coming out to say how happy we were because now our Satanic children could pray to Satan in school.\"\n\nOne of the projects launched by The Satanic Temple was an attempt to raise enough money to \"adopt-a-highway\" in New York City. The adopt-a-highway program would have involved the group to maintain and beautify part of the public highway for up to two years. Their goal was to raise awareness about religious diversity. The group stated that “The campaign will do more than keep our highways clean. It will help send a clear message to the world reaffirming American Religious Plurality”. The group raised just over $2,000 between June 10 and August 15, 2013; short of their goal of $15,000. If their goal had been reached, the New York Department of Transportation would have approved the plan, and the funds would have been put toward the campaign. In the event that the department did not approve the project, the funds were to support contesting that decision. The organization offered different incentive levels for donations, ranging from ten dollars, for which the donor would receive a button, to ten thousand dollars, for which the donor would receive a full “Membership Package,” including the ability to choose the location of and to participate in the next Pink Mass that The Satanic Temple performed.\n\nIn July 2013, The Satanic Temple held a \"Pink Mass\" over the grave of Catherine Johnston, the mother of Westboro Baptist Church founder Fred Phelps. The mass was held after the Westboro Baptist Church announced their intention to picket the funerals of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. Queerty.com suggested they had based the idea of the mass on similar activities held by factions of the Latter Day Saint movement, where they would perform proxy baptisms. The Pink Mass was officiated by Greaves and consisted of two gay men kissing over Johnston's grave while Greaves placed his genitals on the tombstone and chanted an incantation intended to change the deceased's sexual orientation. A misdemeanor charge was issued against Greaves and he was told that if he returned to Lauderdale County, Mississippi (where Johnston's grave is located), he would be arrested. Shortly before Phelps's death on March 19, 2014, The Satanic Temple expressed interest in holding a similar ceremony for the church founder.\n\nIn May 2014, a black mass was scheduled to be held by The Satanic Temple at the Harvard University campus, sponsored by the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club, but had to be relocated off campus due to significant opposition by Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston and school administrators.\n\nThe Protect Children Project is an initiative launched by The Satanic Temple in the spring of 2014. The project's aims are stated to offer \"First Amendment protection to support children who may be at risk for being subjected to mental or physical abuse in school by teachers and administrators through the use of solitary confinement, restraints, and corporal punishment.\" The Protect Children Project's website asked participants to print out pre-written letters to send to their respective school boards on a day designated as \"Protect Children Day\" as a form of protest. In March 2017, The Satanic Temple launched an anti-spanking campaign against corporal punishment in schools, as part of the Protect Children Project. They unveiled billboards in Texas which read \"Never be hit in school again. Exercise your religious rights.\"\n\nOn August 22, 2015 the Detroit chapter of The Satanic Temple held a counter-protest outside of a Ferndale Planned Parenthood location in response to anti-abortionist groups that were planning to protest Planned Parenthood on that same date. As part of the protest the Temple held a guerrilla theatre performance that included two men dressed as clergy pouring milk on kneeling actresses. This was not the first protest of this type that the Temple had held in support of the organization, as they had previously held a 2013 protest where they brought children to the Texas State Capitol who chanted \"Fuck You\" and \"Hail Satan\", while holding signs reading \"Stay Out Of My Mommy's Vagina\".\n\nOn April 23, 2016, members of the Detroit chapter of the Temple counter protested the Citizens for a Pro-Life Society's protest of Planned Parenthood. Temple members dressed in bondage fetish clothing, wearing baby masks and diapers while engaging in flagellation. The Temple said that the reason for the protest was to \"expose the anti-choice protest as an act of fetal idolatry, highlighting the fetishization and abstraction of the 'baby.'\"\n\nIn November 2015 the Temple received media attention for offering to take in Muslims or refugees that were afraid of experiencing backlash over the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nThe Temple's Los Angeles Chapter has also protested the canonization of Junípero Serra by Pope Francis and in October 2015 they held a ceremony where they \"demonized\" the Christian missionary, stating that Serra helped enslave thousands of Native Americans and that he \"also led The Spanish Inquisition in his territories, trying residents of the Missions for the crimes of sorcery, witchcraft and devil worship.\"\n\nOn June 6, 2016, the Temple performed a Pentagram Ritual around the California city of Lancaster in Los Angeles County, to support California State Senate candidate Steve Hill, who hoped to be the first Satanic Temple member elected to public office. Hill received 13% of the vote, more than one Republican candidate.\n\nAfter School Satan is an after school program sponsored by The Satanic Temple. It was created in July 2016 as an alternative to the Christian-based after school group called the Good News Club.\n\nOn January 14, 2017, a week before the Trump presidential inauguration, the Temple hosted what it billed as the largest Satanic gathering in history, hoping to double the attendance of the 2015 gathering in Detroit for the Baphomet unveiling. Film crews from VICE and NatGeo were on hand to document the event. The mass included three parts: Invocation Ritual, Destruction Ritual and a Bloodletting Ritual. Local Los Angeles media was also on hand to cover the event, calling the event \"a bloody good time\".\n\nMembership in The Satanic Temple is free and open to anyone and can be obtained by signing up on the official website. Membership cards can be purchased for $25. Additionally, members can apply to join local chapters, though according to Draco Ignis and Hofman A Turing, members of the NYC chapter, the requirements for each chapter may differ. \"If there's a local chapter where you are, to join you do have to be accepted, but there's no initiation or anything. You don't even have to be a Satanist, you can just be a strong ally who believes in the political and secular actions without being super stoked about all the aesthetic aspects.\" Membership is subject to renewal, revocation, or termination \"for a member's failure to conduct him or herself in a manner consistent with the spirit of The Satanic Temple and its tenets.\"\n\nThe Temple has chapters across the United States, with the largest group in Detroit, Michigan. \n\nIn September 2014, Jex Blackmore launched a chapter of The Satanic Temple in Detroit, Michigan. She held a membership and information booth at the community festival Dally in the Alley, where she reported that she received good support and turnout. On December 21 of that same year the chapter constructed a holiday display for \"Snaketivity\" on the lawn of the Michigan State Capitol as a way to counteract and protest a nativity scene that was placed on the state grounds only days earlier. The holiday display depicted a snake, a pentagram, a book, and a cross with the words \"Knowledge is the Greatest Gift of All\" prominently displayed. In 2015 the chapter commented that they were interested in re-erecting the Snaketivity display or a similar live display after learning that United States Senator Ted Cruz planned to host a live nativity scene at the Capitol on December 19.\n\nBlackmore has stated that the chapter has a core group of about 15 to 20 followers, depending on the project, and that \"there's another group, depending on the activity or what we're doing, that's about one tier larger -- probably about 50 or more.\" The chapter does not have a physical office or building and operates primarily out of rented or borrowed spaces along with other locations.\n\nIn a statement posted to her Twitter account in February 2018, Blackmore stated that she has stepped down from her role as spokesperson and chapter head to focus on her personal artistic endeavors. In August 2018, Blackmore amended her statement with an editorial on Medium claiming her resignation was not voluntary and made claims of long term gender, sexual, and racial diversity problems within the organization as well as claims of being harassed personally. Following Blackmore's statement, other members resigned citing similar complaints including the entire Los Angeles, California chapter which rebranded as \"The Satanic Collective\" and all of the European chapters which rebranded as \"Satanic Temple International\".\n\nLucien Greaves has described the Temple as being a progressive and updated version of LaVey's Satanism. The Temple sees itself as separate and distinct from LaVeyan Satanists, and feels that its principles and tenets represent \"a natural evolution in Satanic thought\". Greaves has said that the elements of Social Darwinism and Nietzscheanism within LaVeyan Satanism is incongruent with game theory, reciprocal altruism, and cognitive science. He has also criticized the Church of Satan for its lack of political lobbying and what he sees as their exclusivity, referring to them as autocratic and hierarchical, and saying that the Church fetishizes authoritarianism. Conversely, the Church of Satan has made statements claiming that The Satanic Temple are only \"masquerading as Satanists and do not represent Satanism.\n\nThe Satanic Temple has received criticism for their actions, most notably from religious organizations and figures. Many critics state that they believe that the Temple is not a serious organization and is instead meant to be a prank, form of satire, or elaborate trolling attempt. Greaves and Blackmore have both dismissed these claims, as Greaves stated in a 2013 interview with \"Vice\" that the Temple could be both satanic and satirical. Blackmore has also stated that people believe that they are only \"trying to cause trouble for no reason except to just be shocking\", but the Temple says they are \"adding to the dialogue that's already there and asking for rights -- just like anyone else.\"\n\nBoth Greaves and Blackmore have stated that they have received death threats in response to their activities with The Satanic Temple.\n\n"}

Its stated goal is \"to promote and foster the development of a Ben Torah, a young [person] capable of actively and wholesomely interacting with his fellow Jews and citizens\".\n\nShaare Torah primarily caters to the Sephardic Jewish community of Brooklyn, but also has students from around the Tri-State area.\n\nGraduates are encouraged to participate in year-long programs at yeshivot and seminaries in Israel. Afterwards, some continue their studies in similar institutions, while others enroll in university, or go straight into the workforce. Some of the most popular universities among Shaare alumni, such as Brooklyn College and Baruch College, grant up to one year's worth of credit to students who study in Israel, allowing them to apply these credits to their undergraduate degree.\n\nIn 2009, 34 students at the girl's elementary school were injured when a sidewalk grate collapsed during a graduation ceremony. The girl's elementary school has about 300 students. That same year, the school closed due to the swine flu epidemic.\n\nIn 2015, the school hosted a political rally promoting tax credits for parents of children in private schools. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke at the event, as did City Council Member David G. Greenfield.\n\nThe boy's high school has athletic teams competing in softball, basketball, and flag football.
