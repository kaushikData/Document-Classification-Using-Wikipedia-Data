His son and successor, Amenhotep II continued the decoration program for this structure. Amenhotep II's successor, Thutmose IV decided to place a roof over its forecourt and transform it into a pillared or hypostyle hall. During the Amarna period, Akhenaten had the name Amun destroyed throughout the temple but this was later restored by Seti I of Egypt's 19th dynasty. Various 19th dynasty kings especially Seti I and Ramesses II also \"carried out minor restorations and added to the temple's decoration.\" The stelas of the Viceroys of Kush Setau, Heqanakht and Messuy and that of Chancellor Bay describe their building activities under Ramesses II, Merneptah and Siptah respectively.\n\nThe original building plan for the structure featured a pylon, forecourt and a portico which led to a sanctuary. However, when Thutmose IV roofed the open forecourt, the pillars and walls \"were decorated with offering scenes, with those involving Thutmosis IV on the left\" and Thutmose III and Amenhotep II on the right. Although the temple has a dull and crumbling exterior, its interior features enjoy some of the most finely cut reliefs with bright and vibrant colours. \n\nThe finest painted reliefs are in the innermost section of the temple where Thutmose III and Amenhotep II are shown being embraced or making offerings to various Egyptian gods. The left hand side of the vestibule shows Amenhotep II being crowned by Horus and Thoth and running with an oar and a \"hap\" (or navigational instrument). The cult room at the side of the sanctuary contains some interesting foundation and consecration scenes for the temple which depict \"the ritual of the 'stretching of the cord', the ceremonial making and laying of bricks, and the offering of the temple to its gods.\"\n\nThere are two important historical inscriptions from Amada temple. The earliest, dated to Year 3 of Amenhotep II, \"is on a round topped stelae at the rear (eastern) wall of the sanctuary.\" Its text describes this pharaoh's ruthless military campaign in Asia: \n\nAmenhotep II goes on to describe how he hanged six of the dead chiefs \"on the walls of Thebes\" while the seventh was hung on the walls of Napata (a Nubian frontier city near the Fourth Cataract). This was done as a clear warning to the subject Nubians of the dangerous consequences of rebellion during Amenhotep's reign. The second historical text, \"on a stela engraved on the left (northern) thickness of the entrance doorway\" mentions the defeat of an invasion from Libya in Year 4 of Merneptah.\n\nThe temple was described by early travellers and first published by Henri Gauthier in 1913. \n\nBetween 1964 and 1975, the temple was moved from its original location to a new site \"some 65 m higher and 2.5 km away from its original site\". Chopping it into blocks, as was being done with the other temples, was not an option; the paintings would not have survived. Seeing that all seemed resigned to see the temple flooded by the silty waters of Lake Nasser, Christiane Desroches Noblecourt announced that France would save it. She asked two architects to propose a method for moving the temple in one piece. Their idea was to put the temple on rails and transport it hydraulically to a site a few kilometers away that was more than 60 meters higher.\n\nThe rock-cut Temple of Derr was also moved to the new site of Amada.\n"}

{"id": "765765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=765765", "title": "Anat", "text": "Anat\n\nAnat (, ), classically Anath (; \"ʿĂnāth\"; \"ʿAnōt\"; \"ʿnt\"; \"Anath\"; Egyptian \"Antit\", \"Anit\", \"Anti\", or \"Anant\") is a major northwest Semitic goddess.\n\nIn the Ugaritic \"Baal Cycle\", ‘Anat is a violent war-goddess, a maiden (\"btlt ‘nt\") who is the sister and, according to a much disputed theory, the lover of the great god Ba‘al Hadad. Ba‘al is usually called the son of Dagan and sometimes the son of El, who addresses ‘Anat as \"daughter\". Either relationship is probably figurative.\n\n‘Anat's titles used again and again are \"virgin ‘Anat\" and \"sister-in-law of the peoples\" (or \"progenitress of the peoples\" or \"sister-in-law, widow of the Li’mites\").\n\nIn a fragmentary passage from Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), Syria ‘Anat appears as a fierce, wild and furious warrior in a battle, wading knee-deep in blood, striking off heads, cutting off hands, binding the heads to her torso and the hands in her sash, driving out the old men and townsfolk with her arrows, her heart filled with joy. \"Her character in this passage anticipates her subsequent warlike role against the enemies of Baal\".\n\n’Anat boasts that she has put an end to Yam the darling of El, to the seven-headed serpent, to Arsh the darling of the gods, to Atik 'Quarrelsome' the calf of El, to Ishat 'Fire' the bitch of the gods, and to Zabib 'flame?' the daughter of El. Later, when Ba‘al is believed to be dead, she seeks after Ba‘al \"like a cow for its calf\" and finds his body (or supposed body) and buries it with great sacrifices and weeping. ‘Anat then finds Mot, Ba‘al Hadad's supposed slayer and she seizes Mot, splits him with a sword, winnows him with a sieve, burns him with fire, grinds him with millstones and scatters the remnants to the birds.\n\nText \"CTA\" 10 tells how ‘Anat seeks after Ba‘al who is out hunting, finds him, and is told she will bear a steer to him. Following the birth she brings the new calf to Ba‘al on Mount Zephon. Nowhere in these texts is ‘Anat explicitly Ba‘al Hadad's consort. To judge from later traditions ‘Athtart (who also appears in these texts) is more likely to be Ba‘al Hadad's consort. Complicating matters is that northwest Semitic culture permitted more than one wife and nonmonogamy is normal for deities in many pantheons.\n\nIn the North Canaanite story of \"Aqhat\", the protagonist Aqhat son of the judge Danel (Dn'il) is given a wonderful bow and arrows which was created for ‘Anat by the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis but which was given to Danel for his infant son as a gift. When Aqhat grew to be a young man, the goddess ‘Anat tried to buy the bow from Aqhat, offering even immortality, but Aqhat refused all offers, calling her a liar because old age and death are the lot of all men. He then added to this insult by asking 'what would a woman do with a bow?'\n\nLike Inanna in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", ‘Anat complained to El and threatened El himself if he did not allow her to take vengeance on Aqhat. El conceded. ‘Anat launched her attendant Yatpan in hawk form against Aqhat to knock the breath out of him and to steal the bow back. Her plan succeeds, but Aqhat is killed instead of merely beaten and robbed. In her rage against Yatpan, (text is missing here) Yatpan runs away and the bow and arrows fall into the sea. All is lost. ‘Anat mourned for Aqhat and for the curse that this act would bring upon the land and for the loss of the bow. The focus of the story then turns to Paghat, the wise younger sister of Aqhat. She sets off to avenge her brother's death and to restore the land which has been devastated by drought as a direct result of the murder. The story is incomplete. It breaks at an extremely dramatic moment when Paghat discovers that the mercenary whom she has hired to help her avenge the death is, in fact, Yatpan, her brother's murderer. The parallels between the story of ‘Anat and her revenge on Mot for the killing of her brother are obvious. In the end, the seasonal myth is played out on the human level.\n\nGibson (1978) thinks Rahmay ('The Merciful'), co-wife of El with Athirat, is also the goddess ‘Anat, but he fails to take into account the primary source documents. Use of dual names of deities in Ugaritic poetry are an essential part of the verse form, and that two names for the same deity are traditionally mentioned in parallel lines. In the same way, Athirat is called Elath (meaning \"The Goddess\") in paired couplets. The poetic structure can also be seen in early Hebrew verse forms.\n\nAnat first appears in Egypt in the 16th dynasty (the Hyksos period) along with other northwest Semitic deities. She was especially worshiped in her aspect of a war goddess, often paired with the goddess `Ashtart. In the \"Contest Between Horus and Set\", these two goddesses appear as daughters of Re and are given as allies to the god Set, who had been identified with the Semitic god Hadad.\n\nDuring the Hyksos period Anat had temples in the Hyksos capital of Avaris and in Beth-Shan (Israel) as well as being worshipped in Memphis. On inscriptions from Memphis of 15th to 12th centuries , Anat is called \"Bin-Ptah\", Daughter of Ptah. She is associated with Reshpu (\"Canaanite\": Resheph) in some texts and sometimes identified with the native Egyptian goddess Neith. She is sometimes called \"Queen of Heaven\". Her iconography varies. She is usually shown carrying one or more weapons.\n\nThe name of Anat-her, a shadowy Egyptian ruler of this time, is derived from \"Anat\".\n\nIn the New Kingdom Ramesses II made ‘Anat his personal guardian in battle and enlarged Anat's temple in Pi-Ramesses. Ramesses named his daughter (whom he later married) Bint-Anat 'Daughter of Anat'. His dog appears in a carving in Beit el Wali temple with the name \"Anat-in-vigor\" and one of his horses was named \"‘Ana-herte\" 'Anat-is-satisfied'.\n\nIn Akkadian, the form one would expect \"Anat\" to take would be \"Antu\", earlier \"Antum\". This would also be the normal feminine form that would be taken by \"Anu\", the Akkadian form of An 'Sky', the Sumerian god of heaven. Antu appears in Akkadian texts mostly as a rather colorless consort of Anu, the mother of Ishtar in the Gilgamesh story, but is also identified with the northwest Semitic goddess ‘Anat of essentially the same name. It is unknown whether this is an equation of two originally separate goddesses whose names happened to fall together or whether Anat's cult spread to Mesopotamia, where she came to be worshipped as Anu's spouse because the Mesopotamian form of her name suggested she was a counterpart to Anu.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the parallelism between the names of the Sumerian goddess, Inanna, and her West Semitic counterpart, Ishtar, continued in Canaanite tradition as Anath and Astarte, particularly in the poetry of Ugarit. The two goddesses were invariably linked in Ugaritic scripture and are also known to have formed a triad (known from sculpture) with a third goddess who was given the name/title of Qadesh (meaning \"the holy one\").\nThe goddess name, ‘Anat is preserved in the city names Beth-Anath and Anathoth. Anathoth seems to be a plural form of the name, perhaps a shortening of \"bêt ‘nātôt\" 'House of the ‘Anats', either a reference to many shrines of the goddess or a plural of intensification.\n\nThe ancient hero Shamgar, son of ‘Anat, is mentioned in Judges 3.31 and 5:6, which raises the idea that this judge or hero may have been understood as a demi-god, a mortal son of the goddess. But John Day (2000) notes that a number of Canaanites known from non-Biblical sources bore that title and theorizes that it was a military designation indicating a warrior under ‘Anat's protection. Asenath, \"holy to Anath\", was the wife of the Hebrew patriarch Joseph.\n\nIn Elephantine (modern Aswan) in Egypt, the 5th century BCE Elephantine papyri make mention of a goddess called Anat-Yahu (Anat-Yahweh) worshiped in the temple to Yahweh originally built by Jewish refugees from the Babylonian conquest of Judah. These suggest that \"even in exile and beyond the worship of a female deity endured.\" The texts were written by a group of Jews living at Elephantine near the Nubian border, whose religion has been described as \"nearly identical to Iron Age II Judahite religion\". The papyri describe the Jews as worshiping Anat-Yahu (or AnatYahu). Anat-Yahu is described as either the wife or paredra (sacred consort) of Yahweh or as a hypostatized aspect of Yahweh.\n\nIn a Cyprian inscription (\"KAI.\" 42) the Greek goddess Athêna Sôteira Nikê is equated with ‘Anat (who is described in the inscription as the strength of life : \"l‘uzza hayim\").\n\nAnat is also presumably the goddess whom Sanchuniathon calls Athene, a daughter of El, mother unnamed, who with Hermes (that is Thoth) counselled El on the making of a sickle and a spear of iron, presumably to use against his father Uranus. However, in the Baal cycle, that rôle is assigned to Asherah / ‘Elat and ‘Anat is there called the \"Virgin.\"\n\nThe goddess ‘Atah worshipped at Palmyra may possibly be in origin identical with ‘Anat. ‘Atah was combined with ‘Ashtart under the name \"Atar\" into the goddess ‘Atar‘atah known to the Hellenes as Atargatis. If this origin for ‘Atah is correct, then Atargatis is effectively a combining of ‘Ashtart and ‘Anat.\n\nIt has also been proposed that (Indo-)Iranian Anahita meaning 'immaculate' in Avestan (\"a\" 'not' + \"ahit\" 'unclean') is a variant of \"‘Anat\". It is however unlikely given that the Indo-Iranian roots of the term are related to the Semitic ones and although—through conflation—Aredvi Sura Anahita (so the full name) inherited much from Ishtar-Inanna, the two are considered historically distinct.\n\nIn the Book of Zohar, ‘Anat is numbered among the holiest of angelic powers under the name of Anathiel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1692649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1692649", "title": "Archpriest", "text": "Archpriest\n\nAn archpriest is an ecclesiastical title for certain priests with supervisory duties over a number of parishes. The term is most often used in Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholic Churches and may be somewhat analogous to a monsignor in the Latin Church, but in the Eastern Churches an archpriest wears an additional vestment and, typically, a pectoral cross, and one becomes an archpriest via a liturgical ceremony.\n\nThe term may be used in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church instead of dean or \"vicar forane\".\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, during the persecution of Catholics in England, an archpriest appointed from Rome had authority over all of the church's secular clergy in the country. In the present-day Church of England, a rural or area dean resembles an archpriest. In the Catholic Latin Rite traditionally a priest's first Mass has an archpriest assisting the newly ordained priest, functioning as the deacon otherwise does, but this is only for that event.\n\nIn ancient times, the archdeacon was the head of the diaconate of a diocese, as is still the case in the Eastern Orthodox Church, while the archpriest was first the chief of the presbyterium of the diocese. His duties included deputising for the Bishop in spiritual matters when necessary.\n\nIn the western church, by the Middle Ages, the title had evolved and was that of the priest of the principal parish among several local parishes. This priest had general charge of worship in this archpresbyterate, and the parishioners of the smaller parishes had to attend Sunday Mass and hold baptisms at the principal parish while the subordinate parishes instead held daily mass and homilies.\n\nExceptionally, the Pope could elevate one to the rank of archipresbyterate nullius, detached from any prelature, yet under a non-prelate, as happened in 1471 with the future abbacy (1583) and (since 1828) bishopric of Guastalla.\n\nBy the time of the Council of Trent the office of archpriest was replaced by the office of vicar forane, also known in English as \"dean\". The first recorded use of this meaning of the title comes from St Charles Borromeo's reforms in his own diocese. Unlike vicars general and vicars episcopal, vicars forane are not prelates, which means they do not possess ordinary power. Their role is entirely supervisory, and they perform visitations for the bishop and report to the bishop or vicar general any problems in their vicariate.\n\nFrom late Elizabethan England until 1623, an Archpriest was appointed from Rome to oversee the Roman Catholic Church's mission in England, with authority over all secular clergy in the country.\n\nThe title of archpriest has survived in Rome, in Malta and elsewhere, where it is now held by the rectors of the major basilicas. However, the title is entirely honorary, reflecting the fact that these churches held archpriestly status in the past.\n\nThere are four archpriests, for each of the four papal major basilicas in Rome, all of whom presently are bishops :\n\nMany churches (thousands) in the world, other than basilicas, have the right to be governed by an archpriest, according to the specific historical tradition. Hence, the title is mostly honorary. Today, the archpriest has no control over the subordinate clergy. The use of \"archpriest\" in Roman Catholicism should not be confused with \"protopriest\", the senior Cardinal-Priest in the College of Cardinals.\n\nIn the Church of England there is at least one archpriest, the Archpriest of Haccombe. The appointment was first made in AD 1315 and has been held ever since. It was confirmed by an Order in Council on 1 April 1913 under King George V. The title reflects the fact that the archpriest has the right to sit beside the bishop and acknowledges no authority below that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, although today, it is more appropriate to go through the usual channels of the church's hierarchy. Haccombe is a village in Devon, near Newton Abbot where the parish is combined with that of Stoke-in-Teignhead with Combe-in-Teignhead. There is an hereditary patron for the Church of St Blaise, Haccombe. The modern office most closely resembling that of archpriest is the role of rural dean (rural dioceses) or area dean (urban dioceses). Like the archpriest of old, these officers have supervisory duties, but not ordinary jurisdiction, and are entitled to carry out visitations of subordinate parishes when so commissioned. With this in mind, although the Archpriest of Haccombe holds a unique role in the Church of England, it must be considered analogous with certain incumbencies which bear the title \"Dean\" regardless of whether or not their incumbent is the actual rural or area dean. One example of this historical oddity is the office of Dean of Bocking in Essex.\n\nArchpriest, also protopope (, \"protopapas\") or protopresbyter (, \"protopresbyteros\"), is a clerical rank, a title of honor given to non-monastic priests and is conferred by a bishop with the laying on of hands and prayer. An archpriest typically wears an epigonation, a vestment originally worn only by bishops; however, details vary locally, and in some places being given the epigonation is an honor that typically precedes being made an archpriest and in other places, it is an honor that is given to only some archpriests. An archpriest also wears a pectoral cross both as part of his street clothes and when vested.\nThe ceremony for making an archpriest is analogous to other clerical promotions bestowed with cheirothesia: at the little entrance of the divine liturgy, the candidate is conducted to the ambo in the middle of the church where the bishop is at the time, and the bishop blesses him and says a prayer addressed to Christ asking to \"... endue our brother (name) with Thy Grace, and adorn him with virtue to stand at the head of the Presbyters of Thy people, and make him to be a good example to them that are with him ...\"\n\nIn the Russian tradition, protopresbyter is a higher rank than archpriest, as explained in a translation by the Orthodox Church in America:\n\nThe Unitarian Church of Transylvania is divided into five Archpriestships as a form of territorial governance, virtual dioceses.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Politically, the association was close to the national conservative and monarchist German National People's Party which, however, refused affiliation with the association.\n\nThe goal of the Association was the total assimilation of Jews into the German Volksgemeinschaft, self eradication of Jewish identity, and the expulsion from Germany of the Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Naumann was especially opposed to Zionists and Eastern European Jews, the former he considered a threat to Jewish integration and to be carriers of a \"racist\" ideology serving British imperial purposes, while he saw the latter as racially and spiritually inferior.\n\nThe association's official organ was the monthly \"Der nationaldeutsche Jude\" edited by Max Naumann. The magazine had a circulation of 6000 in 1927.\n\nAmong the activities of this group was the fight against the Jewish boycott of German goods. They also issued a manifesto that stated that the Jews were being fairly treated.\n\nIn 1934 the group made the following statement:\n\"We have always held the well-being of the German people and the fatherland, to which we feel inextricably linked, above our own well-being. Thus we greeted the results of January, 1933, even though it has brought hardship for us personally.\"\n\nA possible reason why some German Jews supported Hitler may have been that they thought that his antisemitism only was for the purpose of \"stirring up the masses\".\n\nThe seemingly ironic fact that a Jewish association advocated loyalty to the Nazi programme gave rise to a contemporary joke about Naumann and his followers ending their meeting by giving the Nazi salute and shouting \"Down With Us!\".\n\nDespite their extreme patriotism, the German government did not accept their goal of assimilation. The Association of German National Jews was declared illegal and dissolved on 18 November 1935. Max Naumann, was arrested by the Gestapo the same day and imprisoned at the Columbia concentration camp. He was released after a few weeks, and died of cancer in May 1939.\n\nA similar contemporary Jewish group in Germany included the German Vanguard (\"Der deutsche Vortrupp\"), the German-Jewish followers of Hitler led by Hans-Joachim Schoeps, also referred to as \"Nazi Jews\". Schoeps went into exile in Falun/Sweden in 1938, just before the persecutions began in earnest. His two sons were born there. Schoeps returned to Germany after the war and was made professor of religious history at the university of Erlangen in northern Bavaria, ten miles north of Nuremberg. He remained a monarchist and wanted to re-introduce monarchy in post-war Germany. His involvement in the \"Vortrupp\" and his personal engagement for the success of the Nazi movement did not become known at Erlangen while he was a professor there until 1970. He was firmly opposed to the liberal-socialist student movement after , and published a book in 1972 in which he claimed that Germany was threatened by anarchy. Schoeps was a member of the Deutschland-Stiftung, in which former Nazis were active.\n\nThe policy of the German government was to promote Jewish emigration from Germany, and as a consequence it promoted and encouraged the activities of Zionist organisations while at the same time repressing anti-Zionist organisations such as the German National Jews, especially as they were among those who advocated Jewish assimilation in Germany. The Zionists were commended in the SS newspaper by Heydrich for what he interpreted as their racialist position, and Jewish assimilationists were chastised for denying their race.\n\n"}
{"id": "36562012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36562012", "title": "Bathouism", "text": "Bathouism\n\nBathouism (बाथौ) is the traditional religion of the Bodo people or Kachari people. The name \"Bathou\" in Bodo means \"five principles\". The five principles are: \"bar\" (air), \"orr\" (fire), \"ha\" (earth), \"dwi\" (water) and \"okhrang\" (sky). The chief deity, called \"Bathoubwrai\" (\"bwarai\": \"the Elder\")—omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent—is said to have created the five principles. Though there are other minor gods and goddesses, Bathoubwrai is considered the Supreme God. Bathoubwrai is unseen. The second most important deity is \"Mainao\", the consort of Bathoubwrai, who is considered as the \"protector of the rice fields\".\n\nThe \"sijou\" plant, a woody species of (E. neriifolia ) is considered the living embodiment of Bathoubwrai. Families that follow Bathouism plant a sijou shrub at the northeast corner of their courtyard, in an altar called \"sijousali\". Bodo communities that follow Bathouism generally plant a sijou shrub at a community land, fenced with eighteen pairs of bamboo strips with five fastenings. Each pair symbolizes a pair of minor god-goddess. The five fastenings signify, from bottom: birth, pain, death, marriage and peace/pleasure. The bottom three fastenings, called \"bando\", are those that one cannot escape in life; whereas the top two one could.\n\n differentiates between household gods and community gods. Of the household gods Bathoubwrai, Mainao, Song Bwrai/Burai and Bura Bah Raja are considered prominent. The practice of representing Bathoubwrai by the sijou tree was more common in among Boro kachari and more in Darrang. Song Raja is usually represented inside the house in an altar called \"dham\", a deity who obtains devotion from women, and receives offerings during women's menses; but these offerings are eventually brought out and laid at the sijou tree representing Bathou.\n\nThe eighteen pairs of gods-goddesses are: 1 Mwnsinsin bwrai-Mwnsinsin burwi, 2 Si Bwrai-Si Burwi, 3 Aham Bwrai-Aham Burwi, 4 Khuria Bwrai-Khuria Burwi, 5 Eheo Bwrai-Eheo Burwi 6 Mainao Bwrai-Mainao-Burwi, 7 Bwlli Bwrai-Bwlli Burwi, 8 Deva Bwrai-Devi Burwi, 9 Gongar Bwrai-Gongar Burwi, 10 Joumwn Bwrai-Joumwn Burwi, 11 Song Raja-Song Rani, 12 Hasung Bwrai-Hasung Burwi, 13 Rajong Bwrai-Rajong burwi, 14 Agrang Bwrai-Agrang Burwi, 15 Hazw Bwrai-Hazw Burwi, 16. Emao Bwrai-Emao Burwi 17. Mohela Bwrai-Mohela Burwi and 18. Hafao Bwrai-Hafao Burwi.\n\nTraditional Bathouism does not have any written scripture or religious book, nor temples. The worship is performed at the sijousali, and constituted offering animals and fowls for sacrifice and rice beer. Notable religious festivals were Kherai, Garja and others. These ceremonies are performed by priests called Douri (male priest) and Doudini (female priest). This religion was not organized.\n\n\"All Bathou Religious Union\", an organization, was constituted in 1992; and it has begun reviving and reforming the traditional religion. The traditional role of the \"Douri\" and \"Doudini\" are replaced by the \"Gwthari Asari\" appointed by the organization, and a band of singers who sing in a practice called \"Bathou Aroj\". The construction of temples, resembling churches or mosques called \"Thansali\", have come into being. Bathou aroj is performed on Tuesdays in Thansalis. Sacrifices of animals and fowls, and offering of rice beer as modes of worship has been replaced by offering of flowers, fruits and the burning of incense. The partaking of \"prasad\" has also become popular\n"}

While he was sitting on a log, a \"brute\" came up to him with a rifle in his hands and said, \"You give up Mormonism right now, or I'll shoot you.\" Benjamin decisively refused, upon which the ruffian took deliberate aim at him and pulled the trigger. The gun failed to discharge. Cursing fearfully, the man declared that he had \"used the gun 20 years and it had never before missed fire.\" Examining the lock, he reprimed the weapon and again aimed and pulled the trigger—without effect.\nFollowing the same procedure he tried a third time, but the result was the same. A bystander told him to \"fix up his gun a little\" and then \"you can kill the cuss all right.\" So for a fourth and final time the would-be murderer prepared, even putting in a fresh load. However, Benjamin declared, \"This time the gun bursted and killed the wretch upon the spot.\" One of the Missourians was heard to say, \"You'd better not try to kill that man.\" \n\nHe moved to Springfield, Illinois in 1839, Ramus (later Webster) in 1842, Nauvoo in 1845, and Bonaparte, Iowa Territory in 1846. In 1848 he arrived in the Salt Lake Valley with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and served in the Utah territorial legislature from 1855 to 1867. Johnson left Utah for the Arizona Territory in 1882, settling in Tempe before going to Colonia Diaz, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1890 and returning to Arizona in 1892. He died at Mesa.\n\nJohnson's sister married Joseph Smith as a plural marriage. Johnson records the event where Joseph Smith approached Johnson about the arrangement:\n\nJohnson himself was a noted polygamist, and had 7 wives.\n\nJohnson was the brother of hymnwriter Joel H.

{"id": "36416295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36416295", "title": "Christianity in Taiwan", "text": "Christianity in Taiwan\n\nThe Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan, has a Christian minority, making up about 4.5% of its population. Roughly half of Taiwan's Christians are Catholic, and half Protestant. Despite its minority status, Christianity has had a disproportionate influence on the island's culture and development, as illustrated by such exemplary figures as George Leslie Mackay (Presbyterian) and Nitobe Inazō (Methodist, later Quaker).\n\nSeveral Presidents have been at least nominal Christians, including the country's founder Sun Yat-sen (Congregationalist), Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Ching-kuo (both are Methodists) as well as Lee Teng-hui (Presbyterian). Former president, Ma Ying-jeou, apparently received a Catholic baptism in his early teens, but does not identify with the religion. At the same time, the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan has been a key supporter of human rights and the Democratic Progressive Party, a stance opposed to many of the politicians listed above.\n\nEarly Protestantism was driven out of Taiwan by the Ming Dynasty loyalist Koxinga in 1661, leaving no permanent religious influence. The 1860s saw the return of the Spanish Dominicans (via the Philippines), as well as the arrival of Presbyterian missionaries from England and Canada. One particular missionary, George Leslie Mackay, founded the island's first university and hospital.\n\nDuring the Japanese era (1895-1945), no new missions were allowed, with the result that Catholicism and Presbyterianism remain the largest Christian denominations. The development of Christianity took a whole new turn after 1949, when Christians of various denominations followed the Chinese Nationalist army in its retreat to Taiwan. During the dictatorships of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan became outspoken in its defense of democracy, human rights, and a Taiwanese identity. The number of denominations, and independent churches (often Evangelical or Charismatic), skyrocketed with the political liberalization and economic success of the 1980s.\n\nToday, ROC government statistics estimate that Christians comprise some 4.5 percent of Taiwan's population, a figure which is about evenly divided between Protestants and Catholics. Nearly all of Taiwan's aborigines profess Christianity (some 70 percent Presbyterianism, the remainder mostly Catholicism).\n\nTaiwan has been part of a missionary jurisdiction since 1514, when it was included in the Diocese of Funchal (Portugal). In 1576, the first Chinese diocese was established in Macau, covering most of mainland China as well as Taiwan. The diocese was divided several times from the 16th century through the 19th; in chronological order, Taiwan belonged to the dioceses of Nanking (1660), Fukien (1696) and Amoy (1883). In 1913, the Apostolic Vicariate of the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) was established, being detached from the Diocese of Amoy. It was renamed for Kaohsiung in 1949.\n\nBefore the end of World War II, the Catholic Church had a very minor presence in Taiwan, based mainly in the south of the island and centered on Spanish Dominican priests who arrived from the Philippines in the 1860s. The following years saw a mass migration of religious communities from mainland China as Communist persecution began to take effect. As a result, the Catholic Church has many Mandarin-speaking postwar mainland immigrants and is under-represented among the native Taiwanese.\n\nSince 1952, the Papal Internuncio to China has been stationed in Taiwan, and now constitutes one of the last significant formal diplomatic ties of the ROC.\n\nThe first Presbyterian mission started in 1865, with the arrival of James Laidlaw Maxwell of the Presbyterian Church of England in Taiwan-fu (Tainan). His colleague George Leslie Mackay of the Presbyterian Church in Canada arrived in 1871, settling in Danshui. Mackay traveled widely throughout the island, and founded numerous churches. He also founded Tamsui Oxford College (now Aletheia University) in 1882, and Mackay Memorial Hospital (which NB, is named for a different Mackay) in 1880. In 1949, the Presbyterian Church (USA) joined these northern and southern jurisdictions together as the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT). The PCT doubled its membership between 1955 and 1965, perhaps as a result of its outspoken support for democratization, human rights, and Taiwan independence (against the view of the Kuomintang regime that as a notional province of the Republic of China, democratic elections in Taiwan would have to await the military reconquest of the mainland).\n\nA number of denominations (including the Baptist, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Adventists) arrived on the island in the wake of the expulsion of foreign missionaries from China, and the 1949 retreat of Nationalist troops to Taiwan. The same is true of Witness Lee, protégé and co-worker of Watchman Nee, founder of The Local Churches or Church Assembly Hall movement.\n\nThe Chinese Baptist Convention and its predecessors had been planning a Taiwan mission since 1936; its first missionary arrived in 1948. Activity swelled in the 1950s. Baptist churches being congregationally governed, the CBC is not so much a denomination as a cooperative association of independent churches. It supports Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary (f. 1952).\n\nTaiwan Methodists erected a Taipei church in 1953. The national organization gained autonomy in 1972, and installed its first bishop in 1986.\n\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Taiwan (est. 1954) belongs to Province VIII of the U.S. Episcopal Church.\n\nThe Taiwan Lutheran Church began meeting in 1951, and received formal recognition in 1954. One of several Lutheran denominations in Taiwan, it claims 18,000 baptized members.\n\nThe Adventists founded Taiwan Adventist College in 1951, and Taiwan Adventist Hospital in 1955. \nTaiwan Conservative Baptist Association in 1960\nThe Christian and Missionary Alliance arrived in 1963. It now claims a membership of approximately 2300 \n\nThe Fellowship of Mennonite Churches in Taiwan (f. 1962) emerged from medical and relief projects carried out among Taiwan aborigines from 1948 (notably Hualian's Mennonite Christian Hospital, f. 1954). In 2004, it claimed 1658 adherents, concentrated in three major urban areas.\n\nMoon Sun Myung, founder of the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, apparently visited Taiwan in 1965. A missionary was sent in 1967. The church received government recognition in 1971, only to be banned in 1975, then finally permitted again in 1990.\n\nThe history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Taiwan can be divided into three distinct phases. The first corresponds to the period of Japanese rule (1895-1945), when the first believers arrived on the island from Japan, and petitioned St. Nicholas of Japan to send them a priest. A Taiwan parish, named for Christ the Savior, was created in 1901.\n\nThe second period begins in 1949, with the arrival of some 5000 Russian emigres fleeing the Chinese Civil War. A House Church of St. John the Baptist was organized, and visited by various Orthodox dignitaries. At its height, this community numbered one or two hundred believers, and grew inactive during the 1980s. Sources differ as to whether these Russian believers had any contact with their Japanese coreligionists from the earlier period.\n\nThe third period begins in 2000, with the arrival of Fr. Jonah (Mourtos) to the island as a missionary priest under the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia (itself under the Ecumenical Patriarch). Fr. Jonah established Taipei's Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, which formally registered with the government in 2003. Its congregation—a mixture of Russians and East Europeans, as well as Chinese and Western converts—numbers about 30 (rising to more than 100 at Christmas and Easter).\n\nIn 2012, the Moscow Patriarchate, apparently in response to petitions from local Russians, \"reactivated\" the 1901 parish, and established (in Taipei) the Church of the Elevation of the Cross, with Fr. Kirill (Shkarbul) as its first priest. OMHKSEA Bishop Nektarios (Tsilis) of Hong Kong responded by objecting to what he sees as an uncanonical attempt to extend the territory of Moscow beyond its canonical jurisdiction, and by excommunicating Fr. Kirill and a parishioner. (The Moscow-affiliated church has not reciprocated.)\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2262129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2262129", "title": "False prophet", "text": "False prophet\n\nIn religion, a false prophet is one who falsely claims the gift of prophecy or divine inspiration, or who uses that gift for evil ends. Often, someone who is considered a \"true prophet\" by some people is simultaneously considered a \"false prophet\" by others, even within the same religion as the \"prophet\" in question. The term is sometimes applied outside religion to describe someone who fervently promotes a theory that the speaker thinks is false.\n\nThroughout the New Testament, there are warnings of both false prophets and false Messiahs, and believers are adjured to be vigilant. The following verses (Matthew ) are from the Sermon on the Mount:\n\nThe New Testament addresses the same point of a false prophet predicting correctly and Jesus predicted the future appearance of false Christs and false prophets, affirming that they can perform great signs and miracles. The following verses are from the Olivet Discourse:\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke, Jesus brought out an ethical application for his disciples using the analogy of false prophets in the Old Testament:\n\nIn the Acts of the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas encountered a false prophet named Elymas Bar-Jesus on the island of Cyprus:\n\nThis particular story likewise best matches the model found in Deuteronomy. The claim here is that Elymas is trying to turn Sergius Paulus from the true faith, just like the false prophet described in the preceding verses. In these verses, we do not see Elymas prophesying as the term is popularly understood, so the model seems to fit this scenario best.\n\nThe Second Epistle of Peter makes a comparison between false teachers and false prophets and how the former will bring in false teachings, just like the false prophets of old:\n\nThe First Epistle of John warns those of the Christian faith to test every spirit because of these false prophets:\n\nOne well-known New Testament false prophet is the false prophet mentioned in the Book of Revelation. The Apocalypse's false prophet is the agent of the Beast, the Antichrist, and he is ultimately cast with the Beast into the lake of \"fire and brimstone\" (Revelation , ). Another mention of a false prophet in the New Testament is an antichrist spirit which denies the Son.\n\nThe Quran portrays Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets, which is understood by mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims to mean that anyone who claims to be a new prophet after him is a false prophet. All mainstream Muslim scholars' perspectives from both Sunni and Shia denominations do not see the second coming of the Messiah as the coming of a new prophet, as the Islamic Messiah Jesus had already been an existing prophet, and will rule by the Qur'an and Sunnah of Muhammad, bringing no new revelation or prophecy.\n\nThawban ibn Kaidad narrated that Muhammad said;\nAbu Hurairah narrated that Muhammad said;\nMuhammad also stated that the last of these Dajjals would be the False Messiah, al-Masih ad-Dajjal (Antichrist):\n\nSamra ibn Jundab reported once Muhammad (while delivering a ceremonial speech at an occasion of a solar eclipse) said;\nAnas ibn Malik narrated that Muhammad said;\nImam Mahdi, the redeemer according to Islam, will appear on Earth before the Day of Judgment. At the time of the Second Coming of Christ, the Prophet 'Isa (Jesus Christ son of Mary) will kill al-Masih ad-Dajjal (The Antichrist).\nMuslims believe that both Jesus and Mahdi will rid the world of wrongdoing, injustice and tyranny, ensuring peace and tranquility.\n\nJesus is rejected in Judaism as a failed Jewish Messiah claimant and a false prophet.\n\nThe Books of Kings records a story where, under duress from Ahab, the prophet Micaiah depicts God as requesting information from his heavenly counsel as to what he should do with a court of false prophets. This depiction is recorded in 1 Kings 22:19–23:\n\nIt is possible that Micaiah meant to depict the false prophets as a test from YHWH. It is also possible that it was meant as a slur on Ahab's prophets, such as Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah.\n\nThe penalty for false prophecy, including speaking in the name of a god other than YHWH or speaking presumptuously in YHWH's name, is capital punishment. Likewise, if a prophet makes a prophecy in the name of YHWH that does not come to pass, that is another sign that he is not commissioned of YHWH and that the people need not fear the false prophet.\n\nThe Jewish Koine Greek term \"pseuoprophetes\" occurs in the Septuagint Jeremiah 6:13, 33:8,11 34:7, 36:1,8, Zechariah 13:2, Josephus' Antiquities 8-13-1,10-7-3, War of the Jews 6-5-2, and Philo Specific Laws 3:8. Classical pagan writers use the term \"pseudomantis\".\n\nThe term \"false prophet\" is sometimes applied outside religion, to describe promoters of scientific, medical, or political theories which the author of the phrase thinks are false. Paul Offit's 2008 book \"Autism's False Prophets\" applied the phrase to promoters of unproven theories and therapies such as the thiomersal controversy and chelation therapy. Ronald Bailey's 1993 book \"Ecoscam: The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse\" applied the phrase to promoters of the global warming hypothesis; however, by 2005 Bailey had changed his mind, writing \"Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up.\"\n\n"}

Nussbaum’s artwork gives a rare glimpse into the essence of one individual among the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nNussbaum was born in Osnabrück, Germany, as the son of Rahel and Philipp Nussbaum. Philipp was a World War I veteran and German patriot before the rise of the Nazis. He was an amateur painter when he was younger, but was forced to pursue other means of work for financial reasons. He therefore encouraged his son’s artwork passionately.\n\nNussbaum was a lifelong student, beginning his formal studies in 1920 in Hamburg and Berlin, and continuing as long as the contemporary political situation allowed him. In his earlier works, Nussbaum was heavily influenced by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Rousseau and he eventually paid homage to Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carrà as well. Carl Hofer’s expressionist painting influenced Felix’s careful approach to color.\n\nIn 1933, Nussbaum was studying under a scholarship in Rome at the Berlin Academy of the Arts when the Nazis gained control of Germany. Adolf Hitler sent his Minister of Propaganda to Rome in April to explain to the artist elites how a Nazi artist was to develop, which entailed promoting heroism and the Aryan race. Nussbaum realised at this point that, as a Jew, he could not remain at the academy.\n\nThe next decade of Nussbaum's life was characterised by fear, which is reflected in his artwork. In 1934 he took , a painter whom he had met while studying in Berlin and would later marry during their exile in Brussels in 1937, to meet his parents in Switzerland. Felix's parents eventually grew homesick for Germany and, against his fierce objections, they returned. This was the last time Felix would see his mother and father — the source of his spiritual and financial support. Felix and Felka would spend the next ten years in exile, mostly in Belgium, a period of emotional and artistic isolation for him but also one of the most artistically productive in his life.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany attacked Belgium in 1940, Nussbaum was arrested by Belgian police as a \"hostile alien\" German, and was subsequently taken to the Saint-Cyprien camp in France. The desperate circumstances in the camp influenced his pictures of that time. He eventually signed a request to the French camp authorities to be returned to Germany. On the train ride from Saint Cyprien to Germany, he managed to escape and rendezvous with Felka in Brussels, and they began a life in hiding. Without residency papers, Nussbaum had no way of earning an income, but friends provided him with shelter and art supplies so that he could continue his craft. The darkness of the next four years of his life can be seen in the expression of his artwork from that period.\n\n1944 was the year in which the plans of Nazi Germany had the greatest impact on the Nussbaum family. Philipp and Rahel Nussbaum were killed at Auschwitz in February. In July, Nussbaum and his wife were found hiding in an attic by German armed forces. They were arrested, sent to the Mechelen transit camp and given the numbers XXVI/284 and XXVI/285. On August 2 they arrived at Auschwitz, and a week later Felix was murdered at the age of 39. On September 3, Nussbaum’s brother was sent to Auschwitz, and on September 6 his sister-in-law and niece were also murdered there. In December, his brother – the last of the family – died from exhaustion in the camp at Stutthof. Within one year, the entire Nussbaum family had been murdered.\n\nIn this time period, Nussbaum created two of his best-known works: \"Self Portrait with Jewish Identity Card\" (1943), and \"Triumph of Death\" (1944).\n\n\"Triumph of Death\" shows Nussbaum's attention to detail. According to his biography, \"Felix Nussbaum: Art Defamed; Art in Exile; Art in Resistance\", the crumpled music score has the first several bars of \"The Lambeth Walk\", a popular song from the musical \"Me and My Girl\". The words that would normally accompany the music are \"Ev'rythin' free and easy / Do as you darn well please\".\n\nFelix Nussbaum’s artwork affords a rare glimpse into the mind of one individual among the victims of the Holocaust. In 1998, the Felix Nussbaum Haus in Osnabrück opened its doors to exhibit the artworks of Felix Nussbaum.\n\nHe was featured alongside fellow concentration camp survivors and artists Jan Komski and Dinah Gottliebova in the 1999 documentary film \"Eyewitness\", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject.\n\n\"\" is a 1993 documentary directed by Barbara Pfeffer.\n\n\n\n"}

They were selected by Zhu Xi in the Song dynasty to serve as general introduction to Confucian thought, and they were, in the Ming and Qing dynasties, made the core of the official curriculum for the civil service examinations. They are:\n\n\nThe Five Classics () are five pre-Qin Chinese books that form part of the traditional Confucian canon. Several of the texts were already prominent by the Warring States period. Mencius, the leading Confucian scholar of the time, regarded the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" as being equally important as the semi-legendary chronicles of earlier periods. During the Western Han dynasty, which adopted Confucianism as its official ideology, these texts became part of the state-sponsored curriculum. It was during this period that the texts first began to be considered together as a set collection, and to be called collectively the \"Five Classics\".\n\nThe Five Classics are:\n\n\nThe \"Classic of Music\" is sometimes considered the sixth classic but was lost in the Burning of the Books.\n\nUp to the Western Han, authors would typically list the Classics in the order Poems-Documents-Rituals-Changes-Spring&Autumn. However, from the Eastern Han the default order instead became Changes-Documents-Poems-Rituals-Spring&Autumn.\n\nAuthors and editors of later eras have also appropriated the terms \"Book\" and \"Classic\" and applied them ironically to compendia focused on patently low-brow subject matter. Examples include the \"Classic of Whoring\" (\"Piao jing\" 嫖經) and Zhang Yingyu's \"A New Book for Foiling Swindles\" (\"Du pian xin shu\" 杜騙新書, ca. 1617), which is known colloquially as \"The Book of Swindles\" or \"The Classic of Swindles\".\n\nTraditionally, it was thought that Confucius himself had compiled or edited the texts of the Five Classics. The scholar Yao Hsin-chung allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that “nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics.” From the time of the Western Han dynasty, Yao continues, most Confucian scholars believed that Confucius re-collected and edited the prior works, thereby “fixing” the versions of the ancient writings which became the Classics. In the twentieth century, many Chinese scholars still held to this tradition. The New Confucian scholar, Xiong Shili (1885 -1968), for instance, held that the Six Classics were the final versions \"fixed up\" by Confucius in his old age. Other scholars had and have different views. The Old Text School, for instance, relied on versions found in the Han dynasty which supposedly survived the Qin dynasty burning of the books but many of them held that these works had not been edited by Confucius but survived directly from the Zhou dynasty.\n\nFor quite different reasons, mainly having to do with modern textual scholarship, a greater number of twentieth century scholars both in China and in other countries hold that Confucius had nothing to do with editing the classics, much less writing them. Yao Hsin-chung reports that still other scholars hold the “pragmatic” view that the history of the Classics is a long one and that Confucius and his followers, although they did not intend to create a system of classics, “contributed to their formation.” In any case, it is undisputed that for most of the last 2,000 years, Confucius was believed to have either written or edited these classics.\n\nThe most important events in the textual career of these classics were the adoption of Confucianism as state orthodoxy in the Han dynasty, which led to their preservation, and the “renaissance” of Confucianism in the Song dynasty, which led to their being made the basis of Confucian orthodoxy in the imperial examination system in the following dynasties. The Neo-Confucian sage Zhu Xi (1130-1200) fixed the texts of the Four Books and wrote commentaries whose new interpretations became accepted as being those of Confucius himself.\n\n\n"}

By the time Arab migrants began arriving from the east in the fourteenth century in sizeable numbers, the creed was already well established. Islamization in Chad was gradual, the effect of the slow spread of Islamic civilization beyond its political frontiers. Today the majority of Chadians are Muslims (55.7%), the vast majority of whom are Sunni of Maliki madhhab. In Chad, 55% of Muslims belong to a Sufi Tariqah (order). \n\nIslam in Chad was not influenced much by the great mystical movements of the Islamic Middle Ages, nor the fundamentalist upheavals that affected other countries. Consistent contact with West African Muslim traders and pilgrims may be the reason Chadian Muslims identify with the Tijaniyya order. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, the Sanusiyya brotherhood was founded in Libya, which benefited from economic and political influence in the Lake Chad Basin around 1900. An Islamic revival movement, feared by some French, led by Sanusi fanatics, Chadian adherents, limited to the Awlad Sulayman Arabs and the Toubou of eastern Tibesti, have never been numerous.\n\nHigher Islamic education in Chad is sparse; thus, serious Islamic students and scholars must travel to other countries. Scholars travel abroad to places such as Khartoum and Cairo, where Chadians attend Al Azhar.\n\nChadians observe the five pillars of the faith differently than the orthodox version. Prayer, both public and communal, occur more than once a week, but often not in a mosque. Chadian Muslims likely make the pilgrimage less often than Hausans in northern Nigeria. Some Chadian Muslims follow the Ramadan fast stricter than typical, with some refusing to swallow their saliva during the day.\n\n"}

Islam came to Togo about the same time as it did much of West Africa. The vast majority of Muslims in Togo are Sunni of Maliki school of jurisprudence.\n\nIslam was first introduced into West Africa south of the Sahara, across the salt and gold trade routes. Islamicized Berber and Tuareg merchants traveled the trans-Saharan trade routes. As time passed, Muslim clerics and scholars — teaching their beliefs and setting up places of worship along the routes — accompanied traders on their journeys. The Hausa and the Fulani, a traditionally nomadic group, traveled all over West Africa, taking their Muslim beliefs to places such as present-day Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.\n\nEstimates on the number of Muslims in Togo vary depending on the source. The CIA World Factbook puts the figure is 20%. A survey by the Pew Research Center gives an estimate of 12.2% of the population or 809,000 individuals as of 2009.\n\n"}

{"id": "2093718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2093718", "title": "Kamakhya", "text": "Kamakhya\n\nKamakhya (), also known as Siddha Kubjika, is an important Hindu Tantric goddess of desire who evolved in the Himalayan hills. She is worshiped as Siddha Kubjika, and is also identified as Kali and Maha Tripura Sundari. According to the Tantric texts (\"Kalika Purana\", \"Yogini Tantra\") that are the basis for her worship at the Kamakhya temple, a 16th-century temple in the Kamrup district of Assam. The earlier manifest of the goddess sanctified at the Garo hills is destroyed, although the Vatsayana priests are said to have carried away the manifest of the goddess to the Hindu kingdom in Kashmir and later sanctified in a remote hill forest in Himachal. Her name means \"renowned goddess of desire,\" and she resides at the presently rebuilt Kamakhya Temple in 1645 C. The temple is primary amongst the 51 Shakti Peethas related to the sect that follows Sati, and remains one of the most important Shakta temples and Hindu pilgrimage sites in the world.\n\nThe origin of worship 'Shakti' at the site is associated with the legend of Sati, who was the wife of the ascetic god Shiva and daughter of the Puranic god-king Daksha. Daksha was unhappy with his daughter's choice of husband, and when he performed a grand Yajna for all the deities, he did not invite Shiva or Sati. In a rage, Sati threw herself onto the fire, knowing that this would make the sacrifice impure. Because she was the all-powerful mother goddess, Sati left her body in that moment to be reborn as the goddess Parvati. Meanwhile, Shiva was stricken with grief and rage at the loss of his wife. He put Sati's body over his shoulder and began his \"tandava\" (dance of cosmic destruction) throughout the heavens, and vowed not to stop until the body was completely rotted away. The other Gods, afraid of their annihilation, implored Vishnu to pacify Shiva. Thus, wherever Shiva wandered while dancing, Vishnu followed. He sent his discus Sudarshana to destroy the corpse of Sati. Pieces of her body fell until Shiva was left without a body to carry. Seeing this, Shiva sat down to do \"Mahatapasya\" (great penance). Despite the similarity in name, scholars do not generally believe that this legend gave rise to the practice of sati or the voluntary giving of the wife's body on the pyre of her husband .\n\nAccording to various myths and traditions, there are 51 pieces of Sati's body scattered across the Indian subcontinent. These places are called shakti peethas and are dedicated to various powerful goddesses. Kamarupa (\"form of desire\") is the region in which the \"yoni\" (\"vulva,\" \"womb,\" or \"source\") is said to have fallen to earth, and the Kamakhya temple was said to have been constructed on this spot.\n\nKamakhya is mentioned in the \"Kalika Purana\" as the most important goddess of Tantric worship, and is referred to in the text as \"Mahamaya\", the \"great goddess of illusion\", who takes on many forms depending on her mood. Devotees also call her Kameshwari (\"beloved goddess of desire\"), and consider her a form of Maha Tripura Sundari, also called Shodashi. She is identified with Kali in the \"Kalika Purana\", Yoginitantra\" and \"Kamakhya Tantra\", each of which echoes this verse:\n\n\"It is certainly well known that Kamakhya is truly none other than that mother goddess Kali, who is in all things the form of wisdom.\"\nKamakhya is associated with the Dasa Mahavidyas, who each have temples dedicated to them at the Kamakhya temple complex in Assam. She is also closely associated with Durga.\n\nFour Adi Shakti Peethas\n\nThe great mythological texts including the Kalika Purana (the Asthashakti) and various Tantras recognize the four major Shakti Peethas as Adi Shakti Peethas. Like (Bimala, Pada Khanda) inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha, (Tara Tarini) Sthana Khanda (Breasts), near Brahmapur, Odisha, (Kamakhya, Yoni khanda) in Guwahati, Assam and (Dakhina Kalika, Mukha khanda) in Kolkata, West Bengal originated from the limbs of the Corpse of Mata Sati. In a hymn, the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti) clearly says:\n\n“Vimala Pada khandancha,\n\nStana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini),\n\nKamakhya Yoni khandancha,\n\nMukha khandancha Kalika (Kali)\n\nAnga pratyanga sangena\n\nVishnu Chakra Kshate nacha……”\n\nPeetha Body Part Place\n\nVimala Pada khanda Puri, Odisha\n\nTara Tarini Stana khanda Brahmapur, Odisha\n\nKamakhya Yoni khanda Guwahati, Assam\n\nDakshina Kalika Mukha khanda Kolkata, West Bengal\nMantras for general worship of the Mahavidyas at the Kamakhya temple complex reveal a close identity with Kamakhya herself. Several of these goddesses are worshipped as forms of Kamakhya explicitly.\nDevi Kamakhya's 'Ashtashaktis' or eight incarnations are Guptakama,Srikama,Vindhyavasini,Kotishvari,Vanadurga,Padadurga,Dirgheshvari and Bhuvaneshvari.\n\nOnce Narakasura, motivated by his carnal desire, wanted to marry Devi Kamakhya. When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a staircase from the bottom of the Nilachal Hill to the temple within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him.\nNaraka took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. He was almost about to accomplish the job before it was dawn. When Kamakhya Devi got this news, she playfully strangled a cock and made it crow untimely to give the impression of Dawn to Naraka. Duped by the trick even Naraka thought that it was a futile job and left it halfway through. Now the place is known as Kukurakata situated in the district of Darrang. The incomplete staircase is known as Mekhelauja Path.\n\nDrunk with power, as he knew himself to be unrivalled in prowess, he brought all the kingdoms on earth under his control. Next, he turned his eyes towards Swargaloka. Even the mighty Indra could not withstand the assault of this son of Vishnu and had to flee the heavens. \nNarakasura had become the overlord of both the heavens and earth. Addicted to power, he stole the earrings of Aditi, the heavenly mother goddess, and usurped some of her territory, while also kidnapping 16000 women.\n\nAll the Devas, led by Indra, went to Vishnu to ask him to deliver them from Narakasura. Vishnu promised them that he would attend to this matter, when he would be incarnated as Krishna.\n\nAs promised to Mother Earth, Narakasura was allowed to enjoy a long reign. At last Vishnu was born as Krishna. Aditi, who was a relative of Krishna's wife Satyabhama (believed to be an Avatar of Bhudevi - Narakasura' mother), approached Satyabhama for help. When Satyabhama heard of the Narakasura's ill treatment of women and his behaviour with Aditi, she was enraged. Satyabhama approached Lord Krishna for permission to wage a war against Narakasura. As promised to the Devas and Aditi, Krishna attacked the great fortress of Narakasura, riding his mount Garuda with wife Satyabhama.\nLord Krishna used the Narayanastra and the Agneyastra against the army of Narakasura.\nThe battle was furiously fought. Narakasura possessed 11 Akshauhinis that he unleashed on Lord Krishna. However, the Lord slew them all with little effort. Lord Krishna also killed Mura, Narakasura's general. Thus Krishna is called 'Murāri' (the killer of Mura).\n\nNarakasura used several divine weapons against Lord Krishna, but Krishna easily neutralised all those weapons. Narakasura used the Brahmastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with his own Brahmastra. Narakasura used the Agneyastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Varunastra. Narakasura used the Nagapasha against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Garudastra. In desperation, Narakasura launched the Vaishnavastra on Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with another Vaishnavastra. At last, when Narakasura tried to kill Lord Krishna with a trident, Lord Krishna beheaded him with his Sudarshana Chakra (discus).\nEverything happened because of the maya made by the Goddess Kamakhya.\n\nBefore Narakasura's death, he requested a boon from his mother, Satyabhama, that everyone should celebrate his death with colorful light. Thus this day is celebrated as 'Naraka Chaturdashi' - the day before Diwali. Krishna's and Satyabhama's victory on Narakasura translated into freedom for all his prisoners and honoring of Aditi. Having rescued the 16,100 women, Krishna married them to restore them to their former dignity.\n\nKamakhya is pictured as a young goddess, 16 years old, with twelve arms and six heads of varying colors, representing a powerful goddess who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. She is ornately dressed, typically wearing a red sari, opulent jewelry and red flowers such as hibiscus.\n\nShe holds in each of ten hands a lotus, trident, sword, bell, discus, bow, arrows, club or scepter, goad, and shield. Her remaining two hands hold a bowl, which is made either of gold or a skull.\n\nShe is seated upon a lotus, which emerges from the navel of Lord Shiva, who in turn lies atop a lion.\n\nTo each side of her sit Brahma and Vishnu, who are each seated upon a lotus, as well.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Jain Cosmology, when the third ara of the \"avasarpani\" (present descending half-cycle of cosmic age) was nearing its end, felicities due to ten type of \"Kalpavriksha\" (wish-fulfilling trees) started declining. The number of the sages who thus appeared is said to be fourteen, the last of whom was \"Nabhirai\", the father of the first \"tirthankara\", \"Rishabhanatha\".\n\nJainism acknowledge a set of first law-givers who flourished in the present \"Avasarpini\" age (in the third division called \"susama-duhsama\", when beings were born as twins and when the \"Kalpavriksha\" (wishing trees) used to provide them with necessary food, light and other necessities of life). The age of \"Kulakara\" was a primitive one, when arts and sciences were not known, and crime and punishment were in infancy.\n\nThe first \"kulakara\" was Pratisruti. When the trees that shed strong light around them, in the state of the \"bhogabhumi\" disappeared and the sun and the moon became visible, the people, who saw them for the first time, were alarmed. It was Pratisruti who understood the cause of their appearance by his superior wisdom. He explained to them that the light of the trees had been too powerful thus far to enable the sun and the moon to be seen but now that that illumination had paled they became visible. The division of day and night dates from his time.\n\nSanmati was the second \"kulakara\". In his time the light of the trees had faded into insignificance, and even the stars became visible in the sky.\n\nThen came Kshemankara, after the lapse of a long long time. In his time animals began to be troublesome. Hitherto the feeding-trees had supplied men and animals with enough food; but now the conditions were changing, and every one had to look for himself. The distinction of domestic and wild animals dates from Kshemankara’s time.\n\nKshemandhara was the fourth manu who followed Kshemankara after a long interval of time. He is said to have devised weapons of wood and stone to drive away wild animals.\n\nThe next manu was \"Seemankara\". In his time, quarrels arose over the \"kalpa trees\" (wish-fulfilling trees). He was called \"Seemankara\", because he had fixed the \"seemas\" (boundaries) of proprietorship. \n\nSeemandhara was the next in order to appear. The quarrels had become more intense by his time over the disappearing kal'pa vrikshas (trees). He laid the foundation of individual ownership over the trees, and he also set marks on them.\n\nVimalabahana was the seventh manu. He taught men how to utilise the services of domestic animals, and invented the tethering rope, the bridle and the like to keep them under control.\n\nChakshusmana then appeared after the lapse of another long period of time. In his time the old order of bhogabhumi was so far changed that the parents did not die at the birth of their progeny. Some people were astonished at this and enquired the cause of the change from Chakshusmana, which he explained.\n\nYasasvana, the ninth \"kulakara\". According to Jain texts, he taught the men how to regard their children as their own, and to bless them.\n\nThe tenth manu was Abhi Chandra, in whose time the old order of things underwent still further changes. The people now lived to play with their children; they also began to give them useful instruction. Because Abhi Chandra was the first to play with his children in moonlight he came to be known as Abhi Chandra (chandra signifying the moon).\n\nThe eleventh manu was Chandrabha, in whose time children came to be looked after better. His guidance was also very beneficial \nfor mankind in certain other ways.\n\nThe twelfth manu was Marud Deva. He is said to have taught the art of navigation.\n\nPrasenajit was the thirteen \"kulakara\". According to Jain texts, in his time children came to be born with \"prasena\" (the amnion or membrane in which a child is born). Before his time children were not wrapped in a membrane.\n\nThe last of the \"kulakaras\" was Nabhi Rai. He was the father of Rishabhanatha. \"Kulkara\" Nabhi taught the men how to cut the navel chord (\"nabhi\"). According to Jain texts, thick rain cloud began to gather in the sky freely in his time.\n\n"}

This original missive was apparently written not long after Ardashir had overthrown Ardavan, and Tansar appears to have been responding to charges levelled at Ardashir, and the delay in accepting Ardashir's suzerainty. Representative of those charges is the accusation that Ardashir \"had taken away fires from the fire-temples, extinguished them and blotted them out.\" To this, Tansar replies that it was the \"kings of the peoples [i.e. Parthians' vassal kings]\" that began the practice of dynastic fires, an \"innovation\" unauthorized by the kings of old. A similar response appears in Book IV of the 9th century \"Denkard\".\n\nThe letter was revised in the 6th-century, during the reign of Khusrow I Anoshiravan. The legend that the Arsacid Parthians had allowed Zoroastrianism to fall into neglect stems from the same period. The letter was translated into Arabic in the 9th century by Ibn al-Muqaffa, and from Arabic into New Persian in the 13th-century when Ibn Isfandiar, an Iranian Muslim, put it in his \"History of Tabaristan\" (a mountainous region in northern Iran). The Ibn Isfandiar version, which dates to 1210-1216, is the only one that survives. \n\nThe importance of the Letter of Tansar was first perceived by James Darmesteter, who published the first critical translation of it in 1894..\n\n\n"}

Ezra, was a Baghdadi Jewish publisher and Zionist based in Shanghai. He founded the Shanghai Zionist Association in 1903 and its official newspaper, \"Israel's Messenger\", one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals. He served as editor-in-chief of the newspaper for more than 30 years until his death in 1936. Influenced by Ezra, his nephews started the newspaper \"Jewish Tribune\" in Bombay, India.\n\nNissim Elias Benjamin Ezra was a Baghdadi Jew born in Lahore, British India (now Pakistan), and settled in Shanghai, China. An ardent Zionist, he established the Shanghai Zionist Association (SZA) in 1903 and its official newspaper, \"Israel's Messenger\", in 1904. The newspaper was one of China's oldest Jewish periodicals, and became one of the most sophisticated under Ezra's leadership. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper for more than 30 years until his death in 1936. It was also circulated in the United States, where it successfully positioned itself as the most authoritative Jewish voice in East Asia.\n\nEzra also served as the main leader of the Shanghai Zionist Association, which had about 100 members in March 1905, for many years. A major financial supporter of the movement was the tycoon Elly Kadoorie, who became chairman of the SZA in 1915. Despite their efforts, Zionism did not become a major cause of the wealthy Baghdadi Jews of Shanghai, who were organized as the Shanghai Jewish Community Association. On the other hand, Ezra received support from Sun Yat-sen, leader of China's nationalist revolution. In a letter to Ezra dated 24 April 1920, Sun wrote that \"all lovers of Democracy cannot help but support wholeheartedly and welcome with enthusiasm the movement to restore your wonderful and historic nation, which has contributed so much to the civilization of the world and which rightfully deserves an honorable place in the family of nations.\"\n\nOn 5 December 1936, Ezra died of heart disease in Shanghai.\n\nN.E.B. Ezra held a pessimistic view of the West, at a time when Europe was dominated by the regimes in Germany and Russia, which were responsible for widespread human rights abuses. He saw the East a refuge of humanity, and pleaded for a new Buddha, who, like Moses, Confucius, Jesus, and Mohammed, would save the world from the threat of tyranny. That view made him controversial among the Sephardi Jewish community.\n\nEzra extolled the contributions made by the Jews to the development and modernization of China, and thought following the teachings of Confucius would save China and move the world: \"Confucius pleaded for justice and righteousness; he made morality and good government synonymous. If the country is willing to follow him and adopt his teachings then China will be able to 'move the world' in the real sense of the word.\" The view was seen as overly idealistic for the time, when China was faced with grave threats from Japanese imperialism.\n\nOn 15 September 1933, Ezra wrote a letter to Mamoru Shigemitsu and proposed to resettle the European Jews persecuted by Nazi Germany in Manchukuo. He also wrote to Israel Cohen, secretary of the World Zionist Organization in London, for support. Cohen opposed his plan, noting that it would be inappropriate to settle the refugees in Japanese-occupied Manchukuo, and the potential instability that might result from the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in Manchuria.\n\nEzra's nephews, the Sargon brothers (Benjamin, Joseph, and David) of Bombay, grew up reading \"Israel's Messenger\". Greatly influenced by Ezra's journalistic concepts, the brothers edited the \"Jewish Advocate\" (later renamed the \"Jewish Tribune\") in the 1930s, bringing it to a much higher level of professionalism than the older Jewish newspapers of Bombay.\n\n"}
{"id": "243471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243471", "title": "Nimrod", "text": "Nimrod\n\nNimrod (; , , \"an-Namrūd\"), a biblical figure described as a king in the land of Shinar (Assyria/Mesopotamia), was, according to the Book of Genesis and Books of Chronicles, the son of Cush, therefore the great-grandson of Noah. The Bible states that he was \"a mighty hunter before the Lord [and] ... began to be mighty in the earth\". Extra-biblical traditions associating him with the Tower of Babel led to his reputation as a king who was rebellious against God.\n\nAttempts to match Nimrod with historically attested figures have failed. Nimrod may not represent any one personage known to history, and in reality is more likely a conflation of several real and fictional figures of Mesopotamian antiquity, including the Mesopotamian god Ninurta, the Akkadian kings Sargon and his grandson Naram-Sin (2254–2218 BCE), and Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243–1207 BC) of the Middle Assyrian Empire.\n\nThe first biblical mention of Nimrod is in the Table of Nations. He is described as the son of Cush, grandson of Ham, and great-grandson of Noah; and as \"a mighty one in the earth\" and \"a mighty hunter before the Lord\". This is repeated in the First Book of Chronicles 1:10, and the \"Land of Nimrod\" used as a synonym for Assyria or Mesopotamia, is mentioned in the Book of Micah 5:6:\n\nGenesis says that the \"beginning of his kingdom\" (\"reshit mamlakto\") were the towns of \"Babel, Erech, Akkad and Calneh in the land of Shinar\" (Mesopotamia) (Gen 10:10)—understood variously to imply that he either founded these cities, ruled over them, or both. Owing to an ambiguity in the original Hebrew text, it is unclear whether it is he or Ashur who additionally built Nineveh, Resen, Rehoboth-Ir and Calah (both interpretations are reflected in various English versions). Sir Walter Raleigh devoted several pages in his \"History of the World\" (c. 1616) to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria.\n\nIn Hebrew and Christian tradition, Nimrod is considered the leader of those who built the Tower of Babel in the land of Shinar, though the Bible never actually states this. Nimrod's kingdom included the cities of Babel, Erech, Akkad, and perhaps Calneh, in Shinar (Ge 10:10). Flavius Josephus believed that it was likely under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began; in addition to Josephus, this is also the view found in the Talmud (\"Chullin\" 89a, \"Pesahim\" 94b, \"Erubin\" 53a, \"Avodah Zarah\" 53b), and later \"midrash\" such as \"Genesis Rabba\". Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king Amraphel, who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.\n\nSince Accad (Babylonian Akkad) was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200–2154 BCE (long chronology), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late Early Bronze Age. The association with Erech (Babylonian Uruk), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BCE as a result of struggles between Isin, Larsa and Elam, also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin—possibly inserted during the Babylonian captivity.\n\nJudaic interpreters as early as Philo and Yochanan ben Zakai (1st century AD) interpreted \"a mighty hunter \"before\" the Lord\" (Heb.: גבר ציד לפני יהוה, \"ḡibbōr-ṣayiḏ lip̄nê Yahweh\", lit. \"in the face of Yahweh\") as signifying \"\"in opposition to\" the Lord\"; a similar interpretation is found in Pseudo-Philo, as well as later in Symmachus. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name \"Nimrod\" with a Hebrew word meaning 'rebel'. In Pseudo-Philo (dated ca. AD 70), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while Joktan as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower. Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\" (7th century AD).\n\nThe Book of Jubilees mentions the name of \"Nebrod\" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of Azurad, the wife of Eber and mother of Peleg (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.\n\nJosephus wrote:\n\nAn early Arabic work known as \"Kitab al-Magall\" or the \"Book of Rolls\" (part of Clementine literature) states that Nimrod built the towns of Hadāniūn, Ellasar, Seleucia, Ctesiphon, Rūhīn, Atrapatene, Telalān, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when Reu was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building Nisibis, Raha (Edessa) and Harran when Peleg was 50. It further adds that Nimrod \"saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown.\" He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. \"For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from heaven.\" Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the fourth son of Noah.\n\nIn the \"Recognitions\" (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king Ninus, who first appears in the Greek historian Ctesias as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the \"Homilies\" (H 9:4–6), Nimrod is made to be the same as Zoroaster.\n\nThe Syriac \"Cave of Treasures\" (ca. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the \"Kitab al-Magall\", except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called \"Sisan\", and the fourth son of Noah is called \"Yonton\".\n\nJerome, writing ca. 390, explains in \"Hebrew Questions on Genesis\" that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, \"he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.\" However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in Sumer, not Syria.\n\nThe Ge'ez \"Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan\" (ca. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the \"Cave of Treasures\", but the crown maker is called \"Santal\", and the name of Noah's fourth son who instructs Nimrod is \"Barvin\".\n\nHowever, Ephrem the Syrian (306–373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, \"Targum Pseudo-Jonathan\" (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower—for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.\n\n\"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer\" (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod's party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, Esau (grandson of Abraham), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century \"Sefer haYashar\", which adds that Nimrod had a son named \"Mardon\" who was even more wicked.\n\nIn the \"History of the Prophets and Kings\" by the 9th century Muslim historian al-Tabari, Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, Allah destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly Syriac, is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, Abu al-Fida, relates the same story, adding that the patriarch Eber (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian Masudi recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of Aram, son of Shem, adding that he reigned 500 years over the Nabateans. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of Canaan, as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.\n\nIn Armenian legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, Hayk, defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with Bel) in a battle near Lake Van.\n\nIn the Hungarian legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the White Stag [\"Fehér Szarvas\"] or Silver Stag), King Nimród (aka \"Ménrót\" and often described as \"Nimród the Giant\" or \"the giant Nimród\", descendant of one of Noah's \"most wicked\" sons, Kam (references abound in traditions, legends, several religions and historical sources to persons and nations bearing the name of Kam or Kám, and overwhelmingly, the connotations are negative), is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel—construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the event of the Great Flood (see biblical story of Noah's Ark). After the catastrophic failure (through God's will) of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the ensuing linguistic cacophony, Nimród the giant moved to the land of \"Evilát\", where his wife, \"Enéh\" gave birth to twin brothers \"Hunor\" and \"Magyar\" (aka \"Magor\"). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimród especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer. Both the Huns' and Magyars' historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimród. (Simon Kézai, personal \"court priest\" of King Ladislaus the Cuman, in his \"Gesta Hungarorum\", 1282-85. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979).\n\nThe twin sons of King Nimród, Hunor and Magor, each with 100 warriors, followed the White Stag through the Meotis Marsh, where they lost sight of the magnificent animal. Hunor and Magor found the two daughters of King Dul of the Alans, together with their handmaidens, whom they kidnapped. Hungarian legends held Hunor and Magyar (aka Magor) to be ancestors of the Huns and the Magyars (Hungarians), respectively. According to the Miholjanec legend, Stephen V of Hungary had in front of his tent a golden plate with the inscription: \"Attila, the son of Bendeuci, grandson of the great Nimrod, born at Engedi: By the Grace of God King of the Huns, Medes, Goths, Dacians, the horrors of the world and the scourge of God.\"\n\nNimrod figures in some very early versions of the history of Freemasonry, where he was said to have been one of the fraternity's founders. According to the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: The legend of the Craft in the Old Constitutions refers to Nimrod as one of the founders of Masonry. Thus in the York MS., No. 1, we read: \"At ye making of ye toure of Babell there was a Masonrie first much esteemed of, and the King of Babilon yt called Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons.\" However, he does not figure in the current rituals.\n\nThe demon Nyyrikki, figuring in the Finnish \"Kalevala\" as a helper of Lemminkäinen, is associated with Nimrod by some researchers and linguists.\n\nA confrontation between Nimrod and Abraham is said to have taken place, according to several Jewish and Islamic traditions. Some stories bring them both together in a cataclysmic collision, seen as a symbol of the confrontation between Good and Evil, and/or as a symbol of monotheism against polytheism. On the other hand, some Jewish traditions say only that the two men met and had a discussion.\n\nAccording to K. van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, this tradition is first attested in the writings of Pseudo-Philo. The story is also found in the Talmud, and in rabbinical writings in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn some versions (as in Flavius Josephus), Nimrod is a man who sets his will against that of God. In others, he proclaims himself a god and is worshipped as such by his subjects, sometimes with his consort Semiramis worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also Ninus.)\n\nA portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to idolatry. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping Him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of gnats which destroys Nimrod's army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod's brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor Titus, destroyer of the Temple in Jerusalem).\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with Cain). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave Eliezer, whom some accounts describe as Nimrod's own son. (The Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham's majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod.)\n\nStill other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham's crucial act of leaving Mesopotamia and settling in Canaan is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod's revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham's birth (as in the Bible, also \"Jubilees\"); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.\n\nThe story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of Moses' birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings – Nebuchadnezzar and Pharaoh. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with Cyrus, whose birth according to Herodotus was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.\n\nA confrontation is also found in the Qur'an, between a king, not mentioned by name, and the Prophet Ibrahim (Arabic for \"Abraham\"). Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In Ibrahim's confrontation with the king, the former argues that Allah (God) is the one who gives life and gives death. The king responds by bringing out two people sentenced to death. He releases one and kills the other, as a poor attempt at making a point that he also brings life and death. Ibrahim refutes him by stating that Allah brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered.\n\nWhether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as \"Nimrod the Evil\" ().\n\nNimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baha'i scriptures, including the Kitáb-i-Íqán, the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion. There it is said that Nimrod \"dreamed a dream\" which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing \"the coming of Abraham.\" Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the Báb (the herald of the Baha'i Faith). Citing examples of God's power, he asks: \"Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod?\"\n\nThe story of Abraham's confrontation with Nimrod did not remain within the confines of learned writings and religious treatises, but also conspicuously influenced popular culture. A notable example is \"Quando el Rey Nimrod\" (\"When King Nimrod\"), one of the most well-known folksongs in Ladino (the Judeo-Spanish language), apparently written during the reign of King Alfonso X of Castile. Beginning with the words: \"When King Nimrod went out to the fields/ Looked at the heavens and at the stars/He saw a holy light in the Jewish quarter/A sign that Abraham, our father, was about to be born\", the song gives a poetic account of the persecutions perpetrated by the cruel Nimrod and the miraculous birth and deeds of the savior Abraham. (Full original text and an English translation appear in the Ladino Wikipedia article.)\n\nAccording to the Islamic narrative, Abraham seems to have a series of discussions with Nimrod. The Quran states, \"Have you not considered him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom (i.e. he was prideful)?\" Abraham says, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" The king answers, \"I give life and cause death\", and brings forth two men sentenced to death. He frees one and condemns the other. Then Abraham says, \"Indeed, God brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" This causes the king to exile him, and he left for Levant. Although Nimrod's name is not stated in the Quran, it has been held by Islamic scholars that the \"king\" mentioned was him. According to Mujahid, \"Four people gained control over the earth, east and west, two believers and two disbelievers. The two believers were Solomon and Dhul Qarnayn, and the two disbelievers were Nebuchadnezzar and Nimrod. No one but they gained power over it.\"\n\nThe following version of the confrontation between Abraham and Nimrod appears in the Midrash Rabba, a major compilation of Jewish Scriptural exegesis. The part in which this appears, the Genesis Rabbah (Chapter 38, 13), is considered to date from the sixth century.\n\nHistorians, Orientalists, Assyriologists and mythographers have long tried to find links between Nimrod and real historically attested figures in Mesopotamia.\n\nSince the city of Akkad was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200–2154 BC (long chronology), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late Early Bronze Age. The association with Erech (Sumero-Akkadian Uruk), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BC as a result of struggles between Isin, Ur, Larsa and Elam, also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. Several Mesopotamian ruins were given Nimrod's name by 8th-century AD Arabs, including the ruins of the Assyrian city of Kalhu (the biblical Calah), built by Shalmaneser I (1274–1244 BC) A number of attempts to connect him with historical figures have been made.\n\nThe Christian Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea as early as the early 4th century, noting that the Babylonian historian Berossus in the 3rd century BC had stated that the first king after the flood was \"Euechoios\" of Chaldea, identified him with Nimrod. George Syncellus (c. 800) also had access to Berossus, and he too identified \"Euechoios\" with the biblical Nimrod. More recently, Sumerologists have suggested additionally connecting both this \"Euechoios\", and the king of Babylon and grandfather of Gilgamos who appears in the oldest copies of Aelian (c. 200 AD) as \"Euechoros\", with the name of the founder of Uruk known from cuneiform sources as Enmerkar.\n\nIn 1920, J.D. Prince also suggested a possible link between the Lord (Ni) of Marad and Nimrod. He mentioned how Dr. Kraeling was now inclined to connect Nimrod historically with Lugal-Banda, a mythological king mentioned in Poebel, Historical Texts, 1914, whose seat was at the city Marad. This is supported by Theodore Jacobson in 1989, writing on \"Lugalbanda and Ninsuna\".\n\nAccording to Ronald Hendel the name Nimrod is probably a polemical distortion of the god Ninurta, a prominent god in Mesopotamian religion who had cult centers in a number of Assyrian cities such as Kalhu, and also in Babylon, and was a patron god of a number of Assyrian kings. Nimrod's imperial ventures described in \"Genesis\" may be based on the conquests of the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (Dalley et al., 1998, p. 67). Julian Jaynes also indicates Tukulti-Ninurta I (a powerful king of the Middle Assyrian Empire) as the origin for Nimrod. Alexander Hislop, in his tract \"The Two Babylons\" decided that Nimrod was to be identified with Ninus (also unattested in Mesopotamian king lists), who according to Greek legend was a Mesopotamian king and husband of Semiramis, with a whole host of deities throughout the Mediterranean world, and with the Persian Zoroaster. The identification with Ninus follows that of the \"Clementine Recognitions\"; the one with Zoroaster, that of the \"Clementine Homilies\", both works part of Clementine literature. There was a historical Assyrian queen Shammuramat in the 9th century, the wife of Shamshi-Adad V, whom some speculations have identified with Semiramis, while others make her a later namesake of a much earlier Semiramis.\n\nIn David Rohl's theory, Enmerkar, the Sumerian founder of Uruk, was the original inspiration for Nimrod, because the story of \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\" (see:) bears a few similarities to the legend of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, and because the -KAR in Enmerkar means \"hunter\". Additionally, Enmerkar is said to have had ziggurats built in both Uruk and Eridu, which Rohl postulates was the site of the original Babel.\n\nGeorge Rawlinson believed Nimrod was Belus (like Nimrod and Ninus a king not attested in Mesopotamian annals, but claimed by the later Greeks to have been a king of Assyria) based on the fact Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions bear the names Bel-. The word \"Nibru\" in the Akkadian language of Assyria and Babylonia comes from a root meaning to 'pursue' or to make 'one flee', and as Rawlinson pointed out not only does this closely resemble Nimrod’s name but it also perfectly fits the description of Nimrod in Genesis 10: 9 as a great hunter. The Belus-Nimrod equation or link is also found in many old works such as Moses of Chorene and the \"Book of the Bee\". Nibru, in the Sumerian language, was the original name of the city of Nippur.\n\nJoseph Poplicha wrote in 1929 about the identification of Nimrod in the first dynasty or Uruk\n\nYigal Levin (2002) suggests that Nimrod was a recollection of Sargon of Akkad and of his grandson Naram-Sin, with the name \"Nimrod\" derived from the latter. He argues that:\n\nIn modern American English, the term is often used sarcastically to mean a dimwitted or a stupid person, a usage first recorded in 1932 and popularized by the \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, who both sarcastically refer to the hunter Elmer Fudd as \"nimrod\", as an ironic connection between \"mighty hunter\" and \"poor little Nimrod\", i.e. Fudd.\n\n\n\n"}

The Superior of the Church is bishop Dariusz Majewski. In 2016, there were 535 believers in Poland.\n\nThe Old Catholic Church in Poland is a continuation of the mission of the Polish Old Catholic Church, which was established in 1933 as a result of the split in the Polish diocese of the Polish Catholic Church.\n\nThe first bishop of the Polish Old Catholic Church was Wladyslaw Faron, who left the PNKK structure in 1931. In the interwar Poland, the Old Catholic Church operated as an informal union with the parish priest of Father Józef Kostorz from the Old Catholic Church in Germany. After World War II in Poland, the Old Catholic Church entered the ecclesial union with the Polish Old Catholic Churches: the Old Catholic Church of Mariavite and the mission diocese of the Polish National Catholic Church. However, in 1948 it broke up after Bishop Faron and a few priests joined the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Zygmunt Szypold became the superior of the Polish Old Catholic Church. After his death, the authorities of the Polish People's Republic suspended the activities of the Church (1965), citing a lack of authority. The faithful of the Polish Old Catholic Church either went to other churches or practiced underground faith until the resumption of the official activity of the Church, made through the entry into the Register of Churches and Religious Unions in the Ministry of Interior and Administration by Fr. Bishop Wojciech Kolm in 1996. In Hamburg, despite the suspension of the Church's activity, father Klaudiusz Perendyk, who later joined the Orthodox Church. The consequence of the suspension of the activities of the Old Catholic Church was very acute, because the Church lost many sacred objects, which were often illegally acquired by the Catholic Church and Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1996, Father Wojciech Kolm community has made an entry under the name of Old Catholic Church in the Polish Register of churches and other religious organizations Ministry of Interior, and the decision of the Synod of the Church in 1999, he was elected bishop and he was consecrated bishop at the hands of the Superior of the Order of Mariavite in Germany - Nobert Udo Szuwart. His church activity was linked to a number of abuses, both religious and legal. His leadership of the Church practically ended in 2000, when he was sent to jail for a crime against the customs. It was not until 2006 that the church court removed him from office and excommunicated him.\n\nSince 2000, the acting supervisor was Bishop Marek Kordzik, but in the register of churches and other religious figures as the head of the church from July 25, 2006, because it was necessary to his election to the National Synod in accordance with the requirements of the then-current church law.\n\nIn 2009 Bishop Marek Kordzik has reformed the administration of the Church and ordered pastoral matters. On Holy Thursday of the same year the parish of Sts. Padre Pio and the Christ the King, the Eternal High Priest in Chorzow - now in Bytom (from the transfer of the parish community from Grudziadz), and a month later erected parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Dzially Czarnowskie, operating at a retirement home. At the same time, the parish of the Church in Kamienna Góra was erected. In November 2011, there were also pastoral posts in Biala Wielka and Warsaw.\n\nOn the decision of the Church authorities, on Wednesday, 27 June 2012 in Czarnowskie Dzialy took place 4th Synod of the Old Catholic Church in Poland. During the vote, Bishop Marek Jan Kordzik (term 2012-2018) was re-elected by the Superior of the Old Catholic Church. During the discussion the current issues were discussed, and the direction of the development of the parish and missionary communities in the coming years was discussed.\n\nIn 2013 under the jurisdiction of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland has been accepted the parish of St. Stanislav, Marcin of Tours in Nowogrodek in Belarus, and in 2015 the Parish of Black Madonna of Czestochowa from Glasgow, Scotland, which on June 1, 2016 under the jurisdiction of the National Catholic Church in Poland, and on June 12, 2017 returned to the jurisdiction of the Old Catholic Church in Poland.\n\nOn August 15, 2016 the Old Catholic Church in Poland under the agreement with the Ecumenical Center for the Dialogue of Religions and Cultures started a pastoral ministry in the Church of Sts. Stanislaw Kostka in Aleksandrów Łódzki. On 18 September 2016 the clergy of the Church together with the bishops Marek Kordzik and Wojciech Kolm took part in the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the city of Aleksandrów Łódzki.\n\nAugust 18, 2016 Archbishop Willian Dorea signed on behalf of the Old Catholic Apostolic Church in Brazil, an intercom with the Old Catholic Church in Poland. Both churches see the source of their apostolic succession with Bishop Jan Perkowski, who belonged to Bishop Wladyslaw Faron's political sympathizers, and joined him in the organization of the Polish Old Catholic Church. Bishop Marek Kordzik was the Primate of the Diocese of the Old Catholic Apostolic Church. In Brazil, Cameroon, Congo, Spain or Italy.\n\nBishop Marek Kordzik, Superior of the Old Catholic Church in Poland, died on December 10, 2016 in Lodz as a result of cardiovascular failure. By the time of the Synod of the Church in urgent matters, according to § 58 par. 2 The law of the Inner Church is decided jointly by the clergy, who ex officio form part of the council of the Church. On January 14, 2017 during the Extraordinary Synod of Lodz in the Republic of Poland, Rev. Arthur Wiecinski.\n\nThe teaching of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland does not diverge from the faith and tradition of the Holy Universal and Apostolic Church. The highest church honors God in the one and only Holy Trinity. The Church honors the angels, the apostles, the martyrs and the saints, and among them in a special way the Virgin Mary. The Church recognizes the traditional 7 sacraments, according to the teachings of the Western Catholic Church. Holy Communion is given in two forms: the Body and Blood of the Lord. In the Old Catholic Church there is a traditional personal confession and the universal confession of her. The liturgy of the Church is in accordance with the principles and liturgical guidelines of the Roman Catholic Church, although in some parishes there is a tradition of celebrating the Mass. In a pre-baptismal rite, but always in Polish.\n\nIn liturgical activities, the Church uses the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church year, the Gregorian calendar. Celebrations and celebrations of the Church are celebrated in accordance with the tradition of Polish Catholicism, and the following holidays are celebrated only in the Old Catholic Church in Poland:\n\nThe Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland fulfills its statutory tasks by conducting extensive social and charitable actions in local communities. In the cathedral parish of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Lodz, thanks to the cooperation with the Ecumenical Good Shepherd Foundation, free legal and administrative advice is provided free of charge, as well as financial assistance, regardless of confessional status. The Lodz ministry is also involved in the historical reconstruction of the Iron Star Ore Collection Group in Lodz. In Bytom there is also a deacon's activity among the poorest families of the Upper Silesian agglomeration.\n\nSuperiors of the Old Catholic Church over the years:\nCurrently, in the Church of the Old Catholic Church in Poland, the bishop's office holds:\n\nThe priest of the Old Catholic Church in Poland may be a man who has completed the Christian Theological Academy in Warsaw - the Faculty of Theology, the Old Catholic Section or another equivalent Catholic theological school and has received the approval of the Church authorities and at least the ordination of the diaconate. The Church also has a Higher Seminary (based in Warszawa), whose rector is father m. theol. Artur Miłański. Clerics are also welcomed from other Churches, where the problem of celibacy is an obstacle to their canonical work. The bishop in the Old Catholic Church in Poland is a priest elected by the Synod of the Nation. The priest has celibacy, but the bishop has the right to give dispensation in special cases, for example when the priest has married before priestly ordination. The Church has liturgical dresses similar to those in the Roman Catholic Church or pre-Vatican Rite. There are also choir dresses in the case of titular privilege Infułata or Canon. The Church can create canonical chapters, cathedrals, collegiate chapels, and costumes and dystonia as in the Roman Catholic Church. Church clergy provide religious services to everyone, regardless of their confessional status, i.e., the sacraments to every faithful who recognizes Catholic doctrine on the sacraments, and sacramentals to all Christians.\n\nThe supreme legislative authority in the Old Catholic Church is the Synod (it is all clergy and one lay member of each parish) who manages the whole Church as well as its material goods, agendas and clerics. Synod is convened every 6 years. In the inter-synodic period, the executive and legislative power is exercised by the priestly council of the Old Catholic Church, consisting of all active clergy. Since the Fourth Synod of Poland, some of the tasks remaining so far in the competence of the Levitical Council have been transferred to inter-synod committees.\n11-12 November 1996, Jelenia Góra\n\nThe Synod adopted a report on the activity of the Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland in 1993-1996. It was confirmed the function of the head of the Church for father Wojciech Kolm.\nNovember 11-12, 2000, Lodz\n\nThe Synod adopted a report on the activities of the Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland in 1996-2000. The synod adopted the applicable Internal Law of the Old Catholic Church in Poland.\nNovember 11-12, 2006, Lodz\n\nThe Synod adopted a report on the activities of the Old Catholic Church in Poland in the years 2000-2006. At the head of the Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland, Bishop Marek Jan Kordzik, who was ingressed in Lodz in 2007, was elected acting vicar general.\nJune 27, 2012, Czarnowskie Działy\n\nThe Synod adopted a report on the activities of the Old Catholic Church in Poland in 2006-2012. Again, Bishop Marek Kordziek was re-elected to the head of the Old Catholic Church in Poland. A number of amendments to the Internal Law governing the issues of priestly discipline and Church property were adopted at the Synod. The necessity of reactivating the suspended seminary seminar and setting up a press body has been reported. The competences of the Holy See Priest Council and three inter-synodal commissions were established: ecclesiastical law, interfaith and liturgical dialogue. Some of the applications for consideration were transferred to the autumn meeting of the Levitical Council.\nJanuary 14, 2017, Lodz\n\nOn December 10, 2016, Bishop Marek Kordzik, who was the Superior of the Old Catholic Church in Poland, died. According to the applicable Internal Law of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland (§ 44. 2), in the event of the death of the Minister, the Synod shall summon the Vicar General of the Church or the oldest bishop or clergyman if the Vicar General is not vacant. The synod should be convened not later than three months after the death of the summoner. December 11, 2016, it was decided that the Synod will take place on January 14, 2017, to elect a new bishop - Synod elected to the new Superior of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland - Reverend Arthur Wiecinski.\nJuly 21st, 2017, Wojcieszów\n\nOn 21-22 July 2017 the Extraordinary Synod of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland took place. July 22, 2017 On the second day of the Synod, as planned, the bishop of the Old Catholic Church in Poland were ordained. Bishop. E. Artur Wiciński, who according to the applicable Canon Law of the Old Catholic Church in Poland received the title of Archbishop, according to the historical tradition of the Church during the time of Archbishop Wladyslaw Faron, where the Church Superior received the title of archbishop of the community. During the same synod a formal election of Rev. Robert Matysiak for the Bishop of the Diocese of Germany of the Old Catholic Church in Poland.\n\nThe church is one diocese in Poland and Belarus, the other in Germany, and also has a foreign province in Brazil and a territorial prefecture in the United Kingdom. As a whole there are 10 parishes, 23 ministers working in ministry (including 4 bishops and 1 bishop - elect), about 5500 faithful in five countries. The Cathedral of the Church is in Łódź, while the seat of the curia in Wojcieszów. There is also the Order of the Friars Minor of Divine Mercy, which is based in Lodz - Fr. Kazimierz Dorocinski. At the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland there is also the Church Seminary of the Old Catholic Church, where the teaching of 13 Church leaders will begin in September. \n\n"}

He originally gained prominence as an advocate of atheism and metaphysical naturalism, authoring many articles on The Secular Web and later defending his basic position in his book \"Sense and Goodness Without God.\"\n\nHis blog appeared on Freethought Blogs and he has frequently been a featured speaker at various skeptic, secular humanist, freethought and atheist conventions, such as the annual Freethought Festival in Madison, Wisconsin, the annual Skepticon convention in Springfield, Missouri and conventions sponsored by American Atheists. In 2016, he left the Freethought Blogs network.\n\nCarrier has frequently debated with Christian apologists such as William Lane Craig and David Marshall both in person and online. The Craig debate was broadcast on Lee Strobel's television show \"Faith Under Fire\".\nHis recent books on the historicity of Jesus have established him as a leading supporter of the Christ myth theory, which claims that neither the historical Jesus nor the biblical Jesus existed in reality. Carrier asserts that in the context of his Bayesian methodology, the ahistoricity of Jesus and his origin as a mythical deity are \"true\" (i.e. the \"most probable\" Bayesian conclusion), arguing that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range of 1/3 to 1/12000, depending on the estimates used for the computation. Nearly all contemporary scholars of ancient history and most biblical scholars have maintained that a historical Jesus did indeed exist \n\nCarrier received a PhD in Ancient History from Columbia University in 2008. His thesis was entitled \"Attitudes Towards the Natural Philosopher in the Early Roman Empire (100 B.C. to 313 A.D.).\" He has published several articles and chapters in books on the subject of history and philosophy. He was formerly the editor of and a substantial contributor to The Secular Web. His contributions there include an autobiographical essay \"From Taoist to Infidel\" in which he discusses his upbringing in a benign Methodist church, his conversion to Taoism in early adulthood, his confrontation with Christian fundamentalists while in the United States Coast Guard, and his deeper study of religion, Christianity, and Western philosophy, which eventually led to his embrace of naturalism. This was reprinted in his major work defending atheism and naturalism, \"Sense and Goodness without God\".\n\nIn his contribution to \"The Empty Tomb\", Carrier argues that the earliest Christians probably believed Jesus had received a new spiritual body in the resurrection, and that stories of his old body disappearing from its tomb were developed later. He also argues it is less likely, but also possible, that the original body of Jesus was misplaced or stolen. This work was criticized by philosophy professor Stephen T. Davis in \"Philosophia Christi\" and Christian theologian Norman Geisler.\n\nIn \"Not the Impossible Faith\", he wrote on the social and intellectual context of the rise and early development of Christianity. Though originally skeptical of theories about the ahistoricity of Jesus, since late 2005, he has considered it \"\"very\" probable Jesus never actually existed as a historical person.\" He also said \"though I foresee a rising challenge among qualified experts against the assumption of historicity [of Jesus], as I explained, that remains only a hypothesis that has yet to survive proper peer review.\"\n\nCarrier was initially not interested in the question of the historicity of Jesus. Like many others his first thought was that it was a fringe conspiracy topic not worthy of academic inquiry; however a number of different people requested that he investigate the subject and raised money for him to do so. Since then he has become a leading expert on the Jesus ahistoricity theory. Other scholars who hold the \"Jesus agnosticism\" viewpoint or \"Jesus atheism\" viewpoint, include; Arthur Droge, Kurt Noll, Thomas L. Brodie, Earl Doherty, Robert M. Price, Thomas L. Thompson, Raphael Lataster, Hector Avalos and still others like Philip R. Davies, who have opined that the viewpoint of Carrier et al. is respectable enough to deserve consideration.\n\nWhen reports spread in 2004 that Antony Flew changed his mind on his rejection of the existence of gods, Carrier engaged in correspondence with Flew to find out what happened and published an extensive analysis of the situation on The Secular Web, finding among other things that Flew changed his position to there being some sort of \"minimal God,\" as in Deism. According to the author of the book in Flew's name, Roy Abraham Varghese, Flew had released a statement through his publisher (without addressing Carrier's correspondence), stating, \"My name is on the book and it represents exactly my opinions. I would not have a book issued in my name that I do not 100 percent agree with. I needed someone to do the actual writing because I’m 84 and that was Roy Varghese’s role. This is my book and it represents my thinking.\" Carrier concluded that Flew's changed ideas were not accurately represented in the book written for Flew, \"There is a God\".\n\nRichard Carrier, in collaboration with Reinhold Mittschang, challenged several anti-Christian statements attributed to Adolf Hitler in his collection of monologues known as the \"Table Talk\". Carrier's paper argues that the French and English translations are \"entirely untrustworthy\" and suggests the possibility that François Genoud had doctored portions of the text to enhance Hitler's views. Carrier put forward a new translation of twelve quotations based on Henry Picker and Werner Jochmann's German editions, as well as a fragment from the \"Bormann-Vermerke\" preserved at the Library of Congress, which challenge some of the quotations popularly used to demonstrate Hitler's hostility to Christianity. Carrier concludes that Hitler's views in the \"Table Talk\", \"resemble Kant's with regard to the primacy of science over theology in deciding the facts of the universe, while remaining personally committed to a more abstract theism.\" Carrier also maintains that throughout the \"Table Talk\" Hitler takes a cynical view of Catholicism, \"voicing many of the same criticisms one might hear from a candid (and bigoted) Protestant.\"\n\nIn the new forward to the \"Table Talk\", Gerhard Weinberg commented that \"Carrier has shown the English text of the table-talk that originally appeared in 1953 and is reprinted here derives from Genoud's French edition and not from one of the German texts.\" Derek Hastings cites Carrier's paper for \"an attempt to undermine the reliability of the anti-Christian statements.\" Carrier's thesis that the English translation should be entirely dispensed with is not accepted by Richard Steigmann-Gall, who despite referencing the controversies raised by Carrier, \"ultimately presume[d] its authenticity.\"\n\nCarrier has engaged in several formal debates, both online and in person, on a range of subjects including naturalism, natural explanations of early Christian resurrection accounts, the morality of abortion, and the general credibility of the Bible. He debated Michael R. Licona on the Resurrection of Jesus at the University of California, Los Angeles on April 19, 2004. Carrier debated atheist Jennifer Roth online on the morality of abortion. He has defended naturalism in formal debates with Tom Wanchick and Hassanain Rajabali. He has debated David Marshall on the general credibility of the New Testament. His debates on the historicity of Jesus have included professor of religious studies Zeba A. Crook, Christian scholars Dave Lehman and Doug Hamp.\n\nThe March 18, 2009 debate \"Did Jesus Rise From The Dead?\" with William Lane Craig was held at the Northwest Missouri State University and posted online in two parts by ReasonableFaithOrg (YouTube channel). Prior to the debate, Carrier commented that \"I originally insisted we first debate [on the topic] \"Are the Gospels Historically Reliable?\" for the simple reason that you can't honestly debate the former until you've debated (and in fact settled) the latter.\" And then per his post debate commentary, Carrier noted that Craig \"focused almost entirely on protecting the Gospels as historical sources, and it was there that his shotgun of arguments got well ahead of my ability to catch up.\"\n\nThe October 25, 2014 debate \"Did Jesus Exist?\" with Trent Horn was held in San Diego, California and posted online by the \"MABOOM Show\" (YouTube channel). Per the Question and Answer session, Horn lists some of his recommended books for defending the historicity of Jesus. Horn notes works by ; Shirley Jackson Case, Robert Van Voorst, Paul Rhodes Eddy and Greg Boyd and Bart D. Ehrman. Per Ehrman's book, Horn states, \"a good popular introduction might be Bart Ehrman's book \"Did Jesus Exist?\". Unfortunately it is not a scholarly treatment like Dr. Carrier's [book]\" and \"there really is not a scholarly treatment of the issue from the historical view\" (time 1:38:30).\n\nThe April 13, 2016 debate \"Did Jesus Exist?\" with Craig A. Evans was held at the Kennesaw State University and posted online by KSUTV. Per Evans' opening remarks (time 6:30–28:30), Carrier states, \"That is the best case I think you can make for the historicity of Jesus\" (time 28:30).\n\nRichard Carrier was the keynote speaker for the Humanist Community of Central Ohio's annual Winter Solstice Banquet where he spoke on defending naturalism as a philosophy.\n\nCarrier appeared on three episodes of The \"Polyschizmatic Reprobates Hour\" podcast with host Dan Sawyer.\n\nHe also appears in the documentary \"The Nature of Existence\" in which film-maker Roger Nygard interviews people of many different religious and secular philosophies about the meaning of life.\n\nCarrier is listed in \"Who's Who in Hell.\" Carrier was featured in the documentary film \"The God Who Wasn't There\", where he was interviewed about his doubts on the historicity of Jesus. He is also featured in the 2017 documentary film \"Batman & Jesus\" by Jozef K. Richards, as well as his series, \"Holy Shit\", where Carrier appears in a skit as the biblical character, Absalom, alongside comedian Reuben Glaser.\n\nCarrier announced in 2015 that he and his wife had ended their 20-year marriage. He also revealed that he is polyamorous, and that the last two years of his marriage had an open relationship agreement, after informing his wife of his extramarital affairs.\n\nCarrier has authored two Jesus historicity books: \"Proving History\" and \"On the Historicity of Jesus\". The first of these books advances a methodology, based on Bayes' theorem, as the standard by which all methodology for any historical study must adhere in order to be logically sound. The second applies this methodology to the question of the historicity of Jesus, and reaches a conclusion for the ahistoricity of Jesus. Per Carrier's Bayesian methodology, Raphael Lataster writes, \"Given the problematic sources that historical Jesus scholars have access to, and the failings of many of their methods, it seems appropriate to call for a thorough, and Bayesian, analysis of the evidence in order to determine if Jesus’ historicity or ahistoricity is more probable.\" Thus the historicist and ahistoricist argument for Jesus hinges on how well each theory predicts each item of evidence, which items of evidence count, and how they count towards the most probable Bayesian conclusion.\n\nCarrier's first major book, \"Proving History: Bayes's Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus\", published in 2012 by Prometheus Books, describes the application of Bayes' theorem to historical inquiry in general and the historicity of Jesus in particular.\n\n\"Hitler Homer Bible Christ: The Historical Papers of Richard Carrier 1995-2013\", published January 2014, is an anthology of Carrier's published papers on history—of which some are peer reviewed journal articles on the historicity of Jesus and are also cited as source references in Carrier's \"On the Historicity of Jesus\".\n\nIn June 2014, Carrier's \"On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt\" was published by Sheffield Phoenix Press. Carrier notes that it is \"the first comprehensive pro-Jesus-myth book ever published by a respected academic press and under formal peer review.\" Carrier argues that there is insufficient Bayesian probability, that is evidence, to believe in the historicity of Jesus. Furthermore, he argues that a celestial Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure, to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then began to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century.\n\n\"Jesus Did Not Exist: A Debate Among Atheists\", was published November 12, 2015, with foreword and afterword by Richard Carrier. The book by Raphael Lataster compares the claims of Bart D. Ehrman, Maurice Casey, and Richard Carrier. Lataster previously wrote a book review on Carrier's \"On the Historicity of Jesus\" which is used as the basis for the section on Carrier and then expanded upon for the lay reader. Per any evidence outside of the New Testament, for Jesus’s existence, Carrier writes;There is no independent evidence of Jesus’s existence outside the New Testament. All external evidence for his existence, even if it were fully authentic (though much of it isn’t), cannot be shown to be independent of the Gospels, or Christian informants relying on the Gospels. None of it can be shown to independently corroborate the Gospels as to the historicity of Jesus. Not one single item of evidence. Regardless of why no independent evidence survives (it does not matter the reason), no such evidence survives.\n\nThus, according to Carrier, no reliable conclusion on the historicity of Jesus is possible from the so-called \"independent\" and \"objective\" sources dated after the Gospels (see Sources for the historicity of Jesus). They could be reliant on the Gospels and therefore would not be independent, nor objective.\n\nMarcan priority assumes that the Gospel of Mark was the first gospel to be written. However, biblical scholars do not have access to any primary sources for the Gospels (see Historical reliability of the Gospels), which makes any conclusions about them susceptible to doubt as is also the case with any oral transmission of the gospel prior to the first-written gospel. Per the Gospels' status as reliable historical sources, Raphael Lataster writes, \"The Gospels, and indeed all the sources concerning Jesus, are not primary sources; they are not contemporary to the events they describe, nor is it reasonable to assume that they were written by eye-witnesses. The extant sources concerning Jesus are, at best, secondary sources.\" and Carrier additionally claims that:\n\nCarrier contends that apart from the hero archetype pattern, nothing else in the Gospels is reliable evidence for or against the historicity of Jesus.\n\nCarrier asserts that originally \"Jesus was the name of a celestial being, subordinate to God, with whom some people hallucinated conversations\" and \"The Gospel began as a mythic allegory about the celestial Jesus, set on earth, as most myths then were\" (see Jesus in comparative mythology). Stories were created that placed Jesus on Earth, in context with historical figures and places. Eventually people began to believe that these allegorical stories were real.\n\n\nEarl Doherty originated the premise that Jesus originated as a myth per Middle Platonism (with some influence from Jewish mysticism) and that the belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century. Doherty asserts that Paul the Apostle and other writers of the earliest existing proto-Christian Gnostic documents did not believe in Jesus as a person who was incarnated on Earth in an historical setting, rather, they believed in Jesus as a heavenly being who suffered his sacrificial death in the lower spheres of heaven, where he was crucified by demons and then was subsequently resurrected by God (see Dying-and-rising god). This mythological Jesus was not based on a historical Jesus, but rather on an exegesis of the Old Testament in the context of Jewish-Hellenistic religious syncretism heavily influenced by Middle Platonism, and what the authors believed to be mystical visions of a risen Jesus.\n\nCarrier reviewed Doherty's work in 2002, concluding that Doherty's thesis was plausible, however, Carrier had not yet concluded it was probably more true than the minimal historicity thesis (he also noted that some of Doherty's points were untenable and that only his core thesis was at least coherent with the evidence). Carrier remained a historicity agnostic until he began formal research on Jesus ahistoricity theory in 2008, which eventually convinced him that the evidence actually favored the core Doherty thesis.\n\nIn regards to plausible theories for the origination of Jesus in relation to the founding of Christianity, the most probable is contested between three competing theories; Mythological Ahistoricity, Supernatural Historicity, and Natural Historicity. In regards to Mythological Ahistoricity, Carrier reviews Ehrman's \"How Jesus Became God\" and notes, \"It does soundly establish the key point that Jesus was regarded as a pre-existent incarnate divine being from the earliest recorded history of Christianity, even in fact before the writings of Paul, and that this was not even remarkable within Judaism.\"\n\nCarrier notes four major trends in religion, occurring prior to the formation of Christianity:\n\nCarrier writes that per syncretism, \"Mithraism was a syncretism of Persian and Hellenistic elements; the mysteries of Isis and Osiris were a syncretism of Egyptian and Hellenistic elements. Christianity is simply a continuation of the same trend: a syncretism of Jewish and Hellenistic elements. Each of these cults is unique and different from all the others in nearly every detail—but it's the general features they all share in common that reflect the overall fad that produced them in the first place, the very features that made them popular and successful within Greco-Roman culture.\"\n\nCarrier contends that Christianity originated from a Jewish sect, writing;Christianity, as a Jewish sect, began when someone (most likely Cephas, perhaps backed by his closest devotees) claimed this [celestial deity] “Jesus” had at last revealed that he had tricked the Devil by becoming incarnate and being crucified by the Devil (in the region of the heavens ruled by Devil), thereby atoning for all of Israel’s sins. [...] It would be several decades later when subsequent members of this cult, after the world had not yet ended as claimed, started allegorizing the gospel of this angelic being. By placing him in earth history as a divine man, as a commentary on the gospel and its relation to society and the Christian mission.\n\n\"On the Historicity of Jesus\" was reviewed by Raphael Lataster in the \"Journal of Religious History\", who concurs that according to the Gospels, \"Jesus fits almost perfectly\" the Rank-Raglan mythotype, and notes that there is \"not a single confirmed historical figure\" that conforms to the mythotype.\n\nCarrier's methodology in his work on the historicity of Christ was reviewed by Aviezer Tucker, a prior advocate of using Bayesian techniques in history. Tucker expressed some sympathy for Carrier's view of the Gospels, stating: \"The problem with the Synoptic Gospels as evidence for a historical Jesus from a Bayesian perspective is that the evidence that coheres does not seem to be independent, whereas the evidence that is independent does not seem to cohere.\" However, Tucker argued that historians have been able to use theories about the transmission and preservation of information to identify reliable parts of the Gospels. He said that \"Carrier is too dismissive of such methods because he is focused on hypotheses about the historical Jesus rather than on the best explanations of the evidence.\"\n\nReviewing \"On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt\", Christina Petterson of the University of Newcastle, Australia, in the academic journal \"Relegere\", writes, \"Even if strictly correct, the methodology is tenuous. In addition, the numbers and the statistics seem like a diversion or an illusionary tactic which intentionally confuse and obfuscate\", and that, \"Maths aside, nothing in the book shocked me, but seemed quite rudimentary first year New Testament stuff.\" Petterson says Carrier's conclusion that the later tales of a historical Jesus should be studied for their literary and rhetorical purpose and not for their specific historical content \"reveals Carrier's ignorance of the field of New Testament studies and early Christianity\", but states that \"the historical Jesus haunts biblical scholarship\".\n\nResponding to what he sees as the main elements in the same book, Emeritus Professor of New Testament Language, Literature and Theology at the University of Edinburgh, Larry Hurtado, has written that, contrary to Carrier's claims, Philo of Alexandria never refers to an archangel named Jesus. Hurtado also states that the apostle Paul clearly believed Jesus to have been a real man who lived on earth and that deities of pagan saviour cults such as Isis and Osiris, etc., were not transformed in their devotees' ideas from heavenly deities to actual people living on earth.\n\nIn Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus Daniel N. Gullotta, reviewing Carrier’s \"On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt\", says Carrier has provided a \"rigorous and thorough academic treatise that will no doubt be held up as the standard by which the Jesus Myth theory can be measured\" though he finds Carrier's arguments \"problematic and unpersuasive\", his use of Bayesian probabilities \"unnecessarily complicated and uninviting\" and criticizes Carrier's \"lack of evidence, strained readings and troublesome assumptions.\" Gullotta also says that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, either documentary or archaeological, that there was a period when Christians believed that Jesus only existed in heaven rather than living as a human being on earth, which he says is Carrier's \"foundational\" thesis.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "624040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=624040", "title": "Robert Tilton", "text": "Robert Tilton\n\nRobert Gibson Tilton (born 1946) is an American televangelist of the prosperity gospel widely known for his infomercial-styled religious television program \"Success-N-Life\", which at its peak in 1991 aired in all 235 American TV markets (daily in the majority of them), brought in nearly $80 million per year, and was described as \"the fastest growing television ministry in America.\"\n\nWithin two years after ABC's \"Primetime Live\" examined Tilton's fundraising practices, beginning a series of investigations into the ministry, his program was taken off the air. Tilton later returned to television via his new version of \"Success-N-Life\" airing on BET and The Word Network.\n\nTilton was born in McKinney, Texas, on June 7, 1946. He attended Cooke County Junior College and Texas Technological University.\n\nAccording to Tilton's autobiographical materials, he had a conversion experience to evangelical Christianity in 1969 and began his ministry in 1974, taking his new family (including then wife Martha \"Marte\" Phillips, whom he married in 1968) on the road to, in his words, \"preach this gospel of Jesus.\" Tilton preached to small congregations and revivals throughout Texas and Oklahoma. Tilton and his family settled in Dallas, Texas, and built a small nondenominational charismatic church in Farmers Branch, Texas, called the \"Word Of Faith Family Church\" in 1976. The church also started a local television program then known as \"Daystar\" (not related to the Daystar Television Network, though both were started in the Dallas area). Tilton's announcer on \"Daystar\" was Miami radio personality and voice-over artist Dave Mitchell, who was based in Dallas at the time.\n\nTilton's young church was growing steadily, but \"Daystar\" failed to expand beyond the Dallas area until Tilton went to Hawaii—his self-described version of Jesus's forty days in the wilderness—and spent time fishing, drinking, and watching an increasingly popular new form of television programming: the late-night infomercial.\n\nTilton was particularly influenced by Dave Del Dotto, a real estate promoter who produced hour-long infomercials showing his glamorous life in Hawaii (which he constantly stressed anyone could achieve just by following the principles set up in his many \"get rich quick\" books) as well as \"interviews\" with students who were brought out to his Hawaiian villa for said interviews, specifically for their on-camera testimonials about the success in life they were now enjoying thanks to his teachings. Upon his return from Hawaii in 1981, Tilton, with the help of a US$1.3M loan from Dallas banker Herman Beebe, revamped \"Daystar\" into an hour-long \"religious infomercial\" with the title \"Success-N-Life\".\n\nIn \"Success-N-Life\", Tilton regularly taught that all of life's trials, especially poverty, were a result of sin. Tilton's ministry consisted mainly of impressing upon his viewers the importance of making \"vows\"—financial commitments to Tilton's ministry. His preferred vow, stressed frequently on his broadcasts, was $1,000. Occasionally, Tilton would claim to have received a word of knowledge for someone to give a vow of $5,000 or even $10,000. When a person made a vow to Tilton, he preached that God would recognize the vow and reward the donor with vast material riches. The show also ran \"testimonials\" of viewers who gave to Tilton's ministry and reportedly received miracles in return, a practice that would be used as the basis for a later lawsuit from donors charging Tilton's ministry with fraud. A \"Dallas Morning News\" story published in 1992 observed that Tilton spent more than 84 percent of his show's airtime for fundraising and promotions, a total higher than the 22 percent for an average commercial television show; other sources put the total fundraising time during episodes of \"Success-N-Life\" closer to 68 percent. Some of Tilton's fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, who heads a multimillion-dollar marketing empire writing donation letters for other televangelists like W. V. Grant and Don Stewart.\n\nAs a result of Tilton's television success, Word of Faith Family Church (renamed \"Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center\") grew to become a megachurch, with 8,000 members at its height.\n\nTilton is the author of several self-help books about financial success, including \"The Power to Create Wealth\", \"God's Laws of Success\", \"How to Pay Your Bills Supernaturally\", and \"How to be Rich and Have Everything You Ever Wanted\". Most of Tilton's books were published in the 1980s and distributed via promotion on \"Success-N-Life\" and through the many mailings Tilton's ministry sent his followers. The books were republished in the late 1990s to be used as centerpieces of his 1997 infomercial series and are now promoted on his current () daily live internet broadcast.\n\nIn 1991, Diane Sawyer and ABC News conducted an investigation of Tilton (as well as two other Dallas-area televangelists, W. V. Grant and Larry Lea). The investigation, assisted by Trinity Foundation president Ole Anthony and broadcast on ABC's \"Primetime Live\" on November 21, 1991, alleged that Tilton's ministry threw away prayer requests without reading them, keeping only the accompanying money or valuables sent to the ministry by viewers, garnering his ministry an estimated US$80 million a year.\n\nOle Anthony, a Dallas-based minister whose Trinity Foundation church works with the homeless and the poor on the east side of Dallas, first took an interest in Tilton's ministry in the late 1980s after some of the people coming to the Trinity Foundation for help told him they had lost all of their money making donations to some of the higher profile televangelists, especially fellow Dallas-area minister Robert Tilton. Curious about the pervasiveness of the problem, the Trinity Foundation got on the mailing lists of several televangelists, including Tilton, and started keeping records of the many types of solicitations they received almost daily from various ministries.\n\nFormer Coca-Cola executive Harry Guetzlaff came to the Trinity Foundation after he had been turned away from Tilton's church when he found himself on hard times following a divorce. He had been a longtime high-dollar donor and gave up his last $5,000 as a \"vow of faith\" just weeks earlier. Guetzlaff's experience, combined with the sheer magnitude of mailings from Tilton's ministry, spurred Anthony, a former intelligence officer in the United States Air Force and licensed private investigator, to start a full investigation of Tilton's ministry. Guetzlaff joined Anthony in the task of gathering details on Tilton's operation and later did much of the legwork in finding and following the paper trail for the ABC News investigation.\n\nIn a November 21, 1991, promotional appearance for the \"Primetime Live\" televangelist investigation on \"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\", Diane Sawyer said that she had watched several televangelist programs, including Robert Tilton's \"Success-N-Life\", during her travels as a reporter and was \"fascinated\" by them, but also \"disturbed\". Stressing that she knew how sensitive people always are to reporters questioning religion, she said that she spoke with other reporters, and then eventually to ABC producers, who then decided to conduct their own investigation into a number of the more prominent televangelists, eventually settling in 1991 on the three featured in the \"Primetime Live\" episode: W. V. Grant, Larry Lea, and Tilton. According to Sawyer, the ABC producers, including Tilton segment producer Robbie Gordon, learned about possible resources available from Ole Anthony and the Trinity Foundation, and contacted Trinity for information on Tilton. After comparing their accumulated notes, data and details, the two groups decided to pool their efforts and began planning the undercover portion of the story. Anthony agreed to portray himself as a Dallas-based minister with a small church looking into the ways televangelist ministries could grow so quickly, and the ABC producers would pose as Anthony's \"media consultants.\"\n\nThe team, armed with hidden cameras and microphones, arrived for a meeting at Response Media, the Tulsa-based marketing firm handling Tilton's mass mailings, to discuss a proposal sent by Anthony to Response Media about fundraising for a religious-based TV talk show. The director of Response Media, Jim Moore, described for Anthony and the hidden cameras (concealed in the undercover \"Primetime Live\" producers' glasses and handbags) many techniques used by Tilton to raise funds for his ministry. Moore also said that Tilton was doing \"far better than anyone knows\" and described the main strategy Tilton employed for such a high return rate on his mailings—that is, send the recipient a \"gimmick\" that compelled the recipient to mail something back in return, and most recipients would include some money along with it. Moore declined to disclose how much Response Media was paid for its services or how much money the mailings were generating for the Tilton ministry.\n\nHowever, as part of his sales pitch to Anthony, Moore disclosed that the response letters generated by the fundraising mailings Response Media sends out for its clients were never delivered to the client; instead, they were sent unopened to the client's financial institution or other institutions of choice. \"You never have to touch it\", Moore added in response to a clarification question from Ole Anthony about dealing with the gimmick objects sent to the potential donors in the mails. One of the ABC producers asked whether this was a standard practice—\"So the mail goes straight to the bank?\"—and Moore asserted that it was: \"The mail goes to the bank, and they put the money in your account. We just get the paper with the person's name and how much they gave.\"\n\nTrinity Foundation members, acting on this information, started digging through dumpsters outside Tilton's many banks in the Tulsa area as well as dumpsters outside the office of Tilton's lawyer, J. C. Joyce (also based in Tulsa). Over the next 30 days, Trinity's \"garbologists\", as Anthony dubbed them, found tens of thousands of discarded prayer requests, bank statements, computer printouts containing the coding for how Tilton's \"personalized\" letters were generated, and more, all of which were shown in detail on the Tilton segment within the \"Primetime Live\" documentary, now titled \"The Apple of God's Eye\". In a follow-up broadcast on November 28, 1991, \"Primetime Live\" host Diane Sawyer said that the Trinity Foundation and \"Primetime Live\" assistants found prayer requests in bank dumpsters on 14 separate occasions in a 30-day period.\n\nTilton vehemently denied the allegations and took to the airwaves on November 22, 1991, on a special episode of \"Success-N-Life\" entitled \"Primetime Lies\" to air his side of the story. Tilton asserted that the prayer requests found in garbage bags shown on the \"Primetime Live\" investigation were stolen from the ministry and placed in the dumpster for a sensational camera shot, and that he prayed over every prayer request received, to the point that he \"laid on top of those prayer requests so much that 'the chemicals actually got into [his] bloodstream, and... [he] had two small strokes in [his] brain.\" Tilton remained defiant on claims regarding his use of donations to his ministry to fund various purchases, asking, \"Ain't I allowed to have nothing?\" with regards to his ownership of multiple multimillion-dollar estates. Tilton also claimed that he needed plastic surgery to repair capillary damage to his lower eyelids from ink that seeped into his skin from the prayer requests.\n\nAfter Trinity Foundation members spent weeks poring over the details of the documents they and ABC had uncovered, sorting and scrutinizing each prayer request, bank statement, and computer printout dealing with the codes Tilton's banks and legal staff used when categorizing the returned items, Ole Anthony called a press conference in December 1991 to present what he described as Tilton's \"Wheel of Fortune\", using a large display covered in actual prayer requests, copies of receipts for document disposition, and other information which demonstrated what happened to money and prayer requests which the average viewer of Tilton's television program sent him. When both Tilton and his lawyer J. C. Joyce reacted to the news by claiming the items Anthony was displaying had somehow been stolen by \"an insider\", Anthony responded in a subsequent interview that \"Joyce was our mole—a lot of this stuff came from the dumpster outside his office.\"\n\n\"Primetime Live's\" original investigation and subsequent updates included interviews with several former Tilton employees and acquaintances. In the original investigation, one of Tilton's former prayer hotline operators claimed the ministry cared little for desperate followers who called for prayer, saying Tilton had a computer installed in July 1989 to make sure the phone operators talked to no caller for longer than seven minutes. The former employee also revealed very specific instructions were given to them in terms of how to talk with callers and they were told to always ask for a $100 \"vow\" at a minimum. Also in the original report, a former friend of Tilton's from college (who remained anonymous and was shown in silhouette) claimed both he and Tilton would attend tent revival meetings as a \"sport\" and would claim to be anointed and healed at the meetings. He added the two had often discussed the notion that after graduation they would set up their own roving revival ministry \"and drive around the country and get rich.\" In a July 1992 update to the investigation, \"Primetime Live\" interviewed Tilton's former maid, who claimed prayer requests which were sent to Tilton's house by the ministry were routinely ignored until he told her to move them out of the house and into the garage; according to the maid, \"they stacked up and stacked up\" in Tilton's garage until he had them thrown away. In the same interview, Tilton's former secretary came forward and claimed Tilton lifted excerpts from \"get rich quick\" books and used them in his sermons, and she never saw him perform normal pastoral duties such as visiting with the sick and praying with members.\n\nDespite Tilton's repeated denials of misconduct, the State of Texas and the federal government became involved in subsequent investigations, finding more causes for concern about Tilton's financial status with each new revelation. After nearly 10,000 pounds of prayer requests and letters to the Tilton ministry were found in a disposal bin at a Tulsa area recycling firm in February 1992, along with itemized receipts of their delivery from Tilton's main mail-handling service in Tulsa rather than from the church offices in Farmers Branch, Tilton admitted in a deposition given to the Texas Attorney General's office that he often prayed over computerized lists of prayer requests instead of the actual prayer requests themselves, and that prayer requests were in fact routinely thrown away after categorization.\n\nAs each revelation became increasingly more damaging, viewership and donations declined dramatically. The last episode of \"Success-N-Life\" aired nationally on October 30, 1993. By that time, viewership had fallen 85 percent and monthly donations went from $8 million to $2 million.\n\nIn 1992, Tilton sued ABC for libel because of its investigation and report, but the case was dismissed in 1993. Federal Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett, in his July 16, 1993, dismissal of the case, stated that information in the Trinity Foundation's logs on prayer requests reportedly found in dumpsters on September 11, 1991, \"could not have been found then because the postmark date was after September 11, 1991\", but also noted that Ole Anthony had recanted the erroneous entries in a subsequent affidavit. Tilton appealed the decision in 1993; although the findings of the original court were upheld in 1995, federal Judge Michael Burrage's opinion criticized ABC and the \"Primetime Live\" producers for their editing of the story and noted that ABC had been warned by their own religion editor, Peggy Wehmeyer (who knew Ole Anthony from her work as a religion reporter at ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas), that \"Mr. Anthony could not be trusted and was obsessed with his crusade against [Tilton].\" Tilton once more appealed the decision, this time to the US Supreme Court in 1996, but the court refused to hear the case.\n\nSeveral donors to Tilton's television ministry sued Tilton in 1992–1993, charging various forms of fraud. One plaintiff, Vivian Elliott, won $1.5 million in 1994 when it was discovered that a family crisis center for which she had made a donation (and recorded an endorsement testimonial) was never built or even intended to be built. The judgment was later reversed on appeal.\n\nAs part of the defense strategy to the fraud cases, Tilton sued Ole Anthony, Harry Guetzlaff and four plaintiff's lawyers who had filed the fraud cases against him in federal court in Tulsa. The tactic is known to critics as a \"SLAPP\" (strategic lawsuit against public participation) suit. Tilton claimed that the individuals conspired to violate his First Amendment rights under a post–Civil War federal statute designed to protect blacks from the Ku Klux Klan. (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985.) Defense attorneys Martin Merritt of Dallas and ACLU lawyer Michael Linz, also of Dallas, with others won dismissal for the six defendants in federal district court. On appeal, in \"Tilton v. Richardson\", 6 F.3d 683 (10th Cir.1993), the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on the grounds that 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985 did not protect a nonminority individual against a purely private conspiracy, if one existed. The fraud cases continued until the Texas Supreme Court eventually ruled that the plaintiffs could not prove damages because they could not show that, if Tilton had actually prayed over the prayer requests, the prayers would have been answered.\n\nThe decline of \"Success-N-Life\" also led to the end of Tilton's 25-year marriage to his wife Marta, who had been administrative head of the Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center, in 1993. Dallas lawyer Gary Richardson, who represented many of the parties suing Tilton for fraud, attempted to intervene in the Tiltons' divorce, citing the potential for the divorce settlement to be used to hide financial assets that were currently part of the many fraud cases; Richardson's petition to have the divorce action put on hold until after the fraud cases were settled was denied. Marte intervened in Tilton's second divorce from Leigh Valentine, who had asked the court to include the church and all its property as community property in the proceedings. Under Texas law, property accumulated during a marriage is considered community property and thus subject to division between the parties in a divorce. The jury eventually ruled against the request.\n\nLexington Academy was a small private Christian school in Farmers Branch, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), that was founded in the early 1980s by Robert Tilton and his wife Marte. The name \"Lexington\" was chosen in honor of the Battle of Lexington. The school mascot was the Patriots. The school was a member of TAPPS (Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools), and won dozens of State Championships in Athletics, Academics, and Fine Arts during the less than 20 years of its existence, including five overall TAPPS State Championships. The school was dissolved in 1998 as a result of debts incurred from lawsuits against Tilton and his ministry.\n\nTilton returned to television in 1994 with a new show called \"Pastor Tilton\", a show with an emphasis on \"demon blasting\" exorcism practices, usually involving Tilton shouting as loudly as possible at demons supposedly possessing people suffering from pain and illness. However, this program was far less successful than its predecessor, and was cancelled by the end of the year.\n\nAfter moving to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1996, Tilton returned to the airwaves in 1997 with a new version of \"Success-N-Life\", buying airtime on independent television stations primarily serving inner-city areas. The new version of \"Success-N-Life\" returned to Tilton's previous message of asking for \"vows of faith\" from viewers instead of exorcisms. In 1998, the program began airing on Black Entertainment Television (BET) as part of the two-hour late night umbrella rotation block of religious programming entitled \"BET Inspiration\". In 2008, \"Success-N-Life\" usually occupied the first hour of the programming block and also ran on The Word Network. Most of the episodes of \"Success-N-Life\" shown on \"BET Inspiration\" were taped in the late 1990s—with testimonials from 1980s-era episodes interspersed throughout the episodes—but Tilton also recorded infomercials for his books at least once a year from 2003 to 2007, often appearing with his third wife, Maria Rodriguez, and their four French poodles. These infomercials also appeared under the title of \"Success-N-Life\" on \"BET Inspiration\".\n\nThe Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center was finally formally dissolved by Tilton in 1996. Though Tilton was still listed as the church's senior pastor, he had not preached at the church since March 16, 1996, when he named Chattanooga, Tennessee, minister Bob Wright as senior associate pastor, and its membership had declined to less than 300. The church building was purchased by the city of Farmers Branch in 1999 for use as a future civic center; however, the economy suffered a downturn and the plans were scrapped, and the building was finally demolished in 2003 to make room for a new Dallas Stars-sponsored youth hockey center.\n\nIn March 2005, Tilton started a new church in Hallandale, Florida, not far from his home in Miami Beach. The church had already existed for some time under the pastorship of former televangelist David Epley. Tilton's new church, now called \"Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church\", had approximately 200 members in 2007. On May 13, 2007, the church moved into a new location in Miami and was officially renamed \"Word of Faith Church\", much like his original church in Dallas. Tilton also established a church in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2005, also originally named Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church. It has also been officially renamed \"Word of Faith Church\". The Las Vegas church's resident pastor is Natalie Vafai.\n\nWhen Tilton returned to television in 1997, he established his ministry's headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where his lawyer J. C. Joyce's offices were located, and set up a post office box as its mailing address. A woman employed by Mail Services, Inc., a Tulsa-area clearinghouse that handled mail sent to Tilton's ministry, said that when she worked for Mail Services, Inc. in 2001, prayer requests were still routinely thrown away after donations and pledges were removed. However, Tilton dropped the Tulsa address in late 2007 and used a Miami Post Office box to receive responses to his fundraising mailings. In January 2014, Tilton is currently holding services at the Courtyard Marriott in Culver City, California, while having donations again sent to a post office box in Tulsa.\n\nIn 1998, \"The Washington Post\" reported that Tilton's following disappeared after the investigations but he had \"joined dozens of other preachers to become fixtures on BET\". Consequently, Tilton, along with Don Stewart and Peter Popoff received \"criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community.\"\n\nSteve Lumbley, who worked for Tilton's ministry in 1991 when the original \"Primetime Live\" investigation took place, told a reporter for the \"Dallas Observer\" in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the 1991 \"Primetime Live\" exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the dallasobserver.com blog \"Unfair Park\", Lumbley asserted that \"[t]he mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and I can guarantee you that was not a normal practice.\" However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that \"God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down.\"\n\nThe Trinity Foundation still monitors Tilton's television ministry as part of Trinity's ongoing televangelist watchdog efforts. In a 2003 interview published in \"Tulsa World\", Ole Anthony estimated that with none of the Word of Faith Family Church overhead and with television production costs at a fraction of the original \"Success-N-Life\" program, Tilton's current organization was likely grossing more than $24 million per year tax-free.\n\nIn 1985, two men began distributing a video they compiled lampooning Tilton and his ostensible conversations with God. The video exploits Tilton's facial expressions and preaching style. The original video contained no title screen and was roughly edited. The video featured a medley of footage from \"Success-N-Life\" overdubbed with well-timed sound effects of flatulence. Unofficial VHS copies of the video circulated in the United States through the late 1980s under such titles as \"Tooting Tilton\", \"Heaven Only Knows\" (the first title by the original distributors), \"Pastor Gas\", \"The Joyful Noise\", and \"The Farting Preacher\". After the hosts of \"The Mark & Brian Show\", a radio program in Los Angeles, mentioned the video on the air, the video's authors saw the market potential and began selling official copies of their creation. Similar videos have since been made with more recent footage of Tilton and are distributed throughout the Internet, all under the \"Farting Preacher\" name. The video distribution (including digital bootlegs distributed online) expanded public awareness of Tilton and his controversial television ministry.\n\nThe song \"I Know\" on the Barenaked Ladies' 1996 album \"Born on a Pirate Ship\" includes the lines \"If a hundred monkeys each could get their own show / perhaps one day a chimp might say:\n\nThe musician Pogo created the song, \"Hoo Ba Ba Kanda\" using the sounds and words of Tilton from his \"Life-N-Success\" program.\n\nThe comedy material of Ron White also includes mention of Tilton. In the opening to White's act in the first \"Blue Collar Comedy Tour\" movie, Ron claims that \"while sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos\", he finds Tilton on TV and believes Tilton is talking specifically to him: \"Are you lonely?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Have you wasted half your life in bars pursuing sins of the flesh?\" \"This guy's good...\" \"Are you sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos?\" Ron gapes in horror before squeaking, \"...Yes sir!\" \"Do you feel the urge to get up and send me a thousand dollars?\" (pause for effect) \"Close! I thought he was talking about \"me\" there for a second. Apparently, I ain't the only cat on the block (who) digs Cheetos!\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Trinity Foundation put together a number of news broadcasts, including the initial \"Primetime Live\" piece, from the years surrounding the investigations into Tilton's ministry on a DVD entitled \"The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed\". The DVD also includes segments from \"The Daily Show's\" \"God Stuff\" (hosted by Trinity Foundation member John Bloom, a.k.a. Joe Bob Briggs), excerpts from the \"Pastor Gas\" videos, and a number of mocking music videos, as well as moments from \"Success-N-Life\" showing Tilton's more outrageous claims of \"visions from God.\"\n\nA comedian on BET's \"ComicView\" once made fun of \"Success-N-Life\", mainly because BET usually aired it immediately following their explicit music video show \"\". \n\nThe name \"Tilton\" is referred to in the song \"Cash Cow (A Rock Opera In Three Small Acts)\", from the album called \"Squint\" by music artist and film director Steve Taylor, where it says:\n\nTilton's antics are also lampooned in the area of software technology by Douglas Crockford. Crockford created \"The Tilton Macro Preprocessor\", which he describes as \"one of the ugliest programming languages ever conceived\".\n\nBruce Prichard, who portrayed Brother Love in the WWE, has stated that the character was largely based on Tilton's way of speaking.\n\nThe comedian and satirist John Oliver criticized Tilton's televangelism ministry as fraudulent on his nationwide television program \"Last Week Tonight\" on August 17, 2015. Oliver and his team had corresponded with Tilton's Faith Worldwide Church for seven months; it began when a $20 donation was sent to the organization. Oliver explained what happened during those months: the organization sent a letter back with a $1 bill asking Oliver to \"send it back\" with more offerings, leading to a slew of appeals for further donations with nothing substantive in return, according to an account in the \"Christian Post\":\n\nOliver set up his own \"televangelism\" megachurch on his broadcast, which he called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption.\n"}

{"id": "38449730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38449730", "title": "Sutram", "text": "Sutram\n\nThe dictionary gives the meaning of the Sanskrit or Tamil expression, Sutram (सूत्रम्) or Sutra (सूत्र), as string or thread, formula, short sentence or aphoristic rule, girdle, stroke, yarn or plan. Unique to Sanskrit literature, Tamil literature and Pali literature of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, they are short cryptic sentences, methodically written as memory-aids, stringing step by step a particular topic or text in its entirety. There are hundreds of Sanskrit texts found written in the Sutra-format such as \"Kapila Sutram\", \"Samkhya-pravachana Sutram\", \"Brahma Sutra\", \"Jaimini Sutram\", \"Tatvartha Sutram\", \"Kalpa Sutra\", etc.\n\nShatapatha Brahmana defines \"Sutram\" as the sacred thread (SB XII.ii.3), the sacred thread belonging to the first-class Brahmins (SB V.x.16), the power to act (SB XI.iii.37), the \"sutra-tattva\" (SB XI.xxviii.16), the \"mahat-tattva\" distinguished by the power of action (SB XI.ix.19), the function of \"Pradhana\" or the subtle cause of material nature (SB XI.xii.19), or the first transformation of nature (Prakrti), endowed with the potency of activity (SB XI.xxiv.6). Thus, it is the sacred thread that is worn by the twice-born i.e. the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas, signifying their initiation, which initiation gives them the opening or the right and the power to act in accordance with their respective dharmas; it constantly reminds them of their obligatory duties. It is also the thread that runs through, binds and activates the stages of transformation from the Avyakta (the Undefined) to the Vyakta (the Defined).\n\nThere are four main divisions of Kalpa: Shrauta Sutram, Grihya Sutram, Dharma Sutram and Kalpa Sutram, and three subordinate divisions: \"Kaushika Sutram\", \"Vaitana Sutram\" and \"Shulba Sutram\". Kalpa represents the principle of transformation-transformation of point values, taking into consideration the totality of expression.\nSutram, also known as Sutratman, is the Suksmasariram comprising the vijnanamayakosha, manomayakosha and pranomayakosha; Prana (\"vital breath\"), Manas (\"mind\") and \"understanding\", these three sheaths have the nature of Sutratman. Sutram is an adjunct of Hiranyagarbha who is the origin of Viraj, the gross material constituting the world. \"Vijnanam\" is Sutram, and even though Sutram preceded Viraj as the cause of Viraj there is no difference between these two, for when there is no product i.e. Viraj, Sutram has the compact form of \"Prajnanaghanarupa\" (intelligence), it then reverts to its true undefined state.\n\nIn the Buddhist lexicon emphasis is on the meanings of the Sutras, the Sutras of the teaching of \"Aksayamati\" explain that the sutras of expedient meaning are those that teach seeming reality. The sutras of definitive meaning are those that are taught in order to reveal the ultimate reality. The former assist entry on to the path, deal with the seeming, afflicted by phenomena, how to engage in proper actions, cause weariness with cyclic existence, teach variety of terms and definitions, give detailed explanations about the sentient beings, self, etc.. The latter guide disciples to engage in fruition, teaches about purified phenomena, shows how karmas and afflictions become exhausted, demonstrate that the cyclic existence and nirvana are indifferentiable, teaches the profound true reality that is difficult to see and realize, focuses on precise and pithy instructions for cultivating meditative concentration and teaches about the three doors to liberation, non-application, non-organizing, etc..\n\nSri Aurobindo had said that the fundamental necessity of our embodied life is to seek infinite creativity on a finite basis, therefore, according to the Theosophists death is a transformative experience. Sutratman, the spiritual thread, thread of life, is the Monad, the golden thread of the transcendent contexts on which all the immanent incarnate of each individual human are strung like pearls on a thread.\n\nThe subtle principle of life is that thread whereon this life and the next life and all beings are strung (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad III.vii.2). Vayu is also known as Sutratman and Sutratman is \"svatahsiddha\" i.e. self-established. It is through Vak (speech) a devotee attains the nature of Sutratman (Saptanna Brahmana verse 329). Viraj is described as the god marked by spatial directions, etc., who wears a body consisting of the five elements and who arises in/from the notion- \"I am everything\", before that it was Sutratman.\n\nThe Sun is identified with the Breath-spirit, and every being is connected with the Sun by a thread of Breath, the Sutratman, that is also a ray of light. The soul or God, as pervading the totality, is called Sutratman.\n"}

{"id": "196327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196327", "title": "The Forward", "text": "The Forward\n\nThe Forward (), formerly known as The Jewish Daily Forward, is an American magazine published monthly in New York City for a Jewish-American audience. Founded in 1897 as a Yiddish-language daily, in the 21st century \"The Forward\" is a digital-first publication with online reporting; in addition monthly magazines are published in both English and Yiddish. \"The Forward\"'s perspective on world and national news and its reporting on the Jewish perspective on modern United States have made it one of the most influential American Jewish publications. \"The Forward\" is published by an independent not-for-profit association. It has a politically progressive editorial focus.\n\nThe first issue of \"Forverts\" appeared on April 22, 1897, in New York City. The paper was founded by a group of about 50 Yiddish-speaking socialists who had organized three months earlier as the Forward Publishing Association. The paper's name, as well as its political orientation, was borrowed from the German Social Democratic Party and its organ \"Vorwärts\".\n\n\"Forverts\" was a successor to New York's first Yiddish-language socialist newspaper, \"Di Arbeter Tsaytung\" (The Workman's Paper), a weekly established in 1890 by the fledgling Jewish trade union movement centered in the United Hebrew Trades, as a vehicle for bringing socialist and trade unionist ideas to Yiddish-speaking immigrants, primarily from eastern Europe. This paper had been merged into a new Yiddish daily called \"Dos Abend Blatt\" (The Evening Paper) as its weekend supplement when that publication was launched in 1894 under the auspices of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). As this publication established itself, it came under increased political pressure from the de facto head of the SLP, Daniel De Leon, who attempted to maintain a rigid ideological line with respect to its content. It was this centralizing political pressure which had been the motivating factor for a new publication.\n\nChief among the dissident socialists of the Forward Publishing Association were Louis Miller and Abraham Cahan. These two founding fathers of \"The Forward\" were quick to enlist in the ranks of a new rival socialist political party founded in 1897, the Social Democratic Party of America, founded by the nationally famous leader of the 1894 American Railway Union strike, Eugene V. Debs, and Victor L. Berger, a German-speaking teacher and newspaper publisher from Milwaukee. Both joined the SDP in July 1897.\n\nDespite this political similarity, Miller and Cahan differed as to the political orientation of the paper and Cahan left after just four months to join the staff of \"The Commercial Advertiser,\" a well-established Republican newspaper also based in New York City.\n\nFor the next four years Cahan remained outside of \"The Forward\" office, learning the newspaper trade in a financially successful setting. He only returned, he later recalled in his memoirs, upon the promise of \"absolute full power\" over the editorial desk.\n\nThe circulation of the paper grew quickly, paralleling the rapid growth of the Yiddish speaking population of the United States. By 1912 its circulation was 120,000, and by the late 1920s/early 1930s, \"The Forward\" was a leading U.S. metropolitan daily with considerable influence and a nationwide circulation of more than 275,000 though this had dropped to 170,000 by 1939 as a result of changes in U.S. immigration policy that restricted the immigration of Jews to a trickle.\n\nEarly on, \"The Forward\" defended trade unionism and moderate, democratic socialism. The paper was a significant participant in the activities of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; Benjamin Schlesinger, a former president of the ILGWU, became the general manager of the paper in 1923, then returned to the presidency of the union in 1928. The paper was also an early supporter of David Dubinsky, Schlesinger's eventual successor.\nThe best-known writer in the \"Yiddish Forward\" was Isaac Bashevis Singer, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature. although other well known Socialist literary and political figures, such as Leon Trotsky and Morris Winchevsky, also wrote for it.\n\nBy 1962 circulation was down to 56,126 daily and 59,636 Sunday, and by 1983 the newspaper was published only once a week, with an English supplement. In 1990 the English supplement became an independent weekly which by 2000 had a circulation of 26,183, while the Yiddish weekly had a circulation of 7,000 and falling.\n\nAs the influence of the Socialist Party in both American politics and in the Jewish community waned, the paper joined the American liberal mainstream though it maintained a social democratic orientation. The English version has some standing in the Jewish community as an outlet of liberal policy analysis. For a period in the 1990s, conservatives came to the fore of the English edition of the paper, but the break from tradition didn't last. (A number of conservatives dismissed from \"The Forward\" later helped to found the modern \"New York Sun\".)\n\nThe Yiddish edition has recently enjoyed a modest increase in circulation as courses in the language have become more popular among university students; circulation has leveled out at about 5,500. Boris Sandler, one of the most significant contemporary secular writers in Yiddish, was the editor of the Yiddish \"Forward\" for 18 years, until March 2016; the new editor who succeeded him is Rukhl Schaechter.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, prior to the current format as a monthly magazine, \"The Forward\" was published as a newspaper in separate English weekly and Yiddish biweekly editions, and online daily. Each was effectively an independent publication with its own contents. Jane Eisner became the first female editor in chief of the English \"Forward\" in June 2008. The previous editor in chief was J.J. Goldberg, who served from 2000 to 2007; since that time he has been editor at large. The paper maintains a left of center editorial stance.\n\nIn August 2015, \"The Forward\" received wide attention for reporting from Iran at a charged moment in American politics, as the U.S. Congress was ramping up to a vote on an accord reached the month before to limit Tehran's nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Assistant Managing Editor Larry Cohler-Esses was, in the words of \"The New York Times\", \"The first journalist from an American Jewish pro-Israel publication to be given an Iranian visa since 1979.\"\n\nFor a few years, there was also a Russian edition. The website of \"The Forward\" describes its formation: \"In the fall of 1995 a Russian-language edition of the Forward was launched, under the editorship of Vladimir \"Velvl\" Yedidowich. The decision to launch a Russian Forward in the crowded market of Russian-language journalism in New York followed approaches to the Forward Association by a number of intellectual leaders in the fast-growing émigré community who expressed an interest in adding a voice that was strongly Jewish, yet with a secular, social-democratic orientation and an appreciation for the cultural dimension of Jewish life.\"\n\nThe Russian edition was sold to RAJI (Russian American Jews for Israel) in 2004, although initially it kept the name. In contrast to its English counterpart, the Russian edition and its readership were more sympathetic to right-wing voices. In March 2007, it was renamed the \"Forum\".\n\nAround the same time in 2004, the Forward Association also sold off its interest in WEVD to The Walt Disney Company's sports division, ESPN.\n\nThe name of the publication was shortened to \"The Forward\" in April 2015.\n\nAs of July 2016 the Forward began publishing a monthly magazine. The last newspaper published was the June 30, 2016 issue.\n\nFor 24 years, \"The Forward\" was the home of the column \"Philologos\". It now runs in \"Mosaic\".\n\nAt the peak of its popularity, the Forward erected a ten-story office building at 175 East Broadway on the Lower East Side, designed by architect George Boehm and completed in 1912. It was a prime location, across the street from Seward Park. The building was embellished with marble columns and panels and stained glass windows. The facade features carved bas relief portraits of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels (who co-authored, with Marx, \"The Communist Manifesto\"), and Ferdinand Lassalle, founder of the first mass German labor party. A fourth relief portrays a person whose identity has not been clearly established, and has been identified as Wilhelm Liebknecht, Karl Liebknecht, or August Bebel. In the real estate boom of the 1990s, the building was converted to condominiums.\n\nThe \"Forward 50\" is a list of fifty Jewish-Americans \"who have made a significant impact on the Jewish story in the past year\", published annually as an editorial opinion of \"The Forward\" newspaper since 1994. The list was the initiative of Seth Lipsky, founding editor of the English \"Forward\".\n\nAccording to the magazine's website, this is not a scientific study, but rather the opinion of staff members, assisted by nominations from readers. \"The Forward\" does not endorse, or support any of the individuals mentioned in the listing. The rankings are divided into different categories (which may vary from year to year): Top Picks, Politics, Activism, Religion, Community, Culture, Philanthropy, Scandals, Sports and, new in 2010, Food.\n\nThe list also includes those Jews whose impact in the past year has been dramatic and damaging.\n\n\n"}

This type of ritual cleansing is the custom for guests attending a tea ceremony or visiting the grounds of a Buddhist temple. The name originates from the verb \"tsukubau\" meaning \"to crouch\" or \"to bow down\", an act of humility. Guests attending a tea ceremony crouch and wash their hands in a tsukubai set in the tea garden before entering the tearoom.\n\nTsukubai are usually of stone, and are often provided with a small ladle, ready for use. A supply of water may be provided via a bamboo pipe called a \"kakei\".\n\nThe famous tsukubai shown here stands in the grounds of the Ryōan-ji temple in Kyoto, and was donated by the feudal lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni. The kanji written on the surface of the stone are without significance when read alone. If each is read in combination with 口 (kuchi) - the shape of the central bowl - then the characters become 吾, 唯, 足, 知 which translates literally as \"I only know plenty\" (吾 = ware = I, 唯 = tada = only, 足 = taru = plenty, 知 = shiru = know). The underlying meaning, variously translated as \"what one has is all one needs\", or \"learn only to be content\" reflects the basic anti-materialistic teachings of Buddhism.\n\n"}

{"id": "37132259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37132259", "title": "Ya`fūr", "text": "Ya`fūr\n\nYa`fūr (also variously rendered as Ya'foor, Ya'four, `Ufayr, `Ofayr and so on, meaning \"Deer\" in Arabic) was a donkey used as a mount by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who was said to have often ridden it bareback. There are many tales of this donkey but the most common would be that the donkey is recorded to have been a gift from the Byzantine governor of Egypt some time between 628 and 632 AD (8–11 AH). According to an Islamic tradition, it had the power of speech and told Muhammad that it was the last of a line of donkeys ridden by prophets and was a descendant of the donkey ridden by Jesus in his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which was also called Ya`fūr. The tradition holds that Ya`fūr committed suicide in despair after Muhammad died by throwing itself into a well, though these accounts are held to be unreliable in hadith studies. In the centuries after Muhammad's death, the donkey's name and symbolism was repeatedly adopted by Islamic religious figures and rulers.\n\nYa`fūr was one of several animals that Muhammad rode; the others included a roan horse called \"Murtajaz\" (\"Spontaneous\"), a black horse called \"Sakb\" (\"Swift\"), a mule called \"Duldul\" (\"Vacillating\") and a camel called \"Kaswa\" (\"Split-Ears\"), who accidentally killed herself when she hit her head on the stone wall of a mosque some time after his death.\n\nAccording to the \"Book of Gifts and Rarities\" (\"Kitab al-Hadaya wa'l-Tuhaf\"), an anonymous 11th century work, Ya`fūr was presented to Muhammad by al-Muqawqis, the Byzantine governor of Egypt (possibly Cyrus of Alexandria, the Patriarch of Alexandria at the time). Muhammad had sent Muqawqis a letter inviting him to convert to Islam. In return, Muqawqis sent the donkey, the mule Duldul, four slave girls, a eunuch, a horse, 1000 \"mithqals\" of gold and quantities of Egyptian goods and articles. One of the slave girls, Maria al-Qibtiyya, a Coptic Christian, was kept by Muhammad for himself and bore him a short-lived son, Ibrahim. The donkey was no mean gift either, as Egyptian donkeys were known for their beauty and were used by wealthy merchants as a means of transportation.\n\nThe donkey is the subject of a hadith (an account of the sayings and deeds of Muhammad) which holds that it had the power of speech. According to one version, Muhammad asked the donkey what its name was, to which it replied \"Yazīd bin Shihāb\". He declined to call it this, instead giving it the name of Ya`fūr (a name which, according to another Islamic tradition, was shared by the donkey ridden by Jesus during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem). The donkey is said to have declined the gift of a female companion. \n\nAnother account holds that it was the donkey that spoke first to Muhammad, telling him that it had formerly been owned by a Jew. It had been uncooperative with its previous owner, deliberately stumbling so as to make him fall off, and was often punished by having its food withheld and being beaten. According to the donkey's own account, it was the last of sixty generations of donkeys which had been used by prophets (including Jesus, Ezra and Balaam) as riding animals. The donkey was said to have told Muhammad that he was \"the last of his lineage, for Muhammad was the last of the prophets, and that he had been waiting for him and had allowed no one else to mount him.\"\n\nMuhammad was also said to have used Ya`fūr as a messenger, sending it to fetch supplies from merchants at whose doors it knocked using its head. The donkey would give the merchant a token telling him to love or to respond to the Prophet of God. When Muhammad died, the grief-stricken donkey was said to have committed suicide by throwing itself down the well of Abū 'l-Haytham bin at-Tayyihān.\n\nAn alternative hadith transmitted in Syria holds that Ya`fūr's colour was black rather than sandy, that its previous name was 'Amr rather than Yazīd or Ziyād, and that it was the last of seven siblings ridden by prophets, rather than being the last of a line of sixty donkeys. \n\nThese accounts, however, are regarded in hadith studies as being untruthful and their chain of attribution or \"isnād\" is seen as dubious. The 12th century historian Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi is quoted as saying, \"May God curse the fabricator of this tradition!\" Ibn Hibban considered it weak on the grounds of the source, Muhammad bin Mazyad, being unreliable.\n\nFollowers of Shia Islam believed that the Mahdi, the prophesied redeemer of Islam, would make his appearance in the company of Ya`fūr the donkey and Duldul the mule. In one uprising, a grey mule representing Duldul was paraded with a chair on its back for the Mahdi. In the lands where Sunni Islam was practised, Ya`fūr was repeatedly invoked in political and religious events for centuries after Muhammad's death. A \"false prophet\" active in Yemen in the 7th century usurped one of Muhammad's own epithets, calling himself (or being called) the \"Sahib al-Himar\", the \"Master of the Ass\". Likewise the 8th century Umayyad caliph Marwan II was nicknamed \"al-Himar\", \"the Ass\". The early Fatimid Caliphate was nearly overthrown in the 10th century by the rebel Abu Yazid, known as the \"Man on the Donkey\", while in Morocco the 12th century founder of the Almohad movement, Ibn Tumart, insisted on riding a donkey.\n\nIn the wider context, the story of Muhammad's donkey can be seen in the light of such animals being seen as religiously significant in the Near and Middle East for thousands of years. Donkeys and asses were held by the ancient Israelites to have a special connection with the spirit world. This is illustrated in the story of Balaam and the angel in the Book of Numbers, in which the prophet's donkey sees an otherwise invisible angel and miraculously gains the power of speech. Samson, too, draws on the mystical power of the donkey by using an ass's jawbone – symbolic of the power of the donkey's voice – to slay a thousand Philistines, while asses and donkeys were integral to the stories of Jesus and David. \n\nA traditional connection between prophets and donkeys also existed in pre-Islamic Arabia, where seers (known as \"kahins\") were often associated with asses. Muhammad's arrival was said to have been prophesied by a Jew who spoke of \"a man neither short nor tall, wrapped in a cloak, and riding an ass.\" The evil anti-Messiah al-Dajjal is also expected to appear on a giant white donkey, while Muhammad himself is widely reported to have warned of the infernal nature of a donkey's voice: \"When you hear the bray of an ass, seek refuge with God from the devil.\"\n"}

There are nine known pieces of the Yama Zatdaw in Myanmar. The Burmese name for the story itself is \"Yamayana\", while \"zatdaw\" refers to the acted play or being part of jataka tales of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe Yama Zatdaw was introduced by oral tradition during King Anawratha's reign although it was not known clearly whether the story was Valmiki’s Sanskrit epic Ramayana or not. In the Nathlaung Temple, the Visnu temple, within the walls of old city Bagan, there are some stone sculptures, one of which is Ramachandra. Based on Burmese literature, at least, Hanuman has been known in Burma definitely before 1527 AD.\n\nThe Burmese Ramayana was influenced greatly by Ayutthaya Kingdom, during which various Konbaung Dynasty kings invaded the kingdom. The invasions often brought back spoils of war, including elements of Ramakien (Thai version of Ramayana) into the epic. Rama sā-khyan, one of the well known literature in Burma, is believed to be composed in 1775 by U Aung Phyo which begins with Bala kanda and ends at Yudha kanda as in Valmiki's Ramayana. There are also important Burmese literature and classical music related to the Ramayana which were developed in that era such as U Toe's \"Yama yakan\" (Rama's song, and \"Thida yakan\" (Sita's song, ), both written in 1784; \"Yama pyazat\" (Ramayana ballet, ) in 1789; and \"Kalay Yama wuthtu\" (Young Rama's life, ) in 1800. \n\nThe ethnic Mon adaptation of Ramayana is known as \"Loik Samoing Ram\" which was written in 1834 AD by a Buddhist monk named Uttama. It is evident that \"Loik Samoing Ram\" is mainly derived from Burmese version as the author of the Mon version stated in his preface that due to the popularity of Burmese version in the capital. However, Mon version also exhibits the connections with Thai, Javanese and Malayan versions and has own unique episodes, not found in Thai, Burmese or Malayan versions.\n\nThe characters of Yama Zatdaw share the same features and characteristics as those in the original story. However, in acting, the costumes are a mixture of Bamar and Thai elements. The names of the characters, in general, are Burmese transliterations of the Sanskrit names. \n\n\n"}
