Dagobert frequently visited the monastery to hunt. The monastery later became an abbey and a royal foundation named after Saint Cyran. It kept Saint Cyran's relics, as well as those of saints Génitour, Sylvain and Fructueux, all of which were later re-housed in 1860 in a bronze reliquary.\n\nIn 1620 Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, who introduced Jansenism into France, became the abbey's commendatory abbot. Opposed to the Jesuits, he fell into disgrace under Cardinal Richelieu and was imprisoned. The abbey suffered from its association with his fall. It was officially suppressed in 1712 and destroyed on the orders of the archbishop of Bourges. The abbey's monks scattered and its goods were sold in 1739. The buildings were sold as state property in 1790, and all that remains of the main abbey buildings is the 15th-century \"chambre des hôtes\". Some of its granges, stables and mills also survive. A few decades after 1790 Moulins de Paris bought it and later turned it into holiday homes for its employees.\n\nThe abbey was converted to have a more varied frontage. In June 1975 it was bought by Marcel Lefebvre's sister, who renamed it Saint-Michel Abbey and used it to house the sisters of the Society of St. Pius X. It protected Paul Touvier, fleeing from charges of crimes against humanity, until the police seized his baggage there on May 21, 1989.\n"}

Within this range of senses, \"abhiṣeka\" is common to Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nAn abhiṣeka is conducted by priests by pouring libations on the image of the deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of mantras. Usually, offerings such as milk, yogurt, ghee, honey, panchamrita, sesame oil, rose water, sandalwood paste may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed. This rite is routinely performed in some Hindu and Jain temples.\n\nA \"Rudrābhiṣeka\" or abhiṣeka of Rudra is performed on lingams.\n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism, an abhiṣeka can be a method for performing pointing-out instructions, a way to offer blessings of a lineage to participants, or it can be an empowerment to begin a particular meditation practice. This ritual is present in Tibetan Buddhism as well as in Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and in Shingon Buddhism.\n\nThe abhiṣeka was originally used as a consecration rite. Water from the four oceans was poured out of golden jars onto the head of royalty. It was used during a monarch's accession ceremony and also his investiture ceremony.\n\nThe abhiseka rite is a prelude for initiation into mystical teaching. There are four classes of abhiseaka, each being associated with one of the four Tantras. They are \"master consecration\", \"secret consecration\", \"knowledge of prajna\", and \"the fourth consecration\".\n\nThe in Shingon Buddhism is the initiation rite used to confirm that a student of esoteric Buddhism has now graduated to a higher level of practice. The kanji used literally mean \"pouring from the peak\", which poetically describes the process of passing on the master's teachings to the student. The rite was popular in China during the Tang dynasty, and Kūkai, founder of Shingon, studied there extensively before introducing this rite to the Japanese Buddhist establishment of the time. A separate initiation rite exists for the general public called the , and symbolizes their initiation into esoteric Buddhism. This rite is generally only offered at Mount Kōya in Wakayama Prefecture in Japan, but it can be offered under qualified masters and under proper auspices outside Japan, albeit very rarely.\n\nThe Shingon rite utilizes one of the two Mandala of the Two Realms, depending on the occasion. In esoteric ritual, after the student receives the samaya precepts, the teacher of the esoteric Buddhism assumes the role of the teacher, usually Mahavairocana Buddha, while the master and student repeat specific mantras in a form of dialogue taken from esoteric Buddhist sutras. The student, who is blindfolded, then throws a flower upon the Mandala that is constructed, and where it lands (i.e. which deity) helps dictate where the student should focus his devotion on the esoteric path. From there, the student's blindfold is removed and a vajra is placed in hand.\n\n\"Abhisheka\" in Jainism means the ritual of consecration of the image of Jina.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It reached the point of offering classes K through 10th grade. The building survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and was the site of a clinic during the relief effort.\n\nThe Anís Zunúzí Bahá'í School (Ecole Bahá'íe Anís Zunúzí), named for the companion who suffered execution with the Báb, began classes in 1980 and grew into a K-9 primary and secondary school, serving 232 students by 1983, 270 by 1988. For a time the secondary school program was closed to focus on K-4th primary school offerings. The secondary program re-opened in September 2004 and has added one class per year since then and by 2009 the school was a K-10 school (intending on becoming a full high school and offering national exams.) Its initial funding and operating budget for years came from the business income of a Belgian Bahá'í family, Pari Hosseinpour and Hassan-Ali Kamran. The student population comes mostly from no- to low-income families, and most students are only paying minimal or no fees to attend the school. It follows the national curriculum but also provides moral education and English classes. It is situated on about three acres of land in what has become a suburb several miles north east of Port-au-Prince proper (and a few miles north west of Croix-des-Bouquets.)\n\nWhen the school was established, the area was rural and underdeveloped. A 220 V power line was brought in from Bon Repos to provide the school with electricity, and the first telephone line reached the school only in 1989. An artesian well was drilled and provided drinking water to the school as well as to the public through a pipe ending at a fountain at the Bon Repos-Beudet road. In October 1982 Rúhíyyih Khanum, a Hand of the Cause, a position of prominence in the Bahá'í Faith, presided at the official inauguration ceremony for the school. The initial board of directors were Counsellor Farzam Arbab, Dr. Nabil Hanna, Benjamin Levy, Dr. Iraj Majzub and Georges Marcellus. The first school principal came from Germany in 1980 (Hans J Thimm, later of Union School, Haiti.). Current directors are Sue and Yves Puzo.\n\nThe area has been built up with private homes and businesses and the school has been broken into twice forcing security infrastructure additions. The arable land in the vicinity of the school is no longer being worked due to lack of water and lack of initiative on the part of the youth who prefer to find other means of employment that are easier or more lucrative.The Mona Foundation has supported the school with funding for support of satellite schools, scholarships, regular summer camps, and general funding as well as acting as a mediator of larger scale funding for infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe program at the school involves:\n\nThe school has acted as a base of a number of development projects:\n\nThe school has a Facebook presence.

A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. The group has since organized under the name \"Love for Haiti\"; it had organized spontaneously, largely through Facebook. The group gave a presentation on their Haiti experience at St. Matthews Parish Hall in Hoboken, NJ on Feb. 18, and returned to Haiti in March. The group included one photo journalist.\n\n\n"}

The Bahá'í Faith arrived in Shanghai in 1862 and Hong Kong in 1870 but not in Macau until 1953.\n\nIn 1953, along with other remaining parts of the globe where no Bahá'ís resided, Macau became a particular goal for expatriate Baha'is to locate. On October 20, 1953, Mrs. Frances Heller, a Bahá'í from California moved there to reside.\nBy 1954 there were four Bahá'ís in Macau – all expatriates – but they formed a cohesive group and became designated as a Bahá'í Group. \n\nOn July 15, 1954 the first resident of Macau declared his belief in Bahá'u'lláh after studying this system of belief for five months—Mr. Harry P.F. Yim (Yen Pei-feng or Yim Pui Fung), a small-business proprietor from Canton (Guangzhou), China. In October 1954 the second Macanese, Mr. Paul Kao became a Bahá'í. In that year, Mr. Manuel Ferreira, became the first Portuguese to become a Bahá'í in Macau.\n\nBy April 21, 1958 there were enough Baha’is so that Macau could elect its first Local Spiritual Assembly. In 1960 the first all-Chinese Local Spiritual Assembly was elected. \n\nIn the 1970s more pioneers arrived to continue to lay the foundation of the Bahá'í community in Macau and to expand its presence to the nearby islands of Taipa and Coloane. By 1973, there were eighteen believers spread out in three localities, the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane. Later the membership climbed to 32.\n\nIn March 1974, mainly due to teaching efforts of several pioneers and travel teachers from places such as Malaysia, the Bahá'í membership climbed to 36 adults with eleven youth. A few months later reports showed 47 adult Bahá'ís and twelve youth in the three areas of Macau. A later statistical report, indicated there were 68 Bahá'ís, including nineteen youth.\n\nIn the years since the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Macau in 1989, the Macau Bahá'í community continued to expand, and in the \"2009 Macau Yearbook\" their numbers are listed as 2,500, with three Local Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nAdministratively, in the early 1950s Macau was under the jurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, but after the National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia was elected in 1957 they were administered by that body. \n\nIn April 1974 the National Spiritual Assembly of Hong Kong was elected with Macau included in its jurisdiction. Two residents of Macau were elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1982 the Local Spiritual Assembly of Macau (peninsular) was granted certification by the government which was equivalent to its recognition as an incorporated charitable body.\n\nIn 1989 the number of Bahá'ís in Macau was such that, together with its status as a distinct territory, The Universal House of Justice gave permission for Macau to elect its own National Spiritual Assembly. It was the third National Spiritual Assembly in Chinese territory. Taiwan was the first, in 1967, with Hong Kong the second.\n\nDespite the agreement to transfer the sovereignty of Macau to the People's Republic of China in 1999 and its designation as a special administrative region (SAR) of China, the position of the Bahá'í Faith in Macau - its administration, membership and communities - in the context of local laws has remained unchanged. The \"National\" Spiritual Assembly is now referred to as the “Spiritual Assembly” or “Main Spiritual Assembly” in Chinese and still retains jurisdiction over the Local Spiritual Assemblies in Macau. \n\nThe Local Spiritual Assemblies of the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane are elected respectively once a year. The nine members of each Local Spiritual Assembly are elected from the generality of Bahá'í residents of the community through secret votes in a form of non-partisan democracy. Electioneering of any sort, candidacy and other tactics common in most political elections is prohibited. \n\nThe [Main] Spiritual Assembly of Macau is elected in a two-stage process. In the first stage, the entire Bahá'í population is divided into 19 electoral units, and each unit elects a delegate from the adult Bahá'ís residing within its electoral unit. The 19 delegates elect the nine members of the [Main] Spiritual Assembly at the annual National Convention. \n\nLike numerous communities around the world, the Macau Bahá'í Community is heavily engaged in community-building activities in Macau: “meetings that strengthen the devotional character of the community; classes that nurture the tender hearts and minds of children; groups that channel the surging energies of junior youth; circles of study, open to all, that enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on equal footing and explore the application of the teachings to their individual and collective lives. “ [ Ref: Universal House of Justice, “To the Bahá'ís of the World” Ridvan 2010) \n\nBahá’ís all around the world as well as in Macau have adopted an education and training program which caters to the spiritual needs of its participants and is arranged for different age groups as follows:\nAges 5 – 7: Children’s spiritual education classes Grade 1; \nAges 8 – 11: Children’s spiritual education classes Grade 2; \nAges 12 – 14: Junior youth spiritual empowerment program; \nAges 15 and onwards: A sequence of 8 courses\n\nThe above systematic sequence of training courses is able to develop in participants a meaningful spiritual life and enable them, in various ways, to serve society. The above programs are usually delivered in the participants’ homes in small groups. An individual need not be a Bahá’í to take these courses.\n\nIn public articles and briefings the Bahá'í Faith is recognized as one of the five major religions of the Macau SAR and was included in religious delegations to mainland China.\n\nIn 1988, the School of the Nations - a Bahá'í-inspired school in Taipa - was established. It is owned by the Badi Foundation. As an international school, it provides an internationally oriented English-medium educational program to meet the needs of both expatriate and local families. Like many other initiatives around the world, both the Badi Foundation and the School of the Nations’ efforts are examples of endeavors to translate some of the ideals and concepts of the Bahá'í Faith into actions that are of benefit to society at large.\n\nIn recent years, New Millennium Publications, based in Macau, was established and makes more and more literature on the Bahá’í Faith in Chinese available to Chinese readers.\n\nSince there is no administrative structure for the Bahá'í Faith in mainland China at present, the Macau Bahá'í Community, together with the Hong Kong Bahá'í Community, frequently act as liaison and contact points with the relevant government agencies of the People's Republic of China. \n\nThe Macau Bahá'í Community has been involved with exchanges, conferences and events with government, academics, and non-governmental organizations that explore and share the application of the Bahá'í teachings to the advancement of society.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive timeline of some of the recent activities of the Macau Bahá'í Community involving various institutions and government agencies of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other topics she has written about are religion, cultural anthropology, spirituality, and mythology from the viewpoint of pre-Indo-European neolithic matriarchies.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Walker authored several volumes of knitting references which have become landmarks for their comprehensiveness and clarity. Her Knitting Treasury series documents over a thousand different knitting stitches. Other books considered mosaic knitting, for producing multicolored designs while knitting only one color per row, and constructing knitted garments from the top down rather than the usual bottom-up method used in Western knitting tradition. Most of Walker's best-known knitting books have been reprinted, and starting in the mid-1990s, she has published new knitting books.\n\nWalker writes about the problems with mainstream religion and how these problems have contributed to patriarchal societies and sexism. In \"The Skeptical Feminist: Discovering the Virgin, Mother, and Crone\", she writes about her belief that there is no god. However, she believes that people, and women in particular, can use the image of the goddess in their day-to-day lives. Walker often uses the imagery of the Mother Goddess to discuss neolithic matriarchies. Her book \"Woman's Rituals: A Sourcebook\" is an attempt to show how she puts her \"meditation techniques\" into practice, and is meant as a guide for other women who wish to do the same.\n\n\"The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets\" has been criticized for being based on the idea of the \"Great Mother\" by male writers like Robert Graves and Erich Neumann, and for rewriting myths so they would support the theory of a \"Great Goddess\".\n\nWalker studied journalism at the University of Pennsylvania, then worked for the \"Washington Star\" in Washington, D.C. While serving on a local hotline helping battered women and pregnant teens in the mid-1970s, she became interested in feminism.

They traditionally inhabit the coastal districts of Karnataka and also the neighbouring areas of Kasaragod\nand Kodagu. They are considered to have been the ruling military class and administrative elite landed gentry of the cultural region of Tulu Nadu, the Bunts today are a largely urbanised community.\n\nThe word \"Bunt\" means \"powerful man\" or \"warrior\" in the Kannada and Tulu language.\n\nThe word \"Nadava\" is a synonym for the Bunts used in the northern region of the erstwhile South Canara district.\n\nAmerican anthropologist Sylvia Vatuk states that the Bunt-Nadava community was a loosely defined social group. The matrilineal kin groups that constituted the caste were linguistically, geographically and economically diverse which were united by their arrogation of aristocratic status and power. The Bunts living in the northern parts of Canara speak the Kannada language while the majority living in the south speak Tulu. The Bunts follow a matrilineal system of inheritance called Aliyasantana. They have 93 clan names or surnames and are divided into 53 matrilineal septs called Bari. Members of the same bari did not intermarry. According to S. D. L. Alagodi, the Bunts \"originally belonged to the warrior class. Being the martial race of Tulu Nadu, they served the ruling chiefs which brought them considerable benefits and allowed them to become the landowners and nobles of the region.\"\n\nSome Bunt clans claim descent from the ancient Alupa dynasty (circa 2nd century C.E. - 15th century C.E.) . Historian P. Gururaja Bhat mentions that the Alupa royal family were of local origin possibly belonging to the Bunt-Nadava caste. The title Alupa (Alva) survives till this day among the Bunts according to historian Bhaskar Anand Saletore. Some ruling and feudal clans of North Kerala adjacent to Tulu Nadu were also likely descended from Bunt-Nadavas. Indian anthropologist Ayinapalli Aiyappan states that a powerful and warlike clan of the Bunts was called \"Kola Bari\" and the Kolathiri Raja of Kolathunadu was a descendant of this clan.\n\nNorwegian anthropologist Harald Tambs-Lyche, states that the Bunts were warriors of the Jain kingdoms. Jainism gained a foothold in the Canara region during the rule of the Hoysala dynasty who were themselves Jains. The Hoysala Ballal kings are known to have appointed Bunts as military officers A section of Bunts believe that they were originally Jains who later became a caste group. A legend prevalent among the Bunts states that one of the Jain kings of the Bunts abandoned Jainism and took to eating peacock meat to cure a disease. Veerendra Heggade, the hereditary administrator of the Dharmasthala Temple has also publicly spoken about the Jain origin of the Bunts. Heggade is the current head of the Pattada Pergade family of Bunt heritage which continues to practice the Jain religion.\n\nThe concept of personal landed property existed in South Canara district from at least the 12th century and also a military tenure not very different from the feudal system of Europe. The Bunts, being a martial caste, were exempt from paying land taxes. Around the 15th century, the Bunts had consolidated themselves as a land-owning feudal caste grouping. Bunt families controlled several villages and lived in a manor house. Several villages were generally united under a single Bunt chiefdom, and the chiefdoms had considerable autonomy despite being vassals to the Jain kings. The Bunt chiefs and petty princes became virtually independent after the rise of the Nayakas of Keladi. The Haleri Rajas, who were likely a cadet branch of the Nayakas of Keladi invited Bunt families to settle in Kodagu district after establishing the Kingdom of Coorg\n\nAt the start of the 16th century, the Tuluva dynasty came to control the Vijayanagara Empire with its capital at Hampi in North Karnataka. It has been suggested by scholars Mysore Hatti Ramasharma and Mysore Hatti Gopal that the Tuluva rulers were of Bunt origin. A section of Bunts called Parivara Bunt have also traditionally claimed to be Nayaks (chieftains) of the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nThe feudal life and society of Bunt began to disintegrate in the succeeding colonial British Raj period leading to urbanisation.\n\nThe Bunts practice Hinduism and a section among them follow Jainism. Nominally all gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon are worshipped by them and festivals like Deepavali and Dusshera are celebrated. Alagodi wrote in 2006 of the Tulu Nadu population that, \"Among the Hindus, a little over ten per cent are \"brahmins\", and all the others, though nominally Hindus, are really propitiators or worshippers of tutelary deities and \"bhutas\".\" Amitav Ghosh describes the Tulu Butas as protective figures, ancestral spirits and heroes who have been assimilated to the ranks of minor deities. The cult worship of the Butas is widely practiced in Tulu Nadu by a large section of the population. The Bunts being the principal landowners of the region were the traditional patrons of the Buta Kola festival which included aspects akin to theatrical forms like Yakshagana.\n\nButas and daivas (tutelary deities) are not worshiped on a daily basis like mainstream Hindu gods. Their worship is restricted to annual ritual festivals, though daily pujas may be conducted for the ritual objects, ornaments, and other paraphernalia of the būta. Unlike with the better-known Hindu gods of the puraṇic variety, buta worship is congregational and every caste in the Tulu speaking region has it own set of butas and daivas that they worship.\n\nDepending on the significance of the people who worship them, butas or daivas can be family deities (kuṭuṃbada buta), local or village deities (jageda buta, urada buta), or deities associated with administrative units such as manorial estates (Guțțus, Beedus), groups of estates (magane), districts (sime) or even small kingdoms (royal butas or rajandaivas). The deity Jumadi is cited as an example of a Rajandaiva, i.e. a royal deity who reigns over a former small kingdom or large feudal estate. Jumadi is worshiped mainly by the rich land-owning Bunts who are the chief patrons of his cult. In the myth, as well as in the religious Buta Kola dance, Jumadi is always accompanied by his warrior attendant, called Bante, who appears to be specially related to the patrons of the Bunt caste. \"Kodamanthaye\", \"Kukkinanthaye\", \"Jaranthaye\", \"Ullaya\" and \"Ullalthi\" are some of the other deities from the royal Buta cult.\n\nMost Bunts followed a matrilineal system of inheritance and the eldest male member in the female line was the head of the family. This head of the family was called \"Yajmane\" and he would preside over the manorial court during the feudal era.\n\nThe Nadibettu Aramane house in Shirva was built in the 14th century and has copper plate inscriptions of the Vijayanagara Empire Chavadi Aramane of Nandalike, the manorial house of the \"Heggade\" chieftaincy has inscriptions from the 16th century. Suralu Aramane of the Tolaha dynasty is another house of chieftains in Udupi district; it dates from the 15th century. The Suralu Mud Palace is currently under the ownership of Sudarshan Shetty, a descendant of the Tolahas who is leading a restoration project. The Suralu Palace is a State protected Monument which was partially restored in 2016 with help from the Government of Karnataka\n\nSome other houses of the Bunts that preserve medieval architecture include the Kodial Guthu house of Mangalore. Badila Guthu in Kannur , Shetty Bettu, Puthige Guthu, Markada Guthu and Kodethur Guthu\n\nThe traditional caste council of the Bunt-Nadavas has been replaced by a body of elected members called the Buntara Yane Nadavara Mathr Sangha (Bunt or Nadava Association). It was established in 1908 in Mangalore and has been called the apex body of the Bunt community by \"The Hindu\" newspaper. Similar regional organisations operate in areas where the Bunts have migrated, such as Maharashtra, the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring Arab countries.\n\nThe Bunt association, including its regional bodies, also runs schools, colleges, hostels and dispensaries.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n"}

The religions that the Bahá'í Faith claims to be congruent appear to have contradictory teachings. For instance, their attitude toward the Abrahamic prophets (Moses, Jesus, Muhammad) and the way in which followers partake in worship vary significantly among the major religions, and social laws and attitudes vary between traditions.\n\nThe principle of universalism itself has many opponents, such as Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who claims that it not only demeans local and national traditions but also encourages widespread religious supremacy. Sacks disputes the principle of universalism on the grounds that there may not be just one truth about the essentials of the human condition. Bahá'í authors have tried to refute the criticism by claiming to promote unity in diversity.\n\nAnthropologist Fiona Bowie and author on comparative religion Karen Armstrong claim that religious ideas cannot be unified because they evolve out of primitive beliefs in animism and idolatry, ideas at odds with monotheism. Armstrong says that idol worship predates monotheism, raising the question of whether the Bahá'í ideal of unity of religion can extend to ancient beliefs and practices.\n\nChristians have been known to dismiss the Bahá'í Faith as a syncretic combination of faiths or point to discrepancies between faiths to contradict the idea of unity of religion. The Christian doctrine of atonement is commonly understood to exclude all other religions as a path to God. Regarding the Bahá'í teachings of peace and unity, Professor Browne argued that whilst they are admirable, they are, in his opinion, inferior to the simplicity and beauty of the teachings of Christ. He further argued that in the case of \"Baha'ism, with its rather vague doctrines as to the nature and destiny of the soul of man, it is a little difficult to see whence the driving force to enforce the ethical maxims can be derived.\"\n\nChristian apologist Francis J. Beckwith wrote of the Bahá'í teachings:\nBahá'í authors have attempted to address this criticism by claiming that the contradictory teachings are either social laws that change from age to age, or human error introduced to the more ancient faiths over time.\n\nStrict Muslim theology regards Muhammad as the last messenger that God has sent and Islam as the final religion for all humankind. In this view, it is impossible for either any prophet after Muhammad or any new religion to come into existence, and thus they reject the Bahá'í Faith. Some Muslims claim that the idea of oneness of humanity is not a new principle; They claim that Islam espouses such a principle. Fanatical Shīʿites have been known to picture the faith as a \"heresy\" or \"a political movement\". Many Islamic scholars reject all prophets after Muhammad, and regard Bahá'ís as apostates if they had been Muslims before conversion. Critics also argue that, despite the Bahá'í Faith's claim of unity, there are numerous theological differences between Islam and the Bahá'í Faith, with one critic, Imran Shaykh, arguing that the disparities are evidence to the Bahá'í Faith not being a natural progression of Islam, as is claimed.\n\nWhilst Bahá'í teachings assert that men and women are spiritually equal, author Lil Abdo says that the Bahá'í understanding of sexual equality is different from that of secular feminists. Abdo presented the following list of criticisms of the Bahá'í Faith from a feminist perspective at an annual gathering for Bahá'í studies in 1995:\n\nQuoting `Abdu’l-Bahā, Iranian critics claim he saw women as inferior to men. According to these critics, `Abdu’l-Bahā said: \"Although women and men share the same capacities and abilities, there is definitely no doubt that men are superior and stronger. Even in animals like pigeons, sparrows, peacocks, and other [birds] this advantage is visible,\" `Abdu’l-Bahā made the comments in light of being questioned as to why God didn't send any female prophets.\n\nAzadeh Haiati claims that whilst \"official statements from the Baha'i administration seemingly promote gender equality and the ideal of justice and equity in the world at large, Baha'i women themselves are treated with injustice\". Juan Cole notes that in 1988 the all-male House of Justice \"permanently suppressed\" an academic paper that was arguing for women to be able to serve in the UHJ. He says they insisted only men could serve.\n\nSome critics have claimed that Bahá'í leaders have tried to portray themselves as women's rights advocates in order to make their religion more appealing to modern society.\n\nAccording to Shoghi Effendi, the harmony between science and religion is an important Bahá'í principle. However, there is tension over this principle due to several instances of Bahá'í scriptures disagreeing with current scientific knowledge. Prominent among them are references by `Abdu'l-Bahá that humans evolved over a long period, but were never animals. Many Bahá'í authors have commented that the intention of the comments \"were in line with a modern understanding of evolution\" and that the apparent conflict is \"an unfortunate semantic mistake\". One Bahá'í commentator acknowledged that the comments by `Abdu'l-Bahá are not in line with current scientific understanding, but that `Abdu'l-Bahá should not be regarded as infallible in scientific matters.\n\nOther scientifically controversial ideas from Bahá'u'lláh include that the universe is without beginning or end, that every planet has \"creatures\", and that copper can turn into gold.\n\nCritics claim Bahá'u'lláh said that every star has planets, and that every planet has its own creatures. They claim that science has already \"proven the falsity of this claim\". In response, a Baha'i apologist by the name of Gary L. Mathews argued that Bahá'u'lláh's teachings explicitly stated that minerals are endowed with life. He further quotes a teaching of Bahá'u'lláh and a teaching of `Abdu'l-Bahá saying this. `Abdu'l-Bahá says this is even said in the Quran, where it supposedly says \"All things are living\". Critics however point out that this is a misquote of the Quran, which actually says, We made from water everything living . The critics further argue that in addition to this misquotation of the Quran, Mathews leaves out a part of the original quote which they argue has `Abdu'l-Bahá claim that materialists agree that every star has planets and that every planet has life. The critics summarise this by saying, \"As if distorting the Quran wasn't enough `Abdu'l-Bahá puts the burden of his lies upon the materialists\".\n\nAccording to critics, Bahá'u'lláh claimed to be God. William Miller says that the wording of the Aqdas made it difficult to distinguish between the words of the author (Bahá'u'lláh) and the words of God. He further opines that \"Bahá'u'lláh felt no such distinction was necessary\" and that \"Bahá'u'lláh claims to be not merely a human Messenger of God, but a Divine Manifestation\". Samuel Wilson writes that the fundamental assertion of the Bahá'í Faith is that Bahá'u'lláh is the incarnation of \"God the Father\". He further quotes `Abdu'l-Bahá saying, \"Thanks to Baha Ullah, we arrived safely in Liverpool.\" This supposed claim of divinity has been criticised by Imran Shaykh who points to this as an example of a discrepancy between faiths.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith espouses the need to abolish racial prejudices. Critics have claimed that comments made by `Abdu'l-Bahá are contrary to this principle, and show racial prejudice against Black Africans. For example, in \"Twelve Principles\" (2014) `Abdu'l-Bahá is quoted as saying that Africans are \"cows\" with \"human faces\". In addition he is further quoted as saying: \"The [black Africans] are like animals in human form. The [black Americans] are civilized, intelligent, and have culture. [...] what difference is there between these two types of blacks other than nurture, with one in utter ignorance and the other completely civilized?\"\n\nResponding to this, a Bahá'í blogger (Sen McGlinn) claims to directly address the criticism by arguing that the racist references are examples of `Abdu'l-Bahá describing the opinions of others and that with the context of surrounding text `Abdu'l-Bahá does not appear racist and that the writings in question are using Africans as an example of humans \"in a state of nature\" that can be improved through education.\n\nAlthough polygamy is forbidden by Bahá'í law, Bahá'u'lláh himself had three concurrent wives.\n\nBahá'u'lláh very specifically abolished the slave trade among his followers in 1874, but the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh were raised in households that included slaves and, according to Abu'l Qasim, they owned slaves in adulthood too.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith identifies itself as the fulfillment of the Bábí Faith. The separation of the two began in 1863 and was accompanied by conflict and murders.\n\nThe Bahá'í scriptures intend for a line of Guardians appointed by their predecessor - the Kitáb-i-Aqdas states that all Bahá'ís must leave a will, however Shoghi Effendi (the first guardian) broke this law and left no provision for the future administration and guidance of the faith. Due to the first Guardian leaving no appointment, the line ended.\n\nAlthough the Faith emphasizes its own unity, the Bahá'í Faith has had several challenges to leadership, resulting in the formation of breakaway factions. Claimants challenging the widely accepted successions of leadership are shunned by the majority group as Covenant-Breakers. By the time of Shoghi Effendis passing, almost every member of Bahaullahs family had been expelled from the faith.\n\nBahá'ís have been accused, particularly by successive Iranian governments, of being agents or spies of Russia, Britain, the Shah, the United States, and as agents of Zionism—each claim being linked to each regime's relevant enemy and justifying anti-Bahá'í actions. The last claim is partially rooted in the presence of the Bahá'í World Centre in northern Israel.\n\nThere has been criticism of the Bahá'í Faith that has centered on what critics see as exaggerated statements concerning numbers of believers.\n\nThe table below highlights some differences between Bahá'í-cited data and Census data.\nBahá'ís wishing to publish books about the Bahá'í Faith must first submit their work to their respective National Spiritual Assembly for approval through a review process. This process has had critics, some of whom have characterized this requirement as a form of censorship.\n\nJuan Cole refers to this process as \"mandatory prepublication censorship\" of everything Bahá'ís publish about their religion. He argues that Bahá'í leaders employ control mechanisms to \"shape the speech and behavior of Bahá'ís\". Furthermore, he says that when a group of editors proposed their idea of discontinuing censorship and having term limits for N.S.A. members, the N.S.A.'s response was to accuse the editors of engaging in \"negative campaigning\". The editors were then publicly denounced and interrogated by assembly members, who privately expressed concerns that the publication of such a document might have prevented the current members from being reelected. According to Cole, the censorship instituted by the Bahá'í Faith has led to \"intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of indepedent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers.\" He states that writers who publicly disagree with the policies of the Bahá'í institutions risk having their voting rights removed, being declared non-members and, the most serious sanction of all, being declared a \"covenant breaker\".\n\nJuan Cole was an American academic who resigned from membership in the Bahá'í Faith in 1996 after conflict with members of the Bahá'í administration, who perceived him as extreme and threatened him with a Bahá'í version of excommunication. Cole went on to critically attack the Bahá'í Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2002, describing a prominent Bahá'í as an \"inquisitor\" and \"bigot\", and describing Bahá'í institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, with financial irregularities and sexual deviance. Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion. For example, he wrote in 2002:\n"}
{"id": "13898965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13898965", "title": "Danel", "text": "Danel\n\nDanel (), father of Aqhat, was a culture hero who appears in an incomplete Ugaritic text of the fourteenth century BCE at Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), Syria, where the name is rendered , \"El is judge\". \n\nThe text in \"Corpus Tablettes Alphabétiques\" \"[CTA]\" 17–19 is often referred to as the Epic of Aqhat. Danel was depicted as \"judging the cause of the widow, adjudicating the case of the fatherless\" in the city gate. He passed through trials: his son Aqhat was destroyed but apparently in the missing conclusion was revived or replaced by Danel's patron god, Rp'u, who sits and judges with Hadad and Astarte and was likely considered to be the equivalent of El. \n\nThe text was published and translated in 1936 by Charles Virolleaud and has been extensively analysed since then.\n\nThe Book of Ezekiel in three verses (14:14. 14:20, and 28:3) writes \"Danel\", which according to the Masoretic Text should be read as \"Daniel\". This notwithstanding, parallels and contrasts with Danel (without \"i\") of the Book of Ezekiel, placed between Noah and Job and invoked as the very example of righteous judgement, first pointed out by René Dussaud in 1931, have led readers commonly to accept or occasionally to rejecta degree of identification with Ugaritic Danel of the \"Aqhat text\", amounting virtually to the same figure. The three figures referred to in  — \"Even if Noah, Danel and Job were in it...\" — links the name with two non-Israelites of great antiquity. In , Danel is one noted for his wisdom in the prophecy addressed to the king of Tyre: \"you are indeed wiser than Danel, no secret is hidden from you\". The name, \"Danel\", had a long tradition in Hebrew culture: he is supplied as the father-in-law of Enoch in \"Jubilees\".\n\nTexts in the Ugaritic language, a Canaanite tongue, may provide an important clue. The language was discovered by French archaeologists in 1928, and known only from texts found in the lost city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), Syria. Ugaritic has been used by scholars of the Old Testament to clarify Biblical Hebrew texts and has revealed ways in which ancient Israelite culture finds parallels in the neighboring cultures. Ugaritic was \"the greatest literary discovery from antiquity since the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform.\" Literary texts discovered at Ugarit include the Aqhat Epic (or Legend of Danel) — all revealing a Canaanite religion. According to Edward L. Greenstein, a distinguished professor at Bar-Ilan University, Ugaritic texts solved the biblical puzzle of the anachronism of Ezekiel mentioning Daniel at ; it is because in both Ugaritic and the Ancient Hebrew texts, it is correctly \"Danel\" -- the \"yod\" is missing in the originals.\n\nT.E. Gaston argues that there are reasons to doubt the identification of Danel with the Danel of Ezekiel. Firstly, Danel is never described as wise or righteous. Secondly, given he was a Baal-worshiper it is unlikely that a strict Yahwist like Ezekiel would have considered Danel to be righteous. Thirdly, over eight hundred years separate the Aqhat text and the book of Ezekiel, and Danel is not mentioned in any Jewish source in the intervening period.\n\nOn the other hand, it is argued that Danel would fit the pattern of being an ancient non-Israelite like Job and Noah. Ezekiel's literary arrangement may also support this position. Yahweh has compared Judah with foreign nations before () and the context appears to contain similar comparison in . The hypothetical rebellious country, while a cipher for Israel is not specifically named and could represent any ancient Near Eastern country. Ezekiel's audience is clearly enamored with non-Israelite myths (cf. Tammuz in ), and so they could easily be aware of King Danel's legendary virtues. Thus, Ezekiel's triad, if they were three ancient, righteous, non-Israelite men, would fit the pattern of Yahweh judging Israel to some degree by the nations around them. The connection is more plausible when one considers that Ezekiel alludes to Danel in an oracle against Tyre (Eze. 28), for the cultures of Ugarit and Tyre were both Canaanite. Danel also had a son and like Job, was unable to deliver him from divine harm (cf. ).\n\nThe name \"Danel\" has been given to one of the craters on Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter.\n\n"}

It is one of the 12 ranks of Imam in Alevism. The institution of dede is the most important of all the institutions integral to the social and religious organization of the Anatolian Alevis. Although much weakened as a result of the socio-economic transformation experienced in Anatolia towards the end of the nineteenth century, and particularly due to accelerated migration from the rural to the urban areas after the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, it played a primary role in the survival of Alevism until today.\n\nThe institution of dedes is based on a three tiered hierarchy:\n\nIn some regions this hierarchy is modified in such a way that the Pir and Murshid change places. This is exclusively a functional hierarchy, as all involved come from a dede family. They fulfill functions that are complementary in nature, and would be meaningless in isolation from each other. The dede families, all of them called \"ocakzâdes,\" have distributed these duties among themselves.\n\nAn Alevi dede focuses on the mystical Islamic teachings of the Twelve Imams, the Buyruks (mainly the \"Imam Câfer-i Sadık Buyruğu\") and Haji Bektash Veli.\n\nAccording to the books of the \"Buyruk\" which include the basic principles of the Alevi faith, and the traditions that survive among the Alevis, a dede must have the following qualifications:\n\n\nThe main functions of the dedes can be summarized as follows:\n\nFor Alevis, \"“Yol” (path)\" is a very important concept. The pedigrees of the \"dedes\" consistently emphasize this by saying “Yol cümleden uludur” [the Path is the most exalted of all]. What is important is the Yol and not the personal desires and needs of an individual Alevi. All the latter are possible only in conformity with the former. Otherwise, the institution of düşkün would be activated. In other words, an Alevi would become a düşkün if he tries to satisfy his desires and needs without regard for the Yol. As Prof. Yusuf Ziya Yörükan noted “Dede declares one a \"düşkün\" by saying to him \"may your face be darkened\". Any more that person is deprived of the law of men.\"\n\nThe following are major crimes that lead one to the state of düşkün:\n"}

{"id": "2243068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2243068", "title": "Divorce in Islam", "text": "Divorce in Islam\n\nDivorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are \"talaq\" (repudiation), \"khulʿ\" (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place. Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by sharia, as interpreted by traditional Islamic jurisprudence, though they differed depending on the legal school, and in general, historical practices sometimes diverged from legal theory. In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained \"within the orbit of Islamic law\", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.\n\nAccording to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, as indicated by its characterization as a \"firm bond\" and by the rules governing divorce. The relationship between the spouses should ideally be based on love (\"mawadda wa rahma\", 30:21) and important decisions concerning both spouses should be made by mutual consent. When marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows and even advises the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231), although this decision is not to be taken lightly, and the community is called upon to intervene by appointing arbiters from the two families to attempt a reconciliation (4:35). The Quran establishes two further means to avoid hasty divorces. It prescribes two waiting periods of three months before the divorce is final in order to give the husband time to reconsider his decision. Moreover, a man who takes an oath not to have sexual intercourse with his wife, which would lead to automatic divorce, is allowed a four-month period to break his oath (2:226).\n\nThe Quran substantially reformed the gender inequity of divorce practices that existed in pre-Islamic Arabia, although some patriarchical elements survived and others flourished during later centuries. Before Islam, divorce among the Arabs was governed by unwritten customary law, which varied according to region and tribe, and its observance depended on the authority of the individuals and groups involved. In this system, women were particularly vulnerable. The Quranic rules of marriage and divorce provided a fixed set of norms for all Muslims, backed by divine authority and enforced by the community. The early Islamic reforms included giving the wife a possibility to initiate divorce, abrogation of the husband's claim to his wife's property, condemnation of divorce without compelling reason, criminalizing unfounded claims of infidelity made by the husband, and institution of financial responsibilities of the husband toward his divorced wife. In pre-Islamic times, men kept their wives in a state of \"limbo\" by continually repudiating them and taking them back at will. The Quran limited the number of repudiations to three, after which the man cannot take his wife back unless she first marries another man. Additionally, the pre-Islamic bridewealth (\"mahr\"), which was paid by the groom to the bride's family, was transformed into a dower, which became property of the wife, though some scholars believe that the practice of giving at least a part of the \"mahr\" to the bride began shortly before the advent of Islam.\n\nThe subject of divorce is addressed in four different surahs of the Quran, including the general principle articulated in 2:231:\n\nClassical Islamic law is derived from the scriptural sources of Islam (Quran and hadith) using various methodologies developed by different legal schools. It was historically interpreted by jurists (\"muftis\") who were expected to give a legal opinion (\"fatwa\") free of charge in response to any query. Family disputes were handled in sharia courts presided over by a judge (\"qadi\") who had enough legal education to decide some legal questions and queried a mufti if faced with a difficult legal issue. The judges were active members of the local community and were also involved in informal arbitration, which was the preferred method of resolving disputes. In court proceedings, they mediated between the letter of the law and exigences of the local social and moral concerns, with the overarching aim of ensuring social harmony. Actual legal practice sometimes deviated from the precepts of the legal school that was dominant in the area, at times to women's benefit and at times to their disadvantage. Members of all social classes and their witnesses argued their cases in court without professional legal representation, though members of the upper class generally did so through a representative. Women were commonly involved in litigation, usually as plaintiffs, were assertive in arguing their cases, and they were often treated sympathetically by the judge. According to legal doctrine, a woman's testimony in most areas of law carried half the weight of that of a man, though available evidence suggests that practical effects of this rule were limited and the legal standing of women in pre-modern Islam was comparable to or higher than that of their European contemporaries.\n\nThe term \"talaq\" is commonly translated as \"repudiation\" or simply \"divorce\". In classical Islamic law it refers to the husband's right to dissolve the marriage by simply announcing to his wife that he repudiates her. Classical jurists variously classified pronouncement of \"talaq\" as forbidden or reprehensible unless it was motivated by a compelling cause such as impossibility of cohabitation due to irreconcilable conflict, though they did not require the husband to obtain court approval or provide a justification. The jurists imposed certain restrictions on valid repudiation. For example, the declaration must be made in clear terms; the husband must be of sound mind and not coerced. Upon talaq, the wife is entitled to the full payment of \"mahr\" if it had not already been paid. The husband is obligated to financially support her until the end of the waiting period or the delivery of her child, if she is pregnant. In addition, she has a right to child support and any past due maintenance, which Islamic law requires to be paid regularly in the course of marriage.\n\nGiving the husband a prerogative of repudiation was based on the assumption that men would have no interest in initiating a divorce without good cause, given the financial obligations it would incur. Additionally, classical jurists were of the opinion that \"the female nature is wanting in rationality and self-control\". Requiring a justification was seen as being potentially detrimental to the reputation of both spouses, since it may expose family secrets to public scrutiny.\n\nTalaq is considered in Islam to be a reprehensible means of divorce. The initial declaration of talaq is a revocable repudiation (ṭalāq rajʿah) which does not terminate the marriage. The husband can revoke the repudiation at any time during the waiting period (\"‘iddah\") which lasts three full menstrual cycles. The waiting period is intended to give the couple an opportunity for reconciliation, and also a means to ensure that the wife is not pregnant. Resumption of sexual relations automatically retracts the repudiation. The wife retains all her rights during the waiting period. The divorce becomes final when the waiting period expires. This is called a \"minor\" divorce (\"al-baynuna al-sughra\") and the couple can remarry. If the husband repudiates his wife for the third time, it triggers a \"major\" divorce (\"al-baynuna al-kubra\"), after which the couple cannot remarry without an intervening consummated marriage to another man. This is known as \"tahlil\" or \"nikah halala\". Making the third pronouncement irrevocable prevents the husband from using repeated declarations and revocations of divorce as a means of pressuring his wife into making financial concessions in order to \"purchase her freedom\". It also acts as a deterrent to rash repudiations.\n\nWomen often entered marriage with substantial capital in the form of \"mahr\" and the trousseau provided by their family, which they were not obliged to spend on family expenses, and they frequently loaned money to their husbands. Because of this, and the financial obligations incurred, talaq could be a very costly and in many cases financially ruinous enterprise for the husband. Many repudiated women used the divorce payment to buy their ex-husband's share in the family house. In the historical record talaq appears to have been less common than khul'.\n\nAvailable evidence from Mamluk Egypt indicates that talaq was not the principal means of divorce. Talaq was considered to be disastrous for the woman because it deprived her of long-term protection and financial support, preventing her from remarrying, since this would cause her to lose child custody. This led to repudiation without good reason being considered socially improper. Studies of the Ottoman Levant showed that women could invalidate a declaration of talaq by stating that the husband had shown signs of \"diminished rationality\" when he made it, while others used a husband's unrevoked declaration of talaq to obtain divorce at a later date if they could prove that he made it.\n\nTalaq types can be classified into \"talaq al-sunnah\", which is thought to be in accordance with Muhammad's teachings, and \"talaq al-bid'ah\", which are viewed as a bid'ah (innovation) deviations from it. \"Talaq al-sunnah\" is further subdivided into \"talaq al-ahsan\", which is the least disapproved form of talaq, and \"talaq al-hasan\". The \"ahsan\" talaq involves a single revocable pronouncement of divorce and sexual abstinence during the waiting period. The \"hasan\" divorce involves three pronouncements made during the wife's state of ritual purity with menstrual periods intervening between them, and no intercourse having taken place during that time.\n\nIn contrast to \"talaq al-sunnah\", \"talaq al-bid'ah\" does not observe the waiting period and irrevocably terminates the marriage. It may involve a \"triple talaq\", i.e., the declaration of talaq repeated three times, or a different formula such as \"you are \"haram\" for me\". Some legal schools held that a triple talaq performed in a single meeting constituted a \"major\" divorce, while others classified it as a \"minor\" divorce. \"Talaq al-bid'ah\" reflects pre-Islamic divorce customs rather than Quranic principles, and it is considered to be a particularly disapproved, though legally valid form of divorce in traditional Sunni jurisprudence. According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad denounced the practice of triple talaq, and the second caliph Umar punished husbands who made use of it.\n\nShiite jurisprudence does not recognize \"talaq al-bid'ah\".\n\nThe husband can delegate the right of repudiation to his wife. This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract (nikah) or during the marriage, with or without conditions. Many women included such terms in their marriage contracts. Commonly, the contract gave the wife the right to \"repudiate herself\" if the husband married a second wife. Delegated repudiation is called \"ṭalāq al-tafawud\" or \"tafwid\".\n\nKhulʿ is a contractual type of divorce that is initiated by the wife. It is justified on the authority of verse 2:228:\n\nIt is further based on a hadith in which Muhammad instructs a man to agree to his wife's wish of divorce if she gives back a garden received from him as part of her \"mahr\". A khul' is concluded when the couple agrees to a divorce in exchange for a monetary compensation paid by the wife, which cannot exceed the value of the \"mahr\" she had received, and is generally a smaller sum or involves forfeiting the still unpaid portion. Hanafis and Malikis do not require a compensation paid by the wife. The divorce is final and irrevocable, effective when the contract is concluded. The couple cannot reconcile during the waiting period, defined as in the case of talaq, but the husband is required to pay maintenance during its term, unless the requirement is waived by the contract. As in the case of \"talaq\", remarriage is possible until a khul' is concluded for a third time. If the husband pressures his wife to agree to khul' instead of pronouncing talaq, which would let him avoid attendant financial responsibilities, the divorce is considered to be invalid. Like talaq, khulʿ takes place out of court.\n\nRelative frequency of khul' has been noted in studies of Istanbul, Anatolia, Syria, Muslim Cyprus, Egypt and Palestine.\n\nIn studies of Mamluk Egypt and the Balkans under Ottoman rule, khul' was shown to have been the principal means of divorce. Women employed a number of strategies to force a settlement from their husbands. Some neglected their marital and household duties, making family life impossible for the husband. Others demanded immediate payment of the deferred mahr, knowing that the husband had no means to comply and would be jailed if he failed to do so.\n\nIn some cases the khul' contract involved no compensation from the wife, while in other cases women would waive all of their husband's financial obligations. According to studies of the Ottoman Levant, various court procedures were put in place to ensure that a khul' was not actually a talaq.\n\nA marriage can also be dissolved by means of judicial divorce. Either spouse can petition a qadi court to obtain judicial divorce, but they must have compelling grounds for dissolving the marriage. The court starts the process by appointing an arbitrator from each of their families in order to seek a mediated reconciliation. If this effort fails, the court adjudicates the dispute by apportioning fault for the breakdown of the marriage with the associated financial consequences. Examples of fault are cruelty; husband's failure to provide maintenance or pay the immediate installment of \"mahr\"; infidelity; desertion; moral or social incompatibility; certain ailments; and imprisonment harmful to the marriage. Judicial divorce can also be sought over violations of terms stipulated in the marriage contract. Different legal schools recognized different subsets of these grounds for divorce. The Maliki school, which recognized the widest range of grounds for divorce, also stipulates a category of \"harm\" (ḍarar), which gave the judge significant discretion of interpretation.\n\nIn some areas under Ottoman rule it was hardly possible for women to obtain divorce except through khul' due to the restriction imposed by the prevailing Hanafi school, though some exceptions have been found. The most serious problem was abandonment, which was not recognized as grounds for judicial divorce. To address this, in some cases a man setting out for travel would leave his wife a letter authorizing talaq if he did not return within a specified period of time. In other cases, Hanafi judges invited a Maliki or Hanbali colleague to pronounce divorce, or the woman herself took the initiative to seek out a judge from one of these schools. The same approach was used to effect a divorce in cases of failure to provide maintenance. In the Ottoman Balkans a woman could file for divorce on the grounds that her husband was \"not a good Muslim\".\n\nSince marriages between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are forbidden under Islamic law, when a married woman converted to Islam but her husband did not, the marriage would be considered void by Muslim authorities and the woman obtained custody of the children. Seventeenth-century sources indicate that non-Muslim women throughout the Ottoman Empire used this method to obtain a divorce.\n\nThe husband can end marriage through three types of oaths: the oath of continence (\"īlāʿ\" and \"iẓhar\"), the denial of paternity (\"liʿan\"), and conditional ṭalāq. The first two types were pre-Islamic practices confirmed by the Quran (2:226–227 for \"ila\", and 58:2–4 for \"izhar\"), which also makes clear that \"izhar\" is reprehensible despite being legally valid.\n\n\"Ila\" is an oath whereby the husband vows to refrain from sexual relations with his wife for at least four months. If he fulfils his oath, the marriage is dissolved; if he breaks it, the marriage continues. In the \"izhar\" (or \"ẓihār\") oath a man declares that his wife is as sexually prohibited to him as his mother. The husband is able to break the oath and resume the marriage. Breaking either oath requires expiation by means of feeding the poor or fasting.\n\nIn the \"li'an\" oath, the husband denies paternity of his wife's child. The wife is given an opportunity to take an oath denying infidelity, and if she does so and the husband persists in his accusation, the marriage is dissolved by a judge and the couple can never remarry.\n\nIn the oath of conditional ṭalāq, the husband declares that he will divorce his wife if he or she performs a certain act. This oath can serve as a protection for the wife or as a threat by the husband, depending on the specified act.\n\nStudies of practices under Mamluk and Ottoman rule found no instances of the oaths of li'an or abstinence being used, while conditional talaq seems to have played a prominent role. It was used to issue various threats to the wife as well as to make promises. In Ottoman Egypt marriage contracts commonly included stipulations of conditional talaq which were not otherwise recognized by the prevailing Hanafi school as grounds for judicial divorce, such as non-payment of maintenance or marrying a second wife.\n\nIslamic law does not recognize the concept of communal property, and division of property is based on its attribution to either spouse. The wife obtains custody of the children until their majority (whose definition varies according to legal school), while the father retains guardianship.\n\nChild custody practices under Ottoman rule appear to have followed the rules of Hanafi juridprudence, although in Ottoman Egypt children generally stayed with their divorced mother beyond the prescribed age. A divorced woman could keep custody of the children unless she remarried and her husband claimed custody, in which case it generally passed to one of her female relatives. Under the Mamluks, women could waive the right to child support in order to obtain extended custody.\n\n\"Mahr\" is a nuptial gift made by groom to the bride at the time of marriage. Upon receipt, it becomes her sole property with complete freedom of use and disposal. The marriage contract is not valid without the mahr. The amount of the mahr generally depended on the socio-economic status of the bride. The payment of a portion of the mahr was commonly deferred and served as a deterrent to the exercise of the right of unilateral divorce by the husband, although classical jurists disagreed about the permissibility and manner of deferring payment of the mahr.\n\nIslamic jurisprudence has clear guidance on handling of mahr in the case of divorce, depending on who asks for the divorce and whether or not the intercourse occurred. If the husband asks for a divorce and intercourse has occurred, he pays full \"mahr\"; if the husband asks for a divorce and the intercourse has not occurred, the husband pays half the dower; if the wife asks for a divorce and intercourse has occurred, the husband pays half the \"mahr\"; and if the wife asks for a divorce and is still an intercourse has not occurred, then no \"mahr\" is required to be paid by the husband.\n\nIn the modern era, sharia-based laws were widely replaced by statutes based on European models, and its classical rules were largely retained only in personal status (family) laws. Different explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon. Several scholars have argued that because these laws are more extensively specified in the Quran and hadith than others, it has been difficult for believers to accept deviating from these rules. In contrast, Wael Hallaq sees it as a legacy of colonialism: changing family laws would have provided no benefit in colonial administration, and colonial powers promoted the theory that these laws were sacred to the population, advertising their preservation as a mark of respect, which in turn led to them being taken up as a point of reference in modern Muslim identity politics.\n\nImportant changes in family laws took place in the modern era. The laws underwent codification by legislative bodies and were also displaced from their original context into modern legal systems, which generally followed Western practices in court procedure and legal education. This severed them both from the classical interpretative tradition and from the institutional foundations of the pre-modern legal system into which they were embedded. In particular, control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state, though they generally remained \"within the orbit of Islamic law\".\n\nChanging social conditions have led to increasing dissatisfaction with traditional Islamic law of divorce since the early 20th century. Various reforms have been undertaken in an attempt to restrict the husband's right of unilateral repudiation and give women greater ability to initiate divorce. These reforms have utilized a number of methods, of which the most important are:\n\n\nThe All India Muslim Personal Law Board issued a code of conduct in April 2017 regarding talaq in response to the controversy over the practice of triple talaq. It also warned that those who divorce for reasons not prescribed under Shariat will be socially boycotted in addition to calling for boycott of those who use triple talaq recklessly and without justification.\n\nOn 28 December 2017, The BJP Government Lok Sabha passed The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017. The bill make instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddah) in any form — spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as email, SMS and WhatsApp illegal and void, with up to three years in jail for the husband. MPs from RJD, AIMIM, BJD, AIADMK and AIML opposed the bill, calling it arbitrary in nature and a faulty proposal, while Congress supported the Bill tabled in Lok Sabha by law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.\n\nAccording to Yossef Rapoport, in the 15th century, the rate of divorce was higher than it is today in the modern Middle East, which has generally low rates of divorce. In 15th century Egypt, Al-Sakhawi recorded the marital history of 500 women, the largest sample on marriage in the Middle Ages, and found that at least a third of all women in the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria married more than once, with many marrying three or more times. According to Al-Sakhawi, as many as three out of ten marriages in 15th century Cairo ended in divorce. In the early 20th century, some villages in western Java and the Malay peninsula had divorce rates as high as 70%.\n\n\n"}

When the Imperial High Priests tried and failed in their efforts to destroy the demon and dispel the Imperial household of its influence, they were at a loss. Finally, an archer, Yorimasu Minamoto, was summoned to the Imperial Palace in the hopes of slaying the demon with his bow and arrow, ridding the palace of this plague. With a steady hand and a virtuous heart, Yorimasu Minamoto vanquished the demon with the first arrow, and his bow was declared to be a \"Hama Yumi\"; an \"Evil-Destroying Bow\", (and the first arrow a \"Hama Ya\"; a \"Evil-Destroying Arrow\"). \n\nSince then, Hama Yumi have been used in Buddhist and Shinto rituals of purification.

Peckman gathered 4000 signatures to place his proposal for the seven-member commission on the November 2008 general-election ballot in Denver. However, he declined to file the paperwork for the November 2008 election, in the hope that an incoming Obama administration would release material on extraterrestrials to the public.\n\nIn 2009 the initiative received over 7000 signatures for the 2010 Ballot. After validation by the Denver Elections Division, it was determined that the number of valid signatures was insufficient leaving 1000 valid signatures still required. This insufficiency was resolved by the end of November 2009, and Initiative 300 was put on Denver's November 2010 election ballot. The initiative was opposed by a group calling itself M.I.B. In the election, initiative 300 was rejected by 82.34% of Denver voters.\n\nAfter this defeat, Peckman filed a complaint with the Denver Board of Ethics, where he questioned the \"unethical, incompetent, and suspicious behavior\" of Denver officials, whom he claimed assisted other \"very disreputable, incompetent, unethical, and hostile persons\" during the campaign, and further ponders whether these were acting in conjunction with the CIA, NSA, or other covert groups. The Denver ethics board dismissed this complaint \"for lack of jurisdiction, and because the complaint did not deal with any issues that are covered by the Denver Code of Ethics\".\n\nJeff Peckman appeared on the May 3, 2011 Denver Mayoral ballot in a field of 10 other candidates, though one had dropped out before the election. Out of over 110,000 votes cast, Peckman received only 796 votes, coming in second to last place.\n\nHe promotes Metatron Technology, which he says defends against \"harmful electromagnetic waves\" by transforming them into \"desirable healthy energy\".\n\nPeckman is an advocate for disclosure of UFO and extraterrestrial phenomena who gained media attention in 2008 when he publicly displayed a video of a purported extraterrestrial in Denver, Colorado.\n\nPeckman publicly screened the video on May 30, 2008 at Metropolitan State College in Denver and forbid photos by reporters. The three-minute video contained images of a \"white creature with a balloon-shaped head\" and large dark eyes that blinked and looked through a window said to be 8 feet above the ground.\n\nThe video was said to have been made by Stan Romanek, July 17, 2003, in Nebraska. A documentary including the footage was scheduled for release in 2008 but was delayed.

By the middle of June, the fires had destroyed over 180 homes and taken one life. Peckman's solution was to propose that certain music \"replicates the frequencies present in nature when it rains\", and that playing such music was historically proven to increase the chance of rain.

{"id": "65731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65731", "title": "Korybantes", "text": "Korybantes\n\nAccording to the Greek mythology, the Korybantes (; ) were the armed and crested dancers who worshipped the Phrygian goddess Cybele with drumming and dancing. They are also called the Kurbantes in Phrygia. The conventional English equivalent is \"Corybants\". The Korybantes were the offspring of Thalia and Apollo.\n\nThe name Korybantes is of uncertain etymology. Edzard Johan Furnée and R. S. P. Beekes have suggested a Pre-Greek origin.\n\nOthers refer the name to *κορυβή (\"korybé\"), the Macedonian version of κορυφή (\"koryphé\") \"crown, top, mountain peak\", explaining their association with mountains, particularly Olympus.\n\nThe Kuretes or Kouretes () were nine dancers who venerate Rhea, the Cretan counterpart of Cybele. A fragment from Strabo's Book VII gives a sense of the roughly analogous character of these male confraternities, and the confusion rampant among those not initiated: \nMany assert that the gods worshipped in Samothrace as well as the Kurbantes and the Korybantes and in like manner the Kouretes and the Idaean Daktyls are the same as the Kabeiroi, but as to the Kabeiroi they are unable to tell who they are.\n\nThese armored male dancers kept time to a drum and the rhythmic stamping of their feet. Dance, according to Greek thought, was one of the civilizing activities, like wine-making or music. The dance in armor (the \"Pyrrhic dance\" or pyrrhichios [Πυρρίχη]) was a male coming-of-age initiation ritual linked to a warrior victory celebration. Both Jane Ellen Harrison and the French classicist Henri Jeanmaire have shown that both the Kouretes (Κουρῆτες) and Cretan Zeus, who was called \"the greatest \"kouros\" (κοῦρος)\", were intimately connected with the transition of boys into manhood in Cretan cities.\n\nThe English \"Pyrrhic Dance\" is a corruption of the original \"Pyrríkhē\" or the \"Pyrríkhios Khorós\" \"Pyrrhichian Dance\". It has no relationship with the king Pyrrhus of Epirus, who invaded Italy in the 3rd century BC, and who gave his name to the Pyrrhic victory, which was achieved at such cost that it was tantamount to a defeat.\n\nThe Phrygian Korybantes were often confused by Greeks with other ecstatic male confraternities, such as the Idaean Dactyls or the Cretan Kouretes, spirit-youths (\"kouroi\") who acted as guardians of the infant Zeus. In Hesiod's telling of Zeus's birth, when Great Gaia came to Crete and hid the child Zeus in a \"steep cave\", beneath the secret places of the earth, on Mount Aigaion with its thick forests; there the Cretan Kouretes' ritual clashing spears and shields were interpreted by Hellenes as intended to drown out the infant god's cries, and prevent his discovery by his cannibal father Cronus. Emily Vermeule observed,\n\nThis myth is Greek interpretation of mystifying Minoan ritual in an attempt to reconcile their Father Zeus with the Divine Child of Crete; the ritual itself we may never recover with clarity, but it is not impossible that a connection exists between the Kouretes' weapons at the cave and the dedicated weapons at Arkalochori\".\n\nAmong the offerings recovered from the cave, the most spectacular are decorated bronze shields with patterns that draw upon north Syrian originals and a bronze gong on which a god and his attendants are shown in a distinctly Near Eastern style.\n\nKorybantes also presided over the infancy of Dionysus, another god who was born as a babe, and of Zagreus, a Cretan child of Zeus, or child-doublet of Zeus. The wild ecstasy of their cult can be compared to the female Maenads who followed Dionysus.\n\nOvid, in \"Metamorphoses\", says the Kouretes were born from rainwater (Uranus fertilizing Gaia). This suggests a connexion with the Pelasgian Hyades.\n\nThe scholar Jane Ellen Harrison writes that besides being guardians, nurturers, and initiators of the infant Zeus, the Kouretes were primitive magicians and seers. She also writes that they were metal workers and that metallurgy was considered an almost magical art. There were several \"tribes\" of Korybantes, including the Cabeiri, the Korybantes Euboioi, the Korybantes Samothrakioi. Hoplodamos and his Gigantes were counted among Korybantes, and Titan Anytos was considered a Kourete.\n\nHomer referred to select young men as \"kouretes\", when Agamemnon instructs Odysseus to pick out \"kouretes\", the bravest among the Achaeans to bear gifts to Achilles. The Greeks preserved a tradition down to Strabo's day, that the Kuretes of Aetolia and Acarnania in mainland Greece had been imported from Crete.\n\n\n"}

The area between Chakdara Bridge and Saidu Sharif is littered with the remains of pre historic Aryan's Gandhara grave culture, Buddhist shrines and buildings of the Shahi Period. These archaeological sites are concentrated around three towns: Barikot, Odigram and Saidu Sharif.\n\nNear the Chakdara Bridge there are ruins from the Hindu Shahi Period and stupas at Haibatgram, Top Dara and Landakai.\n\nAbout 25 kilometres from Chakdara Bridge (About 20 kilometres before Saidu Sharif ), Birkot is the site of ancient town Bazira sacked by Alexander in 326 BC. This town is situated on ancient route on the River Swat from Nawa Pass. Here ancient route take a turn to south through Karakar Pass into Buner which further lead to Shabaz Garhi in Peshawar Valley.\n\nGumbat Stupa is situated 9 kilometres south of Birkot (locally known as Barikot) in the Kandag Valley. This is one of the best preserved stupas of Swat. It consists of a cell of about 12 feet square with windows. It is surrounded on all sides by a narrow passage intended to walk around sacred images while worshipping. Before Gumbat is a large building known as Kanjar Kot, meaning \"Dancer’s Mansion\". The place is beautiful but it is not advisable to walk there without the help of locals. From the end of the road to the stupa you need to walk about 30 minutes (at least). Besides the remains of the stupa, there are some remains of the monastery. Nothing has been done so far to preserve the site, but the stupa itself is in a rather good condition.\n\nMount Elam, 2811 meter High Mountain is considered sacred since ancient times. In the valley of Amluk-Dara near the foot of Mount Ilam is the ruin of a stupa.\n\nThree kilometers from Barikot towards Saidu Sharif is Shingerdar Stupa (on your right hand side). You can easily access up to the stupa by car. The site is close to the road and safe. 1.5 kilometers from Shingerdar is a large Buddha Carving on a cliff facing the road.. Further after 6 kilometers is the Gogdara Rock Carvings. These 3000-year-old engraving consist of different animals. There are some carvings that show people driving two-wheeled war chariots. These carvings were probably works of ancient Aryans. On the same rock there are some Buddhist carvings.\n\nThe gateway of Swat Barikot. \nBarikot is a town in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, located in the Swat valley region (ancient Udyana). Barikot is the present day name of the ancient \"Bazira\", which was besieged by Alexander the Great. Ancient fortifications by the name of Barikot-Ghwandai, located on the outskirts of the town, are being excavated by an Italian Archaeological mission since 1984. The oldest layer built of bricks and stone probably corresponds to the fortress besieged by Alexander. However, no traces of the Macedonian occupation have been found yet. The sequent layers consist of fortifications built by the Indo-Greek kings. A stone wall in Hellenistic style was built around the city, with equidistant quadrangular bastions, all according to Attic measurements. Ruins of palatial quarters as well as areas related to the Buddhist have been unearthed During the Kushan period, Barikot experienced rapid development with the creation of building dedicated to workmanship. Barikot has become a very important archaeological site, rivaling Taxila, for the study of history in northern Pakistan. A large quantity of the artefacts are preserved in the National Museum of Oriental Art of Rome, and the MAO in Turin.

It is situated 2 km from Saidu Sharif. On the other side of River Swat near Mingora Airport a site of \"Gandhara Grave Culture\" was discovered by Italian-led excavations at Aligrama. The site was dated to 1000 BC.\nSites are known as \"Butkara I\" (easily accessible, small fee) and Butkara II (an excavation lost in the hills and harder to find, free access). Both sites are safe.\n\nNear Mingora in Jambill River Valley many Buddhist remains and carvings have been found. At Panr, a stupa and monastery from the 1st century AD have been excavated. At Loebanr and Matalai, Italians archaeologist unearthed 475 Aryan graves dated 1700 BC.\n\n"}

He is also president of Wild Child Records, formed in 2004.\n\nGayden was born in Nashville, Tennessee. In the early 1970s, he helped establish two critically acclaimed bands, Area Code 615 (signed with Polydor) and Barefoot Jerry (signed with Capitol Records), in which he played guitars and keyboards and sang. Gayden left Barefoot Jerry in 1972 to form his own band, Skyboat. He also served as producer of an album by Dianne Davidson (\"Baby\") and one by Steve Young (\"To Satisfy You\").\n\nGayden's biggest hit as a writer is considered to be the song \"Everlasting Love\", which he co-wrote with Buzz Cason, recorded originally by Robert Knight, a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967. It became a number one hit in the United Kingdom when covered by the Love Affair in January 1968. Carl Carlton's popular disco version was a number six hit in the U.S. in 1974 and has logged over five million plays, according to BMI. Gayden wrote part of the song when he was five years old on his grandmother's piano. The song is one of two that has had hit status every decade for the last four. Gayden was performing at a fraternity house at Vanderbilt, when on break he heard the voice of Robert Knight at another frat house, ran down and introduced himself, and got together with Knight to write a song for his voice. He then proceeded to meet with Knight, and finish up the song with a friend Buzz. Gayden is known for his R&B hits and influences.\n\nMany artists have recorded the song, including German singer Sandra, who had a hit with it in Germany and all across Europe in 1987, and Gloria Estefan, who reached the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1995. U2 recorded the song on the B-side of \"All I Want is You\", Jamie Cullum had a hit with the song in 2009, and it was used in the films \"\" (two versions were used), \"America's Sweethearts\", \"Forces of Nature\", and \"Veronica Guerin\".\n\nGayden wrote another hit entitled \"She Shot a Hole in My Soul\" recorded by Clifford Curry, also covered by the Box Tops. Gayden as a writer favored R&B music; as he said, \"Nashville was an R&B rivertown, until country music came in and started giving the blues artists on the street citations for playing on the street and then called it a Country Music Town.\" Gayden wrote songs for several black singing groups, Robert Knight (see above), the Valentines, and Clifford Curry, who in 2009 was honored in a compilation CD, \"Night Train to Nashville\" and won a Grammy. Gayden performed with Bob Dylan, Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys, John Hiatt, Loudon Wainwright, Joe Simon, Ivory Joe Hunter, Margie Hendrixs, Kris Kristofferson, Gregg and Duane Allman, Steve Young, Jerry Jeff Walker, Ian & Sylvia, Elvis Presley, Hoyt Axton, Leonard Cohen, and Simon & Garfunkel among others. Gayden has written country hits for Bobby Bare and Porter Wagoner.\n\nGayden is also a session guitarist and is renowned for his innovative wah-wah slide guitar technique, as showcased on the early 1970s J. J. Cale hit \"Crazy Mama\". He also wrote a number of successful songs, including \"Hayride\", which was a major Australian hit for Flying Circus. \"La La\" was an even bigger hit. He also co-wrote and co-produced Robert Knight's \"Love on a Mountain Top\". Simon Cowell recorded Gayden's \"Love on a Mountaintop\" on Sinitta (Top 20, 1989). When Gayden played on Bob Dylan's album \"Blonde on Blonde\", Dylan's producer Bob Johnston asked to produce an album for him; the album, \"McGavock Gayden\", was released by EMI Records.\n\nGayden is currently producing groups, one is his daughter Oceana Gayden, and has performed at Bonnaroo and other festivals with her. The other group he is working with now is a group called Sweetwater Rose, which he put together and produced and is currently performing with.\n\nGayden practices Transcendental Meditation, and he and his family have performed numerous times at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, and also in support of the David Lynch Foundation, which is dedicated to bringing the practice of meditation to under-performing public schools. His music has sometimes reflected this personal dimension.

It is a movement in Hinduism that developed during its classical period around the beginning of the Common Era. Philosophically, Madhva tradition is aligned with Dvaita Vedanta, and regards Madhvacharya as its founder or reformer.\n\nAccording to Madhva tradition, the creator is superior to the creation, and hence moksha comes only from the grace of Vishnu, but not from effort.\n\nThe term \"Madhva\" is derived from the name of the tradition's founder, Madhvacharya. The term \"sampradaya\" refers to a Hindu religious tradition. The term \"Sad Vaishnavism\" is derived from \"sad\", meaning \"true\", and the Hindu deity Vishnu, whose worshipers are known as Vaishnavism; this name of the tradition may thus be translated as \"true Vaishnavism\" The followers of \"Sad Vaishnavism\" are known as \"Sad Vaishnavas\".\n\nAccording to Madhvism, the Divine and the soul are completely distinct from each other. Madhva Sampradaya worships Vishnu as the highest Hindu deity and regards Madhva, whom they consider to be an incarnation of Vishnu's son, Vayu, as an incarnate saviour. Madhvism regards Vayu as Vishnu's agent in this world, and Hanuman, Bhima, and Madhvacharya to be his three incarnations; for this reason, the roles of Hanuman in the Ramayana and Bhima in the Mahabharata are emphasised, and Madhvacharya is particularly held in high esteem. Vayu is prominently shown by Madhva in countless texts.\n\nMadhvacharya, was a staunch Vaishnava who pushed strongly the belief that Vishnu was the highest of Hindu deities, and refused to accept any claims that other Hindu deities, such as Brahma or Shiva, might be equally the highest among the deities. Madhvacharya says that in the beginning there was only one God and that was Narayana or Vishnu. Madhvacharya states that the ultimate divine reality, which Hindu traditions refer to as Brahman, and the individual souls, known as jīvātmans, exist as independent realities, and that these are distinct. Madhvacharya asserted, \"yathecchasi tatha kuru\", which Sharma translates and explains as \"one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk\".\n\nMadhvism rejects not only the Advaita Vedanta, or monism, of Shankaracharya, but also the Vishistadvaita, or qualified monism, of Ramanujacharya.\nMadhva rejects Shankara's conception of the \"Nirguna Brahman\"--that is, Brahman without characterisations--and accepts the conception of the \"Saguna Brahman\"--that is, Brahman with characterisations--as the ultimate divine reality. In Madhva philosophy, Brahman possess all positive qualities; at the root of these are existence, consciousness, and bliss. An impersonal Brahman, such as Shankara's Nirguna Brahman cannot perform these functions. For Madhva, the personal Brahman is not different from Vishnu, whom Vaishavas consider to be the creator, the maintainer and destroyer of the world. According to the Madhva viewpoint, nothing can condition Brahman. According to Madhva, Brahman is neither the limited infinite divine reality of the Nyaya school nor a being in inseparable relation with matter and selves as in the philosophy of Ramanuja. Rather, Brahman is viewed as completely independent, but whilst the jivas are viewed as dependent upon Brahman for activity, knowledge, and existence. According to the Vaishnava viewpoint, Vishnu creates the world by his will and brings into existence the world of objects and selves. Objects and selves, the though real and irreducible to each other, are dependent on Brahman. At the time of dissolution of the world, material and objects are considered to be transformed into undifferentiated matter and selves into disembodied intelligence by Brahman; it is believed, even in the state of dissolution, that Brahman, matter, and the jivas remain distinct from one another, and do not merge with one another.\n\nThe devotional movement of the Haridasa of Karnataka was an expression of Madhva's religious thought. The Haridasa movement initiated by Madhva has had a deep impact on the people in different parts of the country. The Haridasas were mostly Madhwas and almost exclusively of the Brahmin community.\n\nMadhvacharya established many Mathas by defeating various acharya's of different sampradaya's. \n\nOut of these 24 Mathas, the first eight are part of the Ashta (eight) mathas of Udupi who take turns once every two years (Paryaya) to worship Lord Krishna in at Udupi.The mathas which Madhva built exist until today, and continue the teachings and influence of Madhva\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the Eight largest Dvaita Mathas founded by Madhva, and their details.Madhva established more mathas locally for Vedanta studies and its propagation.\n\nThe remaining Dvaita Vedanta mathas following Madhva Tradition include:\n\nOut of these Uttaradi Matha, Vyasaraja Matha and Raghavendra Matha enjoy the status of \"Matha-traya\" or the three premium madhva mathas descended from Jayatirtha.\n\nSome of the prominent Madhva teachers include:\n\n\n"}

All of its elements - text, masorah, Targum, and commentaries were based upon the manuscripts that Ben Hayyim had at hand (although he did not always have access to the best ones according to some, Ginsburg and some others argued that it was a good representation of the Ben Asher text).\n\nThe Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim, though hailed as an extraordinary achievement, was riddled with thousands of technical errors. Objections were also raised by the Jewish readership, based on the fact that the very first printing of the Mikra'ot Gedolot was edited by Felix Pratensis, a Jew converted to Christianity. Furthermore, Bomberg, a Christian, had requested an \"imprimatur\" from the Pope. Such facts were not compatible with the supposed Jewish nature of the work; Bomberg had to produce a fresh edition under the direction of acceptable Jewish editors. Nevertheless, this first edition served as the textual model for nearly all later editions until modern times. With regard to the Biblical text, many of Ben Hayyim's errors were later corrected by Menahem Lonzano and Shlomo Yedidiah Norzi.\n\nThe Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim served as the textus receptus for the King James Version of the Bible in 1611 and the Spanish Reina-Valera translation.\n\nMost editions until the last few decades, and many editions even today, are reprints of or based on late nineteenth century Eastern European editions, which are in turn based more or less on the Ben Hayyim edition described above.\n\nIn the last generation fresh editions of the Mikraot Gedolot have been published, based directly on manuscript evidence, principally the \"Keter Aram Tzova\", the manuscript of the Tanakh kept by the Jews of Aleppo.

{"id": "226651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226651", "title": "Relic", "text": "Relic\n\nIn religion, a relic usually consists of the physical remains of a saint or the personal effects of the saint or venerated person preserved for purposes of veneration as a tangible memorial. Relics are an important aspect of some forms of Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Shamanism, and many other religions. \"Relic\" derives from the Latin \"reliquiae\", meaning \"remains\", and a form of the Latin verb \"relinquere\", to \"leave behind, or abandon\". A reliquary is a shrine that houses one or more religious relics.\n\nIn ancient Greece, a city or sanctuary might claim to possess, without necessarily displaying, the remains of a venerated hero as a part of a hero cult. Other venerable objects associated with the hero were more likely to be on display in sanctuaries, such as spears, shields, or other weaponry; chariots, ships or figureheads; furniture such as chairs or tripods; and clothing. The sanctuary of the Leucippides at Sparta claimed to display the egg of Leda.\n\nThe bones were not regarded as holding a particular power derived from the hero, with some exceptions, such as the divine shoulder of Pelops held at Olympia. Miracles and healing were not regularly attributed to them; rather, their presence was meant to serve a tutelary function, as the tomb of Oedipus was said to protect Athens.\n\nThe bones of Orestes and Theseus were supposed to have been stolen or removed from their original resting place and reburied. On the advice of the Delphic Oracle, the Spartans searched for the bones of Orestes and brought them home, without which they had been told they could not expect victory in their war against the neighboring Tegeans. Plutarch says that the Athenians were likewise instructed by the oracle to locate and steal the relics of Theseus from the Dolopians.\n\nThe body of the legendary Eurystheus was also supposed to protect Athens from enemy attack, and in Thebes, that of the prophet Amphiaraus, whose cult was oracular and healing. Plutarch narrates transferrals similar to that of Theseus for the bodies of the historical Demetrius I of Macedon and Phocion the Good The bones or ashes of Aesculapius at Epidaurus, and of Perdiccas I at Macedon, were treated with the deepest veneration.\n\nAs with the relics of Theseus, the bones are sometimes described in literary sources as gigantic, an indication of the hero's \"larger than life\" status. On the basis of their reported size, it has been conjectured that such bones were those of prehistoric creatures, the startling discovery of which may have prompted the sanctifying of the site.\n\nThe head of the poet-prophet Orpheus was supposed to have been transported to Lesbos, where it was enshrined and visited as an oracle. The 2nd-century geographer Pausanias reported that the bones of Orpheus were kept in a stone vase displayed on a pillar near Dion, his place of death and a major religious center. These too were regarded as having oracular power, which might be accessed through dreaming in a ritual of incubation. The accidental exposure of the bones brought a disaster upon the town of Libretha, whence the people of Dion had transferred the relics to their own keeping.\n\nAccording to the \"Chronicon Paschale\", the bones of the Persian Zoroaster were venerated, but the tradition of Zoroastrianism and its scriptures offer no support of this.\n\nIn Hinduism, relics are less common than in other religions since the physical remains of most saints are cremated. The veneration of corporal relics may have originated with the \"śramaṇa\" movement or the appearance of Buddhism, and burial practices became more common after the Muslim invasions.\n\nIn Buddhism, relics of the Buddha and various sages are venerated. After the Buddha's death, his remains were divided into eight portions. Afterward, these relics were enshrined in stupas wherever Buddhism was spread.\n\nSome relics believed to be original remains of the body of the Buddha still survive, including the much-revered Sacred Relic of the tooth of the Buddha in Sri Lanka.\n\nA stupa is a building created specifically for the relics. Many Buddhist temples have stupas and historically, the placement of relics in a stupa often became the initial structure around which the whole temple would be based. Today, many stupas also hold the ashes or ringsel of prominent/respected Buddhists who were cremated. In rare cases the whole body is conserved, for example in the case of Dudjom Rinpoche, after his death his physical body was moved a year later from France and placed in a stupa in one of his main monasteries near Boudhanath, Nepal in 1988. Pilgrims may view his body through a glass window in the stupa.\n\nThe Buddha's relics are considered to show people that enlightenment is possible, to remind them that the Buddha was a real person, and to also promote good virtue.\n\nOne of the earliest sources that purports to show the efficacy of relics is found in :\n\nAlso cited is the veneration of Polycarp's relics recorded in the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" (written 150–160 AD). With regard to relics that are objects, an often cited passage is Acts 19:11–12, which says that Paul's handkerchiefs were imbued by God with healing power. In the gospel accounts of Jesus healing the bleeding woman and again at Gospel of Mark 6:56, those who touched Jesus's garment were healed.\n\nThe practice of venerating relics seems to have been taken for granted by writers like Augustine, St. Ambrose, Gregory of Nyssa, St. Chrysostom, and St. Gregory Nazianzen. Dom Bernardo Cignitti, O.S.B., wrote, “...[T]he remains of certain dead are surrounded with special care and veneration. This is because the mortal remains of the deceased are associated in some manner with the holiness of their souls which await reunion with their bodies in the resurrection.” Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) pointed out that it was natural that people should treasure what is associated with the dead, much like the personal effects of a relative. In an interview with Catholic News Service, Fr. Mario Conte, executive editor of the Messenger of St. Anthony magazine in Padua, Italy, said, \"Saints' relics help people overcome the abstract and make a connection with the holy. ...Saints do not perform miracles. Only God performs miracles, but saints are intercessors.\"\n\nIn the early church the disturbance, let alone the division, of the remains of martyrs and other saints was not practiced. They were allowed to remain in their often unidentified resting places in cemeteries and the catacombs of Rome, always outside the walls of the city, but martyriums began to be built over the site of the burial, and it was considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to the remains of saints, several large \"funerary halls\" being built over the sites of martyr's graves, including Old Saint Peter's Basilica. These were initially not regular churches, but \"covered cemeteries\" crammed with graves, and celebrating funerary and memorial services. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia it may have been thought that when the souls of the martyrs went to heaven on resurrection day they would be accompanied by those interred nearby, who would gain favour with God.\n\nThe Second Council of Nicaea in 787 drew on the teaching of St. John Damascene that homage or respect is not really paid to an inanimate object, but to the holy person, and indeed the veneration of a holy person is itself honour paid to God. The Council decreed that every altar should contain a relic, making it clear that this was already the norm, as it remains to the present day in the Catholic and Orthodox churches. The veneration of the relics of the saints reflects a belief that the saints in heaven intercede for those on earth. A number of cures and miracles have been attributed to relics, not because of their own power, but because of the holiness of the saint they represent.\n\nMany tales of miracles and other marvels were attributed to relics beginning in the early centuries of the church. These became popular during the Middle Ages. These tales were collected in books of hagiography such as the \"Golden Legend\" or the works of Caesarius of Heisterbach. These miracle tales made relics much sought-after during the Middle Ages. By the late Middle Ages the collecting of, and dealing in, relics had reached enormous proportions, and had spread from the church to royalty, and then to the nobility and merchant classes.\n\nThe Council of Trent of 1563 enjoined bishops to instruct their flocks that \"the holy bodies of holy martyrs ... are to be venerated by the faithful, for through these [bodies] many benefits are bestowed by God on men\". The council further insisted that \"in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics and the sacred use of images, every superstition shall be removed and all filthy lucre abolished.\" There are also many relics attributed to Jesus, perhaps most famously the Shroud of Turin, said to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe cult of Martin of Tours was very popular in Merovingian Gaul, and centered at a great church built just outside the walls of Tours. When Saint Martin died November 8, 397, at a village halfway between Tours and Poitiers, the inhabitants of these cities were well ready to fight for his body, which the people of Tours managed to secure by stealth. Tours became the chief point of Christian pilgrimage in Gaul, a place of resort for the healing of the sick. Gregory of Tours had travelled to the shrine when he had contracted a serious illness. Later, as bishop of Tours, Gregory wrote extensively about miracles attributed to the intercession of St Martin.\nIn his introduction to Gregory's \"History of the Franks\", Ernest Brehaut analyzed the Romano-Christian concepts that gave relics such a powerful draw. He distinguished Gregory's constant usage of \"sanctus\" and \"virtus\", the first with its familiar meaning of \"sacred\" or \"holy\", and the second as \"the mystic potency emanating from the person or thing that is sacred. ... In a practical way the second word \"[virtus]\" ... describes the uncanny, mysterious power emanating from the supernatural and affecting the natural. ... These points of contact and yielding are the miracles we continually hear of.\n\nRome became a major destination for Christian pilgrims as it was easier to access for European pilgrims than the Holy Land. Constantine erected great basilicas over the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. A distinction of these sites was the presence of holy relics. Over the course of the Middle Ages, other religious structures acquired relics and became destinations for pilgrimage. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, substantial numbers of pilgrims flocked to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, in which the supposed relics of the apostle James, son of Zebedee, discovered 830, are housed. Santiago de Compostela remains a significant pilgrimage site, with around 200,000 pilgrims, both secular and Christian, completing the numerous pilgrimage routes to the cathedral in 2012 alone.\n\nBy venerating relics through visitation, gifts, and providing services, medieval Christians believed that they would acquire the protection and intercession of the sanctified dead. Relics of local saints drew visitors to sites like Saint Frideswide's in Oxford, and San Nicola Peregrino in Trani.\n\nInstead of having to travel to be near to a venerated saint, relics of the saint could be venerated locally. Relics are often kept on a circular decorated theca, made of gold, silver, or other metal.\n\nBelievers would make pilgrimages to places believed to have been sanctified by the physical presence of Christ or prominent saints, such as the site of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\n\nAs holy relics attracted pilgrims and these religious tourists needed to be housed, fed, and provided with souvenirs, relics became a source of income not only for the destinations that held them, but for the abbeys, churches, and towns en route. Relics were prized as they were portable. They could be possessed, inventoried, bequeathed, stolen, counterfeited, and smuggled. They could add value to an established site or confer significance on a new location. Offerings made at a site of pilgrimage were an important source of revenue for the community who received them on behalf of the saint.\nAccording to Patrick Geary, \"[t]o the communities fortunate enough to have a saint's remains in its church, the benefits in terms of revenue and status were enormous, and competition to acquire relics and to promote the local saint's virtues over those of neighboring communities was keen\". Local clergy promoted their own patron saints in an effort to secure their own market share. On occasion guards had to watch over mortally ill holy men and women to prevent the unauthorized dismemberment of their corpses as soon as they died. Geary also suggests that the danger of someone murdering an aging holy man in order to acquire his relics was a legitimate concern.\n\nRelics were used to cure the sick, to seek intercession for relief from famine or plague, to take solemn oaths, and to pressure warring factions to make peace in the presence of the sacred. Courts held relics since Merovingian times. St. Angilbert acquired for Charlemagne one of the most impressive collections in Christendom. An active market developed. Relics entered into commerce along the same trade routes followed by other portable commodities. Matthew Brown likens a ninth-century Italian deacon named Deusdona, with access to the Roman catacombs, as crossing the Alps to visit monastic fairs of northern Europe much like a contemporary art dealer.\n\nCanterbury was a popular destination for English pilgrims, who traveled to witness the miracle-working relics of Thomas Becket, the sainted archbishop of Canterbury who was assassinated by knights of King Henry II in 1170. \nAfter Becket's death his successor and the Canterbury chapter quickly used his relics to promote the cult of the as-yet-uncanonized martyr. The motivations included the assertion of the Church's independence against rulers, a desire to have an English (indeed Norman English) saint of European reputation, and the desire to promote Canterbury as a destination for pilgrimage. In the first years after Becket's death, donations at the shrine accounted for twenty-eight percent of the cathedral's total revenues.\n\nMany churches were built along pilgrimage routes. A number in Europe were either founded or rebuilt specifically to enshrine relics, (such as San Marco in Venice) and to welcome and awe the large crowds of pilgrims who came to seek their help. Romanesque buildings developed passageways behind the altar to allow for the creation of several smaller chapels designed to house relics. From the exterior, this collection of small rooms is seen as a cluster of delicate, curved roofs at one end of the church, a distinctive feature of many Romanesque churches. Gothic churches featured lofty, recessed porches which provided space statuary and the display of relics.\n\nHistorian and philosopher of art Hans Belting observed that in medieval painting, images explained the relic and served as a testament to its authenticity. In \"Likeness and Presence\", Belting argued that the cult of relics helped to stimulate the rise of painting in medieval Europe.\n\nReliquaries are containers used to protect and display relics. While frequently taking the form of caskets, they have many other forms including simulations of the relic encased within (e.g., a gilded depiction of an arm for a relic consisting of arm bones). Since the relics themselves were considered valuable, they were enshrined in containers crafted of or covered with gold, silver, gems, and enamel. Ivory was widely used in the Middle Ages for reliquaries; its pure white color an indication of the holy status of its contents. These objects constituted a major form of artistic production across Europe and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the absence of real ways of assessing authenticity, relic-collectors became prey to the unscrupulous, and some extremely high prices were paid. Forgeries proliferated from the very beginning. Augustine already denounced impostors who wandered around disguised as monks, making a profit from the sale of spurious relics. In his \"Admonitio Generalis\" of 789, Charlemagne ordered that \"the false names of martyrs and the uncertain memorials of saints should not be venerated\". The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) the Church condemned such abuses such as counterfeit relics and exaggerated claims.\n\nPieces of the True Cross were one of the most highly sought after such relics; many churches claimed to possess a piece of it, so many that John Calvin famously remarked that there were enough pieces of the True Cross to build a ship from. A study in 1870 found that, put together, the claimed relics of the cross at that much later time weighed less than 1.7 kg.\n\nDue to the existence of some counterfeit relics, the Church began to regulate the use of relics. Canon Law required the authentication of relics if they were to be publicly venerated. They had to be sealed in a reliquary and accompanied by a certificate of authentication, signed and sealed by someone in the Congregation for Saints, or by the local Bishop where the saint lived. Without such authentication, relics are not to be used for public veneration. The Congregation for Saints, as part of the Roman Curia, holds the authority to verify relics in which documentation is lost or missing. The documents and reliquaries of authenticated relics are usually affixed with a wax seal.\n\nIn Catholic theology, sacred relics must not be worshipped, because only God is worshipped and adored. Instead, the veneration given to them was \"dulia\". Saint Jerome declared, \"We do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that we should bow down to the creature rather than to the Creator, but we venerate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore Him whose martyrs they are.\"\n\nThe Catholic church divides relics into three classes:\n\nThe sale or disposal by other means of relics without the permission of the Apostolic See is nowadays strictly forbidden by canon 1190 of the Code of Canon Law. Relics may not be placed upon the altar for public veneration, as that is reserved for the display of the Blessed Sacrament (host or prosphora and Eucharistic wine after consecration in the sacrament of the Eucharist).\n\nThe importance of relics in the Byzantine world can be seen from the veneration given to the pieces of the True Cross. Many great works of Byzantine enamel are staurothekes, or relics containing fragments of the True Cross. Other significant relics included the girdle worn by the Virgin, and pieces of the body or clothing of saints. Such relics (called contact relics, or secondary relics) were, however, scarce and did not provide most believers with ready access to proximity to the holy. The growth in the production and popularity of reproducible contact relics in the fifth and sixth centuries testifies to the need felt for more widespread access to the divine. These contact relics usually involved the placing of readily available objects, such as pieces of cloth, clay tablets, or water then bottled for believers, in contact with a relic. Alternatively, such objects could be dipped into water which had been in contact with the relic (such as the bone of a saint). These relics, a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period, increased the availability of access to the divine but were not infinitely reproducible (an original relic was required), and still usually required believers to undertake pilgrimage or have contact with somebody who had.\n\nThe earliest recorded removal, or translation of saintly remains was that of Saint Babylas at Antioch in 354, but, partly perhaps because Constantinople lacked the many saintly graves of Rome, they soon became common in the Eastern Empire, though still prohibited in the West. The Eastern capital was therefore able to acquire the remains of Saints Timothy, Andrew and Luke, and the division of bodies also began, the 5th century theologian Theodoretus declaring that \"Grace remains entire with every part\". In the West a decree of Theodosius only allowed the moving of a whole sarcophagus with its contents, but the upheavals of the barbarian invasions relaxed the rules, as remains needed to be relocated to safer places.\n\nThe veneration of relics continues to be of importance in the Eastern Orthodox Church. As a natural outgrowth of the concept in Orthodox theology of theosis, the physical bodies of the saints are considered to be transformed by divine grace — indeed, all Orthodox Christians are considered to be sanctified by living the mystical life of the Church, and especially by receiving the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments). In the Orthodox service books, the remains of the departed faithful are referred to as \"relics\", and are treated with honour and respect. For this reason, the bodies of Orthodox Christians are not traditionally embalmed.\n\nThe veneration of the relics of the saints is of great importance in Orthodoxy, and very often churches will display the relics of saints prominently. In a number of monasteries, particularly those on the Holy Mountain (Mount Athos in Greece), all of the relics the monastery possesses are displayed and venerated each evening at Compline. As with the veneration of icons, the veneration (Greek; δουλια, \"dulia\") of relics in the Orthodox Church is clearly distinguished from adoration (λατρεια, \"latria\"); i.e., that worship which is due to God alone. Thus Orthodox teaching warns the faithful against idolatry and at the same time remains true to scriptural teaching (vis. 2 Kings 13:20–21) as understood by Orthodox Sacred Tradition.\n\nThe examination of the relics is an important step in the glorification (canonization) of new saints. Sometimes, one of the signs of sanctification is the condition of the relics of the saint. Some saints will be incorrupt, meaning that their remains do not decay under conditions when they normally would (natural mummification is not the same as incorruption). Sometimes even when the flesh does decay the bones themselves will manifest signs of sanctity. They may be honey colored or give off a sweet aroma. Some relics will exude myrrh. The absence of such manifestations is not necessarily a sign that the person is not a Saint.\n\nRelics play a major role in the consecration of a church. The consecrating bishop will place the relics on a diskos (paten) in a church near the church that is to be consecrated, they will then be taken in a cross procession to the new church, carried three times around the new structure and then placed in the Holy Table (altar) as part of the consecration service.\n\nThe relics of saints (traditionally, always those of a martyr) are also sewn into the antimension which is given to a priest by his bishop as a means of bestowing faculties upon him (i.e., granting him permission to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries). The antimens is kept on the High Place of the Holy Table (altar), and it is forbidden to celebrate the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist) without it. Occasionally, in cases of fixed altars, the relics are built in the altar table itself and sealed with a special mixture called wax-mastic.\n\nThe necessity of provide relics for antimensions in new churches often necessitates continuous division of relics. An account of this process can be found in a treatise of a pre-revolutionary Russian church historian Nikolay Romansky (). According to Romansky, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church operated a special office, located in the Church of Philip the Apostle in the Moscow Kremlin, where bones of numerous saints, authenticated by the church's hierarchs, were stored, and pieces of them were prayerfully separated to be sent to the dioceses that needed to place them into new antimensions.\n\nWhile Orthodoxy does not make use of the strict classification system of the Roman Catholic Church, it too recognizes and venerates relics which may pertain to Jesus Christ or a saint, such as a relic of the True Cross, the Chains of Saint Peter (feast day, 16 January), the grapevine cross of Saint Nino of Georgia, etc. Places can also be considered holy. When one makes a pilgrimage to a shrine he may bring back something from the place, such as soil from the Holy Land or from the grave of a saint.\n\n\nThe veneration of the relics of saints became an incredibly important part of devotional piety in both Sunni and Shia Islam throughout the classical and medieval periods, with \"the ubiquity of relics and ritual practices associated with them\" becoming a mainstay of \"the devotional life of the Muslims ... [all over the world but particularly in] the Near East and North Africa.\" With the latter-day influence of the reformist movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, there is, according to some scholars, an erroneous perception which persists both among some modern Muslims and Western observers opining that \"the Islamic experience['s relationship with relic-veneration] is marginal, because of the perceived absence of relics\nin Islam.\" It is, however, evident that \"the historical reality of relics in Islam\" was very different, and that the classical Islamic thinkers posed various reasons for why the veneration of the relics of prophets and saints was permissible.\n\nWhile various relics are preserved by different Muslim communities, the most important are those known as The Sacred Trusts, more than 600 pieces treasured in the Privy Chamber of the Topkapı Palace Museum in Istanbul.\n\nMuslims believe that these treasures include:\n\nMost of the trusts can be seen in the museum, but the most important of them can only be seen during the month of Ramadan. The Qur'an has been recited next to these relics uninterruptedly since they were brought to the Topkapı Palace, but Muslims do not worship these relics.\n\nA cloak (\"kherqa\") believed to have belonged to the prophet Mohammed is kept in the central mosque in Kandahar, Afghanistan. According to local history, it was given to Ahmad Shah by Mured Beg, the Emir of Bokhara. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis. In 1996 Mullah Omar, leader of the Afghan Taliban, took it out, displayed it to a crowd of \"ulema\" (religious scholars) and was declared \"Amir-ul Momineen\" (\"Commander of the Faithful\"). Prior to this, the last time it had been removed had been when the city was struck by a cholera epidemic in the 1930s.\"\n\nA contact relic, or secondary relic, is a physical object which has acquired the status of a relic due to a physical closeness to the body of a holy figure.\n\nWhile Marxism–Leninism is an ideology rather than a religion, many communist states placed importance on the preservation of the remains of their respective founders, and making them available for veneration by citizens, in \"secular cathedrals\" of sorts. In both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China the mausolea of, respectively, Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong were the focal points of the two nations' capitals. The communists did not rely on the natural incorruptibility of the remains, but used an elaborate embalming process to preserve the lifelike appearance of the bodies.\nMinor communist nations would often seek the help of the USSR or PRC to preserve the remains of their own founders in a similar way to how it was done in Moscow or Beijing. See Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum (Bulgaria, 1949), Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (Vietnam, 1973), Kumsusan Memorial Palace (North Korea, 1994). The bodies of the founders of the socialist Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and Angola were also at some point made available for display and veneration in similar mausolea.\n\nEven though Soviet Communism is commonly viewed as anti-religious in general, and anti-Christian in particular, parallels between the veneration of Lenin's body in his mausoleum (and, for a while, that of Stalin's body as well) and that of the relics of Christian saints in their reliquaries have not been lost on many observers.\n\nIt is said that in the 1940s, some visitors to the mausoleum would cross themselves, as if entering a church. Even decades after the fall of communism, Russia's president would on occasion compare Lenin's body to the relics of Christian saints found in various monasteries.\n\nRelic is also the term for something that has survived the passage of time, especially an object or custom whose original culture has disappeared, but also an object cherished for historical or memorial value (such as a keepsake or heirloom).\n\n\"Cultural relic\" is a common translation for \"Wenwu\" (文物), a common Chinese word that usually means \"antique\" but can be extended to anything, including object and monument, that is of historical and cultural value. However, this has some issues since 文物 has little resemblance to the English usage of \"relic\". In most cases, artifact, archaeological site, monument, or just plain archaeology would be a better translation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3034598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3034598", "title": "Slavic Native Faith", "text": "Slavic Native Faith\n\nThe Slavic Native Faith, also known as Rodnovery, is a modern Pagan religion. Classified as a new religious movement, its practitioners harken back to the historical belief systems of the Slavic peoples of Central and Eastern Europe. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as Orthodoxy, Old Belief and Vedism.\nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs in the Middle Ages. Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and even non-Slavic sources such as Hinduism. Rodnover theology and cosmology may be described as pantheism and polytheism—worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is patriarchal, and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative. Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of political and identitary philosophy. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as ethnic religions, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as ethnic nationalism, opposition to miscegenation and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central place in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome Western thought and what they call \"mono-ideologies\".\nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the Soviet Union and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic Romanticism, which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the Second World War and the establishment of communist states throughout the Eastern Bloc, new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly studied in academic scholarship.\n\nScholars of religion regard Slavic Native Faith as a modern Pagan religion. They also characterise it as a new religious movement. The movement has no overarching structure, or accepted religious authority, and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice. The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as \"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\".\n\nThe scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described \"Slavic Neopaganism\" as a term pertaining to \"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\". The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which \"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\", while according to the historian and ethnologist Victor A. Shnirelman, Rodnovers present themselves as \"followers of some genuine pre-Christian Slavic, Russian or Slavic-Aryan Paganism\".\n\nSome involved in the movement avoid calling their belief system either \"paganism\" or \"religion\". Many Rodnovers refer to their belief system as an \"ethnic religion\", and Rodnover groups were involved in establishing the World Congress of Ethnic Religions. The usage of this term suggests that the religion is restricted to a particular ethnic group. Some practitioners regard \"ethnic religion\" as a term synonymous with \"Native Faith\", but others perceive there as being a distinction between the two terms.\n\nAccording to Shnirelman, it was the Soviet Union's official \"scientific\" atheism, which severely weakened the infrastructure of universalist religions, combined with anti-Westernism and the research of intellectuals into an ancient \"Vedic\" religion of Russia, that paved the way for the rise of Rodnovery and other modern Paganisms in Eastern Europe. After the Soviet Union, the pursuit of Rodnovery matured into the spiritual cultivation of organic folk communities (\"ethnoi\") in the face of what Rodnovers consider as the alien cosmopolitan forces which drive global assimilation, chiefly represented by the Abrahamic religions. In the Russian intellectual milieu, Rodnovery also presents itself as the ideology of \"nativism\" (\"narodnichestvo\"), which in Rodnovers' own historical analysis is destined to supplant what they call the \"mono-ideologies\" whose final bankruptcy the world is now witnessing.\n\nShnirelman states that—contrary to the beliefs of Rodnovers themselves—their religion does not actually constitute the \"restoration of any pre-Christian religion as such\". Rather, he describes the movement as having been \"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\". In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood—at least in part—as an invented tradition, or a form of \"Folklorismus\". Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society. Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.\n\nIn developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies. Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Germanic Heathenry, Siberian shamanism, as well as ideas drawn from various forms of esotericism. Other influences include documents like the \"Book of Veles\", which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions. According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \"a \"new\" religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\". Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of syncretism and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \"purity\" of the religion and thus maintain its \"authenticity\".\n\nA different perspective is offered by Svetlana Chervonnaya, who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \"the mass religious mind\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over Asia, and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites. The notion that modern Rodnovery is closely tied to the historical Slavic religion is a very strong one among practitioners.\n\nIn crafting their beliefs and practices, Rodnovers adopt elements from recorded folk culture, including from the ethnographic record of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Practitioners often legitimise the incorporation of elements from folk culture into Slavic Native Faith through the argument that Slavic folk practices have long reflected the so-called \"double belief\" (\"dvoeverie\"), a conscious preservation of pre-Christian beliefs and practices alongside Christianity. This is a concept that was especially popular among nineteenth-century ethnographers who were influenced by Romanticism and retains widespread popularity across Eastern Europe, but has come under criticism in more recent times. Slavic Christianity was influenced by indigenous beliefs and practices as it was established in the Middle Ages and these folk practices changed greatly over the intervening millennia; according to this, Rodnovers claim that they are just continuing living tradition.\n\nThe concept of double belief is especially significant in Russia and for the identity of the Russian Orthodox Church; in that country, it is an oft-cited dictum that \"although Russia was baptised, it was never Christianised\". Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a new wave of scholarly debate on the subject within Russia itself. A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion. Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints (Perun as Saint Elias, Veles as Saint Blasius and Yarilo as Saint George) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones. The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J. Ivanits reports ethnographic studies documenting that even in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russia there were entire villages maintaining indigenous religious beliefs, whether in pure form or under the cover of a superficial Christianity. According to her, the case of Russia is exceptional compared to western Europe, because Russia neither lived the intellectual upheavals of the Renaissance, nor the Reformation, nor the other movements which severely weakened folk spirituality in Europe.\n\nThe most commonly used religious symbol within Rodnovery is the \"kolovrat\" (\"spinning wheel\"), a variant of the \"swastika\" (Sanskrit: \"wellbeing\", \"wellness\"). As such, it represents wholeness, the ultimate source of renewal, the cosmic order and the four directions. According to the studies of Boris Rybakov, whirl and wheel symbols, which also include patterns like the \"six-petalled rose inside a circle\" (e.g. ) and the \"thunder mark\" (\"gromovoi znak\"), represent the supreme God (\"Rod\"), expressing itself as power of birth and reproduction, in its various forms (whether Triglav, Svetovid, Perun and other gods) and were still carved in folk traditions of north Russia up to the nineteenth century. The contemporary design of the symbol called \"kolovrat\", the eight-spoked wheel, used by Rodnovers was already present in woodcuts produced in the 1920s by the Polish artist Stanisław Jakubowski, under the name \"słoneczko\" (\"little sun\").\n\nThe majority of practitioners of modern Slavic Paganism call their religion \"Native Faith\". This term appears in slightly different forms depending on the Slavic language in question: in Ukrainian, it is \"Ridnovirstvo\" or \"Ridnovirya\", in Russian \"Rodnoverie\", in Polish \"Rodzimowierstwo\", and in Czech \"Rodnovĕří\". The term derives from the Proto-Slavic roots *\"rod\" (род), which means anything \"indigenous\", \"ancestral\" and \"native\", also \"genus\", \"generation\", \"kin\", \"race\" (cf. Russian родная \"rodnaya\" or родной \"rodnoy\"); and *\"vera\", which means \"faith\", \"religion\". Within the community, it has also been used to define an elective community, namely the community of Native Faith practitioners themselves. The term has different histories and associations in each of these languages. The suffix \"-ism\" is usually avoided in favour of others that describe the religion as if it were a practice or craft (which is the meaning of the Ukrainian and Russian suffix \"-stvo\", thus translatable with the English suffix \"-ery, -ry\"). Sometimes the term \"Rodnovery\" has also been interpreted as meaning \"faith of Rod\", a reference to an eponymous concept found in ancient Russian and Ukrainian sources.\n\nThe earliest known usage of this term was by the Ukrainian emigree Lev Sylenko, who in 1964 established a mimeographed publication in Canada that was titled \"Ridna Vira\" (\"Native Faith\"). As an endonym, the term \"Ridnovir\" was in use among Ukrainians involved in the movement by at least 1995. From Ukraine, the term began to spread throughout other Slavic countries. In 1996, it was adopted by a Polish group, the \"Association of Native Faith\" (\"Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary\") and in 1997 by the Russian \"Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities\" (Союз Славянских Общин Славянской Родной Веры). By the early 2000s, the term was widespread across Slavic language countries. In 2002, six Russian Rodnover organisations issued the \"Bittsa Agreement\" (\"Bittsevskoe Obraschchenie\"), in which they expressed the view that \"Rodnoverie\" should be regarded as the foremost name of the religion. The spread of the term reflected the degree of solidarity in establishing a broader brand and a sense of international movement despite the disagreements and power struggles that permeated the groups. The term also came to be applied to the modern Pagan religions of non-Slavic groups; for instance, in the Polish language Lithuanian Romuva has been referred to as \"Rodzimowierstwo litewskie\" (\"Lithuanian Native Faith\") and Celtic Paganism has been referred to as \"Rodzimowierstwo celtyckie\" (\"Celtic Native Faith\").\n\nAitamurto stated that in addition to being the most used term, it is appropriate because of its meanings. Aside from its immediate acceptation, it has deeper senses related to its Slavic etymology that would be lost through translation, expressing the central concepts of the Slavic Native Faith. \"Rod\" is conceived as the absolute, primordial God, supreme ancestor of the universe, that begets all things, and at the same time as the kin, the lineage of generation which is the ancestral bond to the supreme source. \"Rodna\" or \"rodnaya\" is itself a concept which can denote the \"nearest and dearest\", and such impersonal community as one's native home or land.\n\nThe appropriate name of the religion is an acute topic of discussion among practitioners active on social media. Many Rodnovers have adopted terms that are already used to refer to other religions, namely the historical Vedic religion and Orthodox Christianity. For instance, the Saint Petersburg-based \"Union of the Veneds\" (\"Soyuz Venedov\") is one of the major organisations of the branch of Rodnovery known as \"Peterburgian Vedism\". They explain that \"Vedism\" derives from the word \"to know\" and implies that rather than dogmatically believing (\"verit\"), Vedists \"know\" or \"see\" (\"vedat\") spiritual truths. The term was first employed by Yuri P. Mirolyubov—the writer or discoverer of the \"Book of Veles\"—in the mid-twentieth century, and later adopted by the founder of Peterburgian Vedism, Viktor Bezverkhy.\n\nIn Ukraine and Russia many important Rodnover groups advocate the designation of \"Orthodoxy\" (Russian: Православие \"Pravoslaviye\", Ukrainian: Православ'я \"Pravoslav'ya\") for themselves. They claim that the term, which refers to the universal order (\"Prav\", cf. Vedic \"Ṛta\"), was usurped by the Christians. Another term employed by Rodnovers, but historically associated to the Orthodox Christian movement of the Old Believers, is \"Starovery\" (cf. Russian: Старове́ры \"Starovéry\", \"Old Faith\").\n\nSome Slovenian practitioners use the Slovenian language term \"ajd\", which is a loan-word of the Germanic-language \"heathen\". When using English language terms to describe their religion, some Rodnovers favour \"Heathen\", in part due to a perceived affinity with the contemporary Germanic Heathens who also commonly use that term. Another term employed by some Rodnovers has been \"practice of the Slavs\", which appears especially in Polish (\"Słowiaństwo\") and in Slovakian (\"Slovianstvo\"). Some Russians refer to their religion as \"Slavism\" and claim that the word \"Slav\" originally meant \"he who praises his gods\".\n\nIn Slavic languages the closest equivalent of \"paganism\" is \"poganstvo\" (taking for instance Russian; it itself deriving from Latin \"paganus\"), although Rodnovers widely reject this term due to its derogatory connotations. Indeed, many Slavic languages have two terms that are conventionally rendered as \"pagan\" in Western languages: the aforementioned \"pogan\" and языч \"yazich\". The latter, which is a derivation of the near-homophonous язык \"yazik\", \"tongue\", is prevalent and has a less negative acceptation, literally meaning \"pertaining to (our own) language\". It is often more accurately (though by no means thoroughly) translated as \"Gentile\" (i.e. pertaining \"to the \"gens\"\", \"to the kin\"), which in turn it itself renders in Slavic translations of the Bible. Some Russian and Ukrainian Rodnovers employ, respectively, \"Yazychestvo\" and \"Yazychnytstvo\" (i.e. \"our own language craft\", \"Gentility\"), but it is infrequent. \"Yazich\" has been adopted especially among Rodnovers speaking West Slavic languages, where it has not any connotations related to \"paganism\". Thus, Czech Rodnover groups have coined \"Jazyčnictví\" and Slovak Rodnovers have coined \"Jazyčníctvo\".\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the term \"Neopagan\" had been applied to the Polish Zadruga group. It was adopted among Rodnovers in the 1990s—when it appeared in such forms as the Russian \"Neoyazychestvo\" and the Polish \"Neopogaństwo\"—but had been eclipsed by \"Slavic Native Faith\" in the 2000s. However, the prefix \"neo-\" within \"Neopaganism\" is a divisive issue among Rodnovers. Some practitioners dislike it because it minimises the continuity of indigenous pre-Christian beliefs. They regard themselves as restoring the original belief system rather than creating something new. Others embrace the term as a means of emphasising what they regard as the reformed nature of the religion; the Polish Rodnover Maciej Czarnowski for instance encouraged the term because it distinguished his practices from those of the pre-Christian societies, which he regarded as being hindered by superstition and unnecessary practices like animal sacrifice. Many Rodnovers straightforwardly reject the designator \"paganism\", whether \"neo-\", \"modern\", \"contemporary\" or without prefixes and further qualificators, asserting that these are \"poorly defined\" concepts whose use by scholars leads to a situation in which Rodnovery is lumped together with \"all kinds of cults and religions\" which have nothing to do with it.\n\nPrior to their Christianisation, the Slavic peoples were polytheists, worshipping multiple deities who were regarded as the emanations of a supreme God. According to Helmold's \"Chronica Slavorum\" (compiled 1168–1169), \"obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods\". Belief in these deities varied according to location and through time, and it was common for the Slavs to adopt deities from neighbouring cultures. Both in Russia and in Ukraine, modern Rodnovers are divided among those who are monotheists and those who are polytheists. Some practitioners describe themselves as atheists, believing that gods are not real entities but rather ideal symbols.\n\nMonotheism and polytheism are not regarded as mutually exclusive. The shared underpinning is a pantheistic view that is holistic in its understanding of the universe. Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of monism, by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God—generally identified by the concept of \"Rod\", also known as \"Sud\" (\"Judge\") and \"Prabog\" (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among South Slavs. In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.\n\nThe root *\"rod\" is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality. Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well. Its negative form, \"urod\", means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous. Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations. Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal emanation, which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as \"Prav\" (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek \"Orthotes\", Sanskrit \"Ṛta\") in primordial undeterminacy (chaos), through a dual dynamism, represented by Belobog (\"White God\") and Chernobog (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, \"Prav-Yav-Nav\". Triglav (\"Three-Headed One\") and Svetovid (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the \"axis mundi\" and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as \"rodnianin\", \"believers in God\" (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities. This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit–matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, Perun). In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\". Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript \"The Lay of Igor's Host\" may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of Dazhbog (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith. Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others. The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod; these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as \"Vyshen\", i.e. Vishnu, and \"Intra\", i.e. Indra), Iranian deities (such as Simargl and Khors), deities from the \"Book of Veles\" (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard Koschei. Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (\"volkhv\" Velimir), emphasises a dualistic eternal struggle between forces of good and evil; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body. Rodnovers also believe and worship tutelary deities of specific elements, lands and environments, such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry Veles is called upon as the god of literature and communication.\n\nIn Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic. In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism. Conversely, Sylenko's Native Ukrainian National Faith (RUNVira; also called \"Sylenkoism\") regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God who they identify with the name Dazhbog. For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.\n\nSylenko characterised Dazhbog as \"light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being\". Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as pantheistic or panentheistic rather than monotheistic. Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted. A similar view is adopted by Russian Ynglism. Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that \"we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer\". For Native Ukrainian National Faith's members, polytheism is regarded as backward. Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.\n\nRodnovery emphasises the \"this-worldliness\" of morality and moral thinking, seen as a voluntary and thoughtful responsibility towards the others that sprouts from the awareness of the interconnectedness of all things and of the continuity of spirit–matter and not as a strict set of rules. Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, \"Iriy\" or \"Vyriy\", they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world. People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated. Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"turning the other cheek\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness. In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation. This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of Émile Durkheim, Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\". Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the umbegoing context and the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues. Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined conservative. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related. Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community. There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative. Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ. Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house. Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being countercultural, presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of modernism and globalism.\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society—which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate—are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and miscegenation are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments. Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves feminists, partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture. In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt misognyistic and homophobic attitudes. Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\". Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions; for instance, the Ynglist Church's doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions—compared to those of other organisations—about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value. They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\". This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the Green Russia party.\n\nThere is no evidence that the early Slavs ever conceived of themselves as a unified ethno-cultural group. There is an academic consensus that the Proto-Slavic language developed from about the second half of the first millennium BCE in an area of Central and Eastern Europe bordered by the Dnieper basin to the east, the Vistula basin to the west, the Carpathian Mountains to the south and the forests beyond the Pripet basin to the north. Over the course of several centuries, Slavic populations migrated in northern, eastern and south-western directions. In doing so, they branched out into three sub-linguistic families: the Eastern Slavs (Ukrainians, Belarussians, Russians), the Western Slavs (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks) and the Southern Slavs (Slovenes, Serbs, Croats, Macedonians and Bulgarians). The belief systems of these Slavic communities had many affinities with those of neighbouring linguistic populations, such as the Balts, Thracians and Indo-Iranians. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov studied the origin of ancient Slavic themes in the common substratum represented by Proto-Indo-European religion and what Georges Dumézil studied as the \"trifunctional hypothesis\". Marija Gimbutas, instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. Boris Rybakov emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.\n\nThe scholar of religion Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is \"fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity\", while folklorist Nemanja Radulovic described practitioners as placing \"great emphasis on their national or regional identity\". Rodnovery typically displays greater concern for collective rights than individual rights. Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.\n\nSlavic Native Faith's world-view is often ethnic nationalist in basis. Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have—or their heritage has—some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".\n\nMany Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French \"Nouvelle Droite\". Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethno-cultural groups, and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity. Some Rodnovers promote racial segregation, and have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages. Some Rodnovers regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of social injustice, and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus, an approach that could require ethnic cleansing. Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic, for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews, and endorsing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic and political elite.\n\nMany Rodnovers oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as cosmopolitanism, liberalism and globalisation, as well as Americanisation and consumerism. The political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the \"veche\" (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"thing\". Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind; in Rodnovers' view, Western liberal democracy is \"destined to execute the primitive desires of the masses or to work as a tool in the hands of a ruthless elite\", being therefore a mean-spirited \"rule of demons\". Some Rodnovers interpret the \"veche\" in ethnic terms, thus as a form of \"ethnic democracy\", in the wake of similar concepts found in the French \"Nouvelle Droite\".\n\nThere are Rodnovers with extreme right-wing nationalist views, including those who are Neo-Nazi and openly inspired by Nazi Germany. Many other Rodnovers deny or downplay the racist and Nazi elements within their community, and claim that extreme right-wingers are not true believers in Slavic Native Faith because their interests in the movement are primarily political rather than religious. Shnirelman noted that there was a loose boundary between the explicitly politicised and less politicised wings of the Russian movement, adding that ethnic nationalist and racist views were present even in those Rodnovers who did not identify as explicitly political. Rodnover ideas and symbols have also been adopted by many Russian nationalists—including in the Russian skinhead movement—not all of whom embrace Rodnovery as a religion. Some of these far-right groups merge Rodnover elements with others adopted from Germanic Heathenry and from Russian Orthodox Christianity. A number of young practitioners of Slavic Native Faith have been detained on terrorism charges in Russia; between 2008 and 2009, teenaged Rodnovers forming a group called the Slavic Separatists conducted at least ten murders and planted bombs across Moscow targeting Muslims and non-ethnic Russians.\n\nIn countries like Poland and Russia there has been an increasing de-politicisation of the Slavic Native Faith community in the 21st century. Aitamurto and Shizhenskii suggested that expressions of ultra-nationalism were considered socially unacceptable at one of the largest Rodnover event in Russia, the Kupala festival outside Maloyaroslavets.\nAitarmurto suggested that the different wings of the Rodnover movement \"attract different kinds of people approaching the religion from quite diverging points of departure\". For instance, the Circle of Pagan Tradition characterise themselves as \"patriots\" rather than \"nationalists\", avoid ethnic nationalist ideas, and recognise Russia as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural state.\n\nShnirelman notes that the movement is \"obsessed with the idea of \"origin\"\". Many Rodnovers legitimise their practices by according their Slavic ancestors great cultural achievements. Academics studying the movement have described these views of the past as \"extremely imaginative and exaggerated\", \"rather fantastic\", and linked to pseudo-historical ideas. However, Aitamurto and Gaidukov later noted that the \"wildly imaginative\" ideas typical of the 1980s were in decline, and that—within Russia at least—\"a more realistic attitude\" to the past was \"gaining ground\" in the 21st century.\n\nMany within the movement regard the \"Book of Veles\" as a holy text, and as a genuine historical document. Some Rodnovers take their cosmology, ethical system, and ritual practices from the \"Book\". The fact that many scholars outspokenly reject the \"Book\" as a modern, twentieth-century composition has added to the allure that the text has for many Rodnovers. According to them, such criticism is an attempt to \"suppress knowledge\" carried forward either by Soviet-style scientism or by \"Judaic cosmopolitan\" forces. Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include \"The Songs of the Bird Gamayon\", \"Koliada's Book of Stars\", \"The Song of the Victory on the Jewish Khazaria of Sviatoslav the Brave\" or \"The Rigveda of Kiev\". Some Rodnovers pejoratively dismiss movements such as that of the \"Vseyasvetnaya gramota\" as \"New Age\" and claim that reliance on them discredits the Slavic Native Faith movement.\n\nSome Rodnovers believe that Slavs constitute a race whose origin is distinct from that of other ethnic groups. According to them, Slavs are the directest descendants of an ancient Aryan race, whom they equate with the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Some Rodnovers believe that the Aryans originated at the North Pole but moved south as a result of declining temperatures, while others claim that the Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes. In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nSome Rodnovers regard Slavic countries as having a messianic role in humanity's future, for instance with the belief that Ukraine will be the world's future geopolitical centre, or that Russia will be the home of a post-apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world. Such racially eschatological beliefs are explicitly rejected by other Rodnovers, like the Circle of Pagan Tradition.\n\nAlthough their understanding of the past is typically rooted in spiritual conviction rather than in arguments that would be acceptable within academia, many Rodnovers seek to promote their beliefs about the past among academics. For instance, in 2002 Serbian Rodnovers established Svevlad, a research group devoted to historical Slavic religion which simulated academic discourse but was \"highly selective, unsystematic, and distorted\" in its examination of the evidence. In several Slavic countries, many archaeologists and historians have been hesitant about giving credence to Rodnover interpretations of the past. In turn, practitioners have accused academics of being part of a conspiracy to conceal the truth about the past.\n\nMany Rodnovers actively reject Christianity or adopt anti-Christian views. Practitioners generally regard Abrahamic religions as a destructive force that erodes what they view as organic peoples, with Christianity being perceived as a foreign force that is destroying Slavic culture. Some Rodnovers also take a hostile stance toward Judaism, which they regard as having spawned Christianity, or believe that Christianity has left Russia under the control of Jews. Rodnovers often reject Christian ideas of humility, regarding them as antithetical to a Rodnover emphasis on courage and fighting spirit. Christianity is considered as a system that destroys morality by casting human responsibility away from the present world and into a transcendent future, and it is also criticised as being anthropocentric, and thus responsible for ecological disruption. In Russia, Rodnovers often criticise Christianity for its claim to have a monopoly on truth; in regarding it as a mono-ideology, they compare it to Soviet Marxism. Some practitioners also regard capitalism as a creation of Abrahamic religions and seek to return to a pre-capitalist society, believing that their ideology will supplant \"mono-ideologies\" like Christianity in the future.\n\nRodnovers express their anti-Christian views in various ways. Many Native Faith groups organise formal ceremonies of renunciation of Christianity (\"raskrestitsia\", literally \"de-Christianisation\"), in which they adopt a new Slavic name. The folklorist Mariya Lesiv observed Rodnovers marching in Kiev in 2006 chanting \"Out with Jehovah! Glory to Dazhboh!\" Simpson noted that in Poland, several Rodnovers launched a poster campaign against Valentines Day, which they regarded as not being an authentically Polish celebration. In Russia, Rodnovers have vandalised and torched various churches.\n\nChristians have also been responsible for opposition to Slavic Native Faith, for instance through the establishment of social media groups against the movement. The Russian Orthodox Church has expressed opposition to the growth and spread of Slavic Native Faith across Russia on various occasions. Some Russian Rodnovers have however attempted to improve relations with the Orthodox Church, arguing that Russian Orthodoxy had adopted many elements of historical Slavic belief and rites. In this way they argue that Russian Orthodoxy is distinct from other forms of Christianity, and seek to portray it as the \"younger brother\" of Slavic Native Faith. The Orthodox Christian Old Believers, a movement that split out from the Russian Orthodox Church during the reform of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow in the seventeenth century, is seen by Rodnovers in a more positive light than the mainstream Russian Orthodox Church, as Old Believers are considered to have elements similar to those of the Slavic Native Faith.\n\nRodnovery is essentially a religion of the community, with most adherents actively joining organisations; only a minority of believers choose solitary practice. Sometimes, Slavic Native Faith groups send guests to the religious meetings of other groups, including those in other countries. Most Slavic Native Faith groups strongly emphasise the commemoration of ancestors in their religious practices. For many Rodnovers, greater importance is given to creating what they perceive as \"genuine\" Slavic rituals rather than those which will be psychologically empowering.\n\nThere is much variation in the patterns of organisation and practice between different groups, and depending on the level such groups intend to represent, whether national or local. For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian Sylenkoite branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly \"Holy Hour of Self-Realisation\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's \"Maha Vira\", sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of \"Shche ne vmerla Ukraina\", the national anthem of Ukraine. The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources—such as readings from the pan-Rodnover \"Book of Veles\" or the poetry of Taras Shevchenko—into the proceedings. The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose. In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices. Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices. For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the fire poi at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century. The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called \"Zhyva\" that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of reiki. In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of yoga by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians. Another example are groups within Peterburgian Vedism which incorporate Ivanovite healing techniques.\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, circle-dances (\"horovod\" or simply \"kolo\", \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (\"raskrestitsia\"), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slvic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the \"veche\" (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of \"sobornost\" formulated in 20th-century Russian philosophy. \"Veche\" is used as the name of many Rodnover overarching organisations, including the international \"Veche of Slavic Native Faith\", an assembly held each summer, to which adherents from Slavic countries take part. Aitamurto (2008) characterises the \"veche\" as a model of organisation \"from below and to the top\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves—that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves \"obshchina\" (the term for traditional peasant communities), while \"skhod\", \"sobor\" and \"mir\" are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is \"artel\". A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (\"kremlin\") or citadels (\"gorodok\"), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses. The Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova is one of such centres, located in the Podolsky District of Moscow Oblast. Some Rodnover networks have established thorough villages all over Russia; this is the case, among other examples, of those Rodnovers who are part of the Ringing Cedars' movement.\n\nRituals and religious meetings are often performed in rural settings, such as clearings in woodland. The basic structure of a temple of the Slavic Native Faith (капище, \"kapishche\"; or храм, \"khram\") is constituted by a sacred precinct at the centre of which are placed poles with carved images of the gods enshrined. These poles, or statues, are called \"rodovoi\", \"stolb\", \"chur\", but also \"kapy\" (\"poles\"). There are many such basic temples throughout Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. A large, elaborate temple of this type is projected to be built in Khabarovsk. In 2015, the Temple of Svarozich's Fire, in the form of a simple wooden architecture, was opened by the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in Krasotynka, Kaluga. Gaidukov (2013) documented that in the 2000s Rodnovers erected a statue of Perun in a park near Kupchino in Saint Petersburg, although they did not obtain official permission first. The statue remained in place for some time until being removed by the authorities in 2007 when a decision was made to construct a church nearby.\n\nIn Slavic Native Faith, priests are distinguishable into the orders of \"volkhv\" (translatable as \"wiseman\", \"wizard\", i.e. \"shaman\", or \"mage\") and \"zhrets\" (\"sacrificers\"). They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of \"zhritsa\" and \"vedunya\" (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, Halyna Lozko from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement. In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like Vladimir Dal and Boris Rybakov.\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four solstices and equinoxes set in the four phases of the year. Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\". A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the \"Kupala\" Night (June 23–24), although also important are the winter solstice festival \"Karachun\" and \"Koliada\" (December 24–25), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide—called \"Komoeditsa\" or \"Maslenitsa\" (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the \"Krasnaya Gorka\" (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30–May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of Marzanna and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally-affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation. Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside Maloyaroslavets in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts. The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals. The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. The calendar of one of the organisations of the Native Ukrainian National Faith includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\". The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and Hryhory Skovoroda, as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, Svyatoslav I of Kiev is one of the most popular subjects. Rodnover rituals and festivals often include martial arts displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty. Slavic-hill wrestling (Славяно-горицкая борьба, \"Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba\") was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov. Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (\"lavochki\") and \"wall against wall\" (\"stenka na stenku\").\n\nThe origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the Romantic movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against rationalism and the Age of Enlightenment. This was accompanied by a growth in nationalism across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage. Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.\n\nIn 1818, the Polish ethnographer Zorian Dołęga-Chodakowski (Adam Czarnocki) in the work \"O Sławiańszczyźnie przed chrześcijaństwem\" (\"About Slavs before Christianity\") declared himself a \"pagan\" and stated that the Christianisation of the Slavic peoples had been a mistake. Thus he became a precursor of return to Slavic religion in Poland and all Slavic countries. Similarly, the Polish philosopher Bronisław Trentowski saw the historical religion of the Slavs as a true path to understanding the divine creator, arguing that Christianity failed to do so. It was this Romantic rediscovery and revaluing of historical and pre-Christian that prepared the way for the later emergence of Slavic Native Faith.\n\n \nIn Ukraine, the first practitioners of Slavic Native Faith appeared in the 1930s. One of the most influential Ukrainian Rodnover ideologues was Volodymyr Shayan, a linguist and philologist who worked at Lviv University. He claimed that in 1934 he underwent a spiritual revelation atop Mount Grekhit in the Carpathian Mountains. Particularly interested in the ideas of an ancient Aryan race that were popular at the time, he subsequently began promoting what he called a \"pan-Aryan renaissance\". He turned to recorded Ukrainian folklore to find what he regarded as the survivals of the ancient Slavic religion. In 1944, he fled the Soviet government and travelled to refugee camps in Germany and Austria. There, he established the Order of the Knights of the Solar God (\"Orden Lytsariv Boha Sontsia\"), a religio-political group that he hoped would affiliate itself to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\n\nIn Poland, Jan Stachniuk established the \"Zadruga\" magazine in 1937; the term \"Zadruga\" itself was a reference to a South Slavic tribal unit. Continuing on from Dołęga-Chodakowski, Stachniuk's own work criticised Catholicism in Poland, arguing that it had had a negative effect on the country's national character. He did not develop his ideas into a religion, and those who shared his views remained \"a very loose and diverse intellectual clique\". The magazine and its associated group embraced members with a wide variety of viewpoints, ranging from secularly humanistic to religiously Slavic Native Faith stances. He was nevertheless labelled a \"neopoganin\" (\"Neopagan\") by the Polish popular press, a term that he embraced as a self-descriptor in later life.\n\nWładysław Kołodziej later claimed to have established a pre-war Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid (\"Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida\"), although there is no evidence that they conducted regular meetings until many years later. During the Second World War, Stefan Potrzuski led a unit in the Peasant Battalion which battled the Nazi German occupation forces. His unit had a shrine to the god Svetovid in their secret forest base and held group rites in which they toasted a wooden image of the deity with mead. Stachniuk fought against the Nazi occupation during the Warsaw Uprising. Following the end of the war and the incorporation of Poland under a Stalinist regime, both Stachniuk and Kołodziej were arrested, preventing the establishment of a Slavic Native Faith community. In 1954, a student group known as Klan Ausran was established at the University of Łódź; officially dedicated to a study of Indo-European society, its members provided hymns and prayers.\n\nA key influence on the movement was the circulation of the \"Book of Veles\" among Russian and Ukrainian emigrees. This text was brought to the public by Yuri Mirolyubov, who claimed that it had been discovered by a friend of his, Fodor Arturovich Isenbek, while serving as a White Army officer during the Russian Civil War. Mirolyubov alleged that the original text had been etched on wooden boards, but that these had been lost during the Second World War, leaving only his own copies. It is probable that the \"Book of Veles\" was a literary composition produced by Mirolyubov himself. In following decades the work would have caused a sensation, with many emigrees regarding it as a genuine tenth century text.\n\nOne of those who joined Shayan's group was Lev Sylenko. He subsequently left Europe and moved first to Canada and then the United States. It was in Chicago that he established the earliest groups of the Native Ukrainian National Faith in 1966. Sylenko presented himself as a prophet of Dazhbog who had been sent to the Ukrainian people. In his view, the Ukrainians were the superior manifestation of the European peoples, and Kyiv the oldest city of the white race. Sylenko was a charismatic leader, whose followers praised his talents and oratorical skills. In 1979 he published \"Maha Vira\", a book which he claimed chronicled the ancient history of the Ukrainian people. The system of Slavic Native Faith that he developed was influenced by deism and Theosophy. A Native Ukrainian National Faith centre, the Temple of Mother Ukraine, was established in Spring Glen, New York. Native Ukrainian National Faith congregations were established among Ukrainian emigree communities in other parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\nDuring the Stalin era in the Soviet Union, research into prehistoric societies was encouraged, with some scholars arguing that pre-Christian society reflected a form of communitarianism that was damaged by Christianity's promotion of entrenched class divisions. In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation. Russian Native Faith originated in the Soviet dissidents' circles of the 1970s. An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian samizdat nationalist journal \"Veche\" (1971–1974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist Konstantin Vasilyev (1942–1974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a Zoroastrian and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (\"Khristianskaya chuma\"). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed National Bolshevism, which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists. Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's \"Desionizatsiya\" (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's \"Udar russkikh bogov\" (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad. These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s. In Moscow, an occult circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev; although not explicitly Pagan, they were influenced by occult Pagan thinkers like Guido von List and sought a return to a pre-Christian Aryan world. In the early 1980s, the \"Pamyat\" movement was established by figures active at the Metropolitan Moscow Palace of Culture, which similarly looked with fondness on ancient Aryan culture. Several Russian nationalists also began to state that pre-Christian belief systems were the true religion of the Russian people; Apollon Kuzmin did so in his 1988 book \"Padenie Peruna\" (\"The Fall of Perun\"). In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy established the Leningrad (Saint Petersburg)-based Society of the Mages (\"Obshchestvo Volkhvov\"), an explicitly white supremacist and anti-Semitic organisation; it was followed by the Union of the Veneds, founded in 1990. These organisations gave rise to the stream of Rodnovery known as \"Peterburgian Vedism\".\n\nAfter Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet government introduced the policy of \"perestroika\" in the 1980s, Slavic Native Faith groups established themselves in Ukraine. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its official policy of state atheism resulted in a resurgence of open religious adherence across the region. Many individuals arrived at Slavic Native Faith after exploring a range of different alternative spiritualities, with Asian religious influences being particularly apparent within Slavic Native Faith at that time.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent republic, with many Ukrainians turning to strongly nationalistic agendas; among those to have done so are pseudo-archaeologists like Yuri Shylov, who posits Ukraine as the \"cradle of civilisation\". It is within this broader milieu of cultural nationalism and interest in alternative spiritualities that Slavic Native Faith re-emerged in Ukraine. The United States-based Native Ukrainian National Faith established itself in Ukraine soon after independence, with the first congregation in Ukraine gaining official recognition in Kiev in 1991. There had been schisms in the international organisation of Native Ukrainian National Faith. A number of senior followers broke with Sylenko during the 1980s, rejecting the idea that he should be the ultimate authority in the religion; they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen. A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his \"Maha Vira\" as a sacred text. Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them. In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in the country, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land. That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established; in contrast to the anti-Russian slant taken by Sylenko, it embraced a Pan-Slavic perspective.\n\nThe social context of Slavic Native Faith's growth in Russia differed from that in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Russian nationalists had welcomed the collapse of the Soviet system but were disappointed with the arrival of capitalism and the dramatic economic downturn that Russia faced in that decade. Large numbers became unemployed, and many turned to the past, including in ethnic terms. In this context, the growth of Rodnovery can be seen as a nationalistic project to regain national pride. Many leaders of early post-Soviet Rodnovery were intellectuals that were already practising members of the movement in late Soviet times, for instance, Grigory Yakutovsky (Vseslav Svyatozar), Aleksei Dobrovolsky (Dobroslav), and Viktor Bezverkhy. Other leaders that emerged in this period were Aleksandr Asov, publisher of numerous versions of the \"Book of Veles\", and Aleksei Belov, founder of the martial arts style known as \"Slavic-hill wrestling\".\n\nRussian Rodnovers started to organise by the mid-1990s; in 1994 the Moscow Slavic Community was the first Rodnover group to be registered by the government. Concerted efforts by the communities of Moscow and Kaluga led to the establishment of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in 1997. The communities of Moscow and Obninsk later left the organisation for ideological differences. Another organisation, the Circle of Veles, which is one of the largest and administers communities also located in the territory of Ukraine, was founded in 1999. The Ynglist Church too was formally established in the early 1990s. In 2002, the same year of the Bittsa Agreement, the Circle of Pagan Tradition was established in Moscow. Its purpose was to bring together Russian Rodnovers who did not share the extreme right-wing views then dominant in much of the community. In 2009, the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities and the Circle of Pagan Tradition issued a joint statement against Ynglism, disapproving what they reck as Ynglists' \"pseudo-Pagan teachings, pseudo-linguistics, pseudo-science and outright fiction\".\n\nIn Poland, the Wrocław-based publishing house \"Toporzeł\" has reissued Stachniuk's works and those of his disciple Antoni Wacyk. Zadruga also inspired the registered religious Association of Native Faith (\"Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary\"; now called simply \"Rodzima Wiara\" [RW], lit. \"Native Faith\"), whose founder Stanisław Potrzebowski wrote his doctoral thesis on pre-war Zadruga in German (\"Zadruga - eine völkische Bewegung in Polen\").\nAnother Slavic Native Faith group registered with the Polish authorities in 1995 is the Native Polish Church (\"Rodzimy Kościół Polski\"), which represents a tradition that goes back to Władysław Kołodziej's Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid. In 1998, a Czech Native Faith group called \"Rahoŝť\" was founded by an Italian-born academic specialist in Slavic studies, Giuseppe Maiello. In 2000 this group merged with the extreme-right nationalist National Front of the Pures (\"Národní Fronta Kastitů\") to form the \"Rodná Víra\" group. This organisation subsequently nurtured strong links with Rodnover groups in Slovakia, Poland, and Russia. The group broke apart following a schism in 2005.\n\nRodnovery emerged in the former Yugoslav countries in the early 21st century. A Serbian Native Faith group known as Slavic Circle (\"Slovenski krug\") existed during the 1990s and 2000s, merging historical Slavic religion with a ritual structure adopted from that of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In Slovenia, a group called the Svetovid Parish of the Old Belief (\"Staroverska Župa Svetovid\") was established around 2005 through a union of an older group, \"Ajda\", with the followers of military historian Matjaž Vratislav Anžur. As of 2013, it had between ten and fifteen members. The group organised an \"All-Slavic Council\" for August 2009, which was held at Struga Castle. In 2011, the Circle of Svarog (\"Svaroži krug\") was founded in Bosnia. During the 1990s and 2000s, a number of groups were established in Bulgaria, namely the Dulo Alliance, the Warriors of Tangra, and the Bulgarian Horde 1938. These groups had strong political motivations, being extremely nationalistic, anti-Western, and anti-Semitic. Rodnover figures and groups played a prominent role in the 2002 establishment of \"Ongal\", a Bulgarian far-right umbrella organisation.\n\nThe Internet helped to bring about the growing uniformisation of ritual practices across the Slavic Native Faith movement. The first Rodnover website on Russian Internet (so-called \"Runet\")—was established by a Moscow-based believer in 1996. Many Rodnovers made use of Russian Wikipedia to promote their religion, although many found the process difficult and switched focus to promulgating Slavic Native Faith through LiveJournal and mail.ru, through which they could express their own views more directly. From the mid-2000s, Rodnovers made increasing use of social media to communicate with other members of their community. Russian Rodnovery also attracted the attention of academics, many of whom focused on the political dimensions of the movement, thus neglecting other aspects of the community. Aitamurto later criticised some of this Russian-language material for reflecting scholars' own religious biases against Rodnovery, over-reliance on the published texts of prominent figure, or for sensationalising the subject to shock or impress their audience. This generated some mutual hostility between academics and practitioners, rendering subsequent scholarly fieldwork more difficult.\n\nRodnover themes have also been employed in the heavy metal subculture, particularly in bands like \"Sokyra Peruna\" (\"Perun's Axe\"), Whites Load, and \"Komu Vnyz\" (\"Who Will Go Down\"). In Poland, Rodnovery has influenced various forms of folk and popular music.\n\nThe early 2010s saw a strengthening of relations between Rodnover groups. In 2012, in Russia, representatives of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities, the Circle of Pagan Tradition and the Circle of Veles, signed an \"Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests\" that defined the criteria for the ordination of those wishing to become Slavic priests. On the same occasion, they once again expressed disapproval for some authors and movements, including the large Skhoron Ezh Slaven, which is also present in Belarus and Ukraine. In 2014, the Russian government officially registered the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities as an interregional public organisation for the promotion of Slavic culture.\n\nOn 17 March 2014—the day after the Crimean status referendum—, the Russian Rodnover leader Ilya Cherkasov (also known as \"volkhv\" Veleslav) published the following statement: \"I welcome Crimeans with right choice. That day initiates the process of uniting Slavic peoples. And no one is going to be able to interrupt this\". He approved the result of the referendum despite the international controversies arisen around its legality and credibility.\n\nRodnovery has a significant role in the War in Donbass, with many Rodnovers forming or joining armed forces. Some of them—for example those of the Svarozich Battalion—have been fighting in favour of Russia; other Rodnovers—such as those of the Azov Battalion—have taken the side of Ukraine. The war has stirred different reactions among Ukrainian Rodnovers; many adherents of the Native Ukrainian National Faith viewed Russia as the aggressor, while adherents of other Rodnover organisations like the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith more commonly saw Russians and Ukrainians as brothers and believed that the conflict was caused by the machinations of the United States.\n\nIn August 2015, during the III Polish Nationwide Rodnover Congress, the Rodnover Confederation (\"Konfederacja Rodzimowiercza\") was formally established. Among the members are eleven organisations including Gontyna Association, Żertwa Association, Pomeranian Rodnovers (\"Rodzimowiercy Pomorscy\"), Drzewo Przodków Association, Circle of Radegast (\"Krąg Radogost\"), Kałdus Association, Swarga Group (\"Gromada \"Swarga\"\"), WiD Group, ZW Rodzima Wiara and the Watra Rodnover Community (\"Wspólnota Rodzimowierców \"Watra\"\"). In June 2017, during the celebrations of the nationwide holiday called Stado, a new religious organisation was created: the Religious Organisation of Polish Rodnovers \"Kin\" (\"Związek Wyznaniowy Rodzimowierców Polskich \"Ród\"\").\n\nThere are Rodnover groups who develop theories and practices which differ significantly from those of common Rodnovery, represented by the theology and cosmology contained in the \"Book of Veles\" and Slavic folklore. Some of them have developed into religions that may or may not be regarded as Rodnovery (this is the case of Ynglism, which is not recognised as true Slavic Native Faith by the major Rodnover organisations of Russia, and of Yagnovery, Ladovery and Sylenkoism, which some Rodnovers opine not to be classifiable as branches of Slavic Native Faith). Other Rodnover movements represent distinct ethnic groups within the broader Slavic family or space (this is the case of Scythian Assians and Meryan Rodnovers). There are, otherwise, Rodnover groups that intertwine with forms of religion and spirituality that are not immediately related to the Slavic Native Faith (this is the case of Ivanovism, Rerikhism and the Ringing Cedars).\n\nOther documented movements include the devotees of Berehynia in Ukraine, the Pan-Slavic Khara-Khors Slavic Vedic movement, Koliada Viatichei, the Russian Religious Church of Viktor Kandyba, the Satya-Veda Aryan Gentile Community of Ilya Cherkasov (\"volkhv\" Veleslav), the Tezaurus Spiritual Union, amongst others. According to Irina Sadovina, more or less all of these movements share the assumption to represent expressions of a universal truth, or \"Vedic wisdom\".\n\nAssianism (Russian: Ассианство) is essentially Scythian Rodnovery. It is present in Russia and Ukraine, especially, but not exclusively, among Cossacks who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. An organised renewal of Scythian religion started in the 1980s building upon the folk religious beliefs of the Ossetians, who are modern linguistic descendants of the Scythians. They endonymously call the religion \"Uatsdin\" (Ossetian Cyrillic: Уацдин, literally \"True Faith\"), and have embraced it in large numbers. The \"North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire\" is a Scythian Rodnover organisation in the North Caucasus region of Russia and eastern Ukraine that operates under the aegis of the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith.\n\nThe major organisation among Ossetians is the Atsætæ Church (Ossetian: Ацæтæ; Russian: Асата, \"Asata\") led by Daurbek Makeyev, based in North Ossetia–Alania. Some Russians have embraced Assianism by virtue of the fact that most of the ancient Scythians were assimilated by the East Slavs, and therefore modern Russians may reclaim Scythian culture. Such idea that Russians may derive, at least in part, from Scythians is popular in many Rodnover circles. Makeyev himself, in a 2007 publication entitled \"Assianism and world culture\" (\"Assianstvo i mirovaya kul'tura\"), presented the religion as a worldwide spiritual heritage. In 2009, on the occasion of a conference specifically dedicated to the subject held at the Moscow State University, philosopher Alexander Dugin praised the renewal of Scythian culture among Ossetians as an inspiration that will be beneficial to all Indo-Europeans and to the whole world.\n\nMeryan Rodnovery or Meryan Native Faith is an ethnoreligious movement present in the regions of Ivanovo, Kostroma, Moscow, Vladimir, Vologda, Tver, and Yaroslavl. It consists in the establishment of an ethnoreligious identity among those Russians who have Meryan ancestry; Merya are Volga Finns fully assimilated by East Slavs in the historical process of formation of the Russian ethnicity. It is primarily an urban phenomenon and its adherents are Russian-speakers.\n\nVarious organisations have been established in the late 2000s and 2010s, including Merjamaa and Merya mir (Меря мир). In 2012 they presented their official flag. Skrylnikov notes that a salient feature of the movement is what he defines \"ethnofuturism\", that is to say, conscious adaptation of Merya heritage to the forms of modernity, in a process of distinction and interaction with Russian Native Faith. He says that Meryan Native Faith is mostly Slavic Native Faith whose concepts, names and iconoraphy are Finnicised. Meryan Rodnovers also rely upon the uninterrupted traditions of Mari Native Faith; on 27 September 2015, they organised a joint Mari-Merya prayer in the Moscow region. The cult of a Meryan mother goddess is being built upon the festival of the female saint Paraskevi of Iconium, on November 10. Also, Saint Leontius of Rostov is appropriated as a native god.\n\nSylenkoism is the branch of Rodnovery represented by the churches of the Native Ukrainian National Faith established by Lev Sylenko in the 1960s in the Ukrainian diaspora, and introduced in Ukraine only after the fall of the Soviet Union. There are at least four such churches: the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the fellowship established by Volodymyr Chornyi centred in Lviv, and the more independent Union of the Native Ukrainian Faith. According to the definition of Sylenko himself, his doctrine is that of a solar \"absolute monotheism\", in which the single God is Dazhbog, that is to say the sky, the Sun, and the self-giving of the world itself.\n\nSylenko proclaimed himself a prophet, bringing to the Slavs a new understanding of God that, according to him, corresponds to their own and original understanding of God. By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \"breath of his ancestors\" being united with them \"by divine holiness\". The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \"false prophet\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the \"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\", the \"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\".\n\nYagnovery (Ukrainian: Ягновіра), Ladovery (Ладовіра) and Orantism (Орантизм) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine. Ladovery is a doctrine articulated by Oleksander Shokalo and other personalities in the magazine \"Ukrainsky svit\" (\"Ukrainian World\"). Orantism is a movement centred around the cult of Berehynia, linked to Ukrainian national identity, non-violence and resistance to global assimilation.\n\nYnglism (Russian: Инглии́зм), institutionally known as the Ancient Russian Ynglist Church of the Orthodox Old Believers—Ynglings, was established in the early 1990s by the charismatic leader Aleksandr Khinevich from Omsk, in Siberia. According to the movement, which presents itself as the true, Orthodox, olden religion of the Russians, Yngly is the fiery order of reality through which the supreme God—called by the name \"Ramha\" in Ynglist theology—ongoingly generates the universe. They believe that \"Yngling\", a name that identifies the earliest royal dynasties of Scandinavia, means \"offspring of Yngly\", and that the historical Ynglings migrated to Scandinavia from the region of Omsk, which was a spiritual centre of the early Indo-Europeans. They hold that the \"Ynglinga saga\" of the Edda (itself composed by Snorri Sturluson on the basis of an older \"Ynglingatal\"), proves their ideas about the origins of the Ynglings in Omsk and is ultimately a more recent version of texts contained in their own sacred books, the \"Slavo-Aryan Vedas\".\n\nThe spiritual academy of the Ynglist Church teaches their Vedas, \"Aryan mathematics\" and grammar, and health techniques. The church is known for its intensive proselytism, carried out through a \"massive selling\" of books, journals and other media. Ynglists organise yearly gatherings (\"veche\") in summer.\n\nThe Ynglist Church was prosecuted in the early 2000s for ethnic hatred according to Russian laws, and its headquarters in Omsk were liquidated. Despite this, it continues to operate as an unregistered religious phenomenon represented by a multiplicity of communities. Ynglism meets widespread disapproval within mainstream Rodnovery, and the international \"veche\" has declared it a false religion. Nevertheless, according to Aitamurto (2016), on the basis of the amount of literature that Ynglists publish and the presence of their representatives at various Rodnover conferences, is clear that Ynglism has a \"substantial number of followers\".\n\nIvanovism (Russian: Ивановизм) and Rerikhism (Рерихиа́нство) are spiritual movements linked with Russian cosmism, a holistic philosophy emphasising the centrality of the human being within a living environment and the idea of \"God-building\". It originated in the early 20th century and experienced a revival after the collapse of the Soviet Union, relying upon the Russian philosophical tradition, especially that represented by Vladimir Vernadsky and Pavel Florensky.\n\nRerikhism originates from the teachings of Helena and Nicholas Roerich, it inherits elements of Theosophy and revolves around the practice of Agni Yoga, the union with Agni, the fire enliving the universe. Ivakhiv (2005) classifies Rerikhians and others movements of Theosophical imprint, such as the Ukrainian Spiritual Republic, together with the broader \"Vedic\" movement.\n\nIvanovism is a spiritual discipline based on the teachings of the mystic Porfiry Ivanov, based on the \"Detka\" healing system and religious hymns. The movement has its headquarters in eastern Ukraine, the region of origin of Ivanov himself, and it is widespread in Russia. Ivanovite teachings are incorporated by Peterburgian Vedism, the Rodnover movement started by Viktor Bezverkhy and primarily represented by the Society of the Mages founded in 1986 and the Union of the Veneds founded in 1990, and their offshoots.\n\nThe Ringing Cedars (Russian: Звенящие Кедры) or Anastasianism is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery. The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of Vladimir Megre (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an archetypal Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia. These books teach what Rasa Pranskevičiūtė has defined as a \"cosmological pantheism\", in which nature is the manifested \"thought of God\" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.\n\nAnastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, \"kinship homesteads\" (родовое поместье, \"rodovoye pomest'ye\"), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name \"Ringing Cedars\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the Siberian cedar. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \"Vedic\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.\n\nWriting in 2000, Shnirelman noted that Rodnovery was \"growing rapidly\" within the Russian Federation. In 2016, Aitamurto noted that there was \"no reliable information\" on the number of Rodnovers in Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" that there were \"several tens of thousands\" of practitioners active in the country. This was partly because there were several Rodnover groups active on the social network VK which had over 10,000 members. Estimates from some research institutes, often reported by Russian Orthodox Church organs, put the number of Native Faith practitioners in the few millions.\n\nAitamurto observed that a \"substantial number\" of adherents—and in particular those who had been among the earliest—belonged to the \"technical intelligentsia\". Similarly, Shnirelman noted that the founders of Russian Rodnovery were \"well-educated urbanised intellectuals\" who had become frustrated with \"cosmopolitan urban culture\". Physicists were particularly well represented; in this Aitamurto drew comparisons to the high number of computer professionals who were present in the Pagan communities of Western countries. The movement also involved a significant number of people who had a background in the Soviet or Russian Army, or in policing and security. The \"vast majority\" of Russian Rodnovers were young and there were a greater proportion of men than women. A questionnaire distributed at the Kupala festival in Maloyaroslavets suggested that Rodnovers typically had above-average levels of education, with a substantial portion working as business owners or managers. A high proportion were also involved in specialist professions such as engineering, academia, or information technology, and the majority lived in cities.\n\nThe historian Marlene Laruelle suggested that Rodnovery was likely to remain a marginalised religion in comparison to Russian Orthodoxy, but that its main significance for Russian society had been by diffusing \"historical themes\"—particularly regarding an ancient Aryan race—to a far wider audience, including many who were Orthodox or non-religious. A number of youth subcultures have been identified as introducing people to Rodnovery, among them heavy metal, historical re-enactment, and the admirers of J. R. R. Tolkien. Rodnovery is also spread through a variety of newspapers and journals. Also popular with Russian Rodnovers has been the martial arts movement known as \"Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba\". A number of popular celebrities, including the singer Maria Arkhipova and the professional boxer Aleksandr Povetkin, have publicly embraced Rodnovery.\n\nSlavic Native Faith underwent dramatic growth in Ukraine during the early and mid 1990s. In 2005, Ivakhiv noted that there were likely between 5000 and 10,000 practitioners in Ukraine. The religion's \"main base\" consisted of ethnic Ukrainians who were \"nationally oriented\" and who displayed higher than average levels of education. There is overlap between Slavic Native Faith followers and other sectors of Ukrainian society, such as the folk and traditional music revival groups, Cossack associations, traditional martial arts groups, and nationalist and ultra-nationalist organisations.\n\nIvakhiv noted that Rodnovery remains \"a relatively small niche in Ukrainian religious culture\", and that it faces a mixed reception in the country. Established Ukrainian Orthodox and Roman Catholic groups have viewed it with alarm and hostility, while the country's educated and intellectual classes tend to view it as a fringe part of the ultra-conservative movement which was tinged with anti-Semitism and xenophobia.\n\nIn the global Ukrainian diaspora, there has been a \"great decline\" in the numbers practising the Native Ukrainian National Faith branch of Rodnovery. This has been due to branch's inability to attract sufficient numbers of youth in this community. Alternately, the Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith has expanded in both Moldova and Germany.\n\nSlavic Native Faith groups are also active in Belarus, the most numerous being the Commonwealth of Rodoviches (Rodnovers), who fully align with Slavic traditions, and the organisation Radzimas, aligning with Baltic traditions instead. Rodnovery in Belarus is popular among some intellectuals active in the pro-Russian political scene, for instance Rodnover leader Uladzimir Sacevič.\n\nThere are also practising Rodnovers among Lithuania's and Estonia's ethnically Russian minorities. Russians in Estonia have established their own religious organisation, the Fellowship of the Russian People's Faith in Estonia registered in Tartu in 2010.\n\nAs of 2013, Rodnover groups in Bulgaria were described as having few members and little influence. That same year, Simpson noted that Slavic Native Faith remains a \"very small religion\" in Poland, which is otherwise dominated by Roman Catholicism. He suggested that there were under 900 regularly active members of the main four registered Polish Native Faith organisations, and around as many adherents belonging to smaller, unregistered groups. In 2017, he stated that between 2000 and 2500 \"actively engaged and regular participants\" were likely active in the country. He observed that in the country, Slavic Native Faith's adherents were \"still relatively young\", and saw an overlap with the community of historical re-enactors. In Poland, Slavic Native Faith outnumbers other Pagan religions, although both are represented in the Pagan Federation International's Polish branch.\n\nAnna-Marie Dostálová stated that the entire Pagan community in the Czech Republic—which includes Heathens, Wiccans, and Druids as well as Slavic Rodnovers—was of a \"small size\".\n\n"}
{"id": "27900915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27900915", "title": "Temple of Artemis", "text": "Temple of Artemis\n\nThe Temple of Artemis or Artemision (; ), also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis. It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey). It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed. Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.\n\nThe earliest version of the temple (a \"temenos\") antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the Bronze Age. Callimachus, in his \"Hymn to Artemis\", attributed it to the Amazons. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. The project was funded by Croesus of Lydia, and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in Antipater of Sidon's list of the world's Seven Wonders:\nI have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".\n\nThe Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 km south from the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Selçuk.\n\nThe sacred site (\"temenos\") at Ephesus was far older than the \"Artemision\" itself. Pausanias was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at Didyma. He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians. Callimachus, in his \"Hymn to Artemis\" attributed the earliest \"temenos\" at Ephesus to the Amazons, whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (\"bretas\") of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that Pindar believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. Tacitus also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.\n\nModern archaeology cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by David George Hogarth identified three successive temple buildings. Re-excavations in 1987–88 confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age, with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to Middle Geometric times, when a peripteral temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC. The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere.\n\nIn the 7th century BC, a flood destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a griffin and the Tree of Life, apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (\"xoanon\") of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two metres between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4 m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\".\nHeraclitus deposited his book \"On Nature\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple.\n\nThe new temple was sponsored at least in part by Croesus, who founded Lydia's empire and was overlord of Ephesus, and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was 115 m (377 ft) long and 46 m (151 ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its peripteral columns stood some 13 m (40 ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the \"cella\" that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood cult statue was sculpted by Endoios, and a \"naiskos\" to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\nA rich foundation deposit from this era yielded more than a thousand items, including what may be the earliest coins made from the silver-gold alloy electrum. Fragments of bas-relief on the lowest drums of the temple, preserved in the British Museum, show that the enriched columns of the later temple, of which a few survive (\"illustration below\") were versions of this earlier feature. Pliny the Elder, seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes.\n\nThe temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of jewelry and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess' protection from punishment, firstly by Dionysus and later, by Heracles.\n\nIn 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, Herostratus, who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term \"herostratic fame\". For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and forbade anyone from mentioning his name; but Theopompus later noted it. In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of Alexander the Great (around 20/21 July 356 BC). Plutarch remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.\n\nAlexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137 m (450 ft) long by 69 m (225 ft) wide and 18 m (60 ft) high, with more than 127 columns. Athenagoras of Athens names Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus, as sculptor of Artemis' main cult image.\n\nPausanias (c. 2nd century AD) reports another image and altar in the Temple, dedicated to Artemis \"Protothronia\" (Artemis \"of the first seat\") and a gallery of images above this altar, including an ancient figure of Nyx (the primordial goddess of Night) by the sculptor Rhoecus (6th century BC). Pliny describes images of Amazons, the legendary founders of Ephesus and Ephesian Artemis' original protégés, carved by Scopas. Literary sources describe the temple's adornment by paintings, columns gilded with gold and silver, and religious works of renowned Greek sculptors Polyclitus, Pheidias, Cresilas, and Phradmon.\n\nThis reconstruction survived for 600 years, and appears multiple times in early Christian accounts of Ephesus. According to the New Testament, the appearance of the first Christian missionary in Ephesus caused locals to fear for the temple's dishonor. The 2nd-century \"Acts of John\" includes an apocryphal tale of the temple's destruction: the apostle John prayed publicly in the Temple of Artemis, exorcising its demons and \"of a sudden the altar of Artemis split in many pieces... and half the temple fell down,\" instantly converting the Ephesians, who wept, prayed or took flight.\n\nAgainst this, a Roman edict of 162 AD acknowledges the importance of \"Artemesion\", the annual Ephesian festival to Artemis, and officially extends it from a few holy days over March–April to a whole month, \"one of the largest and most magnificent religious festivals in Ephesus' liturgical calendar\".\n\nIn 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the Goths, an East Germanic tribe; in the time of emperor Gallienus: \"Respa, Veduc and Thuruar, leaders of the Goths, took ship and sailed across the strait of the Hellespont to Asia. There they laid waste many populous cities and set fire to the renowned temple of Diana at Ephesus,\" reported Jordanes in \"Getica\". It is, however, unknown to what extent the temple was damaged.\n\nWhatever the extent of the injuries to the building, it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired, as the temple is noted to have been in use for worship during the rise of Christianity, and closed as a consequence of the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. \nHowever, the history of the temple between 268 and its closure by the Christian persecutions is not well known, and it is unconfirmed how big the damage of 268 was, and exactly which year it was closed by the Christians. Ammonius of Alexandria comments on the closure of the temple in his commentary of the Acts of the Apostles in the mid 5th-century, in which he gives the impression that the closure of the temple had occurred in his living memory. The closure of the Temple of Artemis is assumed to have occurred sometime during the course of the early to mid 5th-century, with the year of 407 as an early date. The closure of the temple was followed by the erasing of the name of Artemis from inscriptions around the city of Ephesus.\n\nIt is unknown how long the building stood after the closure of the temple by the Christians. At least some of the stones from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings. Some of the columns in Hagia Sophia originally belonged to the temple of Artemis, and the \"Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai\" records the re-use of several statues and other decorative elements from the temple, throughout Constantinople.\n\nThe main primary sources for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus are Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\", Pomponius Mela i:17, and Plutarch's \"Life of Alexander\" (referencing the burning of the \"Artemiseum\").\n\nAfter six years of searching, the site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum. These excavations continued until 1874. A few further fragments of sculpture were found during the 1904–1906 excavations directed by David George Hogarth. The recovered sculptured fragments of the 4th-century rebuilding and a few from the earlier temple, which had been used in the rubble fill for the rebuilding, were assembled and displayed in the \"Ephesus Room\" of the British Museum. In addition, the museum has part of possibly the oldest pot-hoard of coins in the world (600 BC) that had been buried in the foundations of the Archaic temple.\n\nToday the site of the temple, which lies just outside Selçuk, is marked by a single column constructed of dissociated fragments discovered on the site.\n\nThe archaic \"temeton\" beneath the later temples clearly housed some form of \"Great Goddess\" but nothing is known of her cult. The literary accounts that describe it as \"Amazonian\" refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of \"Artemis Ephesia\". The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding – a gift and honor to the goddess – brought further prosperity. Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and in the beginning of May to attend the main Artemis Procession.\nArtemis' shrines, temples and festivals (\"Artemisia\") could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven. When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused. Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge.\n\nUnder Hellenic rule, and later, under Roman rule, the Ephesian \"Artemisia\" festival was increasingly promoted as a key element in the pan-Hellenic festival circuit. It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and Pliny describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of Apelles' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens. In the Roman Imperial era, the emperor Commodus lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.\n\nFrom the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess Artemis. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of Apollo, a virgin huntress who supplanted the Titan Selene as goddess of the Moon. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic cult image that was carved of wood (a \"xoanon\") and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like term, from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a mural crown (like a city's walls), an attribute of Cybele as a protector of cities (see \"polos\").\nThe traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as \"Diana Efesia Multimammia\" and other related descriptions. This interpretation was rooted in Minucius Felix and Jerome's Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditionally interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called \"breasts\", were left unpainted or cast in different colors. Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies. The \"breasts\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on amber gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987–1988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th century flood. This form of jewelry, then, had already been developed by the Geometric Period.\n\nOn the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined serpents or of a stack of \"ouroboroi\", the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \"Megabyzoi\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the Galli. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls (korai).\n\nA votive inscription mentioned by Florence Mary Bennett, which dates probably from about the 3rd century BC, associates Ephesian Artemis with Crete: \"To the Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has set up in votive offering [a statue of] the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the Light-Bearer.\"\n\nThe Greek habits of syncretism assimilated all foreign gods under some form of the Olympian pantheon familiar to them—in \"interpretatio graeca\"—and it is clear that at Ephesus, the identification with Artemis that the Ionian settlers made of the \"Lady of Ephesus\" was slender. Nevertheless, later Greeks and Romans identified her with both Artemis and Diana, and there was a tradition in ancient Rome that identified her with the goddess Isis as well.\n\nThe Christian approach was at variance with the tolerant syncretistic approach of pagans to gods who were not theirs. A Christian inscription at Ephesus suggests why so little remains at the site:\nDestroying the delusive image of the demon Artemis, Demeas has erected this symbol of Truth, the God that drives away idols, and the Cross of priests, deathless and victorious sign of Christ.\n\nThe assertion that the Ephesians thought that their cult image had fallen from the sky, though it was a familiar origin-myth at other sites, is only known at Ephesus from Acts 19:35:\n\nWhat man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?\n\nLynn LiDonnici observes that modern scholars are likely to be more concerned with origins of the Lady of Ephesus and her iconology than her adherents were at any point in time, and are prone to creating a synthetic account of the Lady of Ephesus by drawing together documentation that ranges over more than a millennium in its origins, creating a falsified, unitary picture, as of an unchanging icon.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It lies beside the junction of West Huifu Road and Liurong Rd. It is usually open to tourists daily from 9–12 in the morning and from 1:30–5 in the afternoon.\n\nThe five immortals honored by the temple are first attested in a passage of the 983 \"Taiping Imperial Readings\" () explaining Guangzhou's nickname \"City of the Rams\". One of the etiological myths given is that\nAt one time, Sun Hao made Teng Xiu a governor but, before reaching his prefecture, there were five immortals riding five colored sheep and bearing the five grains who came upon him and, after he received them, they left. Now the prefectural hall's beams bear the five immortals riding five colored sheep for good luck.\nThe other story, credited to the \"Records of Guangzhou\" () of Pei Yuan (), includes the rams and grain but omits the immortals and places the story in Chu during the ministry of Gao Gu.\n\nLater accounts of the immortals' local cult made them culture heroes who introduced rice farming to Guangzhou around the time of its founding, which occurred historically by the Qin army under Zhao Tuo in 214 . The immortals' clothes and the sheep were now both said to be in difference colors, connecting them with the Five Chinese Elements. The immortals continued to be worshipped as protectors of the yearly harvest. The five goats they rode to the area were said to have turned to stone when they left, forming the statues which gave Guangzhou its nickname \"Goat City\" or \"City of the Five Rams\".\n\nAn abbey and shrine to the five immortals is first attested during the early Song ( century), with rulers making sacrifices and locals offering prayer to them. The present temple was erected under the Ming in the 10th year of the Hongwu Era, either  1377 or 1378. Under the Qing, the site was also known as the .\n\nShortly after the installation of the temple's high, 5-ton bell in 1378, there was an outbreak of plague in the city. Considered unlucky ever afterward, the \"Forbidden Bell\" has not been rung since. In the 19th century, the guardian lions at the entrance to the temple were venerated by local women seeking male children. \n\nThe original temple on Great Market Street burnt down in 1878. It was rebuilt in 1889, with its main hall honoring Shangdi and side areas devoted to the five immortals. \n\nIn 1923, the temple grounds covered ; that year, the KMT lords of the town ordered it to be sold to raise revenue for their soldiers. It was purchased by a local club, who dismissed its Taoist priests, but its site was given special protection by the municipal government. Following the opening up of China in the 1980s, the temple was renovated.\n\nThe huge bell tower dates to the Ming and the main hall before it is still done in the Ming style. The guardian lions at the entrance are centuries old and there are stylized Ming-era sculptures in back as well. A pond to the east of the hall includes a very large foot-shaped depression in red sandstone said to be the mark of one of the temple's immortals. The present statues depict the immortals as three men and two women, all astride their goats.\n\nA back room holds a large 1907 map of Guangzhou, showing interesting details of the imperial city and illuminating that most of the city was, at that time, still rural.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in India in 1879 by Helena Blavatsky, who was also its editor. The journal is still being published till date. For the year 1930, the journal was published in Hollywood, California by Annie Besant and Marie Russak Hotchener, but it returned to Adyar in 1931. The journal features articles about philosophy, art, literature and occultism.\n\nThe Theosophical Society was officially formed in New York City, United States, on 17 November 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and others. The society's initial objective was the \"study and elucidation of Occultism, the Cabala etc.\"\n\nIt established its roots in India in 1879, winning its supporters by its portrayal of sympathy for the native population, by its enthusiasm for the Aryan philosophy, and by its strange dogmas and obscure beliefs. The main objectives of the society were to establish British India as a center of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, to study the Aryan culture and to explore the hidden mysteries and inherent powers in men.\n\nThe first centre was established in Bombay, but the society soon installed a network of branches throughout India, and its journal, \"The Theosophist\", was circulated extensively throughout the three Presidencies.\n\nDue to its widespread circulation, \"The Theosophist\" has been heavily linked with the politics of British India. Despite not explicitly stating any political agendas as of yet, it has been associated with the formation of Congress.\n\nAccording to the later account of Annie Besant, it was discovered that the decision to convene the first Congress in Madras was taken on the recommendation of the Theosophical Society after its convention of December 1884. The success of the periodical publications of the journal has been identified as an encouragement for many of the Indian leaders to experiment by forming an Indian political congress.\n\nUntil 1909, \"The Theosophist\" was printed by Messrs. Thompson & Co., Printers, in Madras (now Chennai). The journey between headquarters in Adyar and the printer in Madras was troublesome as it involved a jolting carriage ride that could take an hour each way. Colonel Olcott wished to have a printing company at Adyar for the journal and other publications, but that did not occur until 1909, when the Vasanṭā Press was established under the presidency of Annie Besant. Hand-powered equipment was used for printing initially. In October 1911, a larger type was introduced for improved legibility. The number of copies printed grew from 400 in the first issue to 800 in 1909 and 4000 two years later.\n\nIn 1936, President George S. Arundale reshaped the journal into being more of a magazine for a general readership. He appointed an American Editorial Committee that was associated with the Editorial Board at Adyar. The three members were Fritz Kunz, Professor H. Douglas Wild, and Claude Bragdon. The announcement stated:\n\n\"Beginning with January, 1936, The Theosophist will be edited as far as possible in the interest of the general public, publishing articles which will relate religion, science, philosophy, psychology, politics, industry, etc., to the science of Theosophy in a manner calculated to arouse the interest of the public. The Theosophical World, an enlargement of Adyar News, will keep members in touch with the Society's special affairs and growth.\n\nThe American Editorial Committee has been requested to cooperate in the publication of The Theosophist through personal contributions, through gathering contributions from other qualified writers, and also, if possible, by making arrangements for advertisements.\"\n\n\n"}

While the Aztec, the Maya and the Inca were famous for their grand architecture with temples, pyramids and cities, the Muisca lived in simple wooden and reed \"bohíos\". The main skill of the Muisca was their goldworking. The Muisca made pectoral pieces, nose rings (\"narigueras\"), earrings, plates, \"poporos\" and other figures from the gold they traded with the surrounding indigenous groups, such as the Muzo, Panche, Guane, Pijao and others. One of the most common finds of these gold or \"tumbaga\" figures are the \"tunjos\".\n\nTunjos were small figures picturing people, the deities of the Muisca religion or animals. They were used for three purposes; as ornaments in the graves of the Muisca people, from various social classes, as decoration at the entrances of temples and shrines, which once filled were buried in secret places by the Muisca priests and as offer ritual figures in the sacred lakes and rivers of the Muisca.\n\n\"Tunjos\" have been uncovered in Lake Guatavita, Bosa River; the part of the Bogotá River west of the Bogotá neighbourhood Bosa, and in various other sacred sites of the Muisca. \"Tunjos\" have been found in caves too. In 2001, a farmer found three \"tunjos\" in Carmen de Carupa, Cundinamarca. Exactly the same figures have been found up to the Valle del Cauca in the south of Colombia. The Pijao also made \"tunjos\".\n\nThe Muisca used to make matrixes or moulds of rock types such as shales and obsidian and poured their molten gold or \"tumbaga\" into the matrix. When the metals were cooled and solidified, they removed the stone moulds and the \"tunjos\" remained. To create the 2D \"tunjos\", they used a lost-wax casting process using beeswax to make the figure, put the wax \"tunjo\" in clay, that was heated to evaporate the wax and the gold or \"tumbaga\" was poured into the empty space left.\n\nThe design of the majority of tunjos appears to have gold wire soldered or brazed onto their surface. This, however, is not the case and analysis of the dendrites formed in the metal has shown that they have in fact been cast as one piece.\n\nVarious \"tunjos\" have been analysed with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) giving the following results:\n\nOf the relatively few Muisca artefacts that can be found in museums outside of Colombia, the \"tunjos\" are most common. \"Tunjos\" are in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History, Art Institute Chicago, Baltimore Museum of Art, British Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Hunt Museum (listed as \"possible Peruvian\" [sic]), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Princeton University Art Museum, Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28697030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28697030", "title": "Vaishnava Padavali", "text": "Vaishnava Padavali\n\nThe Vaishnava Padavali () movement refers to a period in\nmedieval Bengali literature from the 15th to 17th centuries, marked by an efflorescence of Vaishnava poetry often focusing on the Radha-Krishna legend. The term \"padavali\" (also written padaabali) has the literal meaning \"gathering of songs\" (\"pada\"=short verse, lyric; \"+vali\" = plural; collection).\n\nThe padavali poetry reflects an earthy view of divine love which had its roots in the \"Agam\"\npoetry of Tamil Sangam literature (600 BC–300 AD) and spread into early medieval Telugu (Nannaya, Annamayya) and Kannada literatures (Dasa sahitya). The poetic themes spread rapidly as part of the religious Bhakti movement that proposed an intensely personal form of devotion, following the philosophy of Ramanuja and opposing caste distinctions and other brahministic measures implicit in the theism of Adi Shankaracharya. The movement spread out and attained a pan-India status during the 13th–17th centuries.\n\nThe accompanying literary movements were marked by a shift from the classical language of Sanskrit, to the local languages (apabhramsha) or derivatives, e.g. the literary language of brajabuli adopted by Vidyapati (14th century).\n\nVidyapati in Mithila (14th century) and Chandidas (late 14th century) in Birbhum. Chandidas was among the earliest poets in the nascent Bengali language, and many of his poems deal with the Radha-Krishna theme.\n\nIn 1474, Maladhar Basu translated the 10th and 11th cantos of the Sanskrit Srimad Bhagavatam (composed c. 9th century), into the Bengali poem \"SriKrsnaVijay\". Maladhar focused on Krishna's divine life, with the 10th canto relating the legends of Krishna as a child, and his Leela with the Gopis in Vrindavana. He was honoured by Rukunuddin Barbak Shah with the title \"Gunaraj Khan\".\n\nAlthough neither Chandidas nor Maladhar Basu were Vaishnavas, they were to lay the foundation for much of the following Vaishnava poetry in Bengal.\n\nVaishnavism in Bengal was given a tremendous boost by Sri Chaitanya (1486–1533), whose intense spiritualism infected many and started a movement across many regions of India. Chaitanya emphasized the role of merely uttering God's name in obtaining emancipation, and songs, sung passionately and leading to a trance-like state, were central to the path of bhakti. Chaitanya himself wrote many (source - ? gaudiya-vaishnavas say, that Chaitanya left only one song: Shikshashtaka) songs on the Radha-Krishna theme, and certainly encouraged the composition of new songs.\n\nMajor poets in the ensuing padavali tradition included Murari Gupta (\"srikriShNachaitanyacharitrAmr^ta\"), Narahari Sarkar, Basudev Ghosh, Lochandas, Jnanadas, Govindadas, Balaram Das, Syed Sultan and Dwija Chandidas (16th century). The 17th century saw the work of Kaviranjan (\"chhoto Vidyapati\"), Kavishekhar, Radhaballabh Das, Ghanashyam Das and Ramgopal Das; and were followed in the 18th century by Vaisnavadas, Chandrashekhar, Radhamohan Thakur (\"padAmr^tasamudra\"), Narahari Chakravarty (\"gItachandroday\"), Yadunandan and others. Many of the original texts are lost (some may never have been composed, as the songs came down in the kirtan tradition). The later anthology \"pAdakalpataru\" collects about 3000 Vaishnava lyrics by 150 poets.\n\nThe subject matter of the poetry is the love of Radha and Krishna, on the banks of the Yamuna in Vrindavana; their secret trysts in the forests, Krishna's charms including his magic flute, the love of the gopis for Krishna, Radha's viraha on being separated from Krishna and her anguish on seeing him sporting with the other gopis. Much of the poetry, though written by men, focuses on the feelings of a woman in love. Here is a poem from Chandidas, where Radha is talking to a friend:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\">\nHow can I describe his relentless flute,\nwhich pulls virtuous women from their homes\nand drags them by their hair to Shyam\nas thirst and hunger pull the doe to the snare?\nChaste ladies forget their wisdom,\nand clinging vines shakes loose from their trees,\nhearing that music.\nThen how shall a simple dairymaid withstands its call?\n\nChandidasa says, Kala the puppet master leads the dance.\n– trans. Edward C Dimock and Denise Levertov, \"In praise of Krishna\", p. 18 \n</poem>\nMany of the poets were influenced by the Maithili poet Vidyapati, and some, such as Govindadas, also composed in the brajabuli language.\n\nVaishnava music was extremely influential in the evolution of Indian musical tradition. In the 14th century, Amir Khusro, who spent some time in the court at Bengal, was exposed to the Vaishnavite tradition. With the rise of Vrindavana 14th century onwards, there was an admixture of the strains of devotional music from different regions of India. Followers of Vallabhacharya of Andhra and Nimbarkacharya of Maharashtra rubbed shoulders with Vaishnava composers from Bengal and Bihar. Eminent musicians such as Swami Haridas (16th century), reputedly the teacher of Tansen, lived here.\n\nThe songs are often set to a romantic raga such as Pilu or Desh, and borrow freely from folk tunes and other traditions.\n\nThis musical tradition continues to be popular in Bengal with the Bauls and other kirtaniya groups, who include Sufi Muslims among their practitioners.\n\nVaishnava padavali left a lasting mark on Bengali literature. Among others, Rabindranath Tagore was deeply impressed by this music, and wrote many Vaishnava and Baul pieces. His opera \"Bhanusingher Padavali\" was composed in the Brajabuli language of Vidyapati.\n"}
{"id": "11506085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11506085", "title": "Xuanwu (god)", "text": "Xuanwu (god)\n\nXuanwu ( \"Dark Warrior\" or \"Mysterious Warrior\") or Xuandi (玄帝 \"Dark Deity\"), also known as Zhenwu (真武) or Zhenwudadi (真武大帝 \"True Warrior Great Deity\"), is a deity in Chinese religion, one of the higher-ranking deities in Taoism. He is revered as a powerful god, able to control the elements and capable of great magic. He is identified as the god of the north \"Heidi\" (黑帝 \"Black Deity\") and is particularly revered by martial artists. He is the patron god of Hebei, Henan, Manchuria and Mongolia. As some Han Chinese (now the modern-day Cantonese and Fujianese peoples) migrated into the south from Hebei and Henan during the Tang-Song era, Xuanwu is also widely revered in the Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian provinces, as well as among the overseas diaspora.\n\nSince the usurping Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty claimed the help of Xuanwu during his successful Jingnan Campaign against his nephew, he had Taoist monasteries constructed in the Wudang Mountains of Hubei, where Xuanwu allegedly attained immortality.\n\nOne story says that Xuanwu was originally a prince of Jing Le State in northern Hebei during the time of the Yellow Emperor. As he grew up, he felt the sorrow and pain of the life of ordinary people and wanted to retire to a remote mountain for cultivation of the Tao.\n\nAnother says that Xuanwu was originally a butcher who had killed many animals unremorsefully. As days passed, he felt remorse for his sins and repented immediately by giving up butchery and retired to a remote mountain for cultivation of the Tao.\n\nOne day while he was assisting a woman in labor, while cleaning the woman’s blood stained clothes along a river, the words \"Dark (or Mysterious) Heavenly Highest Deity\" (玄天上帝 \"Xuántiān Shàngdì\") appeared before him. The woman in labor turned out to be a manifestation of the goddess Guanyin. To redeem his sins, he dug out his own stomach and intestines and washed them in the river. The river then became dark and murky. After a while, the river flowed clear and pure once again.\n\nUnfortunately, Xuanwu lost his stomach and intestines while he was washing them in the river. The Jade Emperor was moved by his sincerity and determination to clear his sins. The Jade Emperor made him an immortal with the title of \"Xuántiān Shàngdì\".\n\nAfter he became an immortal, his stomach and intestines absorbed the essence of the earth. His viscera transformed into a demonic turtle, and a demonic snake, who started to hurt people. No one could subdue the demonic animals. Eventually, Xuanwu returned to earth to subdue them. After defeating them, he later used them as his means of transportation.\n\nXuanwu is sometimes portrayed with two generals standing besides him, General Wan Gong (萬公) and General Wan Ma (萬媽). The two generals are deities that handle many local issues from children's birth, medication, family matters as well as fengshui consultation.\n\nXuanwu is portrayed as a warrior in dark-coloured imperial robes, his left hand holding the \"three mountain seal\", somewhat similar to Guan Yu's hand seal, while his right hand is holding a sword, which is said to have belonged to Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals.\n\nAnother legend says that he borrowed the sword from Lü Dongbin to subdue a strong demon, and after being successful, he refused to bring it back after witnessing the sword's power. The sword itself would magically return to its owner if Xuanwu released it, so it is said that he always holds his sword tightly and is unable to release it. However, not only does he outrank Lü in terms of divinity, Xuanwu also dates back longer in history than Lü Dongbin, putting this claim in suspect.\n\nHe is usually seated on a throne with the right foot stepping on the snake and left leg extended stepping on the turtle. His face is usually red with bulging eyes. His birthday is celebrated on the third day of the third lunar month.\n\nIn Indonesia, almost every Taoist temples provides an altar for Xuantian Shangdi. The story states that the first temple that worshiped him was a temple at Welahan Town, Jepara, Central Java. And the temples that was built in honor of him are the temple at Gerajen and Bugangan, Semarang City, Central Java. His festival is celebrated annually every the 25th day, 2nd month, of Chinese calendar. The worshipers of Chen Fu Zhen Ren, especially at Tik Liong Tian Temple, Rogojampi, Banyuwangi Regency, East Java, believe that Xuantian Shangdi is their patron deity. That's why they put his altar at the right side of Chen Fu Zhen Ren’s altar, in the middle room of the temple which is always reserved for the main deity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32504038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32504038", "title": "Yoshida Shintō", "text": "Yoshida Shintō\n\nYoshida Shintō reversed the \"honji suijaku\" teaching of Shin-Butsu Shuugo promulgated by Kukai in the Heian Period, asserting that the Buddhist deities were manifestations of the Shintō kami, not the other way around. Yoshida Shinto held that Shintō was the primal religion of the world, which in turn gave rise to Buddhism and Confucianism. However, Shintō was seen not only as the source of creation, but also as the source of all principle in the world. In this sense, Shinto was seen as a divine essence or energy rather than a teaching. This essence was seen as present in all beings at birth, but obscured petty desires and needs, which prevented Man from aligning himself with the Way of the Gods.\n\nAmong the ethic \"principles\" in Yoshida Shintō and took on a great meaning within the sect. These key virtues were linked to well-known Shintō rites as harae or misogi purification ceremonies. Yoshida Shinto redefined and redesigned such traditional rites in a fashion borrowed from Esoteric Buddhism. Also, its doctrines are formulated in the elliptical discourse of Esoteric Buddhism, which makes sense only in combination with ritual practice. Rites took on significance not just as an outward form of purity, but as means to achieve inner purity as well and cultivating the necessary virtues towards makoto. These concepts may be related to Buddhist salvation but in contrast to Buddhism, Yoshida Shinto rejected celibacy and the idea that human life always leads to suffering. There is no clear conception of the afterlife, however.\n\nYoshida Shintō was an esoteric tradition also in terms of priestly organisation in that it consisted of several ranks achieved through secret initiations, with the highest rank accorded to only one man at a time, who would carry on the Yoshida family name. In cases where a suitable heir was lacking, one was adopted.\n\nIn spite of their alleged antiquity, Yoshida doctrines were created by Yoshida Kanetomo (1435–1511) who served the Imperial Court in the Department of Shintō Affairs. Yoshida Shinto gained prominence during the Momoyama period, when the family was involved in the deification of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and enhanced its influence during the Edo period under Yoshikawa Koretaru (1616–94), a Yoshida scion (but not a family member) with excellent contacts to the ruling elites in Edo. Koretaru was probably the driving force behind the fact that the Yoshida were decreed the de facto supervisors of all lesser Shinto shrines in the official \"Regulations for Shrine priests\" (\"Shosha negi kannushi hatto\" 諸社禰宜神主法度) of 1665. Later, however, Koretaru created his own version of Shintō (Yoshikawa Shintō) with an emphasis on self-reflection and the nature of the Kami to Man, as well as Man's role in society (with an emphasis on the lord-vassal relationship common during this period).\n\nEarly Neo-Confucian scholars in Japan such as Hayashi Razan and Yamazaki Ansai likely encountered Yoshida Shintō during their time as Buddhist priests, when guest lectures by Yoshida Shintō priests were common. However, later when Neo-Confucian teachings gained prominence, these thinkers formulated their own theories and doctrines on the relationship between Confucianism and Shintō and criticized Yoshida Shintō for being influenced by Buddhism. Nevertheless, Yoshida vocabulary and Yoshida ideas can still be found in their writings. This trend persisted until the rise of National Learning which sought to separate Shintō from both Buddhism and Confucianism and thus developed a completely new discourse on the native \"kami\".\n\nIn terms of institutional history, Yoshida Shintō was dominant until the late Edo period but decreased rapidly during the 19th century and has left hardly any trace in contemporary Japanese shrine worship. The Yoshida family's collection of ancient texts, however, still forms one of the most important sources of Shinto. Large parts of it are now stored in the library of Tenri University in Nara Prefecture.\n\n\n"}
