{"id": "79845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79845", "title": "Amarna", "text": "Amarna\n\nAmarna (; ) is an extensive Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established (1346 BC) and built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and abandoned shortly after his death (1332 BC). The name for the city employed by the ancient Egyptians is written as Akhetaten (or Akhetaton—transliterations vary) in English transliteration. Akhetaten means \"Horizon of the Aten\".\n\nThe area is located on the east bank of the Nile River in the modern Egyptian province of Minya, some south of the city of al-Minya, south of the Egyptian capital Cairo and north of Luxor. The city of Deir Mawas lies directly west across from the site of Amarna. Amarna, on the east side, includes several modern villages, chief of which are el-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.\n\nThe area was also occupied during later Roman and early Christian times; excavations to the south of the city have found several structures from this period.\n\nThe name Amarna comes from the Beni Amran tribe that lived in the region and founded a few settlements. The ancient Egyptian name was Akhetaten.\n\nEnglish Egyptologist, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna twice in the 1820s and identified it as 'Alabastron', following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors Pliny (\"On Stones\") and Ptolemy (\"Geography\"), although he was not sure about the identification and suggested Kom el-Ahmar as an alternative location.\n\nThe area of the city was effectively a virgin site, and it was in this city that the Akhetaten described as the Aten's\n\"seat of the First Occasion, which he had made for himself that he might rest in it.\"\nIt may be that the Royal Wadi's resemblance to the hieroglyph for \"horizon\" showed that this was the place to found the city.\n\nThe city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mud-brick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.\n\nIt is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan, in large part because the city was abandoned after the death of Akhenaten, when Akhenaten's son, King Tutankhamun, decided to leave the city and return to his birthplace in Thebes (modern Luxor). The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign, if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Amarna was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city's population. The entire city was encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae detailing Akhenaten's conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.\n\nThe earliest dated stele from Akhenaten's new city is known to be \"Boundary stele K\" which is dated to Year 5, IV Peret (or month 8), day 13 of Akhenaten's reign. (Most of the original 14 boundary stelae have been badly eroded.) It preserves an account of Akhenaten's foundation of this city. The document records the pharaoh's wish to have several temples of the Aten to be erected here, for several royal tombs to be created in the eastern hills of Amarna for himself, his chief wife Nefertiti and his eldest daughter Meritaten as well as his explicit command that when he was dead, he would be brought back to Amarna for burial. Boundary stela K introduces a description of the events that were being celebrated at Amarna:\n\nThis text then goes on to state that Akhenaten made a great oblation to the god Aten \"and this is the theme [of the occasion] which is illustrated in the lunettes of the stelae where he stands with his queen and eldest daughter before an altar heaped with offerings under the Aten, while it shines upon him rejuvenating his body with its rays.\"\n\nLocated on the east bank of the Nile, the ruins of the city are laid out roughly north to south along a \"Royal Road\", now referred to as \"Sikhet es-Sultan\". The Royal residences are generally to the north, in what is known as the North City, with a central administration and religious area and the south of the city is made up of residential suburbs.\n\nIf one approached the city of Amarna from the north by river the first buildings past the northern boundary stele would be the North Riverside Palace. This building ran all the way up to the waterfront and was likely the main residence of the Royal Family. Located within the North City area is the Northern Palace, the main residence of the Royal Family. Between this and the central city, the Northern Suburb was initially a prosperous area with large houses, but the house size decreased and became poorer the further from the road they were.\n\nMost of the important ceremonial and administrative buildings were located in the central city. Here the Great Temple of the Aten and the Small Aten Temple were used for religious functions and between these the Great Royal Palace and Royal Residence were the ceremonial residence of the King and Royal Family, and were linked by a bridge or ramp. Located behind the Royal Residence was the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, where the Amarna Letters were found.\n\nThis area was probably the first area to be completed, and had at least two phases of construction.\n\nTo the south of the city was the area now referred to as the \"Southern Suburbs\". It contained the estates of many of the city's powerful nobles, including Nakhtpaaten (Chief Minister), Ranefer, Panehesy (High Priest of the Aten) and Ramose (Master of Horses). This area also held the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, where the famous bust of Nefertiti was found in 1912.\n\nFurther to the south of the city was Kom el-Nana, an enclosure, usually referred to as a \"sun-shade\", and was probably built as a sun-temple., and then the Maru-Aten, which was a palace or sun-temple originally thought to have been constructed for Akhenaten's queen Kiya, but on her death her name and images were altered to those of Meritaten, his daughter.\n\nSurrounding the city and marking its extent, the Boundary Stelae (each a rectangle of carved rock on the cliffs on both sides of the Nile) describing the founding of the city are a primary source of information about it.\n\nAway from the city Akhenaten's Royal necropolis was started in a narrow valley to the east of the city, hidden in the cliffs. Only one tomb was completed, and was used by an unnamed Royal Wife, and Akhenaten's tomb was hastily used to hold him and likely Meketaten, his second daughter.\nIn the cliffs to the north and south of the Royal Wadi, the nobles of the city constructed their Tombs.\n\nMuch of what is known about Amarna's founding is due to the preservation of a series of official boundary stelae (13 are known) ringing the perimeter of the city. These are cut into the cliffs on both sides of the Nile (10 on the east, 3 on the west) and record the events of Akhetaten (Amarna) from founding to just before its fall.\n\nTo make the move from Thebes to Amarna, Akhenaten needed the support of the military. Ay, one of Akhenaten's principal advisors, exercised great influence in this area because his father Yuya had been an important military leader. Additionally, everyone in the military had grown up together, they had been a part of the richest and most successful period in Egypt's history under Akhenaten's father, so loyalty among the ranks was strong and unwavering. Perhaps most importantly, \"it was a military whose massed ranks the king took every opportunity to celebrate in temple reliefs, first at Thebes and later at Amarna.\"\n\nWhile the reforms of Akhenaten are generally believed to have been oriented towards a sort of monotheism, this may be rather oversimplifying to state than monolatrism. Archaeological evidence shows other deities were also revered, even at the centre of the Aten cult – if not officially, then at least by the people who lived and worked there.\n..at Akhetaten itself, recent excavation by Kemp (2008: 41-46) has shown the presence of objects that depict gods, goddesses and symbols that belong to the traditional field of personal belief. So many examples of Bes, the grotesque dwarf figure who warded off evil spirits, have been found, as well as of the goddess-monster, Taweret, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, who was associated with childbirth. Also in the royal workmen’s village at Akhetaten, stelae dedicated to Isis and Shed have been discovered (Watterson 1984: 158 and 208).\n\nThe Amarna art-style broke with long-established Egyptian conventions. Unlike the strict idealistic formalism of previous Egyptian art, it depicted its subjects more realistically. These included informal scenes, such as intimate portrayals of affection within the royal family or playing with their children, and no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art also had a realism that sometimes borders on caricature.\n\nWhile the worship of Aten was later referred to as the Amarna heresy and suppressed, this art had a more lasting legacy.\n\nThe first western mention of the city was made in 1714 by Claude Sicard, a French Jesuit priest who was travelling through the Nile Valley, and described the boundary stela from Amarna. As with much of Egypt, it was visited by Napoleon's \"corps de savants\" in 1798–1799, who prepared the first detailed map of Amarna, which was subsequently published in \"Description de l'Égypte\" between 1821 and 1830.\n\nAfter this European exploration continued in 1824 when Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist Robert Hay and his surveyor G. Laver visited the locality and uncovered several of the Southern Tombs from sand drifts, recording the reliefs in 1833. The copies made by Hay and Laver languish largely unpublished in the British Library, where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.\n\nThe Prussian expedition led by Richard Lepsius visited the site in 1843 and 1845, and recorded the visible monuments and topography of Amarna in two separate visits over a total of twelve days, using drawings and paper squeezes. The results were ultimately published in \"Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien\" between 1849 and 1913, including an improved map of the city. Despite being somewhat limited in accuracy, the engraved \"Denkmäler\" plates formed the basis for scholastic knowledge and interpretation of many of the scenes and inscriptions in the private tombs and some of the Boundary Stelae for the rest of the century. The records made by these early explorers teams are of immense importance since many of these remains were later destroyed or otherwise lost.\n\nIn 1887 a local woman digging for \"sebakh\" uncovered a cache of over 300 cuneiform tablets (now commonly known as the Amarna Letters). These tablets recorded select diplomatic correspondence of the Pharaoh and were predominantly written in Akkadian, the \"lingua franca\" commonly used during the Late Bronze Age of the Ancient Near East for such communication. This discovery led to the recognition of the importance of the site, and lead to a further increase in exploration.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1892 Alessandro Barsanti 'discovered' and cleared the king's tomb (although it was probably known to the local population from about 1880). Around the same time Sir Flinders Petrie worked for one season at Amarna, working independently of the Egypt Exploration Fund. He excavated primarily in the Central City, investigating the Great Temple of the Aten, the Great Official Palace, the King's House, the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh and several private houses. Although frequently amounting to little more than a sondage (survey), Petrie's excavations revealed additional cuneiform tablets, the remains of several glass factories, and a great quantity of discarded faience, glass and ceramic in sifting the palace rubbish heaps (including Mycenaean sherds). By publishing his results and reconstructions rapidly, Petrie was able to stimulate further interest in the site's potential.\n\nThe copyist and artist Norman de Garis Davies published drawn and photographic descriptions of private tombs and boundary stelae from Amarna from 1903 to 1908. These books were republished by the EES in 2006.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century (1907 to 1914) the Deutsche Orientgesellschaft expedition, led by Ludwig Borchardt, excavated extensively throughout the North and South suburbs of the city. The famous bust of Nefertiti, now in Berlin's Ägyptisches Museum, was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 terminated the German excavations.\n\nFrom 1921 to 1936 an Egypt Exploration Society expedition returned to excavation at Amarna under the direction of T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort, Stephen Glanville and John Pendlebury. Mary Chubb served as the digs administrator. The renewed investigations were focused on religious and royal structures.\n\nDuring the 1960s the Egyptian Antiquities Organization (now the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities) undertook a number of excavations at Amarna.\n\nExploration of the city continues to the present, currently under the direction of Barry Kemp (Emeritus Professor in Egyptology, University of Cambridge, England) (until 2006, under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Society and now with the Amarna Project). In 1980 a separate expedition led by Geoffrey Martin described and copied the reliefs from the Royal Tomb, later publishing its findings together with objects thought to have come from the tomb. This work was published in 2 volumes by the EES.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2013, the Amarna Project excavated at a cemetery of private individuals, close to the southern tombs of the Nobles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8119150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8119150", "title": "Babul (Hindi word)", "text": "Babul (Hindi word)\n\nBabul ( Hindi: बाबुल, Pronounced: \"bəˈbo͞ol\" ) () is an old Urdu-Hindi term for father indicating a daughter's affection. The term is now mainly used in Bollywood songs in the context of a newly married daughter leaving her father's home.\n\nIn India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the conclusion of a daughter's marriage, marked by the bidaai (farewell) ceremony, is a profoundly sad occasion, because after this she leaves her father's house and permanently relocates to her husband's family. The moment thus marks the end of her past life and the beginning of a new one. The expression of this sentiment varies, but is usually in the formed of hushed sobs, while maintaining sober calmness and composure. This sentiment is often reflected in Bollywood and regional films.\n\nWajid Ali Shah (1822–1887), the last nawab of Awadh, wrote a popular bhairavi thumri \"Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaye\", where he likens bidai to death, and his own banishment for his beloved Lucknow (video search for Saigal's 1938 rendition):\n\nबाबुल मोरा, नैहर छूटो ही जाए\nचार कहार मिल, मोरी डोलिया उठायें ... \nमोरा अपना बेगाना छूटो जाए | ... \nआँगना तो पर्बत भयो और देहरी भयी बिदेश ... \nजाए बाबुल घर आपनो मैं चली पीया के देश | बाबुल मोरा ...\n\n\"Translation: My father! I'm leaving home.\"\n\"The four bearers lift my doli (palanquin) (here it can also mean the four coffin bearers)\".\n\"I'm leaving those who were my own.\"\n\"Your courtyard is now like a mountain, and the threshold, a foreign country.\"\n\"I leave your house, father, I am going to my beloved.\n\nThe expression is found in the Sanskrit texts also. In Abhijñānaśākuntalam the sage Kanva, who had adopted Shakuntala, mourns:\n\nयास्यत्यद्य शकुन्तलेति हृदयं संस्पृष्टमुत्कण्ठया ..\nऐक्लव्यं मम तावदीदृशमिदं स्नेहादरण्यौकसः\nपीड्यन्ते गृहिणः कथं नु तनयाविश्लेषदुःखैर्नवैः||६||\n\n\"Shakuntala must go to-day, I miss her now at heart ..\"\n\"What must a father feel, when come\"\n\"The pangs of parting from his child at home?\"\n\nThis word Babul has been used in Gurbani, the Sikh scripture few times. Babul means father. God has been referred to as Babul in Gurbani.\n\nਬਾਬੁਲੁ ਮੇਰਾ ਵਡ ਸਮਰਥਾ ਕਰਣ ਕਾਰਣ ਪ੍ਰਭੁ ਹਾਰਾ ॥\nMy father (Babul, God) is all powerful and capable. He is the doer and cause of everything.\n\nMany Bollywood movies have songs on the babul theme. There have been several movies that use the term \"babul\" in the title: \"Babul (1950 film)\", \"Baabul (2006 film)\", \"Babul Ka Aangann Chootey Na\" (it is hard to leave father's courtyard) and \"Babul Ki Galiyaan\" (father's streets).\n\nA song by Sahir Ludhiyanvi from 1968 film \"Neel Kamal\" is often played in Indian weddings is\n\n\"Baabul ki duaaen leti ja, ja tujh ko sukhi sansaar mile\"\n\nबाबुल की दुआएं लेती जा, जा तुझ को सुखी संसार मिले\n\nनाज़ों से तुझे पाला मैनें, कलियों की तरह, फूलों की तरह\nबचपन में झुलाया है तुझ को, बाँहों ने मेरी झूलों कि तरह\nमेरे बाग़ की ऐ नाज़ुक डाली, तुझे हर पल नई बहार मिले |\n\n\"Take your father's blessing! May you find a happy world.\"\n\n\"I raised you tenderly with love, like a flower,\"\n\"I used to swing you in my own arms like a swing.\"\n\"O delicate branch of my garden, may you always find spring.\"\n\nIt is said that the singer Mohammad Rafi sang this song just before his own daughter's marriage.\n\nShakeel Badayuni wrote this song for the 1957 classic \"Mother India\":\n\n\"Pee ke ghar aaj pyaari dulhaniya chali\"\n\nपी के घर आज प्यारी दुल्हनिया चली\nरोएं माता पिता उनकी दुनिया चली\n\nमेरी क़िस्मत में जाता था परदेस रे\nछोड़ कर अपने बाबुल का आँगन चली\n\n\"The bride leaves today for her beloved's house.\"\n\"The father and mother cry, their world is going away.\"\n\"It was my fate to go to a distant land,\"\n\"I leave, leaving behind my father's courtyard.\"\n\nIn the month of Savan (Shravana), the bride is supposed to return to her father home, now as an outsider. A song by Shailendra (movie Bandini) expresses this (video search):\n\nअब के बरस भेज भैयाको बाबुल \nसावन में लीजो बुलाय रे\nलौटेंगी जब मेरे बचपन की सखियाँ\nदीजो संदेशा भिजाय रे\n\nThis year, father, send my brother,\nto come and get me during Savan,\nwhen my childhood friends will also return,\ndo send a message asking me to come.\n\nThis song forms the title of a 2002 film Ab Ke Baras.\n\n"}

For example, the Cathars did not survive Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229) and massacre at Montségur (1244) to leave traces of Cathar apologetics.\n\nThe Crusades also formed the background to medieval Christian criticism of Islam and medieval Islamic criticism of Christianity, resulting in conflicting responses from Christian authors of chivalrous epics and hostile theological polemics. Peter the Venerable's commission of a Latin translation of the Qur'an, was followed by polemical writings from Pedro Pascual, Riccoldo da Monte di Croce \"Contra legem Sarracenorum\" \"Against the Quran of the Saracens\" (1300), and Ramon Llull.\n\nVirulent antisemitism in medieval Europe obviated the need for any debate or discussion in most periods and most countries. However, during the 12th Century converted Jews such as Petrus Alfonsi and Pablo Christiani, well versed in Jewish religion, initiated the \"Contra Iudaeos\" (or \"Adversus Iudaeos\") literature either from missionary or polemic reasons.

It attained perihelion on 28 December that same year.\n\nComet Kohoutek is a long-period comet; its previous apparition was about 150,000 years ago, and its next apparition will be in about 75,000 years. At its apparition in 1973, it had a hyperbolic trajectory (e > 1) due to gravitational perturbations from giant planets. Due to its path, scientists theorized that Kohoutek was an Oort-cloud object. As such, it was believed that this was the comet's first visit to the inner Solar System, which would result in a spectacular display of outgassing. Infrared and visual telescopic study have led many scientists to conclude, in retrospect, that Kohoutek is actually an Edgeworth/Kuiper-belt object, which would account for its apparent rocky makeup and lack of outgassing.\n\nBefore its close approach, Kohoutek was promoted by the media as the \"comet of the century\". However, Kohoutek's display was considered a let-down, possibly due to partial disintegration when the comet closely approached the Sun prior to its Earth flyby. Since this was probably the comet's first visit to the inner Solar System, it would have still contained large amounts of frozen volatiles since its formation. Although it failed to brighten to levels expected, it was still a naked-eye object. Its greatest visual magnitude was −3, when it was at perihelion, from the Sun. Its orbital inclination is 14.3°. Its best viewing was in the night sky after perihelion, when it had dimmed to fourth magnitude. The comet also sported a tail up to 25° long, along with an anti-tail.\n\nThis comet was observed by the crews of Skylab 4 and Soyuz 13, thus becoming the first comet to be observed by a manned spacecraft, since Apollo 13's planned observations of the prominent naked-eye Comet Bennett were aborted by the moon-bound craft's oxygen-tank explosion.\n\nC/1973 E1 should not be confused with the periodic comet 75D/Kohoutek, which can also be called \"Comet Kohoutek\". In addition, there are another two long-period comets, C/1969 O1-A (a.k.a. 1970 III, 1969b), and C/1973 D1 (a.k.a. 1973 VII, 1973e) also discovered by Luboš Kohoutek.\n\nBecause Comet Kohoutek fell far short of expectations, its name became synonymous with spectacular duds. However, it was fairly bright as comets go and put on a respectable show in the evenings shortly after perihelion.\n\nIn 1973, David Berg, founder of the Children of God, predicted that Comet Kohoutek foretold a colossal doomsday event in the United States in January 1974.

Loeb\n\nDaniel Seth Loeb (born December 18, 1961) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and chief executive of Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund focused on event-driven, value-oriented investing with $10.8 billion in assets under management, as of March 2016.\n\n\"New York magazine\" noted that Loeb's \"preferred strategy\" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which \"is the key to his success.\" Loeb was described as \"one of the most successful activists\" in 2014.\n\nLoeb is the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb. He was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.\n\nAt the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed \"Milo Minderbinder\" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel \"Catch-22\" who had a fascination with the stock market). His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma. His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian and independent scholar.\n\nLoeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc. In 2009, Loeb told an audience \"[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business.\"\n\nLoeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree. By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in \"overconcentrating positions\".\n\nFrom 1984-87, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing. After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991–94, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC, where he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.\n\nLoeb started Third Point Management in 1995 \"with $3.3 million from family and friends\". Under Loeb's guidance, Third Point Management's annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%. \nIn 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year. In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%. Loeb appeared in \"Forbes\"' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders. In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%. In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%. In 2017, it was reported the firm returned 18.1% net of fees in the first 11 months of the year.\n\nIn 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.\n\nOn May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years. Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012. \"Reuters\" then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.\n\nMarissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.\n\nIn May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.\n\nOn June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion. According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.\n\nActor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.\n\nAs of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was \"focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses.\" Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was \"long overdue.\"\n\nIn October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, \"They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company's fortunes\".\n\nIn October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's. It announced that Third Point had acquired \"9.3% of the outstanding shares\" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, \"we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years.\" The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—\"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East\"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.\n\nAfter Sotheby's instituted a \"poison pill\" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.\n\nAfter 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.\n\nIn late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided \"it would start talking to shareholders\" and \"return some of its cash to them.\" Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for \"shaking up Japanese firms.\"\n\nIn January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company's profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.\n\nIn April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had \"been sheltered from agitating investors.\" Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, \"Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders ... This isn't a dynasty. This is a corporation.\" Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.<ref name=\"Fortune - 7/11\"></ref>\n\nIn June 2017, Third Point disclosed its ownership of approximately 40 million shares of Nestlé, making it the company's sixth-largest shareholder according to Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"New York magazine\" noted that Loeb's \"preferred strategy\" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which \"is the key to his success.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for \"financial savvy\" and for \"his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights\". One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:\n\nLoeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. \"The moral-indignation business\", Loeb sometimes calls it. \"Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one.\"\n\nOften these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings. Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management. According to \"New York\" magazine, \"Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)\" A 2005 \"New Yorker\" \"The Talk of the Town\" item described him as \"a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken.\"\n\nIn a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) \"place in society\", telling the applicant that he would \"have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club.\" At Third Point, Loeb explained, \"'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally.\" Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson \"the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside.\"\n\nLoeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following \"a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics\", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.\n\nHe wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him \"one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America\" and accusing him of \"ineptitude\" and of using the firm as his \"personal 'honey pot'\". He wrote: \"I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record.\" Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's \"elderly 78-year old mom\" and insisted that Sevin also \"step down ... so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites.\"\n\nA 2005 \"The New York Times\" article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, \"Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'\"\n\nLoeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004, at his beach house in East Hampton, New York. The couple has three children.\n\nLoeb is a founding \"Master Player\" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.\n\nLoeb has called himself a \"lifelong surfer\" with \"a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean\". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia. Third Point takes its name from \"a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach.\"\n\nIn 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of \"prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation\".\n\nLoeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013). He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nLoeb currently sits on the Board of Directors of Sotheby's and is the chair of the Board of the Success Academy charter network.\n\nLoeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.\n\nAccording to \"Forbes Magazine\", his net worth is $3.2 billion USD as of February 16, 2018.\n\nThe Loeb Family - Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $45 million in assets at the end 2016.\n\nLoeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools. Chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn, he pledged, in June 2013, to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.\n\nHe endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.\n\nIn October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the \"MightyMan\" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.\n\nIn 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.\n\nLoeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.\n\nHe is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings\", according to a \"The New York Times\" August 26, 2013 article. At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' \"Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta)\" for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.\n\nLoeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The \"prep school kids\" treated him like a \"jerk\", thinking they \"all knew so much more\", but in the end \"I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't.\"\n\n\"Business Insider\" placed Loeb at the top of its list of \"Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors\", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he \"has his own curator.\"\n\nLoeb is an advocate for criminal justice reform and helps fund the Marshall Project, a nonprofit online journalism group, and the Brennan Center's Innocence Project. He is concerned with those unfairly imprisoned and successfully pushed for the release of Bernard Noble in April 2018, who served more than 7 years in prison for possessing two marijuana joints.\n\n"}

The position was established in the early 12th century.\n\nThe Dean presides over the College of Cardinals, serving as \"primus inter pares\" in the college. He always holds the rank of Cardinal Bishop. The Dean of the College of Cardinals is assisted by the Vice-Dean; in those roles they act as the president and vice-president of the college respectively. Both are elected by and from the Cardinal Bishops who are not Eastern Catholic patriarchs and subject to papal confirmation. Except for presiding, the Dean and Vice-Dean have no power over the other cardinals. In the order of precedence in the Catholic Church as the senior Cardinal Bishops, the Dean and Vice-Dean are placed second and third respectively after the pope. \n\nThe Dean is often, but not necessarily, the longest-serving member of the whole College. It had been customary for centuries for the longest-serving of the six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian sees to be Dean. This was required by canon law from 1917 until 1965, when Pope Paul VI empowered the six to elect the Dean from among their number. This election was a formality until the time of Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe Dean holds the position until death or resignation; there is no mandatory age of retirement.\n\nIt is the Dean's responsibility to summon the conclave for the purposes of electing a new pope following a death or resignation. The Dean presides over the conclave unless he is too old to vote in it. Additionally, the dean has the responsibility of communicating the \"news of the Pope's death to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See and to the Heads of the respective Nations\" and is the public face of the Holy See during the sede vacante period. It is the Dean, unless he is impeded, who asks the Pope-elect if he accepts the election, and then asks the new Pope what name he wishes to use. According to Canon 355 (from the Latin Code of Canon Law 1983), if the newly elected Supreme Pontiff is not already a bishop, it has always been the right of the Bishop of Ostia to ordain him.\n\nThe Cardinal Dean has \"the title of the diocese of Ostia, together with that of any other church to which he already has a title,\" such as his suburbicarian diocese. This has been the case since 1914, by decree of Pope Pius X—previous deans had given up their prior suburbicarian see for the joint title of Ostia and Velletri, which were separated in that same 1914 decree.\n\nNine Deans have been elected Pope: Anastasius IV, Lucius III, Gregory IX, Alexander IV, John XXI, Alexander VI, Paul III, Paul IV, Benedict XVI.\n\nThe following is the list of Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, separated into three groups to account for the Western Schism, which ended after the Council of Constance.

Huntington’s theory of a Clash of Civilizations. The term was initially used by Austrian philosopher Hans Köchler who in 1972, in a letter to UNESCO,\nhad suggested the idea of an international conference on the \"dialogue between different civilizations\" (\"dialogue entre les différentes civilisations\") and had organized, in 1974, a first international conference on the role of intercultural dialogue (\"The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations\") with the support and under the auspices of Senegalese President Léopold Sédar Senghor.\n\nOne of the first places for where Dialogue Among Civilizations took place was in Isfahan, Iran at the Safa Khaneh Community that was established in 1902.\nSafa Khaneh was a place that Haj Aqa Nourollah and his older brother made. It was a place were Muslims and Christians talked about their religions with each other. It was one of the first interfaith centers in the world. Later a magazine was published based on the dialogues between Muslims and Christians in the Safa Khaneh and it was released in Iran, India and England. The founder of Safa Khaneh, Haj Aqa Nouroollah was one of the leaders of the Constitution Era in Iran. His house has become a museum named Constitution house of Isfahan.\n\nThe page dedicated to the United Nations Year of Dialog Among Civilizations introduces the idea as follows:\n\nHere are some excerpts from the vision of the Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations:\n\nHere are some excerpts from the mission of the Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations:\n\nIn 1993, Huntington provoked great debate among international relations theorists with the interrogatively-titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\", a controversial, oft-cited article published in \"Foreign Affairs\" magazine. Its description of post–Cold War geopolitics contrasted with the controversial End of History thesis advocated by Francis Fukuyama.\n\nHuntington expanded \"The Clash of Civilizations?\" to book length and published it as \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\" in 1996. The article and the book posit that post–Cold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict likely occurred between the Capitalist West and the Communist Bloc East, it now was most likely to occur between the world's major civilizations — identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, and (viii) the African. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture — rather than the State — mern(?) nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions.\n\n\nCritics (see \"Le Monde Diplomatique\" articles) call \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\" the theoretical legitimization of American-led Western aggression against China and the world's Islamic cultures. Nevertheless, this post–Cold War shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires that the West internally strengthens itself culturally, by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism. Other critics argue that Huntington's taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary, and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations. Huntington's influence upon U.S. policy has been likened to that of British historian A.J. Toynbee's controversial religious theories about Asian leaders in the early twentieth century.\n\nPersonal Representative of the Secretary-General for the UN Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations, has said:\n\n\nMr. Picco was appointed the Personal Representative to the Secretary-General for the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations in 1999 in order to facilitate discussions on diversity, through organizing conferences, seminars and disseminating information and scholarly materials. Having served the United Nations for two decades, Mr. Picco is most recognized for participating in UN efforts to negotiate the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and in bringing an end to the Iran-Iraq war. He believes that people should take responsibility for who they are, what they do, what they value, and what they believe in.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4741592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4741592", "title": "Dipavamsa", "text": "Dipavamsa\n\nThe Dipavamsa or Deepavamsa (i.e., \"Chronicle of the Island\"; in Pali: \"Dīpavaṃsa\"), is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from Atthakatha and other sources around the 3-4th century. Together with the \"Mahavamsa\", it is the source of many accounts of ancient history of Sri Lanka and India. Its importance resides not only as a source of history and legend, but also as an important early work in Buddhist and Pali literature.\n\nIt is probably authored by several Buddhist monks or nuns of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya in the 3rd-4th century. The \"Dipavamsa\" was likely the first completely new Pali text composed in Sri Lanka; it was also among the last texts to be composed anonymously.\n\nThe preamble begins with \"Listen! I shall relate the chronicle of the Buddha's visits to the island, the arrival of the Tooth Relic and the Bodhi tree, the advent of the Buddha's doctrine, the rise of the teachers, the spread of Buddhism in the island and the coming of Vijaya the Chief of Men\". Dhatusena of Anuradhapura (5th century) had ordered the \"Dipavamsa\" be recited at the Mahinda festival held annually in Anuradhapura.\n\nThe Dipavamsa refers to three visits to the Island by the Buddha, the places being Kelaniya, Deegavapi Raja Maha Viharaya, the place where the Bo-sapling was later planted within the Maha Mewna-uyana (Park) of Anuradhapura. It does not make any mention of the Buddha visiting Adam's Peak.\n\nStarting with the \"Dīpavaṃsa\" in the 4th century, the Theravādins of the Mahāvihāra in Sri Lanka attempted to identify themselves with the original Sthavira sect of India. The \"Dīpavaṃsa\" lauds the Theravāda as a \"great banyan tree,\" and dismissively portrays the other early Buddhist schools as thorns (\"kaṇṭaka\").\n\nRegarding the Vijaya legend, Dipavamsa has tried to be less super-natural than the later work, Mahavamsa in referring to the husband of the Kalinga-Vanga princess, ancestor of Vijya, as a man named Sinha who was an outlaw that attacked caravans en route. In the meantime, Sinha-bahu and Sinhasivali, as king and queen of the kingdom of Lala (Lata), \"gave birth to twin sons, sixteen times.\" The eldest was Vijaya and the second was Sumitta. As Vijaya was of cruel and unseemly conduct, the enraged people requested the king to kill his son. But the king caused him and his seven hundred followers to leave the kingdom, and they landed in Sri Lanka, at a place called Tamba-panni, on the exact day when the Buddha passed into Maha Parinibbana.\n\nThe Dipavamsa gives a fuller account of the arrival of Theri Sangamitta (daughter to Asoka), but the epic story of Dutugamunu is treated only briefly, in ten Pali stanzas, while the Mahavamsa devoted ten chapters to it. Due to the greater attention given to the nuns of Sri Lanka in the Dipavamsa, as well as the description of Sangamitta as being particularly proficient at history, Hugh Nevill suggested that the Dipavamsa might have originated with the nuns community at one or more of the Viharas, rather than being composed by monks.\n\nThe Dipavamsa is considered \"source material\" to the Mahavamsa. The latter is more coherently organized, and is probably the greatest religious and historical epic in the Pali language. The historiography (i.e., the chronology of kings, battles etc.) given in the Mahavamsa, and to that extent in the Dipavasma, are believed to be largely correct from about the time of the death of Asoka.\n\nThe \"Dipavamsa\" was translated into English by Hermann Oldenberg in 1879. It was studied by B. C. Law in 1947.\n\n"}

He is a liberation theologian and the founder of the primitivist art community in the Solentiname Islands, where he lived for more than ten years (1965–1977). A member of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, a party he has since left, he was Nicaragua's minister of culture from 1979 to 1987.\n\nCardenal was born into an upper-class family in Granada, Nicaragua. A first cousin of the poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Cardenal studied literature in Managua and then from 1942 to 1946 in Mexico and from 1947 to 1949 in New York City. In 1949 and 1950, he traveled through Italy, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nIn July 1950, he returned to Nicaragua, where he participated in the 1954 April Revolution against Anastasio Somoza García's regime. The coup d'état failed and ended with the deaths of many of his associates. Cardenal subsequently entered the Trappist Monastery of Gethsemani (Kentucky, United States), joining another poet-priest, Thomas Merton, but in 1959, he left to study theology in Cuernavaca, Mexico.\n\nCardenal was ordained a Catholic priest in 1965 in Granada. He went to the Solentiname Islands, where he founded a Christian, almost-monastic, mainly-peasant community, which eventually led to the founding of the artists' colony. The colony engaged with painting as well as sculpture and was visited many times by artists and writers of the region such as Willarson Brandt, Julio Cortázar, Asilia Guillén, and Aedes Margarita. It was there that the famous book \"El Evangelio en Solentiname\" (\"The Gospel of Solentiname\") was written. Cardenal collaborated closely with the leftist Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN) in working to overthrow Anastasio Somoza Debayle's regime.\n\nMany members of the Solentiname community engaged in the revolutionary process through guerrilla warfare that the FSLN had developed to strike at the regime. The year 1977 was crucial to Cardenal's community, when Somoza's National Guard, as a result from an attack to the headquarters stationed in the city of San Carlos a few miles from the community, raided Solentiname and burned it to the ground. Cardenal fled to Costa Rica.\nOn 19 July 1979, immediately after the Liberation of Managua, he was named Minister of Culture by the new Sandinista regime. He campaigned for a \"revolution without vengeance.\" His brother Fernando Cardenal, also a Catholic priest (in the Jesuit order), was appointed Minister of Education. When Pope John Paul II visited Nicaragua in 1983, he openly scolded Ernesto Cardenal, who knelt before him on the Managua airport runway, for resisting his order to resign from the government, and admonished him: \"Usted tiene que arreglar sus asuntos con la Iglesia\" (\"You must fix your affairs with the Church\"). On 4 February 1984 Pope John Paul II defrocked Cardenal because of Cardenal's refusal to leave his political office. Cardenal remained Minister of Culture until 1987, when his ministry was closed for economic reasons.\n\nCardenal left the FSLN in 1994, protesting the authoritarian direction of the party under Daniel Ortega but insists that he has retained his leftist opinions, calling it a \"robbery of the people and dictatorship not a revolutionary movement\" when he left the government. He is a member of the Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista (Sandinista Renovation Movement, MRS) that participated in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election. Days before the election, Cardenal stated, in a clear reference to his dispute with Ortega: \"I think more desirable an authentic capitalism, as Montealegre's (Eduardo Montealegre, the presidential candidate for Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance) would be, than a false Revolution.\"\n\nHe is also a member of the board of advisers of the pan-Latin American TV station teleSUR.\n\nCardenal has been for a long time a polemical figure in Nicaragua's literary and cultural history. He has been described as \"the most important poet right now in Latin America\" politically and poetically. He has been a vocal representative for Nicaragua and a key to understanding the contemporary literary and cultural life of Nicaragua. He participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007. During a short visit to India, he made a profound impression on a group of writers called the Hungry generation.\n\nCardenal's tour of the United States in 2011 to promote his newest work stirred up some controversy, as with the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property that protested his appearances at Catholic universities such as Xavier, Cincinnati, because of his Marxist ideology.\n\nEarlier works were focused on life and love; however, some works like \"Zero Hour\" had a direct correlation to his Marxist political ideas, being tied to the assassination of guerrilla leader Augusto César Sandino. Cardenal's poetry also was heavily influenced by his unique Catholic ideology, mainly liberation theology. Some of his latest works are heavily influenced by his understanding of science and evolution, though it is still in dialogue with his earlier Marxist and Catholic material. Cardenal sums up his later material in a PBS NewsHour interview:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "88039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88039", "title": "Fensalir", "text": "Fensalir\n\nIn Norse mythology, Fensalir (Old Norse \"Fen Halls\") is a location where the goddess Frigg dwells. Fensalir is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the location, including that the location may have some connection to religious practices involving springs, bogs, or swamps in Norse paganism, and that it may be connected to the goddess Sága's watery location Sökkvabekkr.\n\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Völuspá\", Frigg is described as weeping over her son Baldr's death in Fensalir. This stanza is absent in the \"Hauksbók\" manuscript of the poem. The portion of the stanza mentioning Fensalir foretells that vengeance will come for the death of Baldr and that:\n\nIn chapter 35 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg is the highest among the ásynjur or Aesir, and that \"she has a dwelling called Fensalir and it is very splendid.\" In chapter 49, High says that when Loki witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a woman. In his disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing can hurt Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only mistletoe can, for it seemed to her too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.\n\nIn the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Skáldskaparmál\", Fensalir receives a third and final mention. In chapter 19, ways to refer to Frigg are provided, including that Frigg may be referred to as \"queen of Æsir and Asyniur, of Fulla and falcon form and Fensalir.\"\n\nIn 1882, the German scholar Anton Edzardi proposed that Fensalir may point to religious practices involving springs. John Lindow comments that \"I have no idea why Frigg should live in a boggy place, despite the old argument that there is an association with a cult situated at a spring.\" Rudolf Simek comments that Edzardi's theory \"must remain unanswered.\" In addition, Edzardi theorized a connection between Fensalir and a belief in folklore that particular swamps act as an entrance to the realm of Holda, whom he connects with Frigg.\n\nIn a 19th-century work, Paul Henri Mallet and Walter Scott write that the \"fen\" element of \"Fensalir\" \"may also be made to sig[nify] the watery deep, or the sea.\" This etymology has resulted in theories that the name \"Fensalir\" may mean \"Sea Halls\" rather than \"Fen Halls.\" In his 19th-century translation of the \"Poetic Edda\", Henry Adams Bellows comments that \"some scholars have regarded [Frigg] as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in \"Fensalir\" (\"the sea-halls\") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.\"\n\nJohn Lindow says that due to similarity between the goddess Sága's Sökkvabekkr and Fensalir, the open drinking between Sága and Odin, and the potential etymological basis for Sága being a seeress \"have led most scholars to understand Sága as another name for Frigg.\" Stephan Grundy states that \"Sága\" and \"Sökkvabekkr\" may be by-forms of \"Frigg\" and \"Fensalir\" used for the purpose of composing alliterative verse.\n\nBritt-Mari Näsström theorizes that \"Frigg's role as a fertility goddess is revealed in the name of her abode, Fensalir [...]\", that Frigg is the same as Sága, and that both the names \"Fensalir\" and \"Sökkvabekkr\" \"imply a goddes living in the water and recall the fertility goddess Nerthus.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "159525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159525", "title": "Gabriel", "text": "Gabriel\n\nGabriel (; , , , ), in the Abrahamic religions, is an archangel. It was first described in the Hebrew Bible, and subsequently developed by other traditions.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Gabriel appears to the prophet Daniel, to explain his visions (Daniel 8:15–26, 9:21–27). Gabriel the archangel is also a character in other ancient Jewish writings such as the Book of Enoch. Alongside archangel Michael, Gabriel is described as the guardian angel of Israel, defending this people against the angels of the other nations.\n\nIn the Christian New Testament in the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel appears to Zechariah and the Virgin Mary, foretelling the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively (Luke 1:11–38). In many Christian traditions including Anglican, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic, Gabriel is also referred to as a saint.\n\nIn Islam, Gabriel is an archangel whom God sent with revelation to various prophets, including Muhammad. The first 5 verses of the 96th chapter of the Quran, the Clot, is believed by Muslims to have been the first verses revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad.\n\nIn the Latter Day Saint movement, the angel Gabriel is the same individual as the prophet Noah in his mortal ministry.\n\nIn Yazidism, Gabriel is one of the Seven Mysteries, the Heptad to which God entrusted the world and sometimes identified with Melek Taus.\n\nJewish rabbis interpreted the \"man in linen\" as Gabriel in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Ezekiel. In the Book of Daniel, Gabriel is responsible for interpreting Daniel's visions. Gabriel's main function in Daniel is that of revealer, a role he continues in later literature. In the Book of Ezekiel, Gabriel is understood to be the angel that was sent to destroy Jerusalem. According to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", Gabriel takes the form of a man, and stands at the left hand of God. Shimon ben Lakish (Syria Palaestina, 3rd century) concluded that the angelic names of Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel came out of the Babylonian exile (Gen. Rab. 48:9). Alongside archangel Michael, Gabriel is described as the guardian angel of Israel, defending this people against the angels of the other nations.\n\nIn Kabbalah, Gabriel is identified with the sephirot of Yesod. Gabriel also has a prominent role as one of God's archangels in the Kabbalah literature. There, Gabriel is portrayed as working in concert with Michael as part of God's court. Gabriel is not to be prayed to because only God can answer prayers and sends Gabriel as his agent.\n\nAccording to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the \"tree of souls\" that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the \"Treasury of Souls\". Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.\n\nThe intertestamental period (roughly 200 BC – 50 AD) produced a wealth of literature, much of it having an apocalyptic orientation. The names and ranks of angels and devils were greatly expanded, and each had particular duties and status before God.\n\nIn , Gabriel, along with Michael, Uriel and Suriel, \"saw much blood being shed upon the earth\" (9:1) and heard the souls of men cry, \"Bring our cause before the Most High.\" (9:3) In 1 Enoch 10:1, the reply came from \"the Most High, the Holy and Great One\" who sent forth agents, including Gabriel—\nAnd the Lord said to Gabriel: \"'Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy \"[the children of fornication and]\" the children of the Watchers from amongst men \"[and cause them to go forth]:\" send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle: for length of days shall they not have.\" \n\nGabriel is the fifth of the five angels who keep watch: \"Gabriel, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim.\" ()\n\nWhen Enoch asked who the four figures were that he had seen: \"And he said to me: 'This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel.' And these are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits and the four voices I heard in those days.\" ()\n\nFirst, concerning John the Baptist, an angel appeared to his father Zacharias, a priest of the course of Abia, () whose barren wife Elisabeth was of the daughters of Aaron, while he ministered in the temple:\n<poem>Luke 1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.\n11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.\n12 And when Zacharias saw \"him\", he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.\n13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.\n14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.\n15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\n16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.\n17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\n18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\n19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.\n20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\n( KJV) (other versions: )</poem>\nAfter completing his week of ministry, Zacharias returned to his house (in Hebron) and his wife Elizabeth conceived. After she completed \"five months\" () of her pregnancy, Gabriel is mentioned again:\n\n<poem>Luke 1:26 ¶ And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\n27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name \"was\" Mary.\n28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, \"thou that art\" highly favoured, the Lord \"is\" with thee: blessed \"art\" thou among women.\n29 And when she saw \"him\", she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\n30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\n31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.\n32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\n33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.\n34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\n35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\n36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.\n37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.\n38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\n( KJV) (other versions: )</poem>\n\nGabriel only appears by name in those two passages in Luke. In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel. The only other named angels in the New Testament are Michael the Archangel (in ) and Abaddon (in ) . Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible. Believers are expressly warned not to worship angels (in and ).\n\nThe trope of Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast to indicate the Lord's return to Earth is especially familiar in Negro spirituals. However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25-29); God's trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8-11); or simply \"a trumpet will sound\" (I Corinthians 15:52).\n\nIn related traditions, Gabriel is again not identified as the trumpeter. In Judaism, trumpets are prominent, and they seem to be blown by God himself, or sometimes Michael. In Zoroastrianism, there is no trumpeter at the last judgement. In Islamic tradition, it is Israfil who blows the trumpet, though he is not named in the Qur'an. The Christian Church Fathers do not mention Gabriel as the trumpeter; early English literature similarly does not.\n\nThe earliest known identification of Gabriel as the trumpeter comes in John Wycliffe's 1382 tract, \"De Ecclesiæ Dominio\". In the year 1455, in Armenian art, there is an illustration in an Armenian manuscript showing Gabriel sounding his trumpet as the dead climb out of their graves. Two centuries later, Gabriel is identified as the trumpeter, in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (1667):\n<poem>\nBetwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat\nChief of the Angelic guards (IV.545f)...\nHe ended, and the Son gave signal high\nTo the bright minister that watch'd, he blew\nHis trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps\nWhen God descended, and perhaps once more\nTo sound at general doom. (XI.72ff).\n</poem>\n\nLater, Gabriel's horn is omnipresent in Negro spirituals, but it is unclear how the Byzantine conception inspired Milton and the spirituals, though they presumably have a common source.\n\nGabriel's horn also makes an appearance in \"The Eyes of Texas\" (1903) where it signifies the rapture.\n\nIn Marc Connelly's play based on spirituals, \"The Green Pastures\" (1930), Gabriel has his beloved trumpet constantly with him, and the Lord has to warn him not to blow it too soon. Four years later \"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\" was introduced by Ethel Merman in Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" (1934).\n\nSaint Gabriel Archangel's festivity day was exclusively celebrated the 18th of March as of many sources dating between the years 1588 and 1921, except for a source published in 1856, where the feast was celebrated on April 7th for unknown reasons (a parentheses notes that the day is normally celebrated on March 18). Writer Elizabeth Drayson mentions the feast being celebrated in March 18 the year of 1588 in her 2013 book: \"The Lead Books of Granada\". \n\nOne of the oldest out of print sources pronouncing the feast for March 18th, was first published in 1608 and has the name \"Flos sanctorum: historia general de la vida y hechos de Jesu-Christo ... y de los santos de que reza y haze fiesta la Iglesia Catholica ...\" by the Spanish writer Alonso de Villegas, a newer edition of this book was published in the year 1794. Another source published in Ireland in 1886 «The Irish Ecclesiastical Record» also mentions March 18. There is a painting from 1886 by the Italian artist Diodore Rahoult, the 18th of March appears on the painting as well.\n\nThe feast of Saint Gabriel was included for the first time in the General Roman Calendar in 1921, for celebration on March 24. It is unknown whether this was a temporary change, however there is no recent mention of the feast commemoration between the years 1921 and 1969. In 1969 the day was officially transferred to September 29 for celebration in conjunction with the feast of St. Michael and St. Raphael. The Church of England has also adopted the September 29 date, known as Michaelmas.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite celebrate his feast day on November 8 (for those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar, November 8 currently falls on November 21 of the modern Gregorian Calendar, a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days: March 26 is the \"Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel\" and celebrates his role in the Annunciation. \n\nJuly 13 is also known as the \"Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel\", and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on Mount Athos when, in the 9th century, during the reign of Emperor Basil II and the Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus and while Nicholas Chrysoverges was Patriarch of Constantinople, the Archangel appeared in a cell near Karyes, where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the Theotokos, \"It is truly meet...\".\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates his feast on Paoni 13, Koiak 22 and Paoni 26.\n\nThe Ethiopian Church celebrates his feast on December 28, with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to \"Saint Gabriel\" in Kulubi on that day.\n\nAdditionally, Gabriel is the patron saint of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, remote sensing, postal workers, clerics, diplomats, and stamp collectors.\n\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, Gabriel is believed to have lived a mortal life as the prophet Noah. The two are regarded as the same individual; Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name.\n\nGabriel (Arabic: جبريل, \"Jibrīl\" or جبرائيل \"Jibrāʾīl\") is venerated as an archangel and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam. As the Bible portrays Gabriel as a celestial messenger sent to Daniel, Mary, and Zechariah, so too Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel was sent to numerous pre-Islamic prophets with revelation and divine injunctions, including Adam, whom Muslims believe was consoled by Gabriel some time after the Fall. He is known by many names in Islam, such as \"the holy spirit\", \"keeper of holiness\" and \"peacock of paradise\".\n\nAccording to Muslim belief, God revealed the Quran to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel, and the fifty-third chapter of the text describes the angel without naming him, in a passage that Islamic commentators have unanimously interpreted as referring to Gabriel. The passage in question, , reads:\n\nGabriel is also \"named\" numerous times in the Qur'an ( and for example). In , the Quran mentions Gabriel along with Michael, who is also venerated as an exalted angel in Islam. In Muslim tradition, Gabriel is considered one of the primary archangels. Exegesis narrates that Muhammad saw Gabriel in his full angelic splendor only twice, the first time being when he received his first revelation.\n\nMuslims also revere Gabriel for a number of historical events predating the first revelation. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed Zachariah of John's birth as well as Mary of the future nativity of Jesus, and that Gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed Abraham of the birth of Isaac. All of these events can be found also in the Quran. Gabriel also makes a famous appearance in the Hadith of Gabriel, where he questions Muhammad on the core tenets of Islam.\n\nContrary to Christian tradition, Islamic traditions depict Gabriel as the warring angel. Accordingly he aided Muhammed to overcome his adversaries, significantly during the Battle of Badr and against a demon during the Mi'raj\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith sees Gabriel as a messenger of God who delivered messages to Muhammad. He is mentioned in the \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\", the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion.\n\nAngels are described as pure spirits. The lack of a defined form allows artists wide latitude in depicting them. Amelia R. Brown draws comparisons in Byzantine iconography between portrayals of angels and the conventions used to depict court eunuchs. Mainly from the Caucasus, they tended to have light eyes, hair, and skin; and those \"castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards...\" As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that \"Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch\". Some recent popular works on angels consider Gabriel to be female or androgynous.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eccentric English hagiographer and antiquarian, Sabine Baring-Gould (1834–1924), wrote the English lyrics to \"Gabriel's Message\", which he translated from the Basque Christmas carol \"Birjina gaztetto bat zegoen\", which was probably related to the 13th or 14th-century Latin chant \"Angelus Ad Virginem\", which itself is based on the biblical account of the Annunciation in the Gospel of Luke. In Creed's song, \"My Own Prison\", Gabriel is mentioned deciphering the visions to the main character in the song. \"Sugar Baby\", the last track on Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft\" album, contains this reference: \"Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as we're born/ Look up, look up - seek your Maker - 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.\"\n\nDaniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the \"likeness of man\" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as \"the man Gabriel.\" David Everson observes that \"such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous ... descriptions of angels,\" as in Genesis 19:5.\n\nGabriel is most often portrayed in the context of scenes of the Annunciation. In 2008 a 16th-century drawing by Lucas van Leyden of the Netherlands was discovered. George R. Goldner, chairman of the department of prints and drawings at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggests that the sketch was for a stained glass window. \"The fact that the archangel is an ordinary-looking person and not an idealized boy is typical of the artist\", said Goldner.\n\nIn chronological order (to see each item, follow the link in the footnote):\n\n\n\n\n"}

The number of students was approximately 1500-2000. That group included students of Pakistani origin, among others. It is known that the dominant population that went to study at Cuba was the Pakistani students who were about 936 in strength.

{"id": "13027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13027", "title": "Jinn", "text": "Jinn\n\nJinn (, '), also Romanized as djinn or Anglicized as genies\"' (with the more broad meaning of spirits or demons, depending on source) are supernatural creatures in early pre-Islamic Arabian and later Islamic mythology and theology. Jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept, rather they may be various pagan beings integrated into Islam. Since jinn are not inevitably evil (nor good), Islam was able to adapt spirits from other religions during its expansion. \n\nBesides the jinn, Islam acknowledges the existence of demons (\"Shayāṭīn\"). The lines between demons and jinn are blurred, since malevolent jinn are also called \"shayāṭīn\". However both Islam and Western scholarship, generally distinguishes between angels, jinn and demons (\"shayāṭīn\") as three different types of spiritual entities in Islamic traditions.\n\nIn an Islamic context, the term \"jinn\" is used for both a collective designation for any supernatural creature and also to refer to a specific type of supernatural creature.\n\n\"Jinn\" is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root (, \"jann\"), whose primary meaning is \"to hide\" or \"to conceal\". Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, \"beings that are concealed from the senses\". Cognates include the Arabic ' (\"possessed\", or generally \"insane\"), ' (\"garden\", also “heaven”), and \"\" (\"embryo\"). \"Jinn\" is properly treated as a plural, with the singular being \"jinnī\".\n\nThe origin of the word Jinn remains uncertain.\nSome scholars relate the Arabic term jinn to the Latin genius, as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under Tiberius Augustus, but this derivation is also disputed. Another suggestion holds that jinn may be derived from Aramaic \"ginnaya\" () with the meaning of \"tutelary deity\", or also \"garden\". Others claim a Persian origin of the word, in the form of the Avestic \"Jaini\", a wicked (female) spirit. Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre-Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran.\n\nThe Anglicized form \"genie\" is a borrowing of the French \"\", from the Latin \"genius\", a guardian spirit of people and places in Roman religion. It first appeared in 18th-century translations of the \"Thousand and One Nights\" from the French, where it had been used owing to its rough similarity in sound and sense.\n\nJinn were worshipped by many Arabs during the Pre-Islamic period, but, unlike gods, jinn were not regarded as immortal. In ancient Arabia, the term \"jinn\" also applied to all kinds of supernatural entities among various religions and cults; thus, Zoroastrian, Christian, and Jewish angels and demons were also called \"jinn\".\n\nThe exact origins of belief in jinn are not entirely clear. Some scholars of the Middle East hold that they originated as malevolent spirits residing in deserts and unclean places, who often took the forms of animals; others hold that they were originally pagan nature deities who gradually became marginalized as other deities took greater importance. According to common Arabian belief, soothsayers, pre-Islamic philosophers, and poets were inspired by the jinn. However, jinn were also feared and thought to be responsible for causing various diseases and mental illnesses. Julius Wellhausen observed that such spirits were thought to inhabit desolate, dingy, and dark places and that they were feared. One had to protect oneself from them, but they were not the objects of a true cult.\n\nIn the Islamic sense, \"jinn\" is used in two different ways:\n\n\nIn Islamic tradition, Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and that prophets and messengers were sent to both communities. Traditionally Surah 72 is held to tell about the revelation to Jinn and several stories mention one of Muhammad's followers accompanied him, witnessing the revelation to the Jinn.\n\nAnother Islamic prophet, who is related to interactions with Jinn, is Solomon. In Quran, he is said to be a king in ancient Israel and was gifted by God to talk to animals and Jinn. God granted him authority over the rebellious Jinn or \"marid\", thus Solomon forced them to build the First Temple. Beliefs regarding Solomon and his power over the Jinn were later extended in folklore and folktales.\n\nRelated to common traditions, the angels were created on Wednesday, the Jinn on Thursday and humans on Friday, but not the very next day, rather more than 1000 years later. The community of the Jinn race were like these of humans, but then corruption and injustice among them increased and all warnings sent by God were ignored. Consequently, God sent his angels to battle the infidel Jinn. Just a few survived, and were ousted to far islands or to the mountains. With the revelation of Islam, the Jinn were given a new chance to access salvation. But because of their anciennity, the jinn would attribute themselves to a superiority over humans and envy the them for their place and rank on earth.\n\nIn early Islamic development, the status of jinn were reduced from that of deities to minor spirits. To assert a strict monotheism and the Islamic concept of Tauhid, all affinities between the jinn and God were denied, thus jinn were placed parallel to humans, also subject to God's judgment and able to attain Paradise or Hell. However, even though their status as tutelary deities was reduced, they were not consequently regarded as demons. In later revelations, the concept of demons and angels distinct from the pagan jinn were made. T. Fahd stated, the jinn were related to the pagan belief, while the demons and angels were borrowed from monotheistic concepts of angels and demons. In later revelations the demons and the jinn seems to be used interchangeably, here placing the jinn with the devil, against the angels and Muhammad.\n\nWhen Islam spread outside of Arabia, belief in the jinn was assimilated with local belief about spirits and deities from Iran, Africa, Turkey and India. Persians, for example, identified the jinn in the Quran with the Daeva from Zoroastrian lore. Developed from various traditions and local folklore, but not mentioned in canonical Islamic scriptures, jinn were thought to be able to possess humans; Morocco especially has many possession traditions, including exorcism rituals. In Sindh the concept of the Jinni was introduced during the Abbasid Era and has become a common part of local folklore, also including stories of both male jinn called \"\"jinn\" and female jinn called \"Jiniri\"\". Folk stories of female jinn include stories such as the \"Jejhal Jiniri\". Although, due to the cultural influence, the concept of jinn may vary, all share some common features. The jinn are believed to live in societies resembling these of humans, practicing religion (including Islam, Christianity and Judaism), having emotions, needing to eat and drink, and can procreate and raise families. Additionally, they fear iron, generally appear in desolate or abandoned places, and are stronger and faster than humans. Generally, jinn are thought to eat bones and prefer rotten flesh over fresh flesh.\n\nThe composition and existence of jinn is the subject of various debates during the Middle Ages. According to Ashari, the existence of jinn can not be proven, because arguments concerning the existence of jinn are beyond human comprehension. Adepts of Ashʿari theology explained jinn are invisible to humans, because they lack the appropriate sense organs to envision them. Critics argued, if jinn exist, their bodies must either be ethereal or made of solid material; if they were composed of the former, they would not able to do hard work, like carrying heavy stones. If they were composed of the latter, they would be visible to any human with functional eyes. Critics therefore refused to believe in a literal reading on jinn in Islamic sacred texts, preferring to view them as \"unruly men\". On the other hand, advocates of belief in jinn assert that God's creation can exceed the human mind; thus, jinn are beyond human understanding. Since they are mentioned in Islamic texts, scholars such as Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn Hazm prohibit the denial of jinn. They also refer to spirits and demons among the Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews to \"prove\" their existence. Ibn Taymiyya believed the jinn to be generally \"ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous\". He held that the jinn account for much of the \"magic\" that is perceived by humans, cooperating with magicians to lift items in the air, delivering hidden truths to fortune tellers, and mimicking the voices of deceased humans during seances.\n\nOther critics, such as Jahiz and Mas'udi, stated that sightings of jinn are due to psychological causes. According to Mas'udi, the jinn as described by traditional scholars, are not \"a priori\" false, but improbable. Jahiz states in his work Kitab al-Hayawan that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing \"waswās\" (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by Satan). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.\n\nLater Sufi traditions related the meaning of jinn back to its origin \"something that is concealed from sights\", thus they were related to the hidden realm, including angels from the heavenly realm and the jinn from a sublunary realm. Ibn Arabi stated: \"Only this much is different: The spirits of the jinn are lower spirits, while the spirits of angels are heavenly spirits\". The jinn share, due to their intermediary abode both angelic and human traits. According to some Sufi teachings, a jinn is like an \"empty cup\", composed of its own ego and intention, and a reflection of its observer. Because jinn are closer to the material realm, it would be easier for human to contact a jinn, than an angel.\n\nJinn can be found in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" story of \"The Fisherman and the Jinni\"; more than three different types of jinn are described in the story of \"Ma‘ruf the Cobbler\"; two jinn help young Aladdin in the story of \"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp\"; as Ḥasan Badr al-Dīn weeps over the grave of his father until sleep overcomes him, and he is awoken by a large group of sympathetic jinn in the \"Tale of ‘Alī Nūr al-Dīn and his son Badr ad-Dīn Ḥasan\". In some stories, jinn are credited with the ability of instantaneous travel (from China to Morocco in a single instant); in others, they need to fly from one place to another, though quite fast (from Baghdad to Cairo in a few hours).\n\nAffirmation on the existence of Jinn as sapient creatures living along with humans is still widespread in the Middle Eastern world and mental illnesses are often attributed to jinn possession.\n\nHowever some modernist commentators, on the basis of the word's meaning, reinterpretated references to jinn as microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses or undetectable uncivilized persons. Others try to reconcile the traditional perspective on jinn, with modern sciences. Fethullah Gülen, leader of Hizmet movement, had put forward the idea, that jinn may be the cause of schizophrenia and cancer and that the Quranic references to jinn on \"smokeless fire\" could for that matter mean \"energy\". Others again refuse connections between illness and jinn, but still believe in their existence, due to their occurrences in the Quran. \n\nModern Salafi tenets of Islam, refuse reinterpretations of jinn and adhere to literalism, arguing the threat of jinn and their ability to possess humans, could be proven by \"Quran and Sunnah\". Jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism. Saudi Arabia, following the Wahhabism strant of Salafism, impose death penalty for dealing with jinn to prevent sorcery and witchcraft. Further, there is no distinction made between demons and indifferent spirits from other cultures, as Salafi scholars Umar Sulaiman Al-Ashqar stated, that demons are actually simply \"unbelieving jinn\".\n\nSleep paralysis is conceptualized as a \"Jinn attack\" by many sleep paralysis sufferers in Egypt as discovered by Cambridge neuroscientist Baland Jalal. A scientific study found that as many as 48 percent of those who experience sleep paralysis in Egypt believe it to be an assault by the Jinn. Almost all of these sleep paralysis sufferers (95%) would recite verses from the Quran during sleep paralysis to prevent future \"Jinn attacks\". In addition, some (9%) would increase their daily Islamic prayer (salah) to get rid of these attacks by Jinn. Sleep paralysis is generally associated with great fear in Egypt, especially if believed to be supernatural in origin.\n\nThe supernaturality of Jinn does not mean they are transcendent to nature, but that they appear so in relation to human's perception of nature, due to their invisibility. They are \"natural\" in the classical philosopical sense by consisting of an element, undergoing change and being bound in time and space. Thus they are not purely spiritual, but also physical in nature, being able to interact in a tactile manner with people and objects, and also subject to bodily desires like eating and sleeping. Unlike the Jinn in Islamic belief and folklore, Jinn in Middle Eastern folktales are often depicted as monstrous or magical creatures, and unlike the former, generally considered to be fictional.\n\nThe appearance of jinn can be divided into three major categories:\n\nJinn are assumed to be able to appear in shape of various animals such as scorpions, cats, owls and onagers. The dog is also often related to jinn, especially black dogs. However piebald dogs are rather identified with hinn. Associations between dogs and jinn prevailed in Arabic-literature, but lost its meaning in Persian scriptures. Serpents are the animals most associated with jinn. Islamic traditions knows many narratitions concerning a serpent who was actually a jinni. However (except for the \"'udhrut\" from Yemeni folklore) the jinn can not appear in form of wolves. The wolf is thought of as the natural predator of the jinn, who contrasts the jinn by his noble character and disables them to vanish.\n\nThe jinn are also related to the wind. They may appear in mists or sandstorms. Zubayr ibn al-Awam, who is held to have accompanied Muhammad during his lecture to the jinn, is said to view the jinn as shadowy ghosts with no individual structure. According to a narration Ghazali asked Ṭabasī, famous for jinn-incantations, to reveal the jinn to him. Accordingly Tabasi showed him the jinn, seeing them like they were \"a shadow on the wall\". After Ghazali requested to speak to them, Ṭabasī stated, that for now he could not see more. Although sandstorms are believed to be caused by jinn, others, such as Abu Yahya Zakariya' ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini and Ghazali attribute them to natural causes. Otherwise sandstorms are thought to be caused by a battle between different groups of jinn.\n\nA common characteristic of the jinn is their lack of individuality, but they may gain individuality by materializing in human forms such as Sakhr and severel jinn known from magical writings. But also in their anthropomorphed shape, they stay partly animalic and are not fully human. Therefore, individual jinn are commonly depicted as monstrous and anthropomorphized creatures with body parts from different animals or human with animalic traits. Commonly associated with jinn in humanform are the Si'lah and the Ghoul. However, they stay partly animalic, their bodies are depicted as fashioned out of two or more different species. Some of them may have the hands of cats, the head of birds or wings rise from their shoulders.\n\nWitchcraft (\"sihr\") is often associated with Jinn and Afarit around the Middle East. Therefore, a sorcerer may summon a Jinn and force him to perform orders. Summoned Jinn may be sent to the chosen victim to cause demonic possession. Such summonings were done by invocation, by aid of talismans or by satisfying the Jinn, thus to make a contract. Jinn are also regarded as assistants of soothsayers. Soothsayers reveal information from the past and present; the Jinn can be a source of this information because their lifespans exceed those of humans.\n\nIbn al-Nadim, in his \"Kitāb al-Fihrist\", describes a book that lists 70 Jinn led by Fuqtus, including several Jinn appointed over each day of the week. Bayard Dodge, who translated al-Fihrist into English, notes that most of these names appear in the Testament of Solomon. A collection of late fourteenth- or early fifteenth-century magico-medical manuscripts from Ocaña, Spain describes a different set of 72 Jinn (termed \"Tayaliq\") again under Fuqtus (here named \"Fayqayțūš\" or Fiqitush), blaming them for various ailments. According to these manuscripts, each Jinni was brought before King Solomon and ordered to divulge their \"corruption\" and \"residence\" while the Jinn King Fiqitush gave Solomon a recipe for curing the ailments associated with each Jinni as they confessed their transgressions.\n\nA disseminated treatise on the occult, written by al-Ṭabasī, called Shāmil, deals with subjugating demons and jinn by incantations, charms and the combination of written and recited formulae and to obtain supernatural powers through their aid. Al-Ṭabasī distinguished between licit and illicit magic, the later founded on disbelief, while the first on purity. \n\nSeven kings of the Jinn are traditionally associated with days of the week.\n\nDuring the Rwandan genocide, both Hutus and Tutsis avoided searching local Rwandan Muslim neighborhoods because they widely believed the myth that local Muslims and mosques were protected by the power of Islamic magic and the efficacious Jinn. In the Rwandan city of Cyangugu, arsonists ran away instead of destroying the mosque because they feared the wrath of the jinn, whom they believed were guarding the mosque.\n\nBeliefs in entities similar to the jinn are found throughout pre-Islamic Middle Eastern cultures. The ancient Sumerians believed in Pazuzu, a wind demon, who was shown with \"a rather canine face with abnormally bulging eyes, a scaly body, a snake-headed penis, the talons of a bird and usually wings.\" The ancient Babylonians believed in \"utukku\", a class of demons which were believed to haunt remote wildernesses, graveyards, mountains, and the sea, all locations where jinn were later thought to reside. The Babylonians also believed in the Rabisu, a vampiric demon believed to leap out and attack travelers at unfrequented locations, similar to the post-Islamic \"ghūl\", a specific kind of jinn whose name is etymologically related to that of the Sumerian \"galla\", a class of Underworld demon.\n\nLamashtu, also known as Labartu, was a divine demoness said to devour human infants. Lamassu, also known as Shedu, were guardian spirits, sometimes with evil propensities. The Assyrians believed in the Alû, sometimes described as a wind demon residing in desolate ruins who would sneak into people's houses at night and steal their sleep. In the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, entities similar to jinn were known as \"ginnayê\", an Aramaic name which may be etymologically derived from the name of the \"genii\" from Roman mythology. Like jinn among modern-day Bedouin, \"ginnayê\" were thought to resemble humans. They protected caravans, cattle, and villages in the desert and tutelary shrines were kept in their honor. They were frequently invoked in pairs.\n\nShedim, one of several supernatural creatures in early Jewish mythology, resemble the Islamic concept of Jinn. Both are said to be invisible to human eyes but are subject to bodily desires, like procreating and the need to eat, and both may be malevolent or benevolent. Like the Islamic notion of jinn as Pre-Adamites, Jewish lore also regard shedim as Pre-Adamites, replaced by human beings in some legends. Narrations regarding Asmodeus, an antagonist in the Solomon legends, appears both in Islamic lore and in the Talmud as the king either of the jinn or the shedim.\n\nSimilar to the Islamic idea of spiritual entities converting to one's own religion can be found on Buddhism lore. Accordingly, Buddha preached among humans and Devas, spiritual entities who are like humans subject to the cycle of life, that resembles the Islamic notion of Jinn, who are also ontologically placed among humans in regard of their eschatological destiny.\n\nVan Dyck's Arabic translation of the Old Testament uses the alternative collective plural \"jann\" (Arab:الجان}; translation:al-jānn) to render the Hebrew word usually translated into English as \"familiar spirit\" (אוב , Strong #0178) in several places (Leviticus 19:31, 20:6, 1 Samuel 28:3,7,9, 1 Chronicles 10:13).\n\nIn Guanche mythology from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, there existed the belief in beings that were similar to genies, such as the \"maxios\" or \"dioses paredros\" (\"attendant gods\", domestic and nature spirits) and \"tibicenas\" (evil genies), as well as the demon \"Guayota\" (aboriginal god of evil) that, like the Arabic \"\", is sometimes identified with a genie. The Guanches were the Berber natives of the Canary Islands before they were colonised and enslaved by the Europeans who claimed the island for themselves.\n\nThe jinn frequently occurs as a character or plot element in fiction. Two other classes of jinn, the ifrit and the marid, have been represented in fiction as well.\n\nGenies appear in film in various forms, such as the genie freed by Abu, the eponymous character in the 1940 film \"Thief of Bagdad\".\n\nA \"Blue Djinn\" character appears in the 1960s sitcom \"I Dream Of Jeannie\", season 2, episode 1.\n\nA Jinni makes a short appearance in the novel \"American Gods\" by Neil Gaiman, originally published in 2001. \"American Gods\" was also made into a TV series for the Starz television cable television network in 2017. The television adaptation also features a Jinni.\n\nThe protagonist of the Bartimaeus Sequence is a jinni, and the books have an established hierarchy that include other types of spirits: imps, foliots, djinn, afrits, and marids (to use the author's own spelling). In this interpretation, jinn and all other spirits are not physical beings, but are instead from another dimension of chaos called \"The Other Place\". To exist on Earth at all, magicians must summon sprits and force them to take some kind of form, something so alien that it causes all spirits pain. As a result, magicians must put measures in place to force spirits to do what they want in a form of magical slavery.\n\nIn the popular American television series, \"Supernatural\", the jinn (alternatively 'djinn' or 'genies') are used as a plot device and one of the supernatural beings that the main characters come in contact with. Mentioned in 7 episodes, 2.20 \"What is and What Should Never Be\", 6.01 \"Exile on Main St\", 6.10 \"Caged Heat\", 7.22 \"There Will Be Blood\", 8.20 \"Pac-Man Fever\", 9.20 \"Bloodlines\", and 13.16 \"Scoobynatural\".\n\n\n\n"}

Today there are over 39,000 mosques in China, 25,000 of these are in Xinjiang, a north-west autonomous region.\n\nIn China, mosques are called \"qīngzhēnsì\" (, \"Pure truth temple\"), a name which was also used by Chinese Jews for synagogues. Other names include \"huíhui táng\" (, \"Hui people's hall\"), \"huíhui sì\" (, \"Hui people's temple\"), \"lǐbàisì\" (, \"Temple of worship\"), \"zhēnjiào sì\" (, \"True teaching temple\"), or \"qīngjìng sì\" (, \"Pure and clean temple\").\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, at the Mosque entrance of Hui Mosques, a tablet was placed upon which \"Huángdì wànsuì, wànsuì, wànwànsuì\" () was inscribed, which means, \"The Emperor, may he live forever\". Wansui means Ten thousand years, which means forever in Chinese. Westerners traveling in China noted the presence of these tablets at mosques in Yunnan and Ningbo.\n\nMost mosques have certain aspects in common with each other however as with other regions Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of Iran and Central Asia, with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs, as well as the unique multi-layered portals. In northwest China where the Chinese Hui have built their mosques, there is a combination of eastern and western styles. The mosques have flared Buddhist style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and minarets.\n\nThe style of architecture of Hui Mosques varies according to their sect. The traditionalist Gedimu Hanafi Sunnis, influenced by Chinese culture, build Mosques which look like Chinese temples. The reformist modernist (but originally Wahhabi inspired) Yihewani build their Mosques to look like Middle Eastern Arab style Mosques.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41762731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41762731", "title": "Miao folk religion", "text": "Miao folk religion\n\nMiao folk religion or Hmong folk religion is the common ethnic religion of Miao peoples, primarily consisting in the practice of \"ua dab\" (Hmongic: \"worship of deities\"). The religion is also called Hmongism by a Hmong American church established in 2012 to organise it among Hmong people in the United States.\n\nIt has a pantheist theology, centered on worship of deities and progenitors of the Miao peoples. Throughout its history it has incorporated theoretical and ritual elements from Taoism, and broader Chinese religion, especially the emphasis on the pattern of the forces of the natural universe and the need of human life to be in accordance with these forces.\n\nMost Hmong continue to practice the traditional religion, although many Hmong in Asia have converted to Buddhism or have mixed it with Buddhism, and many Hmong Americans and Hmong Australians have adopted Christianity or Buddhism.\n\nThe highest god of Hmong traditional religion is called \"Saub\" or \"Yawm Saub\", who endows the shamans with their abilities. The Saub god may be called in times of need and he can manifest in points of crisis throughout the course of history. The first shaman was \"Siv Yis\": Hmong shamans refer to themselves as \"Siv Yis\" when they are in ecstasy. The gods of cosmic nature are simply called \"dab\", while \"dab neeb\" or \"qhua neeb\" are shamanic spirits that float through the worlds and work with the shamans operating within a specific sphere which is their domain. The shamanic spirits include wild spirits of untamed nature and the tamed and friendly spirits of the house. Ancestral spirits (\"Xwm Kab\") who reside in the world of the dead form another category, though also involved in shamanic practice.\n\nThe frog god \"Nplooj Lwg\" is considered the creator of humans. \"Ntxwj Nyug\" and \"Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem\" are the lords of the otherworld, determining life, death and reincarnation or rest in heaven. While \"Ntxwj Nyug\" is an indigenous deity, \"Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem\" is thought to derive from the Jade Lord of Taoism. Every house has an altar for the \"Dab Xwm Kab\" (god of good fortune). \"Dab Pog\" is the goddess of babies. \"Zaj Laug\" is the \"Old Dragon\" or \"Dragon King\". \"Poj Ntxoog\" is a fearful female spirit associated with the tiger. \"Yaj Yuam\" is an ancestral hero, the \"Heavenly Archer\", corresponding to the Chinese Houyi. Other gods are of nature, such as \"Xob\", the god of thunder and lightning, and \"Nkauj Hnub\" and \"Nraug Hlis\", \"Lady Sun\" and \"Lord Moon\". Chiyou (or Txiv Yawg) is worshipped as an ancestral god of the Hmong nation.\n\nThe Hmong house is a reflection of the cosmos. It is constructed around a central post (\"ncej tas\") representing the world tree, axis of the spirits, which god is \"Dab Ncej Tas\". The roofs represent the heaven (the spiritual world) and the floor symbolises nature (the world of men). The axis of the building represents the male head of the household and his ancestral spirit, the ancestral unity. Man is in the between of heaven and earth. The Hmong believe in various household spirits called \"dab nyeg\", meaning \"tamed spirits\", such as \"Dab Qhovcub\" (the god of the main hearth), \"Dab Qhovtxos\" (the god of the ritual hearth), \"Dab Nthab\" (the god of the loft), \"Dab Roog\" (the god of the framework of the front door). The \"Dab Txhiaj Meej\" is the god of wealth and richness. Spirits of nature are called \"dab qus\", \"wild spirits\".\n\n\"Yeeb and Yaj\" is the Hmong equivalent of the yin and yang found in Chinese traditional religion and Taoism. Differently from the context of Chinese thought, the Hmong \"yeeb and yaj\" is not represented by symbols such as the \"taijitu\". The concept represents the world of the living and the world of the gods: \"yeeb ceeb\" is the spiritual world, while \"yaj ceeb\" is the world of material nature. The Hmong also practice \"looj mem\", the Chinese feng shui.\n\nShaman practice is called \"ua neeb\" (ua: \"to heal through the, \"neeb: the spirit world\", the \"dab neeb\" being specifically shamanic gods), while the shaman is called \"txiv neeb\", meaning \"father of the \"neeb\"\".\n\nThe position of a shaman is not inherited as shamans are chosen by the \"neeb\" class of gods, manifesting through trails experienced by those chosen. Chosen people are guided by elder shamans until they are able to perform the healing rituals themselves. A shaman has control on his spirits helpers.\n\nIn the spirit journey, the shaman calls on his helpers who are spirits to guide or assist him in the spirit world. He moves and sing on a spiritual horse (\"nees\") represented in the living world by a shaman's bench (\"rooj neeb\"). He also calls on the forces of the cosmos to help him, such as the highest god \"Saub\", the First Couple, \"Pog Ntxoog\", Lady Sun and Lord Moon, the seven stars of the Pleiades, and many animal spirits. Divination horns (\"kwam\") is one form or means of communication with the gods, and they are used in many rituals.\n\nThe shamans perform two sessions of healing rituals: the diagnostic rituals (\"ua neeb saib\") and subsequently the healing rituals (\"ua neeb kho\"), only if the patient shows no signs of recovery after the first ritual.\n\nThe Hmong household altar is dedicated primarily to the \"Dab Xwm Kab\" (god of good fortune). It is placed on the wall of the main room of the house. On the altar people make offerings of rice, chicken, soup and rice served in bamboo, with incense and joss paper. \"Txi dab\" is the general term for the sacrifice to the gods, while \"laib dab\" is the ritual of sacrifice to the ancestors. On the last day of the Old Year rice is offered to the ancestors, with a sacrificed chicken, and a soul-calling (\"hu plig\") ritual is held.\n\nThe shaman's altar is a special hanging or standing altar, with two or three tiers depending on the status of the shaman. It is believed to represent Siv Yis' grotto near the top of the holy mountain, above a pool near of which grows the flower of immortality. This pool is represented by a bowl of water placed upon the altar. From the altar depart several cotton threads resulting attached to the central housepost, and it is along these threads that the \"neeb\" travel when they visit the altar.\n\nA third type of Hmong altar is devoted to a special category of gods known as the \"dab tshuaj\", or gods of medicine, which are generally worshipped by women, since in Hmong culture they specialise in the knowledge of herbalism.\n\nJoss papers are a central element of Hmong altars. There are both joss paper used as offerings and decorative joss papers. The second ones are used as symbols connecting with the gods, and they are usually composed of large white sheets, with smaller yellow or silver sheets, and sometimes little red squares.\n\nMiao religious rituals involving the worship of gods and ancestors are performed by the patriarch of each family or the spiritual leader of a clan or a cluster of male relatives. More difficult ceremonies such as soul-calling (\"hu plig\") are performed by ritual experts the shaman (\"txiv neeb\") for spiritual healing, and various experts in funeral rites like the reed pipe player (\"txiv qeej\"), the soul chanter (\"nkauj plig\") and the blessing singers (\"txiv xaiv\"). The soul is believed to reincarnate. The body (\"cev\") is a microcosm believed to be constructed by a number of souls (\"plig\" or \"ntsuj\") that mirror the macrocosm.\n\nHmong religion includes specific rituals for the milestones of the life cycle: there are rituals for birth and baby naming, marriage, rename after marriage, trauma and sickness, extending the mandate of life for sick elderly, death and funeral. There are also festivals with corresponding ceremonies: the New Year (\"Lwm Qaib\" or \"Ntoo Xeeb\", or also \"Noj Peb Caug\") in mid-November, \"Nyuj Dab\" (Ox Festival), \"Dab Roog\" (Door Festival) and \"Npua Tai\" (Pig Festival).\n\n\n\n"}

Professor Jaini is the author of several books and papers. His best known work is \"The Jaina Path of Purification\" (1979). Some of his major articles have been published under these titles: \"The Collected Papers on Jaina Studies\" (2000) and \"Collected Papers on Buddhist Studies\" (2001).\n\nJaini was born to a Digambar Jain family residing in Nellikar, a small town near Moodabidri, Karnataka, India. His father had abandoned his title of Shetty and adopted the name of Jaini—after the famous Jain scholar, Jugmandar Lal Jaini (1881-1927)—responding to calls within the community to change their names to foster a greater sense of Jain identity. After completing his elementary education, he was sent to Digambara Jain Gurukul, a boarding school in Vidharbha, Maharashtra. It was run on traditional Jain principles and here he came in contact with Jain scholars of his time like – Pandit Nathuram Premi, Dr. Hiralal Jain, Dr. A.N. Upadhye.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education here, he went to Arts College at Nashik where he took the degree of BA hons in 1947 in Sanskrit and Prakrit. During this time he supported himself by taking a job as a superintendent of a Jain Svetambara Hostel and thus coming in contact with the Svetambara community for the first time.\n\nAfter graduation, he was invited to study with Pandit Sukhlal Sanghavi, a renowned scholar belonging to the Sthanakvasi Jain tradition. His daily meeting with Sanghavi, involved not only a formal and rigorous instruction in Jain logic, but he was also exposed to Sanghavi's views on various sectarian debates and controversies. With Sukhlalji's encouragement he studied Pali canon and decided to continue his postgraduate studies in Sri Lanka, thus acquiring a thorough knowledge of Pali Canon and Buddhist scriptures. Here he became a Dharmananda Kosambi memorial Scholar and met Dr. B. R. Ambedkar (before his conversion to Buddhism) and was awarded Tripatakacarya degree in 1951 at the residence of the Prime Minister Senanayake. His years in Sri Lanka were the basis for his first publication in Gujarati, \"Ceylonman Be Varsa\" (Two years in Ceylon). It contains much information on the Theravada Buddhism philosophy and practices.\n\nOn returning he took up position as a lecturer in Ahmedabad and in 1952 he took up position as a lecturer in Pali in Benaras university. Subsequently he took up position as a lecturer in Pali and Sanskrit with SOAS, London from 1956 to 1957. There under John Borough's supervision he completed his Ph.D. in Buddhist work, Abhidharmadipa. From there he travelled to Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand to collect various Buddhist manuscripts which he later edited and translated for Pali Text Society. Subsequently he moved to University of Michigan as professor of Indic Languages and Literature up to 1972. .Thereafter from 1972 to 1994 he served as a professor of Buddhist studies in Department of South and Southeast Asian studies, University of Berkeley, California.

According to Jain beliefs, he became a siddha - a liberated soul which has destroyed all of its karma.\n\nIn the Jain tradition, it is believed that Padmaprabha was born to King Shridhar and Queen Susimadevi in the Ikshvaku dynasty at Kausambi which is in today's Uttar Pradesh, India. Padmaprabha means ‘bright as a red lotus’ in Sanskrit.It is said in Śvetāmbara sources that his mother had a fancy for a couch of red lotuses – padma – while he was in her womb.\n\nHis birth date was the twelfth day of the Kartik krishna month of the Indian calendar. On the eleventh day of the dark half of the month of \"Margashirsh\", Bhagwan Padmaprabha, along with other 308 saints was liberated and attained moksha on Sammet Shikhar (mountain).\n\nMaharaja Aparajit ruled over Susima town located in Dhatki realm in Purvavideh region in Vatsa country. He was a simple and religious person. He got detached after listening to the discourse of an Arihant and took \"diksha\" from \"Acharya\" Pihitashrava. As a result of long spiritual practices, he earned \"Tirthankar-nama-gotra-karma\". Completing his age, he reincarnated as a god in the Graiveyak realm.\n\nFrom the realm of gods, the being that was Aparajit descended into the womb of queen Susima, wife of the king of Kaushambi. One day, queen Susima had a desire to sleep on a bed made up of lotus flowers. As this was a desire of a pregnant mother, the gods made arrangements for its fulfillment. On \"Krishna\" \"Dwadashi\" (twelfth day of the waning fortnight) of the month of \"Kartik\", the queen gave birth to a son. The new born had a soft pink glow like lotus flowers. The king named him as \"Padmaprabha\" (meaning one with lotus-like glow).\n\nIn due course, the prince became young and was married. When his father left for spiritual practices, Padmaprabh ascended the throne. After a long and successful reign, when through his threefold knowledge he knew that the right moment has come, he became an ascetic. After six months of spiritual practices, on the full moon day of the month of Chaitra he attained omniscience under a banyan tree. Propagating right religion for a long time, Bhagavan Padmaprabh wandered around and at last arrived at Sammetshikhar. He attained Nirvana on the eleventh day of the dark half of the month of Margshirsh.\n\nPadmaprabha is associated with Red Lotus emblem, Chatrabha tree, Manovega (Dig.) & Mangupta (Svet.)

Dating from 8th-9th centuries AD, they pre-date the coming of Islam to the Indonesian archipelago by four centuries and were probably made in Java.\n\nUntil Islam became the dominant religion in Indonesia in the 13th Century, both Buddhism and Hinduism were adopted from the India subcontinent as the principal local religions. Over time, many buddhist sculptures were transported to the islands by pilgrims returning from holy sites in eastern India. These in turn inspired local craftsmen who developed their own styles and traits. The buddhist sculptures from Sambas Treasure was almost certainly made in Java based on artistic models that were developed in eastern India centuries before.\n\nThe Sambas Treasure was found in a large earthenware pot on the south-west coast of Borneo sometime during the 1940s. It was then owned by the collector Tan Yeok Seong, a Singaporean historian of Southeast Asia and a collector of historical artefacts.

She had five older sisters named Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten, Neferneferuaten Tasherit, and Neferneferure.\n\nOne of the earliest depictions of Setepenre is in a fresco from the King’s House in Amarna. She is depicted sitting on her mother Nefertiti's lap. The fresco is much damaged and only a small hand of Setepenre remains The fresco is dated to ca. year 9 of Akhenaten, and the entire family is depicted.\n\nThe next time the six princesses appeared together was in Year 12, on the eighth day of the second month of winter, during the so-called “reception of foreign tributes”. This event was depicted in the Amarna tombs of Meryre II and Huya. In the tomb of Meryre II, Akhenaten and Nefertiti are shown seated in a kiosk, receiving tribute from foreign lands.

Since she is not shown on Wall B in Room formula_2, where the royal family mourns the death of the second princess Meketaten, it is likely that she predeceased Meketaten as well, perhaps before the construction of the royal tomb was advanced enough to allow burial.

It is linked in the Talmud from the Biblical law requiring people to assist in unloading burdens from animals ().\n\n\"Tza'ar\" is an (ancient) Hebrew word for \"suffering\" and is used in this context with the meaning of \"suffering that does not advance some legitimate human good\", according to The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality. \"Ba'alei chayim\" is an expresion literally meaning \"owners of life\", which is used in the Talmud for \"animals\".\n\nIn traditional Jewish law, kosher animals may be eaten if they're killed using the slaughter method known as shechitah, where the animal is killed by having its throat cut swiftly using an extremely sharp and specially designed knife. Many rabbis assert that these regulations were put in place to reduce tza'ar ba'alei chayim and to ensure that the animal has the easiest possible death. The design of the kosher knives as well as regulation relating to how the cut is made have been seen to greatly reduce or completely eliminate reaction from the kosher cut. Even modern day scientists that are critical of shechita agree that it greatly improved welfare at slaughter in historical periods. Though, there is disagreement as to shechita's effectivity when compared to modern day slaughter methods, with some scientific experts in favor of the humanness of shechita and others opposed.\n\nIn 2000, the Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards banned the common slaughter method of \"shackling and hoisting\" (pulling a conscious animal into the air with a chain before slaughter). Rabbis Joel Roth and Elliot Dorff wrote a responsum on this topic which concluded that shackling and hoisting \"unquestionably constitutes a violation of Jewish laws that forbid us to cause undue pain to animals.\"\n\nEnforcing a commitment to tza'ar ba'alei chayim in food production has been part of the effort of Conservative Judaism's Magen Tzedek commission, formerly known as Hekshher Tzedek. The Magen Tzedek commission sees compliance with the Humane Farm Animal Care Standards (HFAC) as sufficiently preventing unnecessary suffering to animals. Amid disputed claims of Orthodox opposition the Magen Tzedek commission has not been successful in recruiting any food producers into its certification program.\n\nThe Jewish Initiative For Animals supports innovative programs that seek to turn the Jewish value of tza'ar ba'alei chayim into action and build Jewish American communities in the process. In November 2016 JIFA partnered with kosher meat distributors KOL Foods and Grow and Behold to bring the a run of kosher certified heritage breed chickens to market for the first time in approximately 50 years. Heritage breed chickens and turkeys are able to achieve highest possible welfare outcomes. Thus, the renewed availability of heritage chicken to kosher consumer has helped expand values of tza'ar ba'alei chayim within the modern kosher meat industry. JIFA has also sought to spread the values of tza'ar ba'alei chayim into the Jewish world through its Ark Project, a service-learning curriculum for b’nai mitzvah. This curriculum seeks to engages with Jewish teaching and real life problems about topics such as homeless animals, animals used in entertainment, farmed animal welfare, conservation of wildlife and more.\n\nThe Shamayim V'Aretz Institute is a Jewish animal protection group that educates leaders, trains advocates, and leads campaigns for the humane treatment of animals. Shamyim V'Aretz is led by activist rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz and has run campaigns which seek to end: kosher certification of veal, the controversial practice of kapparot, and the kosher certifying of cattle that are killed using shackle and hoist techniques.\n\nAccording to the Shulkhan Aruch, \"anything that is necessary for medical purposes, or for anything else, is exempt from the prohibition of causing suffering to animals\" (Even ha-Ezer 5:14).\n\nMost Jewish authorities allow medical research if it will help people in need, and if the animals do not undergo any unnecessary suffering. Reform Judaism's Central Conference of American Rabbis, for example, affirms that animal research is permissible if it will save human lives, so long as animals are subjected to little pain and not used in \"frivolous\" experiments such as cosmetic testing.\n\nA concern for suffering caused to animals is found in Judaism's Seven Laws of Noah, which apply to all humankind. One of the seven laws, \"ever min ha chai,\" prohibits eating the flesh of live animals. This law is derived from the Book of Genesis (), as interpreted in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 59a).\n\nCompassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of Moses, which made him the shepherd of his people, while Judah ha-Nasi saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf.\n\nResting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before they sit down to eat.\n\nAt harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work.\n\nA prohibition against using two different kinds of animals teamed together, such as ploughing or doing other work, is derived from the Torah in and the Mishnah in tractate Kila'yim elaborates upon this prohibition. The underlying concern is for the welfare of the animals, particularly the weaker of the pair.\n\nSports like bullfighting are forbidden by most authorities. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef has characterized bullfighting as \"a culture of sinful and cruel people\" which is opposed by Torah values.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5083521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5083521", "title": "Vajrasattva", "text": "Vajrasattva\n\nVajrasattva (Sanskrit: वज्रसत्त्व, Tibetan: རྡོ་རྗེ་སེམས་དཔའ། Dorje Sempa, short form is རྡོར་སེམས། Dorsem, Монгол: Доржсэмбэ) is a bodhisattva in the Mahayana, Mantrayana/Vajrayana Buddhist traditions. In the Japanese Vajrayana school of Buddhism, Shingon, Vajrasattva is the esoteric aspect of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra and is commonly associated with the student practitioner who through the master's teachings, attains an ever-enriching subtle and rarefied grounding in their esoteric practice. In Tibetan Buddhism Vajrasattva is associated with the sambhogakāya and purification practice.\n\nVajrasattva appears principally in two Buddhists texts: the \"Mahavairocana Sutra\" and the \"Vajrasekhara Sutra\". In the Diamond Realm Mandala, Vajrasattva sits to the East near Akshobhya Buddha.\n\nIn some esoteric lineages, Nagarjuna was said to have met Vajrasattva in an iron tower in South India, and was taught tantra, thus transmitting the esoteric teachings to more historical figures.\n\nMantra = । ॐ वज्रसत्त्व हूं॥ \noṁ vajrasattva hūṁ\n\n\"Vajrasattva\"' (, , ) is a bodhisattva in the Mahayana and Vajrayana buddhist traditions. Vajrasattva's name translates to \"Diamond Being\" or \"Thunderbolt Being\", or, more appropriately considering that the term \"vajra\" often functions as a marker for tantric Buddhism, \"the Tantric Buddhist Being\".\n\nVajrasattva is an important figure in the tantric Buddhism of the Newar Vajrācāryas of the Kathmandu Valley. He represents the ideal guru, and he is frequently invoked in the \"guru maṇḍala\", the foundational ritual for all other Newar Buddhist rituals and the daily pūjā for Newar priests. The śatākṣara (100 syllable prayer to Vajrasattva) is memorized early in life by most practicing Newar Buddhists.\n\nIn the Shingon Buddhist lineage, Vajrasattva is traditionally viewed as the second patriarch, the first being Vairocana Buddha himself. According to Kukai's writings in \"Record of the Dharma Transmission\" he relates a story based on Amoghavajra's account that Nagarjuna met Vajrasattva in an iron tower in southern India. Vajrasattva initiated Nagarjuna into the abhiseka ritual and entrusted him with the esoteric he had learned from Vairocana Buddha, as depicted in the Mahavairocana Sutra. Kukai does not elaborate further on Vajrasattva or his origins.\n\nElsewhere, Vajrasattva is an important figure in two esoteric Buddhist sutras, the Mahavairocana Sutra and the Vajrasekhara Sutra. In the first chapter of the Mahavairocana Sutra, Vajrasattva leads a host of beings who visit Vairocana Buddha to learn the Dharma. Vajrasattva inquires about the cause, goal and foundation of all-embracing wisdom, which leads to a philosophical discourse by the Buddha. The audience cannot comprehend the teaching, so the Buddha demonstrates through the use mandala. Vajrasattva then questions why rituals and objects are needed if the truth is beyond form. Vairocana Buddha replies to Vajrasattva that these are expedient means to bring practitioners to experience awakening more readily, and so on. In Shingon Buddhist rituals for initiation, the \"kechien kanjō\", the initiate re-enacts the role of Vajrasattva and recites mantra and dialogue from the sutras above. The Maha Acharya enacts the role of Mahavairocana Buddha bestowing wisdom upon the student.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism the Vajrasattva root tantra is \"Dorje Gyan\", or \"Vajra Ornament\". Vajrasattva practices are common to all of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and are used both to purify obscurations so that the Vajrayana student can progress beyond Ngondro practices to the various yoga practices of tantra and also to purify any broken samaya vows after initiation. As such, Vajrasattva practice is an essential element of Tibetan Buddhist practice.\n\nIn addition to personal practice, the Vajrasattva mantra is regarded as having the ability to purify karma, bring peace, and cause enlightened activity in general. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche announced a project, Prayer 4 Peace, to accumulate one billion six syllable Vajrasattva recitations by practitioners around the world. The six syllable mantra (oṁ vajrasattva hūṁ ), is a less formal version of the one hundred syllable mantra on which it is based but contains the essential spiritual points of the longer mantra, according to lama and tulku Jamgon Kongtrul.\n\nIn Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhist practice, Vajrasattva is used in the Ngondro, or preliminary practices, in order to \"purify\" the mind's defilements, prior to undertaking more advanced tantric techniques. The \"yik gya\", the \"Hundred Syllable Mantra\" () supplication of Vajrasattva, approaches universality in the various elementary Ngondro sadhana for sadhakas of all Mantrayana and Sarma schools bar the Bonpo. The pronunciation and orthography differ between lineages.\n\nThe evocation of the Hundred Syllable Vajrasattva Mantra in the Vajrayana lineage of Jigme Lingpa's (1729–1798) ngondro from the\" Longchen Nyingtig\" displays Sanskrit-Tibetan hybridization. Such textual and dialectical \"diglossia\" (Sanskrit: dvaibhashika) is evident from the earliest transmission of tantra into the region, where the original Sanskrit phonemes and lexical items are often orthographically rendered in the Tibetan, rather than the comparable indigenous terms (Davidson, 2002). Though Jigme Lingpa did not \"compose\" the Hundred Syllable Mantra, his scribal style bears a marked similarity to it as evidenced by his biographies (Gyatso, 1998). Jigme Lingpa as \"pandit\", which in the Himalayan context denotes an indigenous Tibetan versed in Sanskrit, often wrote in a hybridized Sanskrit-Tibetan diglossia.\n\n\"The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva\" () is one of the Seventeen Tantras of Dzogchen Upadesha.\n\nSamantabhadra discourses to Vajrasattva and in turn Vajrasattva asks questions of Samantabhadra in clarification in the Kulayaraja Tantra (Wyl. kun byed rgyal po; Tib. künjé gyalpo) or \"The All-Creating King Tantra\", the main tantra of the Mind Series of Dzogchen.\n\nVajrasattva is often depicted with various consorts, the peaceful one Vajragarvi aka Vajrasattvātmikā (Tib. \"Dorje Nyema\"), Dharmadhatvishvari, Ghantapani (\"Bell Bearer\"), the wrathful one Diptacakra, Vajratopa, Vajrabhrikuti, and others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "928024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=928024", "title": "Wadiyar dynasty", "text": "Wadiyar dynasty\n\nThe Wadiyar (alternatively spelt Wodeyer or Odeyer) dynasty was a Hindu Yadav dynasty in Indian subcontinent that ruled the Kingdom of Mysore from 1399 to 1950, with a brief interruption in the late 1700s. The kingdom was incorporated into the Dominion of India after its independence from British rule. The Wodiyar dynasty is the Yadav royal family from Mysore.\n\nWadiyar\n\nHistorions say that they came to Karnataka from the northern territory near Himalayas and on seeing the natural beauty of the place made Mysore their abode. The dynasty was established in 1399 by Yaduraya Wodeyar. He ruled Mysore under the Vijayanagara Empire until 1423. After Yaduraya Wodeyar, the Mysore kingdom was succeeded by the Wadiyar rulers. The kingdom remained fairly small during this early period and was a part of the Vijayanagara Empire. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, the Kingdom of Mysore became independent and remained so until 1799.\n\nDuring the reign of Krishnaraja Wadiyar III (1799–1868), the region came under the control of the British Empire. His successors changed the English spelling of their royal name to Wadiyar and took the title of \"Bahadur\". The last two monarchs of the dynasty, Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, also accepted the British decoration Knight Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated in 1565. The power vacuum created soon after was exploited by Raja Wadiyar (ruled 1578–1617). He expanded the borders of the Mysore kingdom and in 1610 changed the capital city from Mysore to Srirangapatna; a rare island formed by the river Kaveri, which provided natural protection against military attacks.\n\nLater famous rulers of the dynasty included Kanthirava Narasaraja I (ruled 1638–1659), who expanded the frontiers of the Mysore kingdom to Trichy in Tamil Nadu. The dynasty reached its peak under Chikka Devaraja (ruled 1673–1704), who reformed the administration of the empire by dividing it into 18 departments (called Chavadis) and he also introduced a coherent system of taxation.\n\nFrom 1760 to 1799, the rule of the dynasty was essentially nominal, with real power in the hands of the \"dalwai\", or commanders-in-chief, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, who expanded the kingdom aggressively, but clashed with the British East India Company. After Tipu Sultan was killed by the British in the Battle of Srirangapatna in 1799, the Wadiyars were restored to a reduced kingdom.\n\nAfter restoring the Wadiyars to the throne of Mysore, the British shifted the capital back to the city of Mysore from Srirangapatna. The four-year-old boy (Mummudi) Krishna Raja Wadiyar III, son of the last Wadiyar king, Khasa Chamaraja Wadiyar VIII, was anointed as the King of Mysore. Wadiyars were now subsidiaries of the British Raj and had to pay an annual subsidy to the British. However the British took over the administration of the kingdom on a specious plea of non-payment of the subsidy by Mummudi Krishna Raja Wadiyar in 1831, and British-appointed commissioners were then in charge of the kingdom.\n\nBritish commissioners administered Mysore from 1831–1881. Mark Cubbon (1834–1861) and L. B. Bowring (1861–1870) are among the well-known commissioners of the period.\n\nIn 1868, the British Parliament heeded the king's plea and decided to restore the kingdom to his adopted son Chamaraja Wadiyar IX. In 1881, the transfer of power back to the Wadiyars heralded an important phase in the making of modern Mysore. For the first time in India, democratic experiments were introduced by the establishment of a representative assembly. The next king, Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, earned great fame as a saintly King-Rajarishi, and his kingdom was hailed as Ramarajya by Mahatma Gandhi as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by the historical hero Lord Rama.\n\nUnder British hegemony, the Wadiyars, freed from security concerns, shifted their attention to the patronage of the fine arts. They made Mysore a cultural center of Karnataka, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters.\n\nThe last king of the Wadiyar dynasty was Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, who ruled from 1940 until Indian independence from British rule. In the year 1947, after India attained independence, he ceded his kingdom to the Dominion of India, but continued as the Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950. He became the Raja Pramukh—a constitutional position—as the head of Mysore State in the Republic of India from 1950–1956. After the reorganization of the Indian states on a linguistic basis, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State) in 1956 and held the post until 1964.\n\nThen he was Governor of Madras state (now Tamil Nadu) for two years. The Indian Constitution continued to recognize him as the Maharajah of Mysore, until 1971, when Mrs. Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India, abolished the titles and Privy Purse of over 560 Maharajahs. The Maharajah died in 1974. His only son, Srikanta Datta Narasimha Raja Wadiyar (1953–2013), was a member of the Indian Parliament for many years.\n\nSee Maharaja of Mysore\n\nA curse was believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the Vijayanagar Empire. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death — \"Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali\" (May Talakadu become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children). 400 years since, the Wadiyar dynasty never had any children for alternate generations. Hence the adopted child becomes the king. Even till date, most parts of Talakadu (Talakad) lie under sand, and Malangi village in present Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools.\n\nThe Mysore kingdom, founded by Yaduraya in the year 1399, consisted of only the areas surrounding the present Mysore City. The original fort was supposed to have been at a place known as haDadana — now a small village on the southern side of Chamundi Hill. The Wadiyars, like others at that time, were under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Viceroy of the Vijayanagar kingdom was headquartered at Srirangapatna. Under Yaduraya, the Wadiyars increased their influence and territory over the next 200 years. Raja Wadiyar, the ninth ruler of the dynasty, was known for his valour and patronage of art and culture. He ruled from 1578 to 1617. In 1610, he conquered the fort of Srirangapatna from Tirumala, then Viceroy of Vijayanagar. Tirumala is said to have retired to Talakad with his two wives. One of them, Alamelamma, was a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki, the consort of Sri Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of Srirangapatna.\n\nTirumala suffered from a terminal disease on his back known as the \"disease of the kings\". The condition of Tirumala deteriorated and he died. Alamelamma had a large amount of precious jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow she was no longer permitted jewellery. She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.\n\nThe temple authorities requested Raja Wadiyar to give them the custody of the jewels, as was the normal practice. The treasury officials informed the king of this fact. Raja Wadiyar thought these jewels were of no value to Alamelamma, as she was now a widow and didn't have children, she would no longer need them. Raja Wadiyar sent emissaries to Malangi, where Alamelamma was staying, with a request to return the jewels. Only the pearl-studded nose ring was returned by Alamelamma. Raja Wadiyar then sent his army to Talakad to ask her once again and, if she refused, to seize them by force. To escape the wrath of the Mysore army, Alamelamma uttered the legendary curse on Raja Wadiyar and jumped into a whirlpool in the river Kaveri at Talakadu with the rest of the jewels and escaped unscathed. The curse, as passed down in folklore over the last 400 years, is:\n\nHearing of this extreme step taken by Alamelamma, Raja Wadiyar was truly repentant. He wanted to return the jewellery to the temple and not confiscate it for his own use. In his grief he had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshiped it as a deity. A remnant of her hair was preserved in a box. To this day, Alamelamma’s idol can be found inside the Mysore Palace and is worshiped by the royal family. One can see the same huge pearl nose-stud adorning the Goddess Ranganayaki and Alamelamma today.\n\nThe Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma, and the kankana worn by the royal couple is removed thereafter paving the way for the Vijaya Dashami – Sami pooja the next day. For these nine days the royal couple are required to stay inside the precincts of the palace. Another interesting part of the story is that this Alamelamma temple is under the care of the legal heirs of Alamelamma: They live inside the Mysore Palace fort. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed, and they do not beget children and follow the same pattern afflicting the Wodeyars.\n\nAfter shifting to Srirangapatna, Raja Wadiyar is credited with holding the famous Dasara festivities for the first time in 1610. His only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore) just a day before the commencement of Navaratri, but the king after consulting experts laid down the rule that the celebration of the ceremonies was not to be interrupted even by the death of members of the royal family. Raja Wadiyar was a devoted Vaishnavaite, and he donated the famous bejewelled crown to Lord Cheluvarayaswami of Melukote that is a feature of the Raja Mudi car festival even today. This is contrary to his own lineage as the Wadiyars regarded the temple of Karigiri Lakshmi Narasimha (Devarayana Durga, Tumkur) as their household deity. The mere fact that all the Wadiyars end their names by -\"Narasimharaja Wadiyar\" stands testimony to what was previously stated. This crown was confiscated from the royal Family by the Karnataka Government during an emergency. Legend has it that Raja Wadiyar, having entered the garbha–gruha (sanctum sanctorum) of Cheluvarayaswami Temple on 20 June 1617, became one with the deity (aikya). Even today one can find a Bhakthi Vigraha of the King inside the Temple. Another Bhakthi Vigraha of the King can be found inside the Lakshmi-Narayanaswami Temple inside the Mysore Palace Fort. Malangi and Talakad are two small towns near Tirumakudalu Narasipura on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. Talakad's temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma's curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture. What can be stated with certainty is that the curse on the royal family seems to have come true. Their chief courtier Ram Nath Molahalli was the army head.\n\nFrom Raja Wadiyar’s death in 1617 to that of Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar in 1704 (there were four rulers in between) the kingdom was ruled by the surviving descendants of Yaduraya, but none could beget legal heirs. Incidentally, Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar is credited with the composition of Gita Gopala – an opera in Kannada. The sole exception to the curse was Chikka Devaraja's deaf and mute son Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II, also known as Mookarasu. He was succeeded by his son Dodda Krushna Raja Wodeyar, who ruled from 1714 to 1732. With him Yaduraya’s direct lineage came to an end. What followed was a succession of nominal rulers adopted by the surviving queens to continue the tradition. Traditional army commanders known as Dalvoys virtually ruled the kingdom and paved the way for the ascendancy of a foot soldier like Hyder Ali by 1762. There were five rulers from 1732 to 1796. In this period a definite pattern emerged under which no natural heir to the throne born to a king (adopted or otherwise) could beget children, whereas one who became king by virtue of adoption or other indirect inheritance was blessed with a legal heir. Hyder and Tipu continued the tradition of having a nominal Wodeyar King on the throne, and even the Dasara Celebrations continued as usual. After the famous Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the death of Tipu Sultan, a British army, in which the legendary Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington, also known as the Iron Duke) was serving, conquered Srirangapatna in 1799.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6729563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6729563", "title": "Écône consecrations", "text": "Écône consecrations\n\nThe Écône consecrations were a set of episcopal consecrations that took place in Écône, Switzerland, on 30 June 1988. They were performed by Catholic Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Bishop Antonio de Castro Meyer, and the priests raised to the episcopacy were four members of Lefebvre's Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX). The consecrations, performed against the explicit orders of Pope John Paul II, represented a milestone in the troubled relationship of Lefebvre and the SSPX with the Church leadership. The Holy See's Congregation for Bishops issued a decree signed by its Prefect Cardinal Bernardin Gantin declaring that Lefebvre had incurred automatic excommunication by consecrating the bishops without papal consent.\n\nOn 24 January 2009, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunications of the four bishops (Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson, and Alfonso de Galarreta) consecrated by Archbishop Lefebvre. Fellay, superior general of SSPX, issued a statement in which the society expressed its \"filial gratitude to the Holy Father for this gesture which, beyond the Priestly Society of Saint Pius X, will benefit the whole Church,\" and that the \" wishes always to be more able to help the pope to remedy the unprecedented crisis which presently shakes the Catholic world, and which Pope John Paul II had designated as a state of 'silent apostasy'.\"\n\nReaction to the lifting of excommunications was divided. Many Traditionalist Catholics attributed the decision to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. But other Catholics, especially those of progressive stance, said they were surprised that the Pope had acted in such a positive way toward bishops holding such reactionary positions. The inclusion of Bishop Williamson in the measure was particularly controversial, because some of his remarks (which the Holy See claimed not to have been aware of at the time) were seen as constituting Holocaust denial. The lifting of his excommunication presented problems for Catholic-Jewish relations, culminating in the Chief Rabbinate of Israel severing ties with the Holy See on 28 January 2009 in protest.\n\nCriticism of the Écône consecrations centred on the fact that they were carried out against the explicit orders of the then reigning Pope John Paul II. Under the Catholic Code of Canon Law, the consecration of a bishop requires the permission of the Pope, and (unless a papal dispensation has been granted) at least three consecrating bishops. Violation of the rule about the Pope's permission expressed in Canon 1013 has, since 1951, entailed automatic (\"latae sententiae\") excommunication reserved to the Holy See both for the consecrator and for the recipient of the consecration, and in this case there was not only an absence of permission but an actual prohibition by the Pope.\n\nLefebvre and his supporters argued that the circumstances under which the consecrations took place were such that none of the clergy involved were truly excommunicated. One of their arguments was that a 'state of necessity' existed in which the ordinary provisions of canon law could be set aside. The Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts rejected this argument, stating in a 1996 Explanatory Note that \"there is never a necessity to ordain Bishops contrary to the will of the Roman Pontiff\". Consecrating a bishop without papal approval was also condemned by Pope Pius XII after the Chinese government set up the state-controlled Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Pius XII stated that the sacramental activity of illicitly consecrated bishops was \"gravely illicit, that is, criminal and sacrilegious\", and rejected the defence of necessity put forward by those involved.\n\nIn the 1970s, Lefebvre had stated that he would not consecrate bishops to continue his work with the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). It is alleged that in 1974 (at the age of 69) he told a confidant that he could not take such a step, \"for this would mean I would do what Martin Luther did, and I would lose the Holy Ghost\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Lefebvre's stance changed. In 1983 (at the age of 78), while in the United States, he reportedly sounded out his American priests about the prospect of him consecrating bishops. Those superiors who objected to the idea were removed from their posts as a result. In 1986–1987, the Society's adherents in St Mary's, Kansas were required to attend a series of catechetical sessions in which they were prepared for the forthcoming consecrations and their fallout.\n\nAt the age of 82, Lefebvre first publicly announced his intention to consecrate bishops in a sermon at an ordination Mass in Écône on 29 June 1987, in which he declared that \"Rome is in darkness, in the darkness of error\" and that \"the bishops of the whole world are following the false ideas of the Council with their ecumenism and liberalism.\" He concluded: \"This is why it is likely that before I give account of my life to the good Lord, \"I shall have to consecrate some bishops\".\"\n\nLefebvre and the Holy See engaged in dialogue and, on 5 May 1988, Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI) signed the text of an agreement intended to end the dispute and open the way for the consecration of a successor to Lefebvre. In the first, doctrinal, part of the document, Lefebvre, in his own name and on behalf of the SSPX promised fidelity to the Catholic Church and to the Pope, accepted the doctrine contained in section 25 of the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution \"Lumen gentium\" on the Church's magisterium, pledged a non-polemical attitude of communication with the Holy See on the problematic aspects of the Vatican II, recognized the validity of the revised sacraments and promised to respect the common discipline of the Church and her law. The second, legal, part of the document envisaged that the SSPX would become a Society of Apostolic Life with certain exemptions, it would have the faculty to celebrate the Tridentine rites, a special commission including two members of the SSPX to resolve conflicts and a member of the SSPX to be consecrated as a bishop.\n\nThis document was to be submitted to the Pope for his approval. However, Lefebvre quickly came to the view that he was being enticed into a trap. The very next day, he declared he was obliged in conscience to proceed, with or without papal approval, to ordain on 30 June a bishop to succeed him.\n\nA further meeting took place in Rome on 24 May. Lefebvre was now promised that the Pope would appoint a bishop from among the members of the SSPX, chosen according to the normal procedures, and that the consecration would take place on 15 August, at the close of the Marian year. In return, Lefebvre would have to request reconciliation with the Pope on the basis of the protocol of 5 May. Lefebvre requested in writing that the consecration of three bishops take place on 30 June and that the majority of the members of the special commission must be from the SSPX. On the Pope's instructions, Ratzinger replied on 30 May to Lefebvre concerning these requests, \"[O]n the question of the commission, whose purpose was to favour reconciliation, not to make decisions, the Holy Father thought it best to keep to the agreement that Lefebvre had signed on 5 May\"; on the question of the ordination of bishops, the Pope reiterated his readiness to speed up the usual process so as to nominate a member of the Society to be consecrated on 15 August, and Lefebvre was asked to provide the necessary information on candidates for this purpose, but, Ratzinger added, \"Since you have announced again recently your intention to ordain three bishops on 30 June with or without the agreement of Rome, you must state clearly that you entrust yourself to the Holy Father's decision in full obedience.\"\n\nOn 3 June, Lefebvre wrote from Écône, stating that he intended to proceed with the consecrations. On 9 June, the Pope replied to him with a personal letter, appealing to him not to proceed with a design that \"would be seen as nothing other than a schismatic act, the theological and canonical consequences of which are known to you.\" Lefebvre did not reply, and the letter was made public on 16 June.\n\nOn 17 June, Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops sent the proposed bishops a formal canonical warning that they would automatically incur the penalty of excommunication if they were ordained by Lefebvre without papal permission.\n\nOn 29 June, Cardinal Ratzinger sent the following telegram to Lefebvre:\nOn 30 June, Lefebvre consecrated four SSPX priests: Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta. Bishop Emeritus Antônio de Castro Mayer of Campos, Brazil was co-consecrator with Lefebvre.\n\nPrince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma was present at the consecration ceremony and was the first to congratulate Lefebvre publicly.\n\nThe day after the consecration, 1 July 1988, the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops issued a decree signed by Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, Prefect of the Congregation, declaring that Lefebvre, Fellay, Tissier de Mallerais, Williamson, and de Galarreta had incurred automatic excommunication. On the following day Pope John Paul II, in his apostolic letter \"Ecclesia Dei\", condemned the Archbishop's action. The Pope stated that, since schism is defined in canon 751 of the Code of Canon Law as \"withdrawal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or from communion with the members of the Church subject to him\", the consecration \"constitute[d] a schismatic act.\" He declared: \"In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal canonical warning sent to them by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops on 17 June last, Mons. Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta, have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by ecclesiastical law\", a reference to canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law.\n\nLefebvre declared that he had not withdrawn his submission to the Pope, and that canons 1323 and 1324 of the Code absolved him of culpability because of the crisis in the Church. Canon 1324 provides that, when someone wrongly believes that there is a state of necessity that compels him to perform a canonically illegal act (even if his ignorance on this point is culpable, provided that the act in question is not inherently evil or tending to the harm of souls), the canonical penalty for the relevant act is to be reduced or replaced, and automatic penalties do not apply. The Holy See rejects this argument as irrelevant, both because Lefebvre had been served with express canonical warnings and because of the rule in canon 1325 that ignorance which is \"crass or supine or affected\" provides no defence under canons 1323 and 1324.\n\nAccording to the SSPX, several churchmen and canon lawyers have affirmed that the consecration was not a schismatic act, on the basis that Lefebvre was merely consecrating auxiliary bishops rather than attempting to establish a parallel church. It has been claimed that Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos agrees with this assessment. In line with general canonical opinion, the Holy See holds that Archbishop Lefebvre committed a schismatic act, but not that he created a schismatic Church. Accordingly, when Cardinal Edward Idris Cassidy presented a revised edition of the Vatican's \"Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism\", he stated that \"[t]he situation of the members of [the SSPX] is an internal matter of the Catholic Church.\" Viewing Lefebvre's action as schismatic, a number of former members and supporters of the SSPX resigned or withdrew their support from the Society and joined the newly founded (and Vatican-approved) Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter.\n\nBy a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), issued in response to a request that Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority. The decree, signed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, Prefect of the Congregation, is as follows:\n\nReaction to the decree varied. As SSPX general superior, Bishop Fellay expressed gratitude. Some traditionalist Catholics attributed it to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, while other traditionalists, maintaining that the excommunication was non-existent, blamed the four bishops for asking for its remission. Others expressed surprise at the favour that the Pope had thus shown to bishops holding such positions, with particular regard to Bishop Williamson, who was accused as a Holocaust denier. The inclusion of this bishop presented problems for Catholic-Jewish relations, culminating in the Chief Rabbinate of Israel temporarily severing ties with the Vatican in protest.\n\n"}
