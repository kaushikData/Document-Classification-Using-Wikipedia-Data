Both organizations claim him as their founder; New Covenant Passover Church of God regard Ahn as a teacher, World Mission Society Church of God regard Ahn as God.\n\nAhn was born to Buddhist parents on 13 January 1918 in the small, rural village of Myeongdeok-ri in the North Jeolla Province at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule. The family migrated to Busan, where Ahn grew up in the Haeundae District, the city in which he would later found his church.\n\nFrom 1937, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, Ahn and his mother lived in Japan over a nine-year period. He returned to Korea in 1946, after the war, and began attending the local congregation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Incheon in 1947. Ahn reported getting revelations in 1953, and renounced his Buddhist faith and was credobaptised on 1948 In 1956 Ahn proclaimed that \"Within 10 years there will be a Second Coming of Jesus.\" On 5 April 1958 he married Hwang Wonsun (1923–2008), with the marriage producing three children.\n\nAhn grew critical to teachings in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the church excommunicated him in March 1962 over disputes about the cross as a religious symbol. Twenty-three people followed Ahn and left the church, and two years later on 28 April 1964, Ahn established his church Witnesses of Jesus Church of God in Busan. Witnesses of Jesus Church of God expanded to 13 congregations in South Korea before Ahn's death in 1985.\n\nMajor dogmata are outlined in \"Doctrine Manual of the Witnesses of Jesus Church of God\" (1972), and detailed in the more than two dozen books Ahn wrote. His original publications as well as scans of his notes and extant sermons have been made available online. Ahn argued that the practice of the apostolic early church had been distorted and his restorational doctrines and practices included:\n\nAhn, who like most Christians believed in the Second Coming of Jesus, had predicted a Second Coming \"within 10 years\" in 1956. In the tradition of Seventh-day Adventist eschatology, which had been suppressed by Kuniaki Koiso during his wartime rule of Korea, Ahn further believed to be living in the end time and that the Second Coming was imminent. As Korean Protestants earlier in the 20th century had perceived Japanese occupation by identifying symbolically with the history of Israel, Ahn through biblical exegesis in his book \"The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life\" (1980) interprets the Gospel of Matthew to suggest that the world could come to an end in 1988, 40 years after the independence of the modern state of Israel. Ahn's original \"The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life\" is made available online; World Mission Society Church of God in their later editions of the book have deleted information pertaining to the failed prediction. Ahn in his book \"The Bridegroom Was a Long Time in Coming, and They All Became Drowsy and Fell Asleep\" (1980) in a discussion based on scriptural typology, presented his conclusion that the world would come to an end in 2012:\nBy 1978 a group of people centered around a female member, one Um Sooin (born 1941), within the Witnesses of Jesus Church of God, claimed through a chain of scriptural eisegesis that they published in writing, that Um variously was \"the only bride\", \"the Heavenly Jerusalem\", \"the New Jerusalem\" on earth, \"the comforter sent by God\", and they asserted that she was \"our mother who has come down from Heaven\", and that Ahn was Christ. Um and the group around her claiming she was the spiritual mother were expelled from the church, and Ahn dedicated a book entitled \"Problems with the New Jerusalem, the Bride and Women's Veils\" (1980, reprinted 1983) to the controversy, in which he writes:\n\nAhn concludes his rebuking of Um Sooin:\nFollowing a heart attack during lunch on 24 February 1985, Ahn had a stroke en route to hospital, and died the next day, 25 February 1985 in the Catholic Maryknoll Hospital in Jung District, Busan. Ahn Sahng-hong was 67 years old. He was survived by his wife and three children.\n\nAhn was buried in a public grave located in Seokgye Cemetery north of Busan. From the time of his burial in 1985, a single tombstone stood beside the grave, the epitaph reading: \"The grave of the prophet Elijah Ahn Sahng-hong.\" After the death of his wife Hwang Won-sun 23 years later on 4 September 2008, she was buried in the plot beside Ahn, and a new tombstone carrying both their names (as well as their children's on the back) replaced the 1985 stone, repeating the epitaph.\n\nThe unexpected death of Ahn gave rise to a power struggle within Witnesses of Jesus Church of God: some people in the church wanted to continue along the lines laid out by Ahn, others wanted to re-introduce the concept of a \"spiritual mother\" embodied in the then 41-year-old woman named Zahng Gil-jah (born 1943). After an extraordinary general meeting in Witnesses of Jesus Church of God on 4 March 1985 failed to reconcile the opposing factions, a schism divided the church into two sects\n\nOne group of people in Witnesses of Jesus Church of God stayed on the premises in Busan. Among them were Ahn's wife and their three children. This sect is today known as New Covenant Passover Church of God. Ahn's son Ahn Kwang-sup (born 1954) is an elder in the church and continues to expound on his father's work. An outside observer visited the church and had this comment:\nAnother group of people in Witnesses of Jesus Church of God including the man Kim Joo-cheol and the woman Zahng Gil-jah wanted to re-introduce the concept of a \"spiritual mother\", and on 22 March 1985 moved from Busan to Seoul. On a meeting in Seoul on 2 June 1985, they established a church called Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God. Two major new doctrines were codified\nA change in religious practice, as reflected in the change of name from \"Witnesses of Jesus\" to \"Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong\", was, that prayers were no longer conducted in the name of Jesus Christ but in the name of \"Christ Ahn Sahng-hong\".\n\nThe deification of Ahn Sahng-hong and Zahng Gil-jah has been \"harshly criticized,\" and has led to the church being officially condemned by The National Council of Churches in Korea as an interdenominationally combatted, blasphemous, heretical cult.\n\nAs a central argument to the claim that Ahn Sahng-hong should be the Second Coming of Jesus, and in turn an argument for his suggested promotion of Zahng Gil-jah to the Bride of the Lamb, is the proposition that he fulfilled a Davidic prophecy by preaching 37 years from his baptism 16 December 1948 to his death on 25 February 1985, a period which in reality was only 36 years, 2 months, and 9 days. The source for the baptismal date of 16 December 1948 performed by a Pastor Lee Myeong-deok in Incheon is however obscure, and no written record exists. In 2011 a protocol from the Seventh-day Adventist Church was discovered, stating Ahn was baptised when he was 36 years old on 9 October 1954 by a Pastor Gim Seo-gyeong. The investigation by The International Korean Christian Coalition against Heresy showed, that while Pastor Gim could be confirmed, no Pastor Lee Myeong-deok was with the church in 1948, reducing the length of the ministry of Ahn from 36 years to 30 years and 4 months.\nWitnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God announced that \"1988 is the end of the world\" citing Matthew as Ahn had done in his 1980 book \"The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life\". A few thousand members of Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God gathered on a mountain in , Yeongi County, South Chungcheong Province awaiting the coming of Christ Ahn Sahng-hong, preparing for the rapture and the salvation of 144,000 souls. When Ahn failed to appear and nothing happened the church updated their apocalyptic forecast and scheduled it to the opening of the 1988 Olympics in Seoul later that year where the members gathered and preached the end of the world would come by the end of 1988 and that Ahn Sahng Hong would come again. WMSCOG later claimed it was a fulfillment of the preaching of Johna.\n\nAround 1997, Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God had established a non-profit organization titled the Church of God World Mission Society for the purpose of registering and managing the organization's assets.\n\nList of people claimed to be Jesus\n\n"}

He had a marked tendency to take independent positions and defy authority—both secular and ecclesiastical—which involved him in numerous controversies and nearly cost him his life during the French Revolution.\n\nAs the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" noted of him in 1913, \"Dereser's combative character got him in trouble everywhere, and, though believing himself a good Catholic, he was imbued with a rationalistic, anti-Roman spirit\", which made him \"imbued with the shallow Rationalism of his time\" and therefore \"explaining away everything supernatural in Scripture and religion\". This made all his writings \"tainted\" in the eyes of the Church authorities, though only one was placed on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (see below) and that without the name of the author - testifying to the Church's appreciation of his talent, in spite of its dislike of his rationalism.\n\nHis Profession was in Cologne on 18 October 1777. He was ordained in 1780 at Mainz. During his studies of Philosophy and Theology at Würzburg and Heidelberg, where he graduated, he acquired such renown that contrary to the custom of his religious order he was allowed to accept a professorship in Hermeneutics and Oriental Languages, first at his own alma mater, then at the Academy (University from 1786) of Bonn (1783–1791).\n\nIn 1791 he was sent to Strasbourg where he was a professor of Exegetical Theology and also filled the posts of preacher and of rector at the episcopal seminary. This embroiled him with the ongoing French Revolution. Dereser refused the Constitutional oath, making the clergy subordinate to the French civil authorities - an act which marked him out as a counter-revolutionary priest. During the Reign of Terror he was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the capital punishment was commuted into one of deportation. It is not quite clear whether this was put into execution; but it is certain that with the fall of Robespierre he regained his liberty and returned with shattered health to the convent in Heidelberg (1796).\n\nIn 1799 he became professor of Oriental Languages, Exegesis and Pastoral Theology in Heidelberg. The Margrave of Baden withholding his consent to Dereser's acceptance of the office of coadjutor to the Bishop of Strasbourg, Dereser was transferred with the whole university to Freiburg (1807), but having given offence by a funeral sermon (1810) had to leave suddenly to Karlsruhe where he was a pastor, and then to Constance.\n\nThence he went to Lucerne where from 1811 to 1814 he was Rector of the Episcopal Seminary, but was expelled on account of his rationalistic teaching, which involved explaining away everything supernatural in Scripture and religion. He turned, on invitation, to Breslau as canon and professor of Dogmatic Theology (1815). There he spent the rest of his life.\n\n\n"}

The figures and events of the poem's story are embellishments of mythological characters and events alluded to in the \"Gathas\", which are a set of autobiographical hymns in the \"Avesta\" that are attributed to the prophet Zoroaster.\n\nHistorically, Iranian epic poems such as this one were composed and sung by travelling minstrels, who in pre-Islamic times were a fixture of Iranian society. Although heroic tales such as the \"Memorial of Zarer\" were collected by Zoroastrian priests for the now-lost Sassanid-era \"Book of Kings\", (the \"Khwaday-Namag\", a 5th/6th-century collection of heroic legends), other minstrel compositions were either never written down (and have thus been lost), or are only known of from later translations into Islamic-era languages such as Arabic or Persian. While the Sassanid-era \"Book of Kings\" has also been lost, a copy of the \"Memorial of Zarer\" was preserved by Zoroastrian priests in Zoroastrian Middle Persian (so-called \"Pahlavi\", an exclusively written late form of Middle Persian used only by Zoroastrian priests), and it is the only surviving specimen of Iranian epic poetry in that Middle Iranian language.\n\nThe surviving manuscripts of the \"Memorial of Zarer\" are part of (copies of) the \"MK\" Codex, the colophones of which date to 1322, but—like most other \"Pahlavi\" literature represents a codification of earlier oral tradition. The language of the poem is significantly older than the 14th century, and even has Parthian language words, phrases and grammatical usages scattered through it. The manuscript came to the attention of western scholarship following Wilhelm Geiger's report of the \"MK\" collection in 1890. Following an analysis by Émile Benveniste in 1932, the poem is now generally considered to be a 5th or 6th-century (Sassanid-era) adaptation of an earlier (Arsacid-era) Parthian original.\n\nThe story of \"Memorial of Zarer\" plays in the time of the mythological Kayanid monarch Wishtasp (< Avestan Vishtaspa), the patron of Zoroaster. The story opens with the arrival of messengers at the Wishtasp's court. The message is from the daew-worshipping king of the Un-Iranianian Khyonas (< Av. Hyaona), Arjasp (< Avestan Arjat.aspa), who demands that Wishtasp \"abandon 'the pure Mazda-worshipping religion which he had received from Ohrmazd', and should become once more 'of the same religion'\" as himself. Arjasp threatens Wishtasp with a brutal battle if Wishtasp does not consent.\n\nZarer, who is Wishtap's brother and the command-in-chief of Wishtasp's army, pens a reply in which Arjasp's demands are rejected and a site for battle is selected. In preparation for battle, the army of the Iranians grows so large that the \"noise of the caravan of the country of Iran went up to heavens and the noise of the moving swords went up to hell.\" Wishtasp's chief-minister, Jamasp (< Av. Jamaspa), whom the poem praises as infinitely wise and able to fortell the future, predicts that the Iranians will win the battle, but also that many will die in it, including many of Wishtasp's clan/family. As predicted, many of the king's clansmen are killed in the fight, among them Wishtasp's brother Zarer, who is slain by Bidarafsh/Widrafsh, the wicked sorcerer (the epithet is 'jadu', implying a practitioner of black magic) of Arjasp's court.\n\nZarer's 7-year old son, Bastwar (< Av. Bastauuairi) goes to the battlefield to recover his father's body. Enraged and grieving, Bastwar wows to take revenge. Although initially forbidden to engage in battle due to his youth, Bastwar engages with the Khyaonas, killing many of them, and revenging his father by shooting an arrow through Widrafsh's heart. Meanwhile, Bastwar's cousin Spandyad (< Av. Spentodata) has captured Arjasp, who is then mutilated and humiliated by being sent away on a donkey without a tail.\n\nBastwar is subsequently appointed his father's successor as commander-in-chief and given the hand of Wishtasp's daughter, Homai, in marriage.\n\nAlthough quintessentially Zoroastrian (i.e. indigenous ethnic Iranian religious tradition), the epic compositions of the travelling minstrels continued to be retold (and further developed) even in Islamic Iran, and the figures/events of these stories were just as well-known to Muslim Iranians as they had been to their Zoroastrian ancestors. The 5th/6th-century \"Book of Kings\", now lost, and partly perhaps a still living oral tradition in north-eastern Iran, served as the basis for a 10th-century rhymed-verse version of the \"Memorial of Zarer\" by Abu-Mansur Daqiqi. In turn, Daqiqi's poem was incorporated by Firdausi in his \"Shahnameh\". In 2009, these adaptations of \"Memorial of Zarer\" became the basis of the stage play \"Yādegār-e Zarirān\" written by Qotb al-Din Sadeqi, and played by Mostafa Abdollahi, Kazem Hozhir-Azad, Esmayil Bakhtiyari and others.\n\n\n"}

It is also called the \"Discourse of Sri Heruka\" (\"sriherukabhidhana\") and the \"Samvara Light\" (\"Laghusamvara\"). David B. Gray dates this tantra to the late eight or early ninth century.\n\nThe Cakrasamvara Tantra is mostly dedicated to describing rituals and meditations which produce either mundane siddhis (accomplishment) such as flight and the supramundane siddhi of awakening. These are achieved through deity yoga (visualizing oneself as the deity) and the use of mantras. \n\nThe central deity of the mandala, Saṃvara, is a form of Heruka, one of the principal yidam or meditational deities of the Sarma schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nSaṃvara is typically depicted with a blue-coloured body, four faces, and twelve arms, and embracing his consort, the wisdom dakini Vajravārāhī in Yab-Yum. Other forms of the deity are also known with varying numbers of limbs.\n\nSaṃvara and Vajravārāhī are not to be thought of as two different entities, as an ordinary husband and wife are two different people; in reality, their divine embrace is a metaphor for the union of great bliss and emptiness, which are one and the same essence.\n\nIn Western meditation texts his name is often translated to mean \"Highest Bliss\". Meditation on Cakrasaṃvara is an advanced practice transmitted by one's lama, and binds the mind of the meditator to enlightenment itself.\n\nThe Samvara texts adopted the pitha list from the Saiva text \"Tantrasadbhava\", introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word is derived from the Greek Καθολικος, meaning \"wholeness\" and it was used to designate ecclesiastical primacy of some major metropolitan sees.\n\nWhile a catholicos is sometimes considered to correspond to a bishop in the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions, a catholicate is typically a larger and more significant organizational division than a bishopric, archdiocese or episcopal see. Catholicates often have distinct cultural traditions established over many centuries.\n\nWithin the Armenian Apostolic Church there are two catholicosates: the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin in Etchmiadzin, Armenia, and the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia in Antelias, Lebanon. In the 10th century, when lands inhabited by Armenians were devastated by Seljuks, the Armenian church took refuge in Cilicia. In the 15th century, a new catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin.\n\nWhile some traditions favor the English language spelling \"catholicate\", others favor \"catholicosate.\" There is a degree of inconsistency in this regard.

{"id": "3295060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3295060", "title": "Christian ethics", "text": "Christian ethics\n\nChristian ethics is a branch of Christian theology that defines virtuous behavior and wrong behavior from a Christian perspective. Systematic theological study of Christian ethics is called moral theology.\n\nChristian virtues are often divided into four cardinal virtues and three theological virtues. Christian ethics includes questions regarding how the rich should act toward the poor, how women are to be treated, and the morality of war. Christian ethicists, like other ethicists, approach ethics from different frameworks and perspectives. The approach of virtue ethics has also become popular in recent decades, largely due to the work of Alasdair MacIntyre and Stanley Hauerwas.\n\nThe curriculum for seminary formation of Catholic priests commonly includes multiple, required courses in Catholic moral theology. Required courses in moral theology or ethics are comparatively less common in Evangelical seminaries.\n\nIn the Wesleyan tradition, Christian theology (and thus Christian ethics) are informed by four distinguishable sources known as the Wesleyan Quadrilateral. The four sources are scripture, tradition, reason, and Christian experience.\n\nAccording to D. Stephen Long, Jewish ethics and the life of Jesus figure prominently in Christian ethics, but \"The Bible is the universal and fundamental source of specifically \"Christian\" ethics\", Long also claims \"Christian ethics finds its source in diverse means, but it primarily emerges from the biblical narrative and especially the call of Abraham and Sarah and subsequent creation of the Jewish people\".\n\nChildress and Macquarrie state that \"Many Christian ethicists have claimed that Jesus Christ is the center of the biblical message in its entirety and the key to scripture\". Other Christian ethicists \"prefer a more Trinitarian rendering of the message of scripture\". Some modern Christians \"understand 'liberation' or deliverance from oppression to be the message of scripture\".\n\nChristians today \"do not feel compelled to observe all 613 commandments\" in the Torah, but the Ten Commandments often figure prominently in Christian ethics.\n\n\"The Prophets ground their appeals for right conduct in God's demand for righteousness.\" On the other hand, \"It is not... true to say that for the OT writers righteousness is \"defined\" by what God does; i.e., an act is not made righteous by the fact that God does it. Also noted as ethical guidelines adhered to by Old Testament figures is \"maintenance of the \"family\"\", \"safeguarding of the family \"property\"\", and \"maintenance of the community\".\n\nMuch of Christian ethics derives from Biblical scripture and Christians have always considered the Bible profitable to teach, reprove, correct, and train in righteousness.\n\nThe New Testament generally asserts that all morality flows from the Great Commandment, to love God with all one's heart, mind, strength, and soul, and to love one's neighbour as oneself. In this, Jesus was reaffirming a teachings of and . Christ united these commands together and proposed himself as a model of the love required in , known also as The New Commandment.\n\nPaul is also the source of the phrase \"Law of Christ\", though its meaning and the relationship of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism are still disputed. The Pauline writings are also the major source of the New Testament household code.\n\nThe Council of Jerusalem, as reported in Acts 15, may have been held in Jerusalem in about 50 . Its decree, known as the \"Apostolic Decree\", was held as generally binding for several centuries and is still observed today by the Greek Orthodox.\n\nChristian ethics developed during Early Christianity as Christianity arose in the Holy Land and other early centers of Christianity while Christianity emerged from Second Temple Judaism. Consequently, early Christian ethics included discussions of how believers should relate to Roman authority and to the empire.\n\nThe Church Fathers had little occasion to treat moral questions from a purely philosophical standpoint and independently of divine revelation, but in the explanation of Christian doctrine their discussions naturally led to philosophical investigations.\n\nWriters, such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine of Hippo all wrote on ethics from a distinctly Christian point of view. They made use of philosophical and ethical principles laid down by their Greek philosopher forebears and the intersection of Greek and Jewish thought known as Hellenistic Judaism.\n\nUnder the Emperor Constantine I (312–337), Christianity became a legal religion. With Christianity now in power, ethical concerns broadened and included discussions of the proper role of the state.\n\nAugustine in particular made use of the ethical principles of Greek philosophy and Hellenistic Judaism. He proceeded to develop thoroughly along philosophical lines and to establish firmly most of the truths of Christian morality. The eternal law (\"lex aeterna\"), the original type and source of all temporal laws, the natural law, conscience, the ultimate end of man, the cardinal virtues, sin, marriage, etc. were treated by him in the clearest and most penetrating manner. Augustine identified a movement in Scripture \"toward the 'City of God', from which Christian ethics emerges\", as illustrated in chapters 11 and 12 of the book of Genesis. Broadly speaking, Augustine adapted the philosophy of Plato to Christian principles. His synthesis is called Augustinianism (alternatively, Augustinism). He presents hardly a single portion of ethics to us but what he does present is enriched with his keen philosophical commentaries. Later writers followed in his footsteps.\n\nA sharper line of separation between philosophy and theology, and in particular between ethics and moral theology, is first met within the works of the great Schoolmen of the Middle Ages, especially of Albertus Magnus (1193–1280), Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), Bonaventure (1221–1274), and Duns Scotus (1274–1308). Philosophy and, by means of it, theology reaped abundant fruit from the works of Aristotle, which had until then been a sealed treasure to Western civilization, and had first been elucidated by the detailed and profound commentaries of Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas and pressed into the service of Christian philosophy.\n\nIn his \"Summa Theologiae\", Thomas locates ethics within the context of theology. For example, he discusses the ethics of buying and selling and concludes that although it may be legal (according to human law) to sell an object for more that it is worth, Divine law \"leaves nothing unpunished that is contrary to virtue.\" The question of \"beatitudo\", perfect happiness in the possession of God, is posited as the goal of human life. Thomas also argues that the human being by reflection on human nature's inclinations discovers a law, that is the natural law, which is \"man's participation in the divine law.\"\n\nThe meaning of the word love can be imprecise, so Thomas Aquinas defined \"love\" for the benefit of the Christian believer as \"to will the good of another.\"\n\nAfter a couple centuries of stagnation, in the sixteenth century ethical questions are again made the subject of careful investigation. Writers include the Francisco de Vitoria, Dominicus Soto, Luis de Molina, Francisco Suarez, Leonardus Lessius, Juan de Lugo, Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz, and Alphonsus Liguori. Since the sixteenth century, special chairs of ethics (moral philosophy) have been funded in many Catholic universities.\n\nAmong topics they discussed was the ethics of action in case of doubt, leading to the doctrine of probabilism.\n\nWith the rejection of the doctrine of papal infallibility and the Roman Magisterium as the absolute religious authority, each individual, at least in principle, became the arbiter in matters pertaining to faith and morals. The Reformers held fast to \"Sola Scriptura\" and many endeavored to construct an ethical system directly from the scriptures.\n\nLutheran Philipp Melanchthon, in his \"Elementa philosophiae moralis\", still clung to the Aristotelian philosophy strongly rejected by Martin Luther, as did Hugo Grotius in \"De jure belli et pacis\". But Richard Cumberland and his follower Samuel Pufendorf assumed, with Descartes, that the ultimate ground for every distinction between good and evil lay in the free determination of God's will, an antinomian view which renders the philosophical treatment of ethics fundamentally impossible.\n\nIn the 20th century some Christian philosophers, notably Dietrich Bonhoeffer, questioned the value of ethical reasoning in moral philosophy. In this school of thought, ethics, with its focus on distinguishing right from wrong, tends to produce behavior that is simply not wrong, whereas the Christian life should instead be marked by the highest form of right. Rather than ethical reasoning, they stress the importance of meditation on, and relationship with, God. Other important Protestant Christian ethicists include H. Richard Niebuhr, John Howard Yoder, Glen Stassen, and Stanley Hauerwas.\n\nCharles Sheldon's 1896 book, \"In His Steps\" was subtitled \"What Would Jesus Do?\" and posed the question in the form of a novel. In a popular movement of the 1990s, many used the phrase \"What would Jesus do?\" (abbreviated WWJD) as a personal motto. The question was a reminder of their belief in a moral imperative to act in a manner that would demonstrate the Love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents.\n\nThe seven Christian virtues are from two sets of virtues. The four cardinal virtues are Prudence, Justice, Restraint (or Temperance), and Courage (or Fortitude). The cardinal virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. The three theological virtues, are Faith, Hope, and Love (or Charity).\n\n\nChristian views on abortion has a complex history as there is no explicit prohibition of abortion in either the Old Testament or New Testament books of the Christian Bible. While some writers say that early Christians held different beliefs at different times about abortion, others say that, in spite of the silence of the New Testament on the issue, they condemned abortion at any point of pregnancy as a grave sin, a condemnation that they maintained even when some of them did not qualify as homicide the elimination of a fetus not yet \"formed\" and animated by a human soul. The Didache, a Christian writing usually dated to sometime in the mid to late 1st century, prohibits abortion in Ch 2.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church and teaches that abortion that \"human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.\" Accordingly, it opposes procedures whose purpose is to destroy an embryo or fetus for whatever motive (even before implantation), but admits acts, such as chemotherapy or hysterectomy of a pregnant woman who has cervical cancer, which indirectly results in the death of the fetus, is morally acceptable. Since the first century, the Church has affirmed that every procured abortion is a moral evil, a teaching that the Catechism of the Catholic Church declares \"has not changed and remains unchangeable\".\n\nSince the twentieth century Protestant views on abortion have varied considerably, with Protestants to be found in both the \"anti-abortion\" and \"abortion-rights\" camps. Conservative Protestants tend to be anti-abortion whereas \"mainline\" Protestants lean towards an abortion-rights stance. African-American Protestants are much more strongly anti-abortion than white Protestants. Even among Protestants who believe that abortion should be a legal option, there are those who believe that it should nonetheless be morally unacceptable in most instances.\n\nAlthough scripture is mostly silent on abortion, various elements of scripture inform Christian ethical views on this topic, including Genesis 4:1; Job 31:15; Isaiah 44:24, 49:1, 5; and Jeremiah 1:5, among others.\n\nCurrent views on alcohol in Christianity can be divided into moderationism, abstentionism, and prohibitionism. Abstentionists and prohibitionists are sometimes lumped together as \"teetotalers\", sharing some similar arguments. However, prohibitionists abstain from alcohol as a matter of law (that is, they believe God requires abstinence in all ordinary circumstances), while abstentionists abstain as a matter of prudence (that is, they believe total abstinence is the wisest and most loving way to live in the present circumstances).\n\nSome Christians, including Pentecostals , Baptists and Methodists, today believe one ought to abstain from alcohol. Fifty-two percent of Evangelical leaders around the world say drinking alcohol is incompatible with being a good Evangelical. Evangelicals in Asia, Africa, and also in Muslim-majority countries are decidedly against drinking.\n\nChristian views on divorce are informed by verses in Matthew, Mark, Deuteronomy, and others and political developments much later. In the synoptic Gospels, Jesus emphasized the permanence of marriage, but also its integrity. In the book of Matthew Jesus says \"Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. When Jesus discusses marriage, he points out that a certain talent is needed to live together with another human being. Not having assets of their own, women needed to be protected from the risk of their husbands' putting them on the street at whim. In those times marriage was an economic matter. A woman and her children could easily be rejected. Restriction of divorce was based on the necessity of protecting the woman and her position in society, not necessarily in a religious context, but an economic context. Paul concurred but added an exception for abandonment by an unbelieving spouse.\n\nThe Catholic Church prohibits divorce, but permits annulment (a finding that the marriage was never valid) under a narrow set of circumstances. The Eastern Orthodox Church permits divorce and remarriage in church in certain circumstances. Most Protestant churches discourage divorce except as a last resort, but do not actually prohibit it through church doctrine.\n\nModern Christian sexual morality rejects adultery, extramarital sex, prostitution, and rape. Christian views on the moral benefits of celibate and marital lifestyles has varied over time.\n\nIn his early writings, Paul described marriage as a social obligation that has the potential of distracting from Christ. Sex, in turn, is not sinful but natural, and sex within marriage is both proper and necessary. In his later writings, Paul made parallels between the relations between spouses and God's relationship with the church. Paul encouraged both celibate and marital lifestyles.\n\nWhile Jesus made reference to some that have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven, there is no commandment in the New Testament that Jesus' disciples have to live in celibacy. The general view on sexuality among the early Jewish Christians was quite positive.\n\nDuring the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons.\n\nToday, the Roman Catholic Church teachings on celibacy uphold it for monastics and priests.\n\nProtestantism has rejected the celibate (unmarried) life for preachers since the Reformation. Many evangelicals prefer the term \"abstinence\" to \"celibacy.\" Assuming everyone will marry, they focus their discussion on refraining from premarital sex and focusing on the joys of a future marriage. But some evangelicals, particularly older singles, desire a positive message of celibacy that moves beyond the \"wait until marriage\" message of abstinence campaigns. They seek a new understanding of celibacy that is focused on God rather than a future marriage or a lifelong vow to the Church.\n\nWithin Christianity there are a variety of views on the issues of sexual orientation and homosexuality. The many Christian denominations vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as sinful, through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality. In the Bible, procreative marriage is presented as \"the norm\" and homosexuality is discussed in the New Testament, but in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries whether or not the Bible condemns homosexuality, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics.\n\nIn modern times, Christian organizations reject any permissibility of slavery, but Christian views on slavery did vary both historically. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century debates in the UK and the US, passages in the Bible were used by both pro-slavery advocates and abolitionists to support their respective views.\n\nChristian pacifism is the position that any form of violence is incompatible with the Christian faith. Christian pacifists state that Jesus himself was a pacifist who taught and practiced pacifism, and that his followers must do likewise. Notable Christian pacifists include Martin Luther King, Jr., Leo Tolstoy, and Ammon Hennacy.\n\nJesus opposed use of violence in his statement that \"all who will take up the sword, will die by the sword\", which suggested that those who perpetrate violence will themselves face violence. Historian Roland Bainton described the early church as pacifist – a period that ended with the accession of Constantine.\n\nIn the first few centuries of Christianity, many Christians refused to engage in military combat. In fact, there were a number of famous examples of soldiers who became Christians and refused to engage in combat afterward. They were subsequently executed for their refusal to fight. The commitment to pacifism and rejection of military service is attributed by Allman and Allman to two principles: \"(1) the use of force (violence) was seen as antithetical to Jesus' teachings and service in the Roman military required worship of the emperor as a god which was a form of idolatry.\"\n\nThe first conscientious objector in the modern sense was a Quaker in 1815. The Quakers had originally served in Cromwell's New Model Army but from the 1800s increasingly became pacifists. A number of Christian denominations have taken pacifist positions institutionally, including the Quakers and Mennonites.\n\nPacifist and violence-resisting traditions have continued into contemporary times.\n\nIn the 20th century, Martin Luther King, Jr. adapted the nonviolent ideas of Gandhi to a Baptist theology and politics.\n\nThere are a variety of Christian views on poverty and wealth. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted. At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the \"good life\". Professor David W. Miller has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth. According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.\n\nAmerican theologian John B. Cobb has argued that the \"economism that rules the West and through it much of the East\" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that \"man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)\". He asserts that it is obvious that \"Western society is organized in the service of wealth\" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.\n\nSimon Blackburn states that the \"Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women\". Elizabeth S. Anderson, a Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, states that \"the Bible contains both good and evil teachings\", and it is \"morally inconsistent\". She concludes that, \"Here are religious doctrines that on their face claim that it is all right to mercilessly punish people for the wrongs of others and for blameless error, that license or even command murder, rape, torture, slavery, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. We know such actions are wrong.\"\n\nBlackburn notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's New Testament as well. He notes some \"moral quirks\" of Jesus: that he could be \"sectarian\" (Matt 10:5–6), racist (Matt 15:26 and Mark 7:27), placed no value on animal life (Luke 8: 27–33), and believed that \"mental illness is caused by possession by devils\". He also did not repudiate any of the more brutal portions of the Old Testament. Anderson notes the Christian apologist argument that the Jesus of the New Testament is \"all loving\". She states, however, that the New Testament has some morally repugnant lessons as well: \"Jesus tells us his mission is to make family members hate one another, so that they shall love him more than their kin (Matt 10:35–37)\", \"Disciples must hate their parents, siblings, wives, and children (Luke 14:26)\", children who \"curse their parents ... must be killed\", and Peter and Paul elevate men over their wives \"who must obey their husbands \" (1 Corinthians 11:3, 14:34–5, Eph. 5:22–24, Col. 3:18, 1 Tim. 2: 11–2, 1 Pet. 3:1) in the New Testament household code.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1338403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1338403", "title": "Coadjutor bishop", "text": "Coadjutor bishop\n\nA coadjutor bishop (or bishop coadjutor) is a bishop in the Catholic, Anglican, and (historically) Eastern Orthodox churches whose main role is to assist the diocesan bishop in the administration of the diocese. The coadjutor (literally, \"co-assister\" in Latin) is a bishop himself, although he is also appointed as vicar general. The coadjutor bishop is, however, given authority beyond that ordinarily given to the vicar general, making him co-head of the diocese in all but ceremonial precedence. In modern times, the coadjutor automatically succeeds the diocesan bishop upon the latter's retirement, removal, or death.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, a coadjutor bishop is an immediate collaborator of the diocesan bishop, similar to an auxiliary bishop. However, unlike auxiliary bishops, coadjutors are given the right of succession to the episcopal see. When the diocesan bishop dies, retires, resigns, or is reassigned, the coadjutor automatically becomes the next bishop of the local Church (diocese). Until then, the diocesan bishop appoints the coadjutor to act as vicar general. He needs to be a bishop, and, in a now-discontinued practice, held a titular see until his succession.\n\nIn modern church practice, the appointment of a coadjutor is usually done in cases where a diocesan bishop feels that he will not be able to continue in his position for health reasons or impending retirement. In such cases, the Pope may assign a coadjutor in order to give him time to become familiar with the diocese that he will eventually take over. For example, Bishop Dennis Marion Schnurr of the Diocese of Duluth, Minnesota, was named Coadjutor Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2008 to succeed aging Archbishop Daniel Edward Pilarczyk.\n\nAt times, the appointment of a coadjutor is used to discreetly remove a diocesan bishop who has become involved in scandal or other problems. An example of this occurred in the Archdiocese of Dubuque in the 1940s, when Archbishop Francis Beckman involved the archdiocese in what turned out to be a dubious mining scheme. When the scheme fell apart and resulted in serious financial problems for Beckman and the archdiocese, Bishop Henry Rohlman, of Davenport, Iowa, was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Dubuque. While Beckman was allowed to retain the office of Archbishop, it was made clear to him by the Holy See that the actual power rested with Rohlman.\n\nPrior to the reform of the Code of Canon Law in 1983, a distinction was made between coadjutor bishops \"cum jure succesionis\" (\"with the right of succession\") and those without. Some coadjutors were appointed with the right of succession, and others were without such a right, usually in archbishops with particularly large dioceses who also held other important posts and to honor certain auxiliary bishops).\n\nFor an example of a coadjutor without right of succession, see John J. Maguire, coadjutor archbishop of New York (1965-1980). Now, every coadjutor who is appointed has the concomitant right of succession.\n\nAn Apostolic Vicar may also have a coadjutor, who, like him, will be a titular bishop.\n\nIn some provinces of the Anglican Communion, a bishop coadjutor (the form usually used) is a bishop elected or appointed to follow the current diocesan bishop upon the incumbent's death or retirement. For example, in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, when a diocesan bishop announces a retirement, a special diocesan convention is held to elect a coadjutor. Usually, the coadjutor serves with the incumbent for a short time before the latter's retirement, when the coadjutor becomes the diocesan bishop. Bishops coadjutor are also appointed in the Reformed Episcopal Church.\n\nThe role of 'assistant-bishop' (with no expectation to succeed the diocesan see) in the Church of England is fulfilled by a suffragan.\n\nThere have been bishops coadjutor in the Anglican Church of Australia without the right of succession to the diocesan see.\n"}

The \"cojines\" are two round stones used in the religion of the Muisca to worship Sun god Sué and his wife; Moon goddess Chía. When the Spanish conquistadores arrived, they called them \"Cojines del Diablo\".\n\nDuring the time before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, the central highlands of the Colombian Andes (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) were populated by the Muisca. This advanced civilization had its own religion and rituals, centered around the most important deities Sué and Chía. The northern territories were ruled by the \"iraca\" of Sugamuxi, the \"tundama\" of Tundama and the \"zaque\" based in Hunza.\n\nThe Cojines are two circular stones made of sandstone located at the base of the San Lázaro hill in Tunja. The northernmost \"Cojín\" measures in diameter and the southern pillow . The stones are oriented with respect to the solar elliptic and consist of an inclined part in the west and a flat part in the east. The rocks were used by the \"zaque\" to kneel down and pray to Sué at sunrise.\n\nThe Cojines were studied as of 1847 and in 1928 the city of Tunja made the stones into an archeological site.\n\nEvery morning the \"zaque\" would go in a procession from his grand \"bohío\" in Hunza to the Cojines. Apart from the daily rituals, also with sowing and harvests, rituals were performed on the \"Cojines del Zaque\".\n\nThe Muisca calendar defined the months of sowing and harvests and those periods would fall on the Gregorian calendar in the months of March and September respectively. To increase the fertility of the lands the Muisca had their agriculture, they performed festivities to the gods around the Cojines del Zaque. During these festivals, the Muisca danced in groups, holding hands and sang to the music of flutes, ocarinas and other instruments. They danced on the rhythm of drums. During these rituals the Muisca got drunk by drinking their typical \"chicha\".\n\nSometimes twelve year-old boys; \"moxas\", captured from other indigenous peoples in the region would be sacrificed to the gods at the site of the Cojines del Zaque. The heads of the boys would be placed on the cojines and the children decapitated draining the Cojines in blood. The Muisca left their bodies lying there as food for Sué. The bodies would be retrieved after a few days.\n\n"}

It is located on the west bank of the Nile some 55 km south of Luxor. The town was formerly part of the modern Qena Governorate, but as of 9/12/2009, it was incorporated into the new Luxor Governorate.\n\nThis city of Latopolis (πόλις Λάτων) in the Thebaid of Upper Egypt should not be confused with the more northerly city of Letopolis (Λητοῦς Πόλις), ancient Khem, modern Ausim, in the Nile Delta in Lower Egypt.\n\nThe name \"Latopolis\" is in honor of the Nile perch, \"Lates niloticus\", the largest of the 52 species which inhabit the Nile, which was abundant in these stretches of the river in ancient times, and which appears in sculptures, among the symbols of the goddess Neith, associated by the ancient Greeks as Pallas-Athene, surrounded by the oval shield or ring indicative of royalty or divinity. Held sacred, the \"Lates niloticus\" was buried in a cemetery west of the town.\n\nThe temple of Esna, dedicated to the god Khnum, his consorts Menhit and Nebtu, their son, Heka, and also the goddess Neith, was remarkable for the beauty of its site and the magnificence of its architecture. It was built of red sandstone, and its portico consisted of six rows of four columns each, with lotus-leaf capitals, all of which however differ from each other.\n\nAnother temple of the same period has been identified at Kom Mer, about 12 km to the south, but cannot be excavated because a modern village is built over it.\n\nThere was a smaller temple, dedicated to the triad of Latopolis, about two miles and a half north of the city, at a village now called el-Dayr. Here, too, is a small Zodiac of the age of Ptolemy III Euergetes (246-221 BC). This latter building was destroyed in the 19th century, as it stood in the way of a new canal. The temple of Esna was cleared of the soil and rubbish which filled its area when Denon visited it, and served as a cotton warehouse in the mid-19th century.\n\nWith the exception of the jamb of a gateway – now converted into a door-sill – of the reign of Thutmose II (Eighteenth Dynasty), the remains of Latopolis belong to the Ptolemaic or Roman eras. Ptolemy III Euergetes, the restorer of so many temples in Upper Egypt, was a benefactor to Latopolis, and he is depicted upon the walls of its temple followed by a tame lion, and in the act of striking down the chiefs of his enemies. The name of Ptolemy V Epiphanes is found also inscribed upon a doorway. Although the scale of the ruins are impressive, their sculptures and hieroglyphics attest to the decline of Egyptian art. The west wall features reliefs of Ptolemy VI Philometor and Ptolemy VIII Physcon. The pronaos, which alone exists, resembles in style that of Apollonopolis Magna (Edfu), and was begun not earlier than the reign of Claudius (41-54 AD), and completed in that of Vespasian, whose name and titles are carved on the dedicatory inscription over the entrance. On the ceiling of the pronaos is the larger Latopolitan Zodiac. The name of the emperor Geta, the last ruler that can be read in hieroglyphics, although partially erased by his brother and murderer Caracalla (212), is still legible on the walls of Latopolis. Before raising their own edifice, the Romans seem to have destroyed even the basements of the earlier Egyptian temple. The ceremonial way, which probably linked the quay to the temple, has disappeared. The quay bears cartouches of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe cemetery west of the town, where the \"Lates niloticus\" was buried, also contains human burials dating of the Middle Kingdom to the Late Period.\n\nThe Temple of Esna conveys a sense of the importance which the Ancient Egyptians placed upon their places of worship. All Egyptians who entered the confines of an Egyptian temple were required \"to comply with the strict rules regarding ritual purity.\" According to inscriptions carved on the walls of the Temple of Esna, those who entered this temple were expected to fastidiously cut their fingernails and toenails, remove other body hair, wash their hands with natron (a natural occurring salt), \"be dressed in linen (they were forbidden from wearing wool), and not to have had sexual intercourse for several days.\"\n\nTwo barrage bridges straddle the Nile at this point: one built by the British in 1906, and the \"Electricity Bridge\" built in the 1990s. Navigation, particularly, Nile cruisers ferrying tourists from Luxor to Aswan 155 km further upstream, can be held up for hours while vessels negotiate their way through the lock system.\n\nThe two main points of interest in Esna are its lively tourist-oriented market, which fills a couple of streets leading inland from the corniche. The other is the temple of Esna. The temple, which has only been partially excavated, is about 200 meters from the river and some 9 meters below street level.\n\nAttackers on a patrol killed a policeman and a civilian, and wounded three other victims.\n\nUnder the older name of \"Latopolis,\" the city is now a Roman Catholic Latin titular see.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert climate (BWh).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31836287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31836287", "title": "Johannes Jørgensen", "text": "Johannes Jørgensen\n\nJens Johannes Jørgensen (6 November 1866 in Svendborg – 29 May 1956) was a Danish writer, best known for his biographies of Catholic saints. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.\n\nJohannes Jørgensen was born in 1866 in Svendborg, Denmark.\nIn 1884, he travelled to Copenhagen to start his studies,\nbut he quit his studies in 1888.\nIn Copenhagen he began to develop radical social views, which soon led him into a circle of cultural and radical artists.\n\nHe was fascinated by the Russian nihilists and by Georg Brandes who boasted of dispelling \"the darkness of Christianity.\" He led a life of pleasure and married, but his happiness did not last. New voices announcing spiritual values were then being heard in Denmark. Jørgensen read Joris-Karl Huysmans, Maurice Maeterlinck and others. He broke with Georg Brandes and his school, which would later cause his ruin.\n\nFrom his earliest years, he had shown a strong love of poetry through which he could express his dreams and observations. For rest of his life, poetry remained as one of his prominent modes of expression.\n\nBut with his innate melancholy temperament, he found no permanent place in cultural radicalism and materialism, where Eros and connoisseur, summarized in pantheism's worship of nature was prevalent. Therefore, he began a quest for more spiritually motivated sources of inspiration together with like-minded people. \nAs an editor of the magazine \"The Tower\" (\"Taarnet\" in Danish) in the years 1893-94, he had an outlet for his expressing his ideas about symbolism, and his opposition to naturalism.\n\nSymbolists quickly came across the prevailing literary circles, in particular, the brothers Georg and Edvard Brandes, who did not spare the young rebels.\n\nJohannes Jørgensen then met a young Jewish silversmith, Mogens Ballin, who had converted to Catholicism. He had not reached the spiritual depth he had sought. From his childhood home he had inherited an entrenched base of Christianity, and even at his most radical period this base never quite left him. It now returned in the form of mysticism. It took a long time with many internal battles before he found the port of spiritual comfort, though many internal and external factors constantly tore at him.\n\nIn 1894 Jørgensen (together with Mogens Ballin) first visited the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi. It was the beginning of what would come to fill most of his future life as both man and writer – namely the love of the Holy St. Francis, Assisi's famous son who was born here and worked here until he died in 1226. The close friendship with Mogens Ballin and visiting the Basilica of St. Francis led to his conversion to Catholicism in 1896, a crucial turning point in his writing.\n\nIn 1907 Jørgensen finished his biography of St. Francis, a book which would make him famous and an honorary citizen both in Assisi and later also in his native town of Svendborg. He had previously worked with the saint from Assisi. In 1902 he had translated \"Fioretti\" into Danish, and the following year he had published a book with the Pilgrim's depiction of the Franciscan sites.\n\nThe Franciscan'a spirituality came to dominate his thoughts. In 1915 settled in Assisi, only interrupted by the war years 1943–1945 when he traveled to Vadstena, Sweden to live and begin his great work on St. Birgitta. It was his third major biography of saints, following the book of St. Catherine of Siena (1915). His embracing of the Franciscan spirit led to a series of books based on the Umbrian world where spirit and nature always led to a higher unity.\n\nJohannes Jørgensen's life had had an almost sentimental affinity to nature, seasons, flowers and life's affirmative diversity. This had developed into a pantheistic natural worship in his youth. But in the depiction of St. Francis's relationship with nature as God's true image, the two passion within him merged – nature and God. The deity who in his youth was the human relationship to nature now turned into an expression of God's truth.\n\nAfter the war ended he returned to Assisi, but age was starting to weigh him down. In 1952 he moved back to Svendborg, where the city offered him free honorary residence in his childhood home of Lady Alley.\n\nIn 1913 he left his wife, Amalie F. Ewald and their seven children after an increasingly problematic marriage. As a Catholic he could not remarry, but when Amalie died in 1935, he married (in 1937) the Austrian-born Helen Klein.\n\nHe became an honorary citizen of Assisi 1922 and in Svendborg 1936 and dr. phil. hc ved Universitetet i Louvain 1927. Moreover, he was made Knight of the Dannebrog in 1920 and Commander of the 2nd grade 1926 . degree 1926.\n\nJohannes Jørgensen died on 29 May 1956, almost 90 years old. He was buried at the city cemetery.\n\n\nJohannes Jørgensen's writing is difficult to categorize.\n\nHis Catholicism made him interesting far outside the Catholic Church. In his travel books he can be compared to Fyn Hans Christian Andersen. His sublime sense of language has made him loved by many. While in Denmark he was a stranger, so his writing enjoyed much more attention at home than abroad, while Hans Christian Andersen is often translated from Danish.\n\nJohannes Jørgensen's poetry is perhaps the most interesting part of his writing, and many read his poems in his homeland. Many look even today at his poetry for his beautiful styling and incomparable natural sense.\n\nFollowing the murder of Kaj Munk on 4 January 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper De frie Danske brought condemning reactions from influential Scandinavians, including Jørgensen.\n\nAmong his works are:\nIn the 18th edition of the \"Danish Folk High School Songbook\" there are three poems by John Jørgensen: Francis of Assisi Solsang \"Almighty and dear God\", \"Now lit foliage in forests\" and \"Lay down your head, you blossom\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "81453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81453", "title": "Kahuna", "text": "Kahuna\n\nKahuna is a Hawaiian word, defined as a respectful man who has moral authority in society \"a prime person, a minister, or an expert in any profession\". Merriam-Webster defines kahuna as \"a preeminent person or thing\" and \"Hawaiian shaman\".\n\nWith the revival of the Hawaiian culture beginning in the 1970s, some native Hawaiian cultural practitioners call themselves kahuna today. Others disdain the term. In the New Age spiritual system known as Huna, which uses Hawaiian words and is adapted from Hawaiian tradition, \"kahuna\" similarly denotes someone of priestly or shamanic standing.\n\nA kahuna may be versed in agriculture, canoe building or any other talent. Blessing new buildings and construction projects, officiating weddings are some of the tasks a kahuna may be called upon to perform, by his or her community. \n\nForty types of kahuna are listed in the book \"Tales from the Night Rainbow\", twenty in the healing professions alone, including \"Kahuna lapaʻau, medical priest or practitioner\", and \"Kahuna hāhā, an expert who diagnoses, as sickness or pain, by feeling the body\". \n\nThere are two categories of kahuna; craft kahuna, such as kālai waa, an expert canoe maker, and hookele, an expert navigator; and sorcery kahuna such as \"kahuna ʻanāanā\" and \"kahuna lapaau\" (healer).\n\nAccording to sources, there are ten types (or ranks) of sorcery kahuna:\n\nExpert kahuna are called \"Kahuna Nui\" (High Priest) and Kahuna Nui lived in places such as Waimea Valley, which is known as the \"Valley of the Priests\". They were given slices of land that spanned from the mountain to the sea. Hewahewa, a direct descendant of Paʻao, was the \"Kahuna Nui\" to Kamehameha I. A contemporary, Leimomi Mo'okini Lum is a Kahuna Nui. David Kaonohiokala Bray was a well-known kahuna.\n\nKing Kamehameha IV, in his translation of the Book of Common Prayer, used the term \"Kahuna\" to refer to Anglican priests and \"Kahunapule\" to refer to both lay and ordained Anglican ministers.\n\nCraft kahuna were never prohibited; however, during the decline of native Hawaiian culture many died out and did not pass on their wisdom to new students. As an example, when the \"Hōkūle‘a\" was built to be sailed to the South Pacific to prove the voyaging capabilities of the ancient Hawaiians, master navigator Mau Piailug from Satawal was brought to Hawaii to teach the Hawaiians navigation.\n\nIt is often said that the missionaries came to Hawaii in 1820 and made kahuna practices illegal. In the 100 years after the missionaries arrived all kahuna practices were legal until 1831, some were illegal until 1863, all were legal until 1887, then some were illegal until 1919. Since 1919, all have been legal, except sorcery, which was illegal at first, but was decriminalized in 1972.\n\nThe first Christian missionaries arrived in 1820. The most powerful person in the nation, Kaʻahumanu, did not convert until 1825. But it was not until 11 years after missionaries arrived that she proclaimed laws against hula, chant, ‘awa (kava), and Hawaiian religion.\n\nKing Kamehameha V came to power in 1863. He disdained the law and encouraged the revival of native practices. (Chai) Many kahuna who had been quietly practicing came forward. On Maui, a group of eight Hawaiians founded the \" 'Ahahui La'au Lapa'au\" in 1866. They were not only kahuna; several were also members of the Hawaiian Legislature. They interviewed twenty-one kahuna to compile a complete resource of prayers and remedies for the Legislative record. (These interviews have been republished in the book \"Must We Wait in Despair?\" by Malcolm Naea Chun.)\n\nBoth Kamehameha V and his successor, King Kalakaua, invited kahuna to come to Honolulu to share their wisdom. They compiled oral and written histories and documented the prayers, chants, hulas, and remedies for healings. Kalakaua convened groups of kahuna to consult with each other to preserve their heritage. This and many other moves by Kalakaua outraged the Christian residents. In 1887 they forced the Bayonet Constitution upon the King, stripping him of most of his personal authority.\n\nWhile all this legal maneuvering has been going on, many traditional practitioners have continued to practice as they and their ancestors have always done. \n\nThe use of the term in reference to surfing can be traced back to the 1959 film \"Gidget\", in which \"The Big Kahuna\", played by Cliff Robertson, (Martin Milner in the TV episode), was the leader of a group of surfers. The term then became commonplace in Beach Party films of the 1960s such as \"Beach Blanket Bingo\", where the \"Big Kahuna\" was the best surfer on the beach. Eventually, it was adopted into general surfing culture. Hawaiian surfing master Duke Kahanamoku may have been referred to as the \"Big Kahuna\" but rejected the term as he knew the original meaning.\n\nIn the 1999 movie \"The Big Kahuna\" salesmen are trying to get a lucrative contract with a manufacturer they refer to as the \"great kahuna\". In a fantasy scene, Kevin Spacey's character wears a headdress and is revered as \"the big kahuna\".\n\nThe term was also used by Wally Amos in his cookie business, The Cookie Kahuna.\n\nIn popular culture, the island leaders in Pokémon Sun and Moon are called Kahunas.\n\n\n\n"}

The religious belief system was held by several tribes in Central California and Northern California, from the Sacramento Valley west to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe practice of Kuksu religion included elaborate narrative ceremonial dances and specific regalia. The men of the tribe practiced rituals to ensure good health, bountiful harvests, hunts, fertility, and good weather. Ceremonies included an annual mourning ceremony, rites of passage, and intervention with the spirit world. A male secret society met in underground dance rooms and danced in disguises at the public dances.\n\nKuksu has been identified archaeologically by the discovery of underground dance rooms and wooden dance drums.\n\nThe Patwin culture of Northern California had comparatively strong and noticeable Kuksu systems and rituals.\n\nThe Maidu culture of Northern California had comparatively strong and noticeable Kuksu systems and rituals.\n\nKuksu was personified as a spirit being by the Pomo people. Their mythology and dance ceremonies were witnessed, including the spirit of Kuksu or Guksu, between 1892 and 1904. The Pomo used the name \"Kuksu\" or \"Guksu\", depending on the dialect, as the name for a red-beaked supernatural being, that lived in a sweathouse at the southern end of the world. Healing was his province and specialty. The person who played the Kuksu/Guksu in Pomo dance ceremonies was often considered the medicine man, and dressed as him when attending the sick. A ceremony dance was named after him. He also appeared in costume at most ceremonies briefly in order to take away the villager's illnesses.\n\nAll males were expected to join a ceremonial society; some of their dances were private or secret from women and children. Scholars differ in their opinions of the societies' power in the tribe: \"There was no secret society of importance as there was among the Maidu and presumedly among the neighboring Wintun, and no organized priesthood vested with control over ceremonies.\" In contrast, in 1925 a witness of the Clear Lake Pomo said: \"The heart of religious activities lay in a secret society called \"kuhma\", akin to that of the Patwin and Maidu and composed chiefly of men, which managed the ritual of the ancient \"hindil\" or kuksu religion.\n\nThe ethnohistorian Alfred L. Kroeber observed that Kuksu existed, but had less \"specialized cosmogony,\" in the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\" of the Ohlone/Costanoan, Salinan, Miwok and Esselen and northernmost Yokuts, in comparison to the groups in the Northern California and northern Sacramento Valley.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16864608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16864608", "title": "Miriam Schapiro", "text": "Miriam Schapiro\n\nMiriam Schapiro (also known as Mimi) (November 15, 1923 – June 20, 2015) was a Canadian-born artist based in the United States. She was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and a pioneer of feminist art. She was also considered a leader of the Pattern and Decoration art movement. Schapiro's artwork blurs the line between fine art and craft. She incorporated craft elements into her paintings due to their association with women and femininity. Schapiro’s work touches on the issue of feminism and art: especially in the aspect of feminism in relation to abstract art. Schapiro honed in her domesticated craft work and was able to create work that stood amongst the rest of the high art. These works represent Schapiro’s identity as an artist working in the center of contemporary abstraction and simultaneously as a feminist being challenged to represent women’s \"consciousness\" through imagery. She often used icons that are associated with women, such as hearts, floral decorations, geometric patterns, and the color pink. In the 1970s she made the hand fan, a typically small woman's object, heroic by painting it six feet by twelve feet. \"The fan-shaped canvas, a powerful icon, gave Schapiro the opportunity to experiment... Out of this emerged a surface of textured coloristic complexity and opulence that formed the basis of her new personal style. The kimonos, fans, houses, and hearts were the form into which she repeatedly poured her feelings and desires, her anxieties, and hopes\". Miriam Schapiro's estate is exclusively represented by the Eric Firestone Gallery in New York.\n\nSchapiro was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She was the only child of two Russian Jewish parents. Her Russian immigrant grandfather invented the first movable doll’s eye in the United States and manufactured \"Teddy Bears.\" Her father, Theodore Schapiro, was an artist and an intellectual who was studying at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, in New York, when Schapiro was born. He was an industrial design artist who fostered her desire to be an artist and served as her role model and mentor. Her mother, Fannie Cohen,a homemaker and a Zionist, encouraged Schapiro to take up a career in the arts. At age six, Schapiro began drawing.\n\nAs a teenager, Schapiro was taught by Victor d’ Amico, her first modernist teacher at the Museum of Modern Art. In the evenings she joined WPA classes for adults to study drawing from the nude model. In 1943, Schapiro entered Hunter College in New York City, but eventually transferred to the University of Iowa. At the University of Iowa, Schapiro studied painting with Stuart Edie and James Lechay. She studied printmaking under Mauricio Lasansky and was his personal assistant, which then led her to help form the Iowa Print Group. Lasanky taught his students to use several different printing techniques in their work and to study the masters' work in order to find solutions to technical problems.\n\nAt the State University of Iowa she met the artist Paul Brach, whom she married in 1946. After Brach and Schapiro graduated in 1949, Brach received a job in the University of Missouri as a painting instructor. Schapiro did not receive a position, and was very unhappy during their time there. By 1951 they moved to New York City and befriended many of the Abstract expressionist artists of the New York School, including Joan Mitchell, Larry Rivers, Knox Martin and Michael Goldberg. Schapiro and Brach lived in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s. Miriam and Paul had a son, Peter Brach, in 1955. Before and after the birth of her son Peter, Schapiro struggled with her identity and place as an artist. Miriam’s Schapiro’s successive studios, after this period of crisis, became both environments for and reflections of the changes in her life and art.\n\nShe died on June 20, 2015 in Hampton Bays, New York, aged 91.\n\nSchapiro not only honored the craft tradition in women's art, but also paid homage to women artists of the past. In the early 1970s she made paintings and collages which included photo reproductions of past artists such as Mary Cassatt. In the mid 1980s she painted portraits of Frida Kahlo on top of her old self-portrait paintings. In the 1990s Schapiro began to include women of the Russian Avant Garde in her work. The Russian Avant Garde was an important moment in Modern Art history for Schapiro to reflect on because women were seen as equals.\n\nBetween 1953 and 1957, Schapiro created a substantial body of work in which she focused on the dominant style of the period: Abstract Expressionism. Miriam created her own gestural language: \"painting thinly and wiping out\", in which the wiped area played a significant role as the painted area. Although these works were abstracted such as her work Beast Land and Plenty, Schapiro based them off of black and white illustrations of works by the \"old masters\". In December 1957, André Emmerich selected one of her paintings for the opening of his gallery.\n\nEarly in her career, Schapiro started looking for maternal symbols to unify her own roles as a woman. Her series, \"Shrines\" was created in 1961-63 with this in mind. Beginning in 1960 Schapiro began to eliminate abstract expressionist brushwork from her paintings and began to introduce a variety of geometric forms. It is one of her earliest group of work that was also an autobiography. Each section of the work show an aspect of being a woman artist. They are also symbolic of her body and soul. The play between the illusion of depth and the acceptance of the surface became the main formal strategy of Miriam's work for the rest of the decade. The Shrines enabled Schapiro to discover the multiple and fragmented aspects of herself.\n\nIn 1964 Schapiro and her husband Paul both worked at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. One of Schapiro's biggest turning points in her art career was working at the workshop and experimenting with Josef Albers' Color-Aid paper, where she began making several new shrines and created her first collages.\n\nIn 1967, Schapiro and Brach moved to California so that both could teach in the art department at the University of California, San Diego. There Miriam met her close friend David Nalibof, a physicist who worked for General Dynamics. Nalibof formulated computer programs that could plot and alter Miriam Schapiro's drawings. This was how her first feminist work, \"Big Ox #1\" from 1968 was created. The diagonals of which represented the limbs of the \"Vitruvian man,\" while the O depicted the center of the women, the vagina, the womb. This work is described as \"a newly invented, body-based, archetypal emblem for female power and identity, realized in brilliant red-orange, silver, and 'tender shades of pink'\". The O is also thought to symbolize the egg, which exists as the window into the maternal structure with outstretched limbs.\n\nSubsequently, she was able to establish the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia with Judy Chicago. The program set out to address the problems in the arts from an institutional position and focused on the expansion of a female environment in Downtown, L.A. In \"Womanhouse\" women were able to turn their invested creativity in rewarding their families with supportive environments toward themselves by allowing their fantasies to take over all rooms. They wanted the creation of art to be less of a private, introspective adventure and more of a public process through consciousness raising sessions, personal confessions and technical training. \"('House') became the repository of female fantasy and womanly dreams\". Schapiro participated in the \"Womanhouse\" exhibition in 1972. Schapiro's smaller piece within \"Womanhouse\", called \"Dollhouse\", was constructed using various scrap pieces to create all the furniture and accessories in the house. Each room signified a particular role a woman plays in society and depicted the conflicts between them.\n\nSchapiro's work from the 1970s onwards consists primarily of collages assembled from fabrics, which she called \"femmages\". In the early seventies, succeeding Schapiro’s collaboration in \"Womanhouse\", she made her first fabric collages in her studio in Los Angeles, which looked much like a room in a house. From the male technological world of computers Schapiro moved into a woman’s decorated house. In this home-like studio, Schapiro monumentalized her fabric cabinet and its significance for women, in a number of large femmages, including \"A Cabinet for All Seasons\". This was her poetic version of the representation of continuous changes and repetitions in all women’s bodies and lives. In her definition of femmage, Schapiro wrote that the style, which simultaneously recalls quilting and Cubism, has a \"woman-life context\" and that it \"celebrates a private or public event.\" As Schapiro traveled the United States giving lectures, she would ask the women she met for a souvenir. These souvenirs would be used in her collage like paintings. Schapiro also did collaborative art projects, like her series of etchings \"Anonymous was a Woman\" from 1977. She was able to produce the series with a group of nine women studio-art graduates from the University of Oregon. Each print is an impression made from an untransformed doily that was placed in soft ground on a zinc plate, then etched and printed.\n\nHer 1977-1978 essay \"Waste Not Want Not: An Inquiry into What Women Saved and Assembled - FEMMAGE\" (written with Melissa Meyer) describes femmage as the activities of collage, assemblage, découpage and photomontage practised by women using \"traditional women's techniques - sewing, piercing, hooking, cutting, appliquéing, cooking and the like...\"\n\nAfter 1975, Schapiro returned to New York and with what she made after selling some paintings, she not only had a room but a studio of her own. Decoration and \"collaboration,\" are central to her artwork and both play a significant role in her house as well as in her studio. The studio became Schapiro’s own room and at moments of great personal conflict, the only connection with her creative self. Her various studios throughout the span of her career have reflected the changes in both the outer and the inner realities of her life. They have expressed her changing self-conceptions in accordance with or in against society, which keeps gender roles separate. Schapiro's studios have also become metaphors for her creative work, as well as spaces in which she could live her life and fulfill her dreams as well.\n\nIn the process of taking on different projects, Schapiro’s studio expanded and eventually became portable, following her as she traveled from place to place. It was during the same time of her Oregon collaborative project with the nine women that Schapiro also created her first \"Collaboration Series\" with women artists of the past. This series combined reproductions of the work of Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot with colorful and sensuous fabric borders in patterns inspired by quilts. In \"Mary Cassatt and Me\", Schapiro overlapped her own mental image of her mother with Cassatt's maternal ideal–her mother reading a newspaper.\n\nIn the 1990s Schapiro began exploring her Jewish identity further in her painting. Her painting \"My History\" (1997) she used the same structure as the \"House\" project and built rooms of different memories surrounding her Jewish heritage. Her most explicit Jewish-themed statement in art was \"Four Matriarchs\", stained glass windows portraying the biblical heroines Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. This was a colorful piece combining identity symbology and her older domesticated art to create the true vision of what high art meant to the public. \"Mother Russia\" (1994), was a fan piece made by Schapiro that drew from her family's Russian background. She depicts the powerful women from Russia each on a row of the hand held fan with a hat and a veil. She added pieces from each artist work in her \"collaborative\" style to join them as revolutionary women and give hidden figures praise. Her background in both the Russian and Jewish culture have very much attributed to what Schapiro’s collection of work represents. The foundation and collective use of patterns and colors describe Miriam's work and allow us to see her culture and female voice.\n\nSchapiro's works are held in numerous museum collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Jewish Museum (New York), the National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her awards include the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement from the College Art Association and a 1987 Guggenheim Fellowship. Miriam Schapiro's estate is represented exclusively by Eric Firestone Gallery.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was also the founder of the internationally broadcast cable television network Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) and the radio network WEWN.\n\nIn 1981, Mother Angelica started broadcasting religious programs from a converted garage in Birmingham, Alabama. Over the next twenty years, she developed a media network that included radio, TV, and internet channels as well as printed media. In 2009, Mother Angelica was a recipient of the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice Award granted by Pope Benedict XVI for services to the Catholic Church.\n\nMother Angelica hosted shows on EWTN until she had a stroke in 2001. She continued to live in the cloistered monastery in Hanceville, Alabama, until her death at age 92 on March 27, 2016 (Easter Sunday).\n\nMother Angelica was born Rita Antoinette Rizzo on April 20, 1923, in Canton, Ohio, in a community of African-American and Italian immigrant mill workers. Of Italian-American background, she was the only child of John and Mae Helen Rizzo (née Gianfrancesco). Her father, a tailor by trade, abandoned the family when Rizzo was only five, and her parents divorced two years later. On March 10, 1931, her mother was granted custody of the young Rizzo, and her father ordered to pay five dollars a week in child support. Her mother only received \"intermittent child-support payments from the father\". While maintaining full custody, her mother struggled with chronic depression and poverty. This was in part because being a divorcée carried a social stigma at the time and the opportunities for a woman to secure income were limited especially in the height of the Great Depression.\n\nLooking back at her childhood, Mother Angelica described herself and her mother as being \"like a pair of refugees\". \"We were poor, hungry, and barely surviving on odd jobs until Mother joined the dry cleaning business as an apprentice to a Jewish tailor in our area. Even then, we pinched pennies just to keep food on the table.\" The pair lived with her maternal grandparents, moving out for a time between 1933 and 1937, but were forced to return because of financial pressures. Matters were complicated when her grandfather, Anthony Gianfancesco, suffered a stroke in their absence, which paralyzed him on one side and required him to use a cane.\n\nRizzo attended a convent school, but disliked the nuns there, whom she recalled as being \"the meanest people on earth\" and treating her with harsh discipline due to her parents' divorce. She then attended Canton McKinley High School, where she was one of the school's first drum majorettes. She later told an interviewer, \"I did very poorly in school. I wasn’t interested in the capital of Ohio. I was interested in whether my mother had committed suicide that day.\" Rizzo developed no intimate friendships in high school, partly because of her fear that it would further upset her mother, who might see other demands for attention as a threat. Rizzo never dated, recalling later, \"I never had a date, never wanted one. I just didn't have any desire. I suppose having experienced the worst of married life, it was not at all attractive to me.\"\n\nIn 1939, Rizzo, feeling overwhelmed by crowd noise and school chatter, began to leave McKinley High in the afternoons. She was given calcium and nerve medication to treat what was deemed a nervous condition. When her mother's mental condition seemed to worsen, she made arrangements with her grandparents to have her sent to Philadelphia to be with a relative.\n\nA stomach ailment that Rizzo had from 1939 continued to cause severe abdominal pain, despite the extensive medical treatment she received. Her mother took her to Rhoda Wise who was hailed as a mystic and stigmatic and \"who claimed to receive visions of St Thérèse of Lisieux.\" Wise instructed Rizzo to perform a novena (a nine-day course of prayers) and made the girl promise that she would spread devotion to the saint if she was cured.\"\n\nOn the novena’s final day, January 18, 1943, Rizzo declared that she woke up with no pain and the abdominal lump causing it had vanished. This experience profoundly touched her; she believed that God had performed a miracle and she traced her lifelong commitment to God to this event. She later told an interviewer \"[at that point] I knew that God knew me and loved me and was interested in me. All I wanted to do after my healing was give myself to Jesus.\"\n\nOne evening in 1944, Rizzo stopped at a church to pray and felt that God was calling her to be a nun. She sought guidance from a local parish priest who encouraged her to begin visiting convents. Her first visit was to the Sisters of St. Joseph in Buffalo, New York, but the active congregation felt that she was better suited to contemplative life. She also visited Saint Paul's Shrine of Perpetual Adoration, a facility operated by an order of cloistered contemplative nuns, located in Cleveland, Ohio. When visiting this order, she felt as if she were at home. The order accepted her as a postulant, asking her to enter on August 15, 1944. She was 21 years old.\n\nOn November 8, 1945, Rizzo was vested as a Poor Clare nun. She received a new name, which her mother had chosen for her, and title, \"Sister Mary Angelica of the Annunciation\". Soon afterwards, the Cleveland monastery established a new monastery in her home town of Canton and she moved there.\n\nIn 1946, as a young nun, Sister Angelica had an accident with an industrial floor-scrubbing machine that knocked her over and injured her spine, causing her ongoing pain and requiring her to wear leg braces for most of her life. Sister Angelica saw the occurrence as a divine sign and promised Jesus to build a new monastery deep in the Protestant-dominated Southern United States if she recovered.\n\nOn January 2, 1953, she made her solemn profession of vows at Sancta Clara Monastery in Ohio.\n\nWhile at Sancta Clara, Sister Angelica was inspired to create a religious community which would appeal to African Americans in the southern states and began to seek support. In 1957, Archbishop Thomas Toolen suggested that she open this community in Birmingham. With a number of other Poor Clare nuns she worked to raise the necessary funds, partially from a small business venture making and selling fishing lures. In 1961, the nuns bought a building and land, and in 1962, the community was officially established. It was named Our Lady of the Angels Monastery and located in Irondale, Alabama, although it was later relocated to the grounds of the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament.\n\nIn 1999, Mother Angelica visited Colombia where she claimed to have a vision which told her to build a temple in honor of the Child Jesus. Private donors contributed $48.6 million and she opened the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville later the same year.\n\nIn 1962, Mother Angelica began a series of community meetings on matters relevant to Catholicism and also began recording her talks for sale. Bishop Joseph Vath noticed her talent for communicating with the lay public and encouraged her to continue; she began taping a radio show for broadcast on Sunday mornings and published her first book in 1972. In the late 1970s she began videotaping her talks for television, which were broadcast on the satellite Christian Broadcasting Network. In 1981, after visiting a Chicago television studio and being impressed by its capability, she formed the non-profit EWTN corporation. Initially, she recorded her shows in a converted garage at the monastery's property.\n\nEWTN became a voice for American conservative and traditional Catholics, with its position on religious and social issues often mirroring that of Pope John Paul II. With the emphasis on tradition, Angelica had feuds with some members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Most famous is the feud over a pastoral letter written by Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over teachings surrounding the Eucharist and the liturgy. After this dispute, EWTN added a theology department with priests, theologians, deacons, and lay people to make sure EWTN was in line with the teachings of the magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAccording to EWTN, the network's channels currently reach 264 million households globally.\n\nOn December 28, 1992, Mother Angelica launched a radio network, WEWN, which is carried by 215 stations, as well as on shortwave.\n\nMother Angelica stepped down from control of EWTN in 2000 and handed control to a board of lay people. In 2001 she had one of several strokes. She was left with \"slightly slurred speech, some unresponsive facial muscles and the need to wear an eye patch over one eye because she was unable to close the eyelid.\"\n\nIn response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Mother Angelica made a statement expressing sympathy for the victims, praising President Bush's speech to the U.S. Congress and calling for justice on the conspirators. She went on identifying \"pornography, abortion, child prostitution, the spread of drugs, the destruction of youth by an immoral media and the suppression of religious expression in public places as 'other' terrorist threats that must be addressed.\" She condemned abortion saying it had \"deprived the nation of millions of people who would otherwise be there to defend the nation.\"\n\nMother Angelica returned to taping her show twice a week on September 25, 2001. On Christmas Eve, she suffered another stroke and underwent a thrombectomy to remove a blood clot, a procedure that resulted in improvement of her vision. The stroke caused partial paralysis of the right side of her body and affected her speech. She began speech therapy and stopped hosting television programs. As her health declined, fellow nuns in Hanceville began providing her with constant care.\n\nOn October 4, 2009, Mother Angelica and Deacon Bill Steltemeier, then chairman of EWTN's board of governors, received the papal medal (Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice) from Pope Benedict XVI for their distinguished service to the Catholic Church. Because of her ill health, Mother Angelica received the award in her room. Bishop Robert J. Baker of the Diocese of Birmingham conferred the papal awards. At a public ceremony he said: \"Mother Angelica’s effort has been at the vanguard of the new evangelization and has had a great impact on our world.\"\n\nIn early December 2015, Mother Angelica was placed on a feeding tube. A representative for her order explained, \"It's not that she's completely unable to eat. It's assisting her to get the nutrients she needs.\" He added that she had experienced \"some up and downs the last few months. She's a fighter.\" Although confined to her bed, a representative said that \"She's able to communicate with a squeeze of a hand, make gestures with her eyes. She acknowledges people when they're there. The nuns say she does sleep a lot.\" The use of a feeding tube was in accord with the wishes she made before her stroke in 2001 – a reporter recalled her saying:\n\nWe don't understand the awesomeness of living even one more day... I told my sisters the other day, 'When I get really bad give me all the medicine I can take, all the tubes you can stuff down me. ... I want to live. ... Because I will have suffered one more day for the love of God ... I will exercise you in virtue. But most of all I will know God better. You cannot measure the value of one new thought about God in your own life.'\"\n\nIn early February 2016 Pope Francis, while en route to Cuba, recorded a message for Mother Angelica, saying: \"To Mother Angelica with my blessing and I ask you to pray for me; I need it. God bless you Mother Angelica.\" Near the end of that month, her fellow nuns at Our Lady of Angels Monastery called for prayers on her behalf saying that \"Mother's condition remains delicate and she receives devoted care day and night by her sisters and nurses. In God's Providence, she was able to receive the special Jubilee grace of passing through the Holy Door shortly after its opening. Although she is most often sleeping, from time to time Mother will give a radiant smile. ... Mother herself is regularly fortified by the sacraments. Please continue to keep her in your prayers; each day is a gift!\"\n\nMother Angelica remained living at the monastery until her death on March 27, 2016 (Easter Sunday) at the age of 92 from complications due to the stroke she had 14 years prior. At the time, she \"also suffered from Bell's palsy, heart disease and asthma.\"\n\nMother Angelica held the Catholic belief in Redemptive suffering, the belief human suffering can become meritorious if offered to Jesus Christ and mystically united with His suffering. Because of this belief, in her period of declining health Mother Angelica \"instructed her nuns to do everything to keep her alive, no matter how much she suffered, because every day she suffered, she suffered for God.\" She wanted every day to be \"one more act of suffering to God.\" EWTN chaplain, Father Joseph Mary Wolfe, MFVA told reporters that Mother Angelica's desire to unite with Jesus in suffering was fulfilled when she \"went into her death throes on Good Friday\".\n\nFather Wolfe recalled that \"Mother began to cry out early in the morning from the pain that she was having. She had a fracture in her bones because of the length of time she had been bedridden. They said you could hear it down the hallways, that she was crying out on Good Friday from what she was going through. These two people [a caregiver and one of the sisters of her order] said to me she has excruciating pain.\" Wolfe said that \"After the 3 o'clock hour arrived on Good Friday she was more calm, she was more peaceful.\" He also said that by the following day he made a point of putting himself in a position where her open eyes might focus on him and thanked her for the witness of her faith and \"teaching us how to love Jesus more\". By 5:30 am on Easter Sunday, Wolfe was contacted by Mother Delores who told him that Mother Angelica \"was really struggling, she wasn't doing very well.\" Wolfe went to her bedside to administer the Catholic last rites with the sisters of her order in attendance. The sisters prayed their morning prayers, the Divine Office, around her bed. As it was Easter, the prayer was liturgically required to contain Alleluias, which are usually not contained in the office for the dead – a fact that Wolfe felt had significance. Around 10:30 am, Father Paschal offered Mass in her room and she received her last communion (Viaticum). Priests and nuns continued to pray around her bed into the afternoon. She took her last breath shortly before 5:00 pm, and died.\n\nMother Angelica's death was announced by EWTN. In a statement on EWTN's Facebook page, Father Sean O. Sheridan, president of the Franciscan University of Steubenville where Mother Angelica received an honorary doctorate of sacred theology, described her as \"a true media giant. She proved that the Church belonged in the popular media alongside the news, sports, and talk shows. Though her stances were decidedly old-school — she was critical of religious and political progressives — her lectures were lightened with an often self-deprecating humor. She famously said the nuns she remembered from her youth were \"the meanest people on God’s earth.\"\n\nIn a ceremony on March 29, 2016, Mother Angelica's body was brought to the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery for private visitation by the Poor Clare nuns. Public visitation occurred at the upper church of the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament on March 30–31. The Mass of Christian Burial at the shrine's upper church took place on April 1 with Archbishop of Philadelphia and EWTN board member Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., serving as principal celebrant and EWTN chaplain Father Joseph Mary Wolfe, MFVA, as the homilist. Robert J. Baker and David E. Foley, the current and emeritus Bishops of Birmingham (where both EWTN and Our Lady of the Angels Monastery are located), respectively, concelebrated the Mass, along with Archbishop Thomas J. Rodi of Mobile (whose ecclesiastical province includes the Diocese of Birmingham), Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of Phoenix, Bishop Richard F. Stika of Knoxville and Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. In addition, many priests, deacons, religious, and seminarians were in attendance. This was followed by the Rite of Committal at the shrine's crypt chapel. All the funeral rites were televised on EWTN. It has been called for her to be proclaimed a saint.\n\n"}
{"id": "37737694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37737694", "title": "Mun (religion)", "text": "Mun (religion)\n\nMun or Munism (also called Bongthingism) is the traditional polytheistic, animist, shamanistic, and syncretic religion of the Lepcha people. It predates the seventh century Lepcha conversion to Lamaistic Buddhism, and since that time, the Lepcha have practiced it together with Buddhism. Since the arrival of Christian missionaries in the nineteenth century, Mun traditions have been followed alongside that religion as well. The traditional religion permits incorporation of Buddha and Jesus Christ as deities, depending on household beliefs.\n\nThe exonym \"Mun\" derives from the traditional belief in spirits called \"mun\" or \"mung\". Together with \"bongthing\" (also \"bungthing\" or \"bóngthíng\"), \"mun\" comprise a central element in the religion. These terms are also used to describe the shaman priesthood that officiates the respective spirits.\n\nThe Mun religion and its priesthood are in decline. Conversion to other religions is attributed to economic pressure, as traditional practices are immensely expensive to the ordinary practitioner. It has, however, regained interest among Lepcha as ecological encroachment becomes a growing concern. The environment is so deeply intertwined with Mun beliefs that religious leaders have offered direct opposition to development in areas including the Rathong Chu and Teesta Rivers.\n\nThe traditional Lepcha belief system is rich in oral myths, legends, fables, and fairy-tales collectively called \"lúngten sung\".\n\nAccording to Mun mythology, the ancestors of the Lepcha were created by Itbu Rum, who molded them from the pure snows of mount Kangchenjunga. They thus share a lineage with the natural environment and share the cosmos with non-human spirits.\n\nThe spirit of the legendary Thekong Thek delivers reproaches to the Lepcha chief through \"mun\" or \"bongthing\" shamans.\n\nThe belief system of Mun is animist, and the natural environment provides much of its basis. Naturally occurring spirits are an object of ceremonial dedication, and they reside in objects such as trees, rocks, and rivers. It is also a syncretic religion that has coexisted with Mahayana Buddhism since its arrival in the seventh century, with practitioners following both religions at the same time. Traditional beliefs may have influenced Lepcha Buddhist scriptures. Modern religious life in a Lepcha village is centered on the \"gumpa\", or Buddhist monastery.\n\nMany Lepcha were converted to Christianity by Scottish missionaries in the 19th century, however Buddhism and the traditional religion have retained important roles in Lepcha religious life. Many Christian Lepcha who have lost their Lepcha language have also distanced themselves from these traditional aspects of Lepcha religion.\n\nMun religion includes a belief in heaven, called \"rumlyang\".\n\nThe Mun religion is polytheistic and syncretic: it acknowledges several deities, including those of other religions, namely Buddhism and Christianity.\n\nThe chief goddess of the Lepcha religion is Nozyongnyu. The mother-creator is a female earth deity, It Bunoo (also Itbu-moo). Two other female deities are the chief of the \"mun\" spirits.\n\nTraditional Lepcha beliefs include deities governing family, clan (or lineage, \"putsho\"), village, region, and wider levels. Clan deities may be named after mountain peaks or rivers, while regions are home to deities associated with Kangchenjunga such as \"Chyu-rum-fat\". The traditional religion also incorporates Buddha and Jesus Christ as a deities, depending on household beliefs.\n\n\"Mun\" spirits are of two general types: the benevolent, or white magician, \"taung-li mun\", and the malevolent, or black magician, \"mung-sek mun\" or \"mung\". The latter reside in trees, bushes, rocks, and rivers. The spirits are further subdivided into seven classes: \"avor mun\", \"pildon mun\", \"angan mun\", \"tungli mun\", \"munjyum mun\", \"mun mook mun\" and \"lyang-eet mun\". \"Mun\" spirits, and witchcraft, are believed to be the invariable culprit of illness.\n\nCeremonies are usually performed for one or several households, and consist of two parts. The \"rum\" portion is an offering to devils. The second, \"tsandong\", is for offerings to the deity Kangchenjunga, to \"Chyu rum fat\", and to the plains. Ceremonies generally seek to appease these spirits. \"Bongthing\" rituals generally include prayers, herbs, and amulets, and may also include directed breathing or spitting by the priest. Ritual prayers are sometimes in the form of glossolalia.\n\nSpirit possession occurs in a variety of manners: from a subtle headache to violent, uncontrollable madness. Generally symptoms are the manifestation of \"mung\" spirits feeding off the flesh, blood, internal organs, or life energy of the host. Ritual paraphernalia include the \"ghanta\" bell, \"damaru dru\" necklaces, and consecrated cup filled with \"chi\".\n\nThe religion practices animal sacrifice, especially of goats and pigs.\n\nMun priests are traditionally present at Lepcha celebrations for birth, marriage, and death. Among the Lepcha, Mun officiants are the only obligatory aspect of a commoner's funeral. The funerary ceremony, called \"dek flee\", is accompanied by the sacrifice of a goat and a hen three days after death. It is also performed at the home of people who die elsewhere, for fear of the spirit's return. Auspicious locations and days, particularly in rural settings, may be required of rituals to address more severe ailments or threatening afflictions.\n\nFestivals are also a central aspect of the religion.\n\nThe priesthood consists of two types of shaman, corresponding to the spirits they manifest. \"Mun\" undergo spirit possession, manifesting supernatural entities bodily, can be male or female. While \"bongthing\" are only male, where they have to learn and practice rituals. It is said that Bongthing came before Mun, so as to show respect, the Mun needs to learn both the Bongthing way and the Mun way. Mun undergo spirit possession, manifesting supernatural entities bodily. Their main functions are to ward off misfortunes and illness, perform exorcisms, and guide souls to the afterlife. Some also adjudicate theft cases. Although the priesthood exists, the religion considers true knowledge to be a divine revelation through meditation or dreams, as opposed to a learned talent.\n\nBoth the \"mun\" and \"bongthing\" priesthoods are hereditary, although they do not pass strictly patrilineally. Trained disciples of existing masters are often recruited to service at times of crisis as an election by ancestors or shamanic gods. It is possible for a \"bongthing\" to advance to \"mun\" status.\n\n\"Padem\" are a male hereditary junior priesthood. A \"padem\" is usually an initiate on the path to becoming a \"mun\" shaman, and has the right to offer sacrifice.\n\nThe traditional priesthood also plays a role in the indigenous medical system, as they learn therapeutic knowledge and healing rituals.\n\n"}

{"id": "2269085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269085", "title": "Panehesy", "text": "Panehesy\n\nThe Egyptian noble Panehesy (also transcribed as Pinhasy or Panehsy) was the 'Chief servitor of the Aten in the temple of Aten in Akhetaten' ('Second Prophet of the Lord of the Two Lands').\n\nPanehesy held a variety of titles that show how powerful he must have been during the Amarna Period. He was the 'Chief servitor of the Aten in the temple of Aten in Akhetaten' and 'Second Prophet of the Lord of the Two Lands'. He was also the 'Seal-bearer of Lower Egypt.'.\n\nPanehsy was also the 'Superintendent of the Cattle of the Aten in Akhetaten' and the 'Superintendent of the Granary of the Aten'.\n\nPanehesy had two houses in Amarna. One was located near the temple, while another was located in the Central City. The house near the temple was likely more of an office.\n\nThe main residence of Panehesy (R44.2) lies in the Central City of Amarna. In his main residence a large shrine was discovered which depicted Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and princess Meritaten making offerings to the Aten. This is an example of the domestic cult of the royal couple. The hypaethral chapel was located within the central hall. To the south of Panehesy's home was a small village. The total area occupied by the village is less than the area occupied by the main residence of the Priest. The village consists of some 40 houses that were likely the residences of Panehesy's staff.\nIn the vicinity of the home a stele was discovered depicting Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye.\n\nThe second residence of Panehesy near the temple of the Aten may be related to his function as the overseer of the cattle. The structure includes stone floors and brick mangers and may have served as a holding pen for the cattle. Excavations revealed remains of cattle, horn and bones. The bones were the remains of the cattle butchered for the offerings in the temple. The central hall of this house held a stone built shrine painted to look like an Amarna Temple. The structure held narrow wooden doors and likely held a statue of the King. The shrine is now at the Cairo Museum.\n\nHe had a tomb constructed at Amarna, among the northern tombs among the Tombs of the Nobles. The Tomb of Panehsy (Amarna Tomb 6) contains scenes of himself and his family and others showing the royal family, but his remains have never been identified. The tomb had suffered damage from iconoclasts. The images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti had been disfigured, and most of the names had been removed.\n\nIn later times, his tomb was turned into a Coptic place of worship for a while and suffered damage. \nA deep font for total immersion was placed before the apse.\n"}
{"id": "3763987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3763987", "title": "Panj Pyare", "text": "Panj Pyare\n\nPanj Pyare (, ', literally the five beloved ones), is the name collectively given to the five Sikh men, Bhai Dhaya Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh, Bhai Himmat Singh, Bhai Mohkam Singh and Bhai Sahib Singh by Guru Gobind Singh at the historic divan Anandpur Sahib on 14 April 1699. They formed the nucleus of the Khalsa, as the first batch to receive khanda di Pahul, i.e. rites of the two-edged sword.\nIn Sikh theology, as in the Indian classical tradition generally, panj (ਪੰਜ) or paanch (पांच), i.e. the numeral five, has a special significance. Guru Nanak in Japji Sahib refers to five khands, i.e. stages or steps in spiritual development, and calls a spiritually awakened person a \"panch\". The ancient Indian socio-political institution panchayat meant a council of five elders. Something like an inner council of five existed even in the time of the earlier Gurus: five Sikhs accompanied Guru Arjan on his last journey to Lahore; the five were each given 100 armed Sikhs to command by his successor, Guru Hargobind. Guru Tegh Bahadur set out on his journey to Delhi to court execution attended by five Sikhs.\n\nUntil the Baisakhi of AD 1699, Sikh initiation ceremony, Charan Pahul, comprised the administering of charanamrit or charanodak to the novitiate. As Bhai Gurdas, Varan, I.23, records, this was the practice Guru Nanak Dev introduced for the Sikhs. At the ceremony the novitiate quaffed water poured over the foot of the Guru and vowed to follow the religious and moral injunctions as well as the code of communal conduct laid down. Later, masands or local leaders, specially authorized by the Gurus, also administered charan pahul. According to Kesar Singh Chhibbar, Bansavalinama, a modification was introduced in the time of Guru Hargobind when water, poured over the toe of the right foot of each of the five chosen Sikhs assembled in a dharamsal, was received in a bowl and administered to the seekers after ardas or supplicatory prayer.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh, who had abolished the institution of masands replaced charan pahul with khanda di Pahul. He summoned a special assembly in the Keshgarh Fort at Anandpur on the Baisakhi day of 1756 Bk/30 March 1699. After the morning devotions and kirtan, he suddenly stood up, drawn sword in hand, and, to quote Bhai Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, spoke: “The entire sangat is very dear to me; but is there a devoted Sikh who will give his head to me here and now? A need has arisen at this moment which calls for a head.” A hush fell over the assembly. Daya Ram , a shopkeeper of Lahore, arose and offered himself. He walked behind the Guru to a tent near by. Guru Gobind Singh returned with his sword dripping blood and demanded another head. The Guru again asked for another head, this time Dharam Singh from Hastinapur or modern Meerut, presented himself to the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh gave three more calls. Mohkam Chand, a calico printer/tailor from Dwarka, Gujarat, Himmat Rai, a water-bearer from Jagannath Puri, Orissa, and Sahib Chand, a barber from Bidar, Karnataka stood up one after another and advanced to offer their heads. They were the first five Sikhs as understood in modern parlance.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh emerged from the tent “hand in hand with the five”, says Kuir Singh, Gurbilas Patshahi 10. The disciples wore saffron-coloured raiment topped over with neatly tied turbans of the same colour. Guru Gobind Singh, similarly dressed, introduced his chosen Sikhs to the audience as Panj Pyare, the five devoted spirits beloved of the Guru. He then proceeded to perform the ceremony. Filling an iron bowl with clean water, he kept churning it with a khanda, i.e. double-edged sword, while reciting over it the sacred verses. Guru Gobind Singh’s wife Mata Sahib Kaur ji brought sugar crystals which were put into the vessel at the Guru’s bidding. Sweetness was thus mingled with the alchemy of iron. Amrit, the Nectar of Immortality, was now ready and Guru Gobind Singh gave the five Sikhs each five palmsful of it to drink. At the end, all five of them quaffed from the steel bowl the remaining elixir binding themselves in new fraternal ties. Their rebirth into this brotherhood meant the cancellation of their previous family ties, of the occupations which had hitherto determined their place in society, of their beliefs and creeds and of the rituals they had so far observed.\n\nThe five Sikhs formed the nucleus of the self-abnegating, martial and casteless fellowship of the Khalsa Guru Gobind Singh had brought into being. They were given the surname of Singh, meaning lion, and were ever to wear the five emblems of the Khalsa — kesh or unshorn hair and beard; kangha, a comb in the kesh to keep it tidy as against the recluses who kept it matted in token of their having renounced the world; kara, a iron bracelet; kaccha, short breeches worn by soldiers; and kirpan, a sword. They were enjoined to succour the helpless and fight the oppressor, to have faith in One God and to consider all human beings equal, irrespective of caste and creed.\n\nThe episode of sis-bhet, i.e. offering of the heads was recorded by Bhai Kuir Singh in his Gurbilas Patshahi 10 (1751) followed by Bhai Sukkha Singh, Bhai Santokh Singh, and others. Earlier chronicles such as the Sri Gur Sobha, and the Bansavalinama do not narrate it in such detail. Ratan Singh Bhangu, Prachin Panth Prakash, simply says that \"five Sikhs were selected, one each from the five castes, that they had received instruction at the hands of Guru Gobind Singh, was a devoted disciple and had been in residence at Anandpur long enough to have been affected by its ambience of faith and sacrifice. As they volunteered individually it was a coincidence that they belonged to different castes and to different parts of India.\n\nKhanda di Pahul, introduced by Guru Gobind Singh on 30 March 1699, became the established form of initiation for Sikhs for all time to come; so also the institution of the Panj Pyare. In fact, Guru Gobind Singh had himself been initiated by the Panj Pyare as he had initiated them. Since then this has been the custom. Panj Pyare, any five initiated Sikhs reputed to be strictly following the rahit, or Sikh discipline, are chosen to administer to the novitiates amrit, i.e. Khanda di Pahul. Panj Pyare are similarly chosen to perform other important ceremonies such as laying the cornerstone of a gurdwara building or inaugurating kar-seva, i.e. cleansing by voluntary labour of a sacred tank, or leading a religious procession, and to decide issues confronting a local sangat or community as a whole.\n\nAt crucial moments of history, Panj Pyare have collectively acted as supreme authority, representing the Guru-Panth. During the battle of Chamkaur, it was the last five surviving Sikhs who, constituting themselves into the Council of Five, Panj Pyare, commanded Guru Gobind to leave the fortress and save himself to reassemble the Sikhs. Guru Gobind Singh had abolished the masand system and before he died, he also ended the line of living gurus. In the institution of Panj Pyare, he had created the nucleus of a casteless and democratic continuing society.\n\nSee: Concepts in Sikhism\n\n\nGobind Rai was 33 years old when he had Divine inspiration to actuate his designs and make an undying legacy. Every year at the time of Baisakhi (springtime), thousands of devotees would come to Anandpur to pay their obeisance and seek the Guru's blessings. In early 1699, months before Baisakhi Day, Gobind Rai sent special edicts to congregants far and wide that that year the Baisakhi was going to be a unique affair. He asked them not to cut any of their hair—to come with unshorn hair under their turbans and chunis, and for the men to come with full beards.\n\nOn Baisakhi Day, March 30, 1699, hundreds of thousands of people gathered around his divine temporal seat at Anandpur Sahib. The Guru addressed the congregants with a most stirring oration on his divine mission of restoring their faith and preserving the Sikh religion. After his inspirational discourse, he flashed his unsheathed sword and said that every great deed was preceded by equally great sacrifice: He demanded one head for oblation. \"I need a head\", he declared. After some trepidation one person offered himself. The Guru took him inside a tent. A little later he reappeared with his sword dripping with blood, and asked for another head. One by one, four more earnest devotees offered their heads. Every time the Guru took a person inside the tent, he came out with a bloodied sword in his hand.\n\nThinking their Guru to have gone berserk, the congregants started to disperse. Then the Guru emerged with all five men dressed in orange suits with a blue bib.(These are the colors of Sikhism). He baptized the five in a new and unique ceremony called pahul, what Sikhs today know as the baptism ceremony called Amrit. Then the Guru asked those five baptized Sikhs to baptize him as well. This is how he became known as Guru Chela both teacher and student. He then proclaimed that the Panj Pyare—the Five Beloved Ones—would be the embodiment of the Guru himself: \"Where there are Panj Pyare, there am I. When the Five meet, they are the holiest of the holy.\"\n\nHe said whenever and wherever five baptized (Amritdhari) Sikhs come together, the Guru would be present. All those who receive Amrit from five baptized Sikhs will be infused with the spirit of courage and strength to sacrifice. Thus with these principles he established Panth Khalsa, the Order of the Pure Ones.\n\nAt the same time the Guru gave his new Khalsa a unique, indisputable, and distinct identity. The Guru gave the gift of bana, the distinctive Sikh clothing and headwear. He also offered five emblems of purity and courage. These symbols, worn by all baptized Sikhs of both sexes, are popularly known today as Five Ks: Kesh, unshorn hair this a gift from god. Kangha, the wooden comb it keeps the tangles out of Sikhs hair which shows that god keeps the tangles out of your life.

Discriminatory class distinctions (--the Indian \"caste\" system--) promoted by Hindu Brahmins were responsible for the people's sense of degradation. The Guru wanted to eliminate the anomalies caused by the caste system. The constitution of the Panj Pyare was the living example of his dream: both the high and low castes were amalgamated into one. Among the original Panj Pyare, there was one Khatri, shopkeeper; one Brahmin, priest; one Chhimba, calico printer/tailor; one Ghumar, water-carrier; and one Nai, a barber. Further the five were from distant regions - Sindh, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat and Karnataka.. He gave the surname of Singh (Lion) to every Sikh and also took the name for himself. From Gobind Rai he became Guru Gobind Singh. He also pronounced that all Sikh women embody royalty, and gave them the surname Kaur (Princess). With the distinct Khalsa identity and consciousness of purity Guru Gobind Singh gave all Sikhs the opportunity to live lives of courage, sacrifice, and equality.\n\nThe birth of the Khalsa is celebrated by Sikhs every Baisakhi Day on April 13. Baisakhi 1999 marks the 300th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh's gift of Panth Khalsa to all Sikhs everywhere.\n"}

Z. Knight, who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old being called Ramtha the Enlightened One. The school's teachings are based on these channeling sessions.\n\nIn 1988, J. Z. Knight founded Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE), then called Ramtha's School of Enlightenment: The American Gnostic School, on her estate in Yelm, Washington, U.S. A division of Knight's company JZK, Inc., the school had around 80 staff members . According to RSE's website, it is an \"academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of all ages and cultures\". RSE's private, fenced compounds are only open to staff members and students, not to the public.\n\nIn 2004, various Ramtha school leaders joined community groups to strongly oppose a proposed 75,000-seat NASCAR racetrack in Yelm. The proposal was withdrawn. In 2007, Knight's profits from the school's activities and from sale of books, tapes, CDs and DVDs had reportedly been around $2.6 million. In 2008, lessons were given to the public in more than 20 countries, including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile for the first time.\n\nThe school teaches that human beings have the capacity to utilize their inner wisdom, focus their brains, and create their own reality. The school's curriculum is based on the channelings by Knight of the entity Ramtha. Although the school has been criticised for being a cult (see below), Knight and her followers deny such claims and say that the school is neither a religion nor a cult.\n\nRamtha's School of Enlightenment teachings have been described as part of the New Age movement (the school itself claims to be outside it). A controversial religious scholar, J. Gordon Melton, wrote a book countering this argument called \"Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom\".\n\nLessons in the school's compounds sometimes include wine drinking, tobacco pipe smoking and dancing to rock ’n’ roll music. Allegedly, it is being taught that the nitric oxide in red wine (not the alcohol), also found in pipe tobacco (not the nicotine), can help to facilitate changes in the brain as a part of the process in which to achieve these means.\n\nThrough various focus techniques, the students believe they are on their way to becoming as \"enlightened\" as other shamans who can alter their personal reality at will. The main activities towards that goal vary from specific focusing, meditation-like techniques, breathing techniques, blindfolded archery, energy healing (for one's self and for someone else), finding the heart of a maze, and many more. The students are taught that human beings can train themselves into such powers that will allow them to levitate, raise the dead, make gold appear in their hand and predict the future. Eventually this may lead to the \"ascension\" of the physical body into the \"light body\".\n\nOther skills allegedly obtained by attending the lessons include psychokinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, and other ESP skills, which have been criticized by various skeptics around the world.\n\nThe dialogues, and a lot of transcripts from Knight's Ramtha talks, have been compiled and published over the course of many years. Videotapes of various dialogue sessions have also been released. While some of the major themes around the school's teachings are covered in these publications, a more in-depth and systematic presentation of its philosophies and teachings are only accessible by attending a retreat in person.\n\nIn February 1997, Knight hosted a conference of scholars who had been studying her, the students and the school for the previous year. During their research phase, they also observed Knight's Ramtha sessions and measured various physiological functions of her body. The researchers examined Ramtha’s teachings and the school's practices from a variety of perspectives, including physics, feminism, parapsychology and religion. Melton organized the research. In addition to the conference presenters, Knight invited the media to attend. However, Knight said she did not sponsor the conference to gain publicity or to convince her skeptics.\n\nKnight paid the travel expenses and stipends for the conference presenters, which caused some of Knight’s critics to suggest she had influenced their research. The researchers denied this contention to the press and, according to the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", \"were offended by a suggestion that the New Age spiritualist could have tried to buy their support\".\n\nApart from the conference proceedings, two papers were published. In 1998, Stanley Krippner published a paper on the psychological, phenomenological and geomagnetic results of the various studies. In 2009, Joan Hageman published a paper examining the results of the physiological testing on Knight and six students.\n\nRamtha's School of Enlightenment has been called a cult by various people, including her former husband Jeff Knight, former personal bodyguard Glen Cunningham, former students of the school (such as David McCarthy or Joe Szimhart), and skeptic Michael Shermer. Melton's book, which denies the school's status as a cult, has been criticized for siding with the school and not providing a neutral description of what is going on within the school. He has also been called a \"cult apologist\" by various opposers of cults. His position was further criticized when he took the stand as a witness in the case of Knight v. Knight (1992–1995) against Jeff Knight (JZ Knight's husband at the time), by further supporting that the school is not a cult.\n\nFormer students of the school have accused the RSE of practicing brain-washing and mind-control, as well as using intimidation and fear techniques to keep students in the school. David McCarthy, a student of the RSE between 1989 and 1996, calls Knight a \"spiritual predator\", and he mentions various parts of the teachings which had an intimidative character, such as the prophecy that unless students remain faithful to Ramtha, they will become prey of the \"lizard people\", and that the ancient figure of Jehovah would return to earth accompanied by lizard people, in a spaceship. The former students (including David McCarthy and Joe Szimhart) have formed an online community, Life After RSE (LARSE), to provide support for people who have quit the school and find themselves lost.\n\nA further controversial issue regarding the Ramtha teachings involve the so-called \"days to come\", which were prophesied earth changes. Instructions reputed as coming from Ramtha were given to the students, telling them to leave the cities, find a place in the country to grow their own food and become sovereign or self-sufficient. Another instruction was told to students to build underground shelters to protect themselves and their families.\n\nVarious incidents within the school's grounds have been characterized as controversial. Glen Cunningham, in an interview with David McCarthy, describes how, one evening, Knight suggested that all students should stay there overnight because she said it would be \"good for the energy\". That was before the Great Arena (formerly used as horse stables) had been floored, and as a result there would be a lot of dust in the air. Cunningham says that there was a very old woman among the students, who begged him that she did not want to do this and she wanted to go home, but Ramtha said that she can stay under the protection of Ramtha and her bodyguard. Leaving the arena the following day, the old woman died of pneumonia (due to the dust in the air and humidity).\n\nAnother incident which is mentioned by both Cunningham and Joe Szimhart is the practice of running blindfolded in a large fenced field. Szimhart mentions in particular an occasion around the year 1990, in which about 1,000 blindfolded students were directed to split up and run across the field, with their hands in the \"Consciousness & Energy\" position in front of them, and the exercise was meant to help the students overcome their fears. Szimhart recalls how many people crashed into each other, and that there were some injuries. A customer of his ended up with a deeply bruised shoulder and a big lump on his forehead. Aside from the minor injuries, a few people had to be treated at the hospital.\n\nIn 2011, Knight stated (while at the RSE supposedly channeling Ramtha), \"Fuck God’s chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now\", and said that Mexican people \"breed like rabbits\" and are \"poison,\" that all gay men used to be Catholic priests, and that organic farmers have bad hygiene. In 2012, videos of this were placed on the Internet by ex-students of Knight's and by the Freedom Foundation.\n\nIn 2004, three members of the RSE produced a controversial film that combined documentary interviews and a fictional narrative to posit a connection between science and spirituality, called \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\". The film has been criticized by the scientific community due to its mis-representation of quantum physics, and an unnecessary connection to consciousness. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a \"pseudoscientific docudrama\", saying \"Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2171906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171906", "title": "Slavery and religion", "text": "Slavery and religion\n\nThe issue of slavery and religion is an area of historical research into the relationship between the world's major religions and the practice of slavery. Slavery could be a result of being a prisoner of war, owing a debt or being sold into slavery. Historically slavery has been supported by several major religions. A passage in the Bible has historically been interpreted by a subset of Christians to mean that anyone with dark (black) skin also had a black soul, condemning them to slavery. Some Christians also enslaved non-believers as the \"natural order of things\" and saw any non-believer as a potential slave. Enslaved non-believers were sometimes converted to Christianity but elements of their traditional beliefs merged with their Christian beliefs. Some Popes since the 15th century denounced slavery, and various denominations were for or against slavery into the 19th century. In Judaism, slaves were given a range of treatments and protections. They were to be treated as extended family with certain protections and could be freed. They were property but could also own material goods. In Islam, under Sharia law, prisoners of war could be enslaved. Hindus encourage liberation as an ultimate goal, and their scriptures do not discuss slavery. However, Sanskrit language Hindu texts such as the \"Arthashastra\", and the Pali language Buddhist texts, contain the word \"dasa\", which is translated as either \"servant\" or \"slave\".\n\nGenesis narrative about the Curse of Ham has often been held to be an aetiological story, giving a reason for the enslavement of the Canaanites. The word \"ham\" is very similar to the Hebrew word for \"hot\", which is cognate with an Egyptian word (\"kem\", meaning \"black\") used to refer to Egypt itself, in reference to the fertile black soil along the Nile valley. Although many scholars therefore view \"Ham\" as an eponym used to represent Egypt in the Table of Nations, a number of Christians throughout history, including Origen and the Cave of Treasures, have argued for the alternate proposition that \"Ham\" represents all black people, his name symbolising their dark skin colour; pro-slavery advocates, from Eutychius of Alexandria and John Philoponus, to American pro-slavery apologists, have therefore occasionally interpreted the narrative as a condemnation of all black people to slavery. A few Christians, like Jerome, even took up the racist notion that black people inherently had \"a soul as black as [their] body\".\n\nSlavery was customary in antiquity, and it is condoned by the Torah. The Bible uses the Hebrew term \"ebed\" to refer to slavery; however, \"ebed\" has a much wider meaning than the English term \"slavery\", and in several circumstances it is more accurately translated into English as \"servant\". It was seen as legitimate to enslave captives obtained through warfare, but not through kidnapping. Children could also be sold into debt bondage, which was sometimes ordered by a court of law.\n\nAs with the Hittite Laws and the Code of Hammurabi, the Bible does set minimum rules for the conditions under which slaves were to be kept. Slaves were to be treated as part of an extended family; they were allowed to celebrate the Sukkot festival, and expected to honour Shabbat. Israelite slaves could not be compelled to work \"with rigour\", and debtors who sold themselves as slaves to their creditors had to be treated the same as a hired servant. If a master harmed a slave in one of the ways covered by the lex talionis, the slave was to be compensated by manumission; if the slave died within 24 to 48 hours, he or she was to be \"avenged\" (whether this refers to the death penalty or not is uncertain).\n\nIsraelite slaves were automatically manumitted after six years of work, and/or at the next Jubilee (occurring either every 49 or every 50 years, depending on interpretation), although the latter would not apply if the slave was owned by an Israelite and wasn't in debt bondage. Slaves released automatically in their 7th year of service, which did not include female slaves, or did, were to be given livestock, grain, and wine, as a parting gift (possibly hung round their necks). This 7th-year manumission could be voluntarily renounced, which would be signified, as in other Ancient Near Eastern nations, by the slave gaining a ritual ear piercing; after such renunciation, the individual was enslaved \"forever\" (and not released at the Jubilee). Non-Israelite slaves were always to be enslaved \"forever\", and treated as inheritable property.\n\nIn several Pauline epistles, and the First Epistle of Peter, slaves are admonished to obey their masters, \"as to the Lord, and not to men\"; however these particular \"Pauline epistles\" are also those whose Pauline authorship is doubted by many modern scholars. By contrast, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, one of the \"undisputed epistles\", describes lawfully obtained manumission as the ideal for slaves. Another \"undisputed epistle\" is that to Philemon, which has become an important text in regard to slavery, being used by pro-slavery advocates as well as by abolitionists; in the epistle, Paul returns Onesimus, a fugitive slave, back to his master nature, which was opposed to the equality in which mankind was created.\n\nMore mainstream forms of first-century Judaism didn't exhibit such qualms about slavery, and ever since the 2nd-century expulsion of Jews from Judea, wealthy Jews have owned non-Jewish slaves, wherever it was legal to do so; nevertheless, manumissions were approved by Jewish religious officials on the slightest of pretexts, and court cases concerning manumission were nearly always decided in favour of freedom, whenever there was uncertainty towards the facts.\n\nThe Talmud, a document of great importance in Judaism, made many rulings which had the effect of making manumission easier and more likely:\n\nJewish participation in the slave trade itself was also regulated by the Talmud. Fear of apostasy lead to the Talmudic discouragement of the sale of Jewish slaves to non-Jews, although loans were allowed; similarly slave trade with Tyre was only to be for the purpose of removing slaves from non-Jewish religion. Religious racism meant that the Talmudic writers completely forbade the sale or transfer of Canaanite slaves out from Palestine to elsewhere. Other types of trade were also discouraged: men selling themselves to women, and post-pubescent daughters being sold into slavery by their fathers. Pre-pubescent slave girls sold by their fathers had to be freed-then-married by their new owner, or his son, when she \"started\" puberty; slaves could not be allowed to marry free Jews, although masters were often granted access to the \"services\" of the wives of any of their slaves.\n\nAccording to the Talmudic law, killing of a slave is punishable in the same way as killing of a freeman, even if it was committed by the owner. While slaves are considered the owner's property, they may not work on Sabbath and holidays; they may acquire and hold property of the own.\n\nSeveral prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages took offense at the idea that Jews might be enslaved; Joseph Caro and Maimonides both argue that calling a Jew \"slave\" was so offensive that it should be punished by excommunication. However, they did not condemn enslavement of non-Jews. Indeed, they argued that the biblical rule, that slaves should be freed for certain injuries, should actually only apply to slaves who had converted to Judaism; additionally, Maimonides argued that this manumission was really punishment of the owner, and therefore it could only be imposed by a court, and required evidence from witnesses. Unlike the biblical law protecting fugitive slaves, Maimonides argued that such slaves should be compelled to buy their freedom.\n\nAt the same time, Maimonides and other halachic authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves. According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, \"The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended - the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out.\" In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are \"mercy, compassion and forbearance\".\n\nSlavery in different forms existed within Christianity for over 18 centuries. Although in the early years of Christianity, freeing slaves was regarded as an act of charity, and the Christian view of equality of all people including slaves was a novelty in the Roman Empire, the institution of slavery was rarely criticised. Indeed, in 340, the Synod of Gangra condemned the Manicheans for their urging that slaves should liberate themselves; the canons of the Synod instead declared that anyone preaching abolitionism should be anathematised, and that slaves had a \"Christian obligation\" to submit to their masters. Augustine of Hippo, who renounced his former Manicheanism, argued that slavery was part of the mechanism to preserve the natural order of things; John Chrysostom, regarded as a saint by Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, argued that slaves should be resigned to their fate, as by \"obeying his master he is obeying God\". but also stated that \"Slavery is the fruit of covetousness, of extravagance, of insatiable greediness\" in his Epist. ad Ephes. As the Apostle Paul admonished the early Christians; \"There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus\". And in fact, even some of the first popes were once slaves themselves.\n\nIn 1452 Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, which granted Afonso V of Portugal the right to reduce any \"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers\" to hereditary slavery. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. (This was regarding wars caused by the fall on constantinople) In 1488 Pope Innocent VIII accepted the gift of 100 slaves from Ferdinand II of Aragon and distributed those slaves to his cardinals and the Roman nobility. Also, in 1639 Pope Urban VIII purchased slaves for himself from the Knights of Malta.\n\nOther Popes in the 15th and 16th century denounced slavery as a \"great crime\", including Pius II, Paul III, and Eugene IV. \nIn 1639, pope Urban VIII forbade slavery, as did Benedict XIV in 1741. In 1815, pope Pius VII demanded of the Congress of Vienna the suppression of the slave trade, and Gregory XVI condemned it again in 1839.\n\nIn addition, the Dominican friars who arrived at the Spanish settlement at Santo Domingo in 1510 strongly denounced the enslavement of the local Indians. Along with other priests, they opposed their treatment as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king and in the subsequent royal commission. As a response to this position, the Spanish monarchy's subsequent \"Requerimiento\" provided a religious justification for the enslavement of the local populations, on the pretext of refusing conversion to Roman Catholicism and therefore denying the authority of the Pope.\n\nSome other Christian organizations were slaveholders. The 18th century high-church Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts owned the Codrington Plantation, in Barbados, containing several hundred slaves, branded on their chests with the word \"Society\". George Whitefield, famed for his sparking of the so-called \"Great Awakening\" of American evangelicalism, overturned a province-wide ban against slavery, and went on to own several hundred slaves himself. Yet Whitefield is remembered as one of the first to preach to the enslaved.\n\nAt other times, Christian groups worked against slavery. The seventh century Saint Eloi used his vast wealth to purchase British and Saxon slaves in groups of 50 and 100 in order to set them free. The Quakers in particular were early leaders in abolitionism, attacking slavery since at least 1688. In 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed, with 9 of the 12 founder members being Quakers; William Wilberforce, an early supporter of the society, went on to push through the 1807 Slave Trade Act, striking a major blow against the transatlantic slave trade. Leaders of Methodism and Presbyterianism also vehemently denounced human bondage, convincing their congregations to do likewise; Methodists and Presbyterians subsequently made the repudiation of slavery a condition of membership.\n\nIn the Southern United States, however, support for slavery was strong; anti-slavery literature was prevented from passing through the postal system, and even sermons, from the famed English preacher Charles Spurgeon, were burned due to their censure of slavery. When the American Civil War broke out, slavery became one of the issues which would be decided by its outcome; the southern defeat led to a constitutional ban on slavery. Despite the general emancipation of slaves, members of fringe Christian groups like the Christian Identity movement, and the Ku Klux Klan (a white supremacist group) see the enslavement of Africans as a positive aspect of American history.\n\nIn the United States, Christianity not only held views about slavery but also on how slaves practiced their own form of Christianity. Prior to the work of Melville Herskovits in 1941, it was widely believed that all elements of African culture were destroyed by the horrific experiences of Africans forced to come to the United States of America. Since his groundbreaking work, scholarship has found that Slave Christianity existed as an extraordinarily creative patchwork of African and Christian religious tradition. The slaves brought with them a wide variety of religious traditions including both tribal shamanism and Islam. Beyond that, tribal traditions could vary to a high degree across the African continent.\n\nDuring the early eighteenth century, Anglican missionaries attempting to bring Christianity to slaves in the Southern colonies often found themselves butting up against not only uncooperative masters, but also resistant slaves. An unquestionable obstacle to the acceptance of Christianity among slaves was their desire to continue to adhere as much as possible to the religious beliefs and rituals of their African ancestors. Missionaries working in the South were especially displeased with slave retention of African practices such as polygamy and what they called idolatrous dancing. In fact, even blacks who embraced Christianity in America did not completely abandon Old World religion. Instead, they engaged in syncretism, blending Christian influences with traditional African rites and beliefs. Symbols and objects, such as crosses, were conflated with charms carried by Africans to ward off evil spirits. Christ was interpreted as a healer similar to the priests of Africa. In the New World, fusions of African spirituality and Christianity led to distinct new practices among slave populations, including voodoo or vodun in Haiti and Spanish Louisiana. Although African religious influences were also important among Northern blacks, exposure to Old World religions was more intense in the South, where the density of the black population was greater.\n\nThere were, however, some commonalities across the majority of tribal traditions. Perhaps the primary understanding of tribal traditions was that there was not a separation of the sacred and the secular. All life was sacred and the supernatural was present in every facet and focus of life. Most tribal traditions highlighted this experience of the supernatural in ecstatic experiences of the supernatural brought on by ritual song and dance. Repetitious music and dancing were often used to bring on these experiences through the use of drums and chanting. The realization of these experiences was in the \"possession\" of a worshipper in which one not only is taken over by the divine but actually becomes one with the divine.\n\nEchoes of African tribal traditions can be seen in the Christianity practiced by slaves in the Americas. The song, dance, and ecstatic experiences of traditional tribal religion were Christianized and practiced by slaves in what is called the \"Ring Shout.\" This practice was a major mark of African American Christianity during the slavery period.\n\nChristianity came more slowly to the slaves of North America. Many colonial slaveholders feared that baptizing slaves would lead to emancipation because of vague laws concerning the slave status of Christians under British colonial rule. Even after 1706, by which time many states had passed laws stating that baptism would not alter slave status, slaveholders were worried that the catechization of slaves wouldn't be a wise economic choice. Slaves usually had one day off each week, usually Sunday. That time was used to grow their own crops, as well as dancing and singing (doing such things on the Sabbath was frowned on by most preachers), so there was little time for slaves to receive religious instruction.\n\nDuring the antebellum period, slave preachers - enslaved or formally enslaved evangelists - became instrumental in shaping slave Christianity. They preached a gospel radically different from that of white preachers, who often used Christianity in an attempt to make slaves more complacent to their enslaved status. Rather than focusing on obedience, slave preachers placed a greater emphasis on the Old Testament, especially the book of Exodus. They likened the plight of the American slaves to the enslaved Hebrews of the Bible, instilling hope into the hearts of those enslaved. Slave preachers were instrumental in shaping the religious landscape of African Americans for decades to come.\n\nAccording to Bernard Lewis, slavery has been a part of Islam's history from its beginning. The Quran like the Old and the New Testaments, states Lewis, \"assumes the existence of slavery\". It attempts to regulate slavery and thereby implicitly accepts it. Muhammad and his Companions owned slaves, and some of them acquired slaves through conquests.\n\nThe Quran does forbid slavery, nor does it consider it as a permanent institution. In various verses, it refers to slaves as \"necks\" (\"raqabah\") or \"those whom your right hand possesses\" (\"Ma malakat aymanukum\"). In addition to these terms for slaves, the Quran and early Islamic literature uses \"'Abd\" (male) and \"Amah\" (female) term for an enslaved and servile possession, as well as other terms. According to Brockopp, seven separate terms for slaves appear in the Quran, in at least twenty nine Quranic verses.\n\nThe Quran assigns the same spiritual value to a slave as to a free man, and a believing slave is regarded as superior to a free pagan or idolator. The manumission of slaves is regarded as a meritorious act in the Quran, and is recommended either as an act of charity or as expiation for sins. While the spiritual value of a slave was same as the freeman, states Forough Jahanbakhsh, in regards to earthly matters, a slave was not an equal to the freeman and relegated to an inferior status. In Quran and for its many commentators, states Ennaji, there is a fundamental distinction between free Muslims and slaves, a basic constituent of its social organization, an irreparable dichotomy introduced by the existence of believers and infidels. \n\nThe corpus of hadith attributed to Muhammad or his Companions contains a large store of reports enjoining kindness toward slaves. Chouki El Hamel has argued that the Quran recommends gradual abolition of slavery, and that some hadith are consistent with that message while others contradict it.\n\nAccording to Dror Ze'evi, early Islamic dogma set out to improve conditions of human bondage. It forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (\"dhimmis\") residing under Islamic rule. Islam also allowed the acquisition of lawful non-Muslim slaves who were imprisoned, slaves purchased from lands outside the Islamic state, as well as considered the boys or girls born to slaves as slaves. Islamic law treats a free man and a slave unequally in sentencing for an equivalent crime. For example, traditional Sunni jurisprudence, with the exception of Hanafi law, objects to putting a free man to death for killing a slave. A slave who commits a crime may receive the same punishment as a free man, a punishment half as severe, or the master may be responsible for paying the damages, depending on the crime. According to Ze'evi, Islam considered the master to own the slave's labor, a slave to be his master's property to be sold or bought at will, and that the master was entitled to slave's sexual submission.\n\nThe Islamic law (sharia) allows the taking of infidels (non-Muslims) as slaves, during religious wars also called holy wars or \"jihad\". In the early Islamic communities, according to Kecia Ali, \"both life and law were saturated with slaves and slavery\". War, tribute from vassal states, purchase and children who inherited their parent's slavery were the sources of slaves in Islam. In Islam, according to Paul Lovejoy, \"the religious requirement that new slaves be pagans and need for continued imports to maintain slave population made Africa an important source of slaves for the Islamic world.\" Slavery of non-Muslims, followed by the structured process of converting them to Islam then encouraging the freeing of the converted slave, states Lovejoy helped the growth of Islam after its conquests. \n\nAccording to Mohammed Ennaji, the ownership gave the master a right \"to punish one's slave\". In Islam, a child inherited slavery if he or she was born to a slave mother and slave father. However, if the child was born to a slave mother and her owner master, then the child was free. Slaves could be given as property (dower) during marriage. The text encourages Muslim men to take slave women as sexual partners (concubines), or marry them. Islam, states Lewis, did not permit \"Dhimmis\" (non-Muslims) \"to own Muslim slaves; and if a slave owned by a dhimmi embraced Islam, his owner was legally obliged to free or sell him\". There was also a gradation in the status on the slave, and his descendants, after the slave converted to Islam.\n\nUnder Islamic law, in \"what might be called civil matters\", a slave was \"a chattel with no legal powers or rights whatsoever\", states Lewis. A slave could not own or inherit property or enter into a contract. However, he was better off in terms of rights than Greek or Roman slaves. According to Chirag Ali, the early Muhammadans misinterpreted the Quran as sanctioning \"polygamy, arbitrary divorce, slavery, concubinage and religious wars\", and he states that the Quranic injunctions are against all this. According to Ron Shaham and other scholars, the various jurisprudence systems on Sharia such as Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali and others differ in their interpretation of the Islamic law on slaves.\n\nSlaves were particularly numerous in Muslim armies. Slave armies were deployed by Sultans and Caliphs at various medieval era war fronts across the Islamic Empires, playing an important role in the expansion of Islam in Africa and elsewhere. Slavery of men and women in Islamic states such as the Ottoman Empire, states Ze'evi, continued through the early 20th-century.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, commended Queen Victoria for abolishing the slave trade in a letter written to Her Majesty between 1868-1872. Bahá'u'lláh also forbids slavery in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas written around 1873 considered by Bahá'ís to be the holiest book revealed by Bahá'u'lláh in which he states, \"It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women.\" \n\nBoth the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh owned slaves of African descent before the writing of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. While the Báb purchased several slaves, Bahá'u'lláh acquired his through inheritance and freed them. Bahá'u'lláh officially condemned slavery in 1874. 21st century scholarship has found that the Báb credited one of the slaves of his elders as having raised him and compares him favorably with his own father. Work has continued on other recent finds in archives such as a very early document of Bahá'u'lláh's explaining his emancipating his slave because as all humans are symbolically slaves of God none can be owned by another saying \"How, then, can this thrall claim for himself ownership of any other human being? Nay,….\"\n\nHindu Vedas regard liberation to be the ultimate goal which is contrary to slavery. Hindu Smritis condemn slavery.\n\nThe term \"dasa\" (dāsa) in ancient Hindu text is loosely translated as \"slave.\" However, the meaning of the term varied over time. R. S. Sharma, in his 1958 book, for example, states that the only word which could possibly mean slave in Rigveda is dāsa, and this sense of use is traceable to four later verses in Rigveda. The term dāsa in the Rigveda, has been also been translated as a servant or enemy, and the identity of this term remains unclear and disputed among scholars.\n\nThe word \"dāsi\" is found in Rigveda and Atharvaveda, states R.S. Sharma, which he states represented \"a small servile class of women slaves\". Slavery in Vedic period, according to him, was mostly confined to women employed as domestic workers. He translates \"dasi\" in a Vedic era Upanishad as \"maid-servant\". Male slaves are rarely mentioned in the Vedic texts. The word dāsa occurs in the Hindu Sruti texts Aitareya and Gopatha Brahmanas, but not in the sense of a slave.\n\nTowards the end of the Vedic period (600 BCE), a new system of \"varnas\" had appeared, with people called shudras replacing the erstwhile \"dasas\". Some of the \"shudras\" were employed as labouring masses on farm land, much like \"helots of Sparta\", even though they were not treated with the same degree of coercion and contempt. They could be given away as gifts along with the land, which came in for criticism from the religious texts \"Āśvalāyana\" and \"Kātyāyana\" \"Śrautasūtras\". The term \"dasa\" was now employed to designate such enslaved people. Slavery arose out of debt, sale by parents or oneself (due to famines), judicial decree or fear. The slaves were differentiated by origin and different disabilities and rules for manumission applied. While this could happen to a person of any \"varna\", \"shudras\" were much more likely to be reduced to slavery.\n\nThe Arthashastra laid down norms for the State to resettle \"shudra\" cultivators into new villages and providing them with land, grain, cattle and money. It also stated that \"aryas\" could not be subject to slavery and that the selling or mortgaging of a \"shudra\" was punishable unless he was a born slave.\n\nIn Pali language Buddhist texts, \"Amaya-dasa\" has been translated by Davids and Stede in 1925, as a \"slave by birth\", \"Kila-dasa\" translated as a \"bought slave\", and \"Amata-dasa\" as \"one who sees Amata (Sanskrit: \"Amrita\", nectar of immortality) or Nibbana\". However, \"dasa\" in ancient texts can also mean \"servant\".\n\nWords related to \"dasa\" are found in early Buddhist texts, such as \"dāso na pabbājetabbo\", which Davids and Stede translate as \"the slave cannot become a Bhikkhu\". This restriction on who could become a Buddhist monk is found in Vinaya Pitakam i.93, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikāya, Tibetan \"Bhiksukarmavakya\" and \"Upasampadajnapti\". Schopen states that this translation of \"dasa\" as slave is disputed by scholars.\n\nEarly Buddhist texts in Pali, according to R. S. Sharma, mention \"dāsa\" and \"kammakaras\", and they show that those who failed to pay their debts were enslaved, and Buddhism did not allow debtors and slaves to join their monasteries.\n\nThe Buddhist Emperor Ashoka banned slavery and renounced war.\n\n\n"}

It is a necropolis from the Late Bronze Age. The oldest tombs are from the 14th century BC, the last traces of the use were found from the end of the 13th century, the beginning of the 12th century BC. The settlement, associated with the necropolis, has not been found. Many of the burial offerings were made in the Mycenaean style, so that the Mycenaean cultural circle probably also (see also History and archaeology Pierias) extended over the border of Thessaly to Pieria.\n\nNear the village of Agios Dimitrios, on the border with Thessaly, in 1000 to 1100 meters altitude, on a hillside. The burial site runs from northeast to southwest direction.\n\nIn 1975, the relevant archaeological authority was informed that several tombs (at least 12 to 13) were destroyed when a firebrake was cut. A bronze sword was found then. Further information revealed that trade was operated with the burial objects from this site. 1985 began trial excavations, which were continued in 1986. The excavations brought to light 34 tombs, which were partly destroyed and plundered. A part of the stolen goods was later found in the storehouse of the Archaeological Museum in Dion. In 1985, some of the stone slabs that covered the tombs were stolen by unknown culprits. A part of the slope was brought to a drop by heavy snowfalls. In the years 1987 and 1988 the slope was terraced and stabilized by a wooden construction. Near the excavation site Spathes, 1987 more tombs were discovered, presumably from the same epoch. Six stone seals were recovered from them, further excavations were not held.\n\nAs in this region of Greece, at the end of the Bronze Age, the deceased were usually buried in box-shaped tombs. The type of these tombs is known from southern Greece. The length of the tombs is approximately 2.40 meters, the width 1.50 meters and the depth between one and 2.50 meters. The bottom of the tombs was covered with a 10 to 20 centimeter high clay layer, the side walls were framed with stone slabs. The graves were intact except for penetrating roots and natural deposits of the building materials. The number of buried persons found in the intact tombs is 52. It is unusual that in each of the tombs several people were buried, presumably they were family tombs. They were buried next to each other, partly also upon one another; In addition to the skeletons of adults, the remains of children were also found.\n\nIn addition to weapons and jewelry, the deceased was mainly given pottery. However, some of them were broken by the kind of burial of several people within the same tomb. The vessels were partly handmade, partly they were modeled with a potter's wheel. The most important finds were made in a tomb, in which apparently high ranking personalities were buried. Two skeletons, one male and one female, found themselves alongside rich burial gifts. Remnants of a spear, a bronze sword, painted and unpainted vases and perfume bottles, jewelry and stone seals (partly with animal motifs) were discovered. The sword is somewhat smaller, but resembles in the kind of swords found in Mycenae and Crete (Knossos, Heraklion). A bronze sword found in another tomb is of the same making as swords discovered in Athens, Crete, Kos and other locations. Recently, excavations on the southeast side of Olympus, to the west of Platamonas, have revealed an identical sword.\n\n"}

The Superior General usually holds supreme executive authority in the religious order, while the general chapter has legislative authority.\n\nThe figure of Superior General first emerged in the thirteenth century with the development of the centralized government of the Mendicant Orders. The Friars Minor (Franciscans) organized their community under a Minister General, and the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) appointed a Master General.\n\nDue to restrictions on women religious, especially the obligation of cloister for nuns, congregations of women were not initially able to organize with their own Superior General. In 1609, Mary Ward was the superior general of a religious institute that imitated the Jesuit model, but the institute was not accepted by the Roman Curia. It was in the nineteenth century that religious congregations of women were able to organize with a General Superior and the role is now very common. Mother Teresa, for example, was the Mother General of the Missionaries of Charity.\n\nIn canon law, the generic term Supreme Moderator is used instead of Superior General. Many orders and congregations use their own title for the person who holds this position. Some examples are: \n\nIn many cases there is an intermediate level between the Superior General and the superior of the individual monasteries or of equivalent communities, often named the provincial superior.\n\n\n"}

In 2005 Robert Entenmann, Ph.D., of St. Olaf College wrote that the book is \"certainly the most widely read book on the Hmong experience in America.\"\n\nOn the most basic level, the book tells the story of the family's second youngest and favored daughter, Lia Lee, who was diagnosed with a severe form of epilepsy named Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and the culture conflict that obstructs her treatment.\n\nThrough miscommunications about medical dosages and parental refusal to give certain medicines due to mistrust, misunderstandings, and behavioral side effects, and the inability of the doctors to develop more empathy with the traditional Hmong lifestyle or try to learn more about the Hmong culture, Lia's condition worsens. The dichotomy between the Hmong's perceived spiritual factors and the Americans' perceived scientific factors comprises the overall theme of the book.\n\nThe book is written in a unique style, with every other chapter returning to Lia's story and the chapters in-between discussing broader themes of Hmong culture, customs, and history; American involvement in and responsibility for the war in Laos; and the many problems of immigration, especially assimilation and discrimination. While particularly sympathetic to the Hmong, Fadiman presents the situation from the perspectives of both the doctors and the family. An example of medical anthropology, the book has been cited by medical journals and lecturers as an argument for greater cultural competence, and often assigned to medical, pharmaceutic, and anthropological students in the US. In 1997, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction.\n\nLia Lee (Romanized Popular Alphabet: Liab Lis, July 19, 1982 – August 31, 2012. She was born in Merced, CA, and she was a Hmong child. She had seizures due to \"Lennox-Gastaut\" syndrome, a severe form of \"epilepsy\".\n\nAnne Fadiman: She is an author and narrator of ‘The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down’. She wrote about her experience with Lia and her family. Through this experience, she learned the importance of understanding about diversity of culture between doctor, patient, and family.\n\nNeil Ernst and Peggy Philp: They are Lia’s doctors at MCMC. There is conflict between them and Lia's parents because of Hmong shamanism culture versus western medicine. This leads to great misunderstandings between each other.\n\nFoua Yang and Nao Kao Lee: They are Lia’s parents, and they love Lia very much. They only believe in their traditional approach to medical treatment, with a strong influence from shamanism.\n\nJeanine Hilt: A social worker who makes Lia her personal cause. She fights against the medical establishment on Lia’s behalf and cares for the Hmong as a significant culture.\n\nLia experienced her first seizure at three months of age, but a resident at Merced Community Medical Center misdiagnosed her condition, and the hospital was unable to communicate with her parents since the hospital had no Hmong interpreters. Anne Fadiman wrote that Lia's parents did not give her medication as it was prescribed because they believed that Lia Lee's state showed a sense of spiritual giftedness, and they did not want to take that away. The American doctors did not understand the Hmong traditional remedies that the Lee family used. The doctors treating Lia Lee, Neil and Peggy Ernst, had her removed from her home when she was almost three years of age, and placed into foster care for one year, causing friction with her parents. By age 4½ Lia Lee had been admitted to hospital care 17 times and had made over 100 outpatient visits.\n\nThe worst seizure Lia had put her onto the verge of death. She went to the emergency room and Dr. Neil Ernst could not do anything. He talked to Lia's parents about transferring her to Fresno, California because Lia would need further treatment that Dr. Ernst could not provide. Lia's parents \". . . believed their daughter was transferred not because of her critical condition but because of the Ernst's vacation plans\".\nLia Lee slipped into a coma after suffering from a grand mal seizure in 1986, when she was four years of age. Lia Lee's doctors believed she would die, but Lia Lee remained alive but with no higher brain functions.\n\nFadiman's sources for information about the history of the Hmong include \"\" by Keith Quincy. She stated \"Were I citing the source of each detail, Quincy's name would attach itself to nearly every sentence in the pages on the Hmong in China.\" Fadiman's book cited the Quincy theory that the Hmong people originated from Siberia. Entenmann wrote that because of the reliance on Quincy's book, Fadiman's book propagates the idea that Sonom was a Hmong king, a concept that Entenmann says is inaccurate.\n\nMarilyn Mochel, a nurse and clinical educator at Sutter Merced Medical Center (now Mercy Medical Center Merced), who heads the hospital's cross-cultural program, said in 1999 that \"The book has allowed more dialogue. There's certainly more awareness and dialogue than before. Both sides are teachers and learners.\"\n\nLia Lee lived in a persistent vegetative state for 26 years. She died in Sacramento, California, on August 31, 2012 at the age of 30. At that age she weighed and was tall; many children with severe brain damage have limited growth as they age. Outside of the State of California Lia Lee's death was not widely reported. Fadiman said that pneumonia was the immediate cause of death. Margalit Fox of \"The New York Times\" said \"[b]ut Lia’s underlying medical issues were more complex still\" because she had lived in a persistent vegetative state for such a long period of time. As of 2012 most individuals who go into that state die three to five years afterwards.\n\nRalph Jennings of \"The Modesto Bee\" said \"Hmong, including some among the 2,000 in Modesto, say the book typified conflicts between their culture and American institutions. But some say it didn't capture the complexity of the Hmong culture.\"\n\nCheng Lee, a brother of Lia Lee, said that his father and mother liked Fadiman's book.\n\n“Compellingly written, from the heart and from the trenches. I couldn’t wait to finish it, then reread it and ponder it again. It is a powerful case study of a medical tragedy.” - David H.

The blockbuster has provoked vigorous discussion of a wide variety of cultural, social, political, and religious themes identified by critics and commentators, and the film's writer and director James Cameron has responded that he hoped to create an emotional reaction and to provoke public conversation about these topics. The broad range of \"Avatar\"s intentional or perceived themes has prompted reviewers to call it \"an all-purpose allegory\" and \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\". One reporter even suggested that the politically charged punditry has been \"misplaced\": reviewers should have seized on the opportunity to take \"a break from their usual fodder of public policy and foreign relations\" rather than making an ideological battlefield of this \"popcorn epic\".\n\nDiscussion has centered on such themes as the conflict between modern human and nature, and the film's treatment of imperialism, racism, militarism and patriotism, corporate greed, property rights, spirituality and religion. Commentators have debated whether the film's treatment of the human aggression against the native Na'vi is a message of support for indigenous peoples today, or is, instead, a tired retelling of the racist myth of the noble savage. Right-wing critics accused Cameron of pushing an anti-American message in the film's depiction of a private military contractor that used ex-Marines to attack the natives, while Cameron and others argued that it is pro-American to question the propriety of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The visual similarity between the destruction of the World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na'vi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists. Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today.\n\nMuch discussion has concerned the film's treatment of environmental protection and the parallels to, for example, the destruction of rainforests, mountaintop removal for mining and evictions from homes for development. The title of the film and various visual and story elements provoked discussion of the film's use of Hindu iconography, which Cameron confirmed had inspired him. Christians, including the Vatican, worried that the film promotes pantheism over Christian beliefs, while others instead thought that it sympathetically explores biblical concepts. Other critics either praised the film's spiritual elements or found them hackneyed.\n\n\"Avatar\" describes the conflict by an indigenous people, the Na'vi of Pandora, against the oppression of alien humans. Director James Cameron acknowledged that the film is \"certainly about imperialism in the sense that the way human history has always worked is that people with more military or technological might tend to supplant or destroy people who are weaker, usually for their resources.\" Critics agreed that the film is \"a clear message about dominant, aggressive cultures subjugating a native population in a quest for resources or riches.\" George Monbiot, writing in \"The Guardian\", asserted that conservative criticism of \"Avatar\" is a reaction to what he called the film's \"chilling metaphor\" for the European \"genocides in the Americas\", which \"massively enriched\" Europe. Cameron told \"National Public Radio\" that references to the colonial period are in the film \"by design\". Adam Cohen of \"The New York Times\" compared the struggle of the Na'vi with \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the British Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit.\"\nSaritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for \"The Tennessean\", wrote about the parallels between the plot and how \"Western power colonizes and invades the indigenous people (native Americans, Eastern countries, you substitute the names), sees the natives as primitives/savages/uncivilized, is unable or unwilling to see the merits in a civilization that has been around longer, loots the weaker power, all while thinking it is doing a favor to the poor natives.\" David Brooks, in \"The New York Times\", criticized what he saw as the \"White Messiah complex\" in the film, whereby the Na'vi \"can either have their history shaped by cruel imperialists or benevolent ones, but either way, they are going to be supporting actors in our journey to self-admiration.\" Others disagree: \"First off, [Jake is] handicapped. Second off, he ultimately becomes one of [the Na'vi] and wins their way.\"\n\nMany commentators saw the film as a message of support for the struggles of native peoples today. Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, praised \"Avatar\" for its \"profound show of resistance to capitalism and the struggle for the defense of nature\". Others compared the human invaders with \"NATO in Iraq or Israel in Palestine\", and considered it reassuring that \"when the Na'vi clans are united, and a sincere prayer is offered, the ... 'primitive savages' win the war.\" Palestinian activists painted themselves blue and dressed like the Na'vi during their weekly protest in the village of Bilin against Israel's separation barrier. Other Arab writers, however, noted that \"for Palestinians, \"Avatar\" is rather a reaffirmation and confirmation of the claims about their incapability to lead themselves and build their own future.\" \"Forbes\" columnist Reihan Salam criticized the vilification of capitalism in the film, asserting that it represents a more noble and heroic way of life than that led by the Na'vi, because it \"give[s] everyone an opportunity to learn, discover, and explore, and to change the world around us.\" Si Sheppard on the other hand praised the film for drawing parallels between the corporate imperialism of the fictional RDA and its historical equivalents of the pre-industrial era (specifically the East India Company, which maintained its own private army in order to impose profit-driven territorial sovereignty at the expense of indigenous peoples).\n\nCameron stated that \"Avatar\" is \"very much a political film\" and added: \"This movie reflects that we are living through war. There are boots on the ground, troops who I personally believe were sent there under false pretenses, so I hope this will be part of opening our eyes.\" He confirmed that \"the Iraq stuff and the Vietnam stuff is there by design\", adding that he did not think that the film was anti-military. Critic Charles Marowitz in \"Swans\" magazine remarked, however, that the realism of the suggested parallel with wars in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan \"doesn't quite jell\" because the natives are \"peace-loving and empathetic\".\n\nCameron said that Americans have a \"moral responsibility\" to understand the impact of their country's recent military campaigns. Commenting on the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\" Christian Hamaker of \"Crosswalk.com\" noted that, \"in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains ... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men.\" A columnist in the Russian newspaper \"Vedomosti\" traced \"Avatar\"'s popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve \"us the scoundrels\" of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of \"New York Press\" dismissed the film as \"essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message\" that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the \"Los Angeles Times\" asserted that \"if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal.\" Other reviews saw \"Avatar\" as \"the bubbling up of our military subconscious ... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast.\"\n\nA critic writing in \"Le Monde\" opined that, contrary to the perceived pacifism of \"Avatar\", the film justifies war in the response to attack by the film's positive characters, particularly the American hero who encourages the Na'vi to \"follow him into battle. ... Every war, even those that seem the most insane [are justified as being] for the 'right reasons'.\" Ann Marlowe of \"Forbes\" saw the film as both pro- and anti-military, \"a metaphor for the networked military\".\n\nMany reviewers perceived an anti-American message in the film, equating RDA's private security force to American soldiers. Commentator Glenn Beck on his radio show said that \"Avatar\" was \"an anti‑U.S. human thing\". Russell D. Moore in \"The Christian Post\" stated that, \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects\" and criticized Cameron for what he saw as an unnuanced depiction of the American military as \"pure evil\". John Podhoretz of \"The Weekly Standard\" argued that \"Avatar\" revealed \"hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool.\" Charles Mudede of \"The Stranger\" commented that with the release of the film \"the American culture industry exports an anti-American spectacle to an anti-American world.\" Debbie Schlussel likewise dismissed \"Avatar\" as \"cinema for the hate America crowd\".\n\nCameron argued that \"the film is definitely not anti-American\" and that \"part of being an American is having the freedom to have dissenting ideas.\" Eric Ditzian of MTV concurred that \"it'd take a great leap of logic to tag 'Avatar' as anti-American or anti-capitalist.\" Ann Marlowe called the film \"the most neo-con movie ever made\" for its \"deeply conservative, pro-American message\". But Cameron admitted to some ambiguity on the issue, agreeing that \"the bad guys could be America in this movie, or the good guys could be America in this movie, depending on your perspective\", and stated that \"Avatar\"'s defeat at the Academy Awards might have been due to the perceived anti-U.S. theme in it.\n\nThe destruction of the Na'vi habitat Hometree reminded commentators of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, and other commentator criticized Cameron for his \"audacious willingness to question the sacred trauma of 9/11\". Cameron said that he was \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\", but added that he did not think that it was necessarily a bad thing. A French critic wrote: \"How can one not see the analogy with the collapse of the towers of the World Trade Center? Then, after that spectacular scene, all is justified [for the unified] indigenous peoples (the allied forces) ... to kill those who [are] just like terrorists.\" Another writer noted that \"the U.S.' stand-ins are the perpetrators, and not the victims\" and described this reversal as \"the movie’s most seditious act\".\n\nCommentators around the world sought to interpret the relationship between the Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the \"Hindustan Times\" and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\": \"The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutal—traits only amplified by their machinery—while the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the \"Avatar\" hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews.\" Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, would find that the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying \"the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature.\" Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in \"The Miami Herald\" urged \"every man, woman and child\" to see the film and wake up to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is \"steamrolling our soul and consciousness\", and reconnection with all life as \"the only ... promise of survival\" for humanity. Similarly, an Angolan critic saw the film as a message of hope, writing, \"With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe: the respect for life.\" Cameron confirmed that \"the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature.\"\n\nConversely, David Brooks of \"The New York Times\" opined that \"Avatar\" creates \"a sort of two-edged cultural imperialism\", an offensive cultural stereotype that white people are rationalist and technocratic while colonial victims are spiritual and athletic and that illiteracy is the path to grace. A review in the \"Irish Independent\" found the film to contrast a \"mix of New Age environmentalism and the myth of the Noble Savage\" with the corruption of the \"civilized\" white man. Reihan Salam, writing in \"Forbes\", viewed it as ironic that \"Cameron has made a dazzling, gorgeous indictment of the kind of society that produces James Camerons.\"\nMany critics saw racist undertones in the film's treatment of the indigenous Na'vi, seeing it as \"a fantasy about race told from the point of view of white people\", which reinforces \"the White Messiah fable\", in which the white hero saves helpless primitive natives, who are thus reduced to servicing his ambitions and proving his heroism. Other reviews called \"Avatar\" an offensive assumption that nonwhites need the White Messiah to lead their crusades, and \"a self-loathing racist screed\" due to the fact that all the \"human\" roles in the film are played by white actors and all the Na'vi characters by African-American or Native American actors.\n\nMāori academic Rawiri Taonui agreed that the film portrays indigenous people as being simplistic and unable to defend themselves without the help from \"the white guys and the neo-liberals.\" Another author remarked that while the white man will fix the destruction, he will never feel guilty, even though he is directly responsible for the destruction.\" Likewise, Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of \"Die Zeit\" in Germany, said the film perpetuates the myth of the \"noble savage\" and has \"a condescending, yes, even racist message. Cameron bows to the noble savages. However, he reduces them to dependents.\" Slavoj Žižek argued that \"the film enables us to practise a typical ideological division: sympathising with the idealised aborigines while rejecting their actual struggle.\" The \"Irish Times\" carried the comment that \"despite all the thematic elements from Hinduism, one thing truly original is the good old American ego. Given its Hollywood origins, the script has remained faithful to the inherent superiority complex, and has predictably bestowed the honor of the 'avatar' not on the movie’s native Na’vis, but on a white American marine.\" Similarly, positing that \"the only good humans [in the film] are dead—or rather, resurrected as 'good Navi'\", a writer in \"The Jerusalem Post\" thought that the film was inadvertently promoting supremacy of one race over another.\n\nOn the \"Charlie Rose\" talk show, Cameron acknowledged parallels with idea of the \"noble savage\", but argued: \"When indigenous populations who are at a bow and arrow level are met with technological superior forces, [if] somebody doesn't help them, they lose. So we are not talking about a racial group within an existing population fighting for their rights.\" Cameron rejected claims that the film is racist, asserting that \"Avatar\" is about respecting others' differences. Adam Cohen of \"The New York Times\" felt similarly, writing that the Na'vi greeting \"I see you\" contrasts with the oppression of, and even genocide against, those who we fail to accept for what they are, citing Jewish ghettos and the Soviet gulags as examples.\n\n\"Avatar\" has been called \"without a doubt the most epic piece of environmental advocacy ever captured on celluloid... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests that are trying to destroy it all.\" Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned \"Avatar\" as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. He said that he created Pandora as \"a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have.\" He told Charlie Rose that \"we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature.\" Interviewed by Terry Gross of \"National Public Radio\", he called \"Avatar\" a satire on the sense of human entitlement: \"[\"Avatar\"] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back.\" An article in the Belgium paper \"De Standaard\" agreed: \"It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his.\"\n\nCommentators connected the film's story to the endangerment of biodiversity in the Amazon rainforests of Brazil by dam construction, logging, mining, and clearing for agriculture. A \"Newsweek\" piece commented on the destruction of Home Tree as resembling the rampant tree-felling in Tibet, while another article compared the film's depiction of destructive corporate mining for unobtanium in the Na'vi lands with the mining and milling of uranium near the Navajo reservation in New Mexico. Other critics, however, dismissed \"Avatar\"'s pro-environmental stance as inconsistent. Armond White remarked that, \"Cameron’s really into the powie-zowie factor: destructive combat and the deployment of technological force. ... Cameron fashionably denounces the same economic and military system that make his technological extravaganza possible. It’s like condemning NASA—yet joyriding on the Mars Exploration Rover.\" Similarly, an article in \"National Review\" concluded that by resorting to technology for educating viewers of the technology endangered world of Pandora, the film \"showcases the contradictions of organic liberalism.\"\n\nStating that such a conservative criticism of his film's \"strong environmental anti-war themes\" was not unexpected, Cameron stressed that he was \"interested in saving the world that my children are going to inhabit\", encouraged everyone to be a \"tree hugger\", and urged that we \"make a fairly rapid transition to alternate energy.\" The film and Cameron's environmental activism caught the attention of the 8,000-strong Dongria Kondh tribe from Orissa, eastern India. They appealed to him to help them stop a mining company from opening a bauxite open-cast mine, on their sacred Niyamgiri mountain, in an advertisement in \"Variety\" that read: \"\"Avatar\" is fantasy ... and real. The Dongria Kondh ... are struggling to defend their land against a mining company hell-bent on destroying their sacred mountain. Please help...\" Similarly, a coalition of over fifty environmental and aboriginal organizations of Canada ran a full-page ad in the special Oscar edition of \"Variety\" likening their fight against Canada's Alberta oilsands to the Na'vi insurgence, —a comparison the mining and oil companies objected to. Cameron was awarded the inaugural Temecula Environment Award for Outstanding Social Responsibility in Media by three environmentalist groups for portrayal of environmental struggles that they compared with their own.\n\nThe destruction of the Na'vi habitat to make way for mining operations has also evoked parallels with the oppressive policies of some states often involving forcible evictions related to development. David Boaz of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in \"Los Angeles Times\" that the film's essential conflict is a battle over property rights, \"the foundation of the free market and indeed of civilization.\" Melinda Liu found this storyline reminiscent of the policies of the authorities in China, where 30 million citizens have been evicted in the course of a three-decade long development boom. An article in the \"Global Times\", published by the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper \"People's Daily\", called the film's plot \"the spitting image of the violent demolition in our everyday life. ... [F]acing the violent demolition conducted by chengguan but instigated by real estate developers, some ordinary people have wept or burned themselves desperately, while most continue to bear unfairness in silence.\" Others saw similar links to the displacement of tribes in the Amazon basin and the forcible demolition of private houses in a Moscow suburb.\n\nDavid Quinn of the \"Irish Independent\" wrote that the spirituality depicted \"goes some way towards explaining the film's gigantic popularity, and that is the fact that \"Avatar\" is essentially a religious film, even if Cameron might not have intended it as such.\" At the same time, Jonah Goldberg of \"National Review Online\" objected to what he saw in the film reviews as \"the norm to speak glowingly of spirituality but derisively of traditional religion.\"\n\nJames Cameron has said that he \"tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum.\" He also stated that one of the film's philosophical underpinnings is that \"the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences.\" Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: \"Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone.\"\n\nReviewers suggested that the film draws upon many existing religious and mythological motifs. Vern Barnet of the \"Charlotte Observer\" opined that \"Avatar\" poses a great question of faith—should the creation be seen and governed hierarchically, from above, or ecologically, through mutual interdependence? He also noted that the film borrows concepts from other religions and compared its Tree of Souls with the Norse story of the tree Yggdrasil, also called axis mundi or the center of the world, whose destruction signals the collapse of the universe. Malinda Liu in \"Newsweek\" likened the Na'vi respect for life and belief in reincarnation with Tibetan religious beliefs and practices, but Reihan Salam of \"Forbes\" called the species \"perhaps the most sanctimonious humanoids ever portrayed on film.\"\n\nA Bolivian writer defined \"avatar\" as \"something born without human intervention, without intercourse, without sin\", comparing it to the birth of Jesus Christ, Krishna, Manco Capac, and Mama Ocllo and drew parallels between the deity Eywa of Pandora and the goddess Pachamama worshiped by the indigenous people of the Andes. Others suggested that the world of Pandora mirrored the Garden of Eden, and reminded that in Hebrew Na'vi is the singular of \"Nevi'im\" which means \"Prophets\". A writer for \"Religion Dispatches\" countered that \"Avatar\" \"begs, borrows, and steals from a variety of longstanding human stories, puts them through the grinder, and comes up with something new.\" Another commentator called \"Avatar\" \"a new version of the Garden of Eden syndrome\" pointing to what she viewed as phonetic and conceptual similarities of the film's terminology with that of the Book of Genesis.\n\n\"The Times of India\" suggested \"Avatar\" was a treatise on Indianism \"for Indophiles and Indian philosophy enthusiasts\", starting from the very word \"Avatar\" itself. A \"Houston Chronicle\" piece critiqued the film in terms of the ancient Hindu epics \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", commenting on the Na'vi visual similarity with Rama and Krishna—avatars central to the respective epics and traditionally depicted with blue skin, black hair, and a tilak mark on the forehead. Another critic found that elements of the film's plot resembled such teachings and concepts of Hinduism as reincarnation of the soul, ecological consciousness, and incarnations of deities on Earth, commending \"Avatar\" and its director for \"raising the global stature of Hinduism ... in months\", while criticizing them for substantiating the western reluctance to accept anything oriental in its pristine form.\n\nCameron calls the connection a \"subconscious\" reference: \"I have just loved ... the mythology, the entire Hindu pantheon, seems so rich and vivid.\" He continued, \"I didn't want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, and I hope I haven't offended anyone in doing so.\" He has stated that he was familiar with a lot of beliefs of the Hindu religion and found it \"quite fascinating\".\n\nAnswering a question from \"Time\" magazine in 2007, \"What is an \"Avatar\" anyway?\" James Cameron replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\" In 2010, Cameron confirmed the meaning of the title to the \"Times of India\": \"Of course, that was the significance in the film, although the characters are not divine beings. But the idea was that they take flesh in another body.\"\n\nFollowing the film's release, reviewers focused on Cameron's choice of the religious Sanskrit term for the film's title. A reviewer in the \"Irish Times\" traced the term to the ten incarnations of Vishnu. Another writer for \"The Hindu\" concluded that by using the \"loaded Sanskrit word\" Cameron indicated the possibility that an encounter with an emotionally superior—but technologically inferior—form of alien may in the future become a next step in human evolution—provided we will learn to integrate and change, rather than conquer and destroy.\nMaxim Osipov of ISKCON argued in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" that \"Avatar\" is a \"downright misnomer\" for the film because \"the movie reverses the very concept [that] the term 'avatar'—literally, in Sanskrit, 'descent'—is based on. So much for a descending 'avatar', Jake becomes a refugee among the aborigines.\" Vern Barnet in \"Charlotte Observer\" likewise thought that the title insults traditional Hindu usage of the term since it is a human, not a god, who descends in the film. However, Rishi Bhutada, Houston coordinator of the Hindu American Foundation, stated that while there are certain sacred terms that would offend Hindus if used improperly, 'avatar' is not one of them. Texas-based filmmaker Ashok Rao added that 'avatar' does not always mean a representative of God on Earth, but simply one being in another form—especially in literature, moviemaking, poetry and other forms of art.\n\nExplaining the choice of the color blue for the Na'vi, Cameron said \"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities, which I like conceptually.\" Commentators agreed that the blue skin of the Na'vi, described in a \"New Yorker\" article as \"Vishnu-blue\", \"instantly and metaphorically\" relates the film's protagonist to such avatars of Vishnu as Rama and Krishna. An article in the \"San Francisco Examiner\" described an 18th-century Indian painting of Vishnu and his consort Laksmi riding the great mythical bird Garuda as \"\"Avatar\" prequel\" due to its resemblance with the film's scene in which the hero's blue-skinned avatar flies a gigantic raptor. Asra Q. Nomani of \"The Daily Beast\" likened the hero and his Na'vi mate Neytiri to images of Shiva and Durga.\nDiscussing explicit or implicit similarities between the film and the philosophy of Hinduism, reviewers suggested that, just as Hindu gods, particularly Vishnu, become avatars to save the order of the universe, the film’s avatar must descend to avert impending ultimate doom, effected by a rapacious greed that leads to destroying the world of nature and other civilizations. Maxim Osipov observed that the film's philosophical message was consistent overall with the \"Bhagavad Gita\", a key scripture of Hinduism, in defining what constitutes real culture and civilization.\n\nCritics saw an \"undeniably\" Hindu connection between the film's story and the Vedic teaching of reverence for the whole universe, as well as the yogic practice of inhabiting a distant body by one’s consciousness and compared the film's love scene to tantric practices. Another linked the Na'vi earth goddess Eywa to the concept of Brahman as the ground of being described in Vedanta and Upanishads and likened the Na'vi ability to connect to Eywa with the realization of Atman. One commentator noted the parallel between the Na'vi greeting \"I see you\" and the ancient Hindu greeting \"Namaste\", which signifies perceiving and adoring the divinity within others. Others commented on \"Avatar\"'s adaptation of the Hindu teaching of reincarnation,—a concept, which another author felt was more accurately applicable to ordinary human beings that are \"a step or two away from exotic animals\" than to deities.\n\nWriting for the Ukrainian \"Day\" newspaper, Maxim Chaikovsky drew detailed analogies between \"Avatar\"'s plot and elements of the ancient Bhagavata Purana narrative of Krishna, including the heroine Radha, the Vraja tribe and their habitat the Vrindavana forest, the hovering Govardhan mountain, and the mystical rock chintamani. He also opined that this resemblance may account for \"Avatar blues\"—a sense of loss experienced by members of the audience at the conclusion of the film.\n\nSome Christian writers worried that \"Avatar\" promotes pantheism and nature worship. A critic for \"L’Osservatore Romano\" of the Holy See wrote that the film \"shows a spiritualism linked to the worship of nature, a fashionable pantheism in which creator and creation are mixed up.\" Likewise, \"Vatican Radio\" argued that the film \"cleverly winks at all those pseudo-doctrines that turn ecology into the religion of the millennium. Nature is no longer a creation to defend, but a divinity to worship.\" According to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, these reviews reflect the Pope's views on neopaganism, or confusing nature and spirituality. On the other hand, disagreeing with the Vatican's characterization of \"Avatar\" as pagan, a writer in the \"National Catholic Reporter\" urged Christian critics to see the film in the historical context of \"Christianity's complicity in the conquest of the Americas\" instead.\n\nRoss Douthat, a conservative columnist of \"The New York Times\", called \"Avatar\" \"the Gospel According to James\" and \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [which] has been Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now.\" Replying to him, Jay Michaelson of the \"HuffPost\" wrote \"The Meaning of Avatar: Everything is God (A Response to Ross Douthat and other naysayers of ‘pantheism’)\". In \"The Weekly Standard\", John Podhoretz criticized the film's \"mindless worship of a nature-loving tribe and the tribe's adorable pagan rituals.\" Christian critic David Outten disputed that \"the danger to moviegoers is that \"Avatar\" presents the Na'vi culture on Pandora as morally superior to life on Earth. If you love the philosophy and culture of the Na'vi too much, you will be led into evil rather than away from it.\" Outten further added: \"Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in \"Avatar\". He created a world where it looks good and noble to live in a tree and hunt for your food daily with a bow and arrow. ... Cameron said, \"'Avatar\" asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth.' This is a clear statement of religious belief. This is pantheism. It is not Christianity.\"\n\nOther Christian critics wrote that \"Avatar\" has \"an abhorrent New Age, pagan, anti-capitalist worldview that promotes goddess worship and the destruction of the human race\" and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of Jesus Christ as \"the True Avatar\". Some of them also suspected \"Avatar\" of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus, by which Cameron \"invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites.\" Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero \"does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally\" and, unlike in pantheism, \"the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs.\" Ann Marlowe of \"Forbes\" agreed, saying that \"though \"Avatar\" has been charged with \"pantheism\", its mythos is just as deeply Christian.\" Another author suggested that the film's message \"leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world—a very Christian teaching.\" Saritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for \"The Tennessean\", saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: \"What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as Einstein said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature. What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, kumbaya vibe as is often depicted. No wonder many Americans are turned off.\" Prabhu also criticized Hollywood and Western media for what she saw as their generally poor job of portraying Eastern spirituality.\n\n"}
{"id": "146203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146203", "title": "Tonsure", "text": "Tonsure\n\nTonsure () is the practice of cutting or shaving some or all of the hair on the scalp, as a sign of religious devotion or humility. The term originates from the Latin word \"\" (meaning \"clipping\" or \"shearing\") and referred to a specific practice in medieval Catholicism, abandoned by papal order in 1972. Tonsure can also refer to the secular practice of shaving all or part of the scalp to show support or sympathy, or to designate mourning. Current usage more generally refers to cutting or shaving for monks, devotees, or mystics of any religion as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem.\n\nTonsure is still a traditional practice in Catholicism by specific religious orders (with papal permission). It is also commonly used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for newly baptized members and is frequently used for Buddhist novices and monks. It exists as a traditional practice in Islam after completion of the \"Hajj\" and is also practiced by a number of Hindu religious orders.\n\nTonsure is usually the part of three rites of passages in the life of the individual in Hinduism. The first is called Chudakarana (IAST: Cūḍākaraṇa, Sanskrit: चूडाकरण; literally, \"rite of tonsure\"), also known as \"choulam\", \"caula\", \"chudakarma\", or \"mundana\", marks the child's first haircut, typically the shaving of the head. The mother dresses up, sometimes in her wedding sari, and with the father present, the baby's head is shaved and nails trimmed, washed and dressed in new clothes. Sometimes, a tuft of hair is left to cover the soft spot near the top of the baby's head. Both boys and girls typically go through this ceremony, sometimes near a temple or a river, but it is not mandatory in Hinduism.\n\nThe significance of Chudakarana rite of passage is the baby's cyclical step to hygiene and cleanliness. The ritual is typically done about the first birthday, but some texts recommend that it be completed before the third or the seventh year. Sometimes, this ritual is combined with the rite of passage of Upanayana, initiation to formal schooling.\n\nThe second rite of passage in Hinduism that sometimes involves tonsure is at the Upanayana, the \"sanskara\" marking a child's entry into school.\n\nAnother rite of passage where tonsure is practiced by Hindus is after the death and completing the last rites of an immediate family member, that is father, mother, brother, sister, spouse or child. This ritual is regionally found in India among male mourners, who shave their heads as a sign of bereavement. Until a few decades ago, many Hindu communities, especially the upper castes, forced widows to undergo the ritual of tonsure and shun good clothes and ornaments, in order to make them unattractive to men.\n\nAccording to Jamanadas, tonsure was originally a Buddhist custom and was adopted by Hinduism. However, Pandey and others trace the practice to Sanskrit texts dated to have been composed before the birth of Buddha, which mention tonsure as a rite of passage.\n\nIn Buddhism, tonsure is a part of the rite of \"pabbajja\" and also a part of becoming a monk (Skt. \"Bhikshu\") or nun (Skt. \"Bhikshuni\"). This involves shaving head and face. This tonsure is renewed as often as required to keep the head cleanly shaven.\n\nThe purification process of the \"metzora\" (one afflicted with \"tzaraath\") involved the ritual shaving on the \"metzorah's\" entire body except for the afflicted locations.\n\nAnd as the term tonsure may be used as a broad description for such hair styling of devotees as a ritual symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem, Orthodox Jewish males do not shave the corners of their beards or scalps with straight blades, as described in Leviticus 19:27.\n\nTonsure was not widely known in antiquity. Tradition states that it originated with the disciples of Jesus, who observed the Torah command not to shave the hair around the sides of one's head (Leviticus 19:27). There were three forms of tonsure known in the 7th and 8th centuries:\n\n\nSt. Germanus I, Patriarch of Constantinople from 715 to 730, writes \"The double crown inscribed on the head of the priest through tonsure represents the precious head of the chief-apostle Peter. When he was sent out in the teaching and preaching of the Lord, his head was shaved by those who did not believe his word, as if in mockery. The Teacher Christ blessed this head, changed dishonor into honor, ridicule into praise. He placed on it a crown made not out of precious stones, but one which shines more than gold, topaz, or precious stone – with the stone and rock of faith. In the Eastern Orthodox Church today, priests, deacons, readers, and other tonsured offices do not have their heads shaved. Rather, four locks of hair are clipped from the top of the head in the shape of a cross to mark their obedience to the Church.\n\nSt. Germanus I writes \"The total tonsuring of the head is in imitation of the holy Apostle James, brother of the Lord, and the Apostle Paul, and of the rest.\"\n\nIn the Latin or Western Rite of the Catholic Church, \"first tonsure\" was, in medieval times, and generally through 1972, the rite of inducting someone into the clergy and qualifying him for the civil benefits once enjoyed by clerics. Tonsure was a prerequisite for receiving the minor and major orders. Failing to maintain tonsure was the equivalent of attempting to abandon one's clerical state, and in the 1917 Code of Canon Law, any cleric in minor orders (or simply tonsured) who did not resume the tonsure within a month after being warned by his Ordinary, lost the clerical state. Over time, the appearance of tonsure varied, ending up for non-monastic clergy as generally consisting of a symbolic cutting of a few tufts of hair at first tonsure in the Sign of the Cross and in wearing a bare spot on the back of the head which varied according to the degree of orders. It was not supposed to be less than the size of a communicant's host, even for a tonsuratus, someone simply tonsured, and the approximate size for a priest's tonsure was the size of a priest's host. Countries that were not Catholic had exceptions to this rule, especially in the English-speaking world. In England and America, for example, the bare spot was dispensed with, likely because of the persecutions that could arise from being a part of the Catholic clergy, but the ceremonious cutting of the hair in the first clerical tonsure was always required. In accordance with Pope Paul VI's \"motu proprio\" \"Ministeria quaedam\" of 15 August 1972, \"first tonsure is no longer conferred\".\n\nApart from this general clerical tonsure, some Western Rite monastic orders, for example Carthusians and Trappists, employed a very full version of tonsure, shaving the head entirely bald and keeping only a narrow ring of short hair, sometimes called \"the monastic crown\" (see \"Roman tonsure\", above), from the time of entrance into the monastic novitiate for all monks, whether destined for service as priests or brothers.\n\nToday in Eastern Orthodoxy and in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite, there are three types of tonsure: baptismal, monastic, and clerical. It always consists of the cutting of four locks of hair in a cruciform pattern: at the front of head as the celebrant says \"In the Name of the Father\", at the back of head at the words \"and the Son\", and on either side of the head at the words \"and the Holy Spirit\". In all cases, the hair is allowed to grow back; the tonsure as such is not adopted as a hairstyle.\n\nBaptismal tonsure is performed during the rite of Holy Baptism as a first sacrificial offering by the newly baptized. This tonsure is always performed, whether the one being baptized is an infant or an adult.\n\nMonastic tonsure (of which there are three grades: Rassophore, Stavrophore and the Great Schema), is the rite of initiation into the monastic state, symbolic of cutting off of self-will. Orthodox monks traditionally never cut their hair or beards after receiving the monastic tonsure as a sign of the consecration of their lives to God (reminiscent of the Vow of the Nazirite).\n\nClerical tonsure is the equivalent of the \"first tonsure\" in the Latin church. It is done immediately prior to ordination to the minor order of reader but is not repeated at subsequent ordinations. This led to a once common usage that one was, for instance, \"tonsured a reader\", although technically the tonsure occurs prior to the prayer of ordination within the ordination rite.\n\nSince the issuing of \"Ministeria quaedam\" in 1972, certain institutes have been authorized to use the first clerical tonsure, such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (1988), the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (1990), and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney (2001).\n\nAlthough the tonsure itself is obsolete, the wearing of a skull cap, called a zuchetto, in church to keep the head warm, which the fuller form of clerical tonsure led to, still survives. The zuchetto is worn by the pope (in white), cardinals (in red) and bishops (in purple) both during and outside of formal religious ceremonies. Priests may wear a simple black zuchetto, only outside of religious services, though this is almost never seen except on abbots, who continue to wear the black zuchetto; save for abbots of the Order of Canons Regular of Premontre, who wear white. Another congregation of Canons Regular, the Canons Regular of the Lateran, wear a white zuchetto as part of their proper habit. Some priests who held special titles (certain ranks of monsignori and some canons, for instance) formerly wore black zuchettos with red or purple piping, but this too has fallen out of use except in a few, extremely rare cases.\n\nSome monastic orders and individual monasteries still maintain the tradition of a monastic tonsure. While not required, it is still a common practice of Latin Rite friars, such as the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word. Some references compare the tonsure to the crown of thorns worn by Christ at the crucifixion.\n\nPartial tonsure is forbidden in Islam. Muhammad forbade shaving one's hair on some parts of the head while letting it grow on other parts, as in tonsure. However, shaving the head entirely is allowed. The proscription is detailed in the hadith.\n\nعَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ – صلى الله عليه وسلم – نَهَى عَنِ الْقَزَعِ\n\nFrom Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet – peace be upon him – forbids the Qoza‘ (i.e. shaving hair on some parts of the head while let it grow on other parts). \nHadith Bukhori V/2214 no.5577 about \"Al-Qoza‘\", and Hadith Muslim III/1675 no.2120, about \"the Proscription of Al-Qoza‘\")\n\nFrom Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet – peace be upon him – saw a boy whose head shaven on some parts and let the hair grow on other parts. Then, the Prophet commands, \"Shave the head entirely or let the hair grow entirely\" \nHadith Ahmad II/88, Hadith Abu Dawud no. 4195, and Hadith An-Nasa-i no.5048)\n\nAmong the Merovingians, whose rulers were the \"long-haired kings\", the ancient custom remained that an unsuccessful pretender or a dethroned king would be tonsured. Then he had to retire to a monastery, but sometimes this lasted only until his hair grew back. Thus Grimoald the Elder, the son of Pippin of Landen, and Dagobert II's guardian, seized the throne for his own son and had Dagobert tonsured, thus marking him unfit for kingship, and exiled.\n\nThe practice of tonsure, coupled with castration, was common for deposed emperors and their sons in Byzantium from around the 8th century, prior to which disfigurement, usually by blinding, was the normal practice.\n\n\n"}

It states that it is an \"international membership organization whose members use both L. Ron Hubbard management technology and embrace the responsibilities and ethical standards of WISE membership.\"\n\nIn the history of Scientology, Hubbard said about the early Churches of Scientology: \"They are not business and so fail when they try to operate like one\". He then began creating a new system of organizing these churches with the stated purpose of \"Disseminating Scientology to the world.\" This new system was modified continually until circa 1980. In the late 60s, a project began compiling his notes into hard bound volumes that later became known as the Organization Executive Course or OEC. Originally intended as a training program for church executives (hence the name), Hubbard later made them available to all church staff and stated that all staff should train on them.\n\nHowever the OEC was stated to work for any kind of organization if understood. Business not connected to the church wishing to improve their own success reportedly began hiring trained church staff in the 70s causing problems in the church. In the 1980s Hubbard created WISE with the intention of giving any non-church related organization a means to train their own staff so that Scientology churches and missions could train their staff without fear of losing them to other groups. \n\nWISE was officially incorporated in 1979.\n\n\nMembership in WISE means that the owner(s) of the firm have embraced Hubbard's administrative ideas such as management by statistics and the Org board and have agreed to abide by a certain Code of Ethics which includes arbitration by a WISE mediator of any disputes with another WISE member. That is the basic company membership. If the firm also wants to train its employees in the Hubbard administrative technology using WISE materials then they become a higher-level member by paying a pre-determined amount of money to WISE. Some employees and prospective employees have objected to this formal training in that it is something that is also a part of Scientology and a number have filed discrimination lawsuits with mixed results.\n\nWISE Members include e-Republic, which publishes \"Government Technology\" and \"Converge\" magazines and coordinates the \"Center for Digital Government\". Other affiliated firms include various \"alternative health\" centers including \"The Natural Health Centre\" in Redondo Beach, CA which is owned and operated by Dr. Grace Syn. WISE ANZO members include Gallop Solutions based in Sydney, Australia.\n\nA number of firms use the WISE administrative technology in their practices and there have been a number of civil suits and discrimination cases brought by employees objecting to the material with mixed results:\n\n"}
{"id": "487268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=487268", "title": "World Vision United States", "text": "World Vision United States\n\nWorld Vision United States is a member and founding organization of World Vision International. Founded in the United States in 1950, it is an evangelical relief and development organization whose stated goal is \"to follow our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in working with the poor and oppressed to promote human transformation, seek justice and bear witness to the good news of the Kingdom of God.\" It is one of the largest relief and development organizations in the USA with a 1.6 billion dollar budget (2007).\n\nWorld Vision was founded in 1950 by Dr. Robert Pierce (\"Bob\"), a young American evangelist pastor, who had first been sent to China and South Korea in 1947 by the Youth for Christ missionary organization. Pierce remained at the head of World Vision for nearly two decades, but resigned from the organization in 1967.\n\nOn his trip he was inspired by the poverty of one little girl to pledge a monthly amount to the girl's local church to ensure her care. This generated the idea of child sponsorship and World Vision.\n\nAt first the organization focused on orphans and other children in need, beginning in South Korea, then expanding throughout Asia. The program soon spread throughout Latin America, eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In the 1960s, the group started providing food, clothing, and medical care to citizens of impoverished countries after natural disasters by soliciting donations from major corporations.\n\nFrom 1966 onward, the organization used in business also the name \"World Vision International\" but from 1977 on this name was reserved for the umbrella organisation World Vision International. and the founding organization as a member of World Vision International is called World Vision United States whenever a distinction is necessary.\n\nLater, Richard Stearns became president of World Vision US. On January 9, 2018, it was announced that Rich would be retiring from the organization after nearly 20 years as President. On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Edgar Sandoval would replace Rich as World Vision's new President and CEO beginning October 1, 2018.\n\nWorld Vision US is an independently registered interdependent national member office of the federal umbrella organization World Vision International. The relationship with the central organization is governed by the \"Covenant of Partnership\", that all national members sign. It provides that the national organizations must accept policies and decisions of the umbrella organization. and must not establish an office or program outside the US without the consent of the central group and the host country. Furthermore, except for direct project founding, all funds used outside the US have to be remitted through the central organization, and its financial and budget principles must be accepted. Additionally, the national group must also subscribes to the core values, the mission statement, and the Statement of Faith of World Vision.\n\nWorld Vision aims to incorporate Christian belief into their development work as well as their organization. US president Richard Stearns stated that the group has a strict policy against proselytizing, which he describes as \"... - using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone.\" Like all other national members of the World Vision Partnership, World Vision US is committed to the concept of transformational development, which is cast in a biblical framework and in which evangelization is an inseparable integral part of development work.\n\nStearns stated that \"hope\" is World Vision's most lasting impression. He believes that if hope can be restored in a community it is more beneficial than adding a water well. He emphasizes that everyone lives in a religious world where more than 90% of the population believes in some faith. He claims that World Vision's understanding of faith is essential for development.\n\nWorld Vision uses the Sponsor a Child method of fundraising. Individuals, families, churches, schools, and other groups sponsor specific children or specific community projects in their own country or abroad. Sponsors send funds each month, supposedly to provide support for the sponsored children or projects.\n\nAccording to its annual report, in 2008 87% of its funding was spent on programs, 8% on fundraising and 5% on management and general overhead.\n\nWorld Vision provides emergency relief to people whose lives are endangered by disasters or conflict and who need immediate assistance. It attempts to respond to all major emergencies around the world themselves or in cooperation with partner agencies. For example, World Vision responded to famine in Ethiopia and North Korea, hurricanes in Central America, the tsunami in the Indian Ocean nations, earthquakes in El Salvador, India, Taiwan, Turkey and the Sichuan earthquake in China, Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar and war refugees in Kosovo, Chechnya, Sierra Leone, Angola, and East Timor.\n\nThe organization encourages public awareness about the needs of others, the causes of poverty, and the nature of compassionate response. These efforts include collaboration with media and community participation in fundraising.\n\nThe organization devotes considerable effort to advocating to the US government. On March 1, 2011, along with 29 other faith-based groups, it sent a letter to the senate petitioning for the restoration of cuts made to foreign disaster assistance, global health, and food aid in the 2011 budget.\n\nWorld Vision is a leading member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger international affairs budget, which funds American diplomatic and development efforts abroad. World Vision is also a member of the Global Coalition Against Pneumonia and supports World Pneumonia Day on November 2, 2009.\n\nIn 1999, the academic journal \"Development in Practice\" published an overview of World Vision's history focusing on the evolution of its global architecture. The document, \"Pursuing Partnership: World Vision and the Ideology of Development\" was written by then World Vision staff person Alan Whaites, who went on to become a political scientist concerned with international development. He offered a picture of an organization that was often spurred to innovate and change as a result of internal reflection on external criticism.\n\nIn August 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that \"World Vision is a 'religious corporation' and therefore exempt from federal law barring faith-based discrimination, and thus was permitted to dismiss two employees who were fired because they did not believe in the \"divinity of Jesus or the doctrine of the Trinity.\" Judge Marsha S. Berzon of that circuit dissented, arguing that \"Congress did not intend to allow all religiously motivated nonprofits to be exempt from the law.\" She believes that the decision discriminates against employees who have the ability to do the assigned work just because of their religious views.\n\nOn March 24, 2014, the World Vision US announced that it would hire what it defined as Christians in same-sex marriages. Facing protests from donors and the larger evangelical community after the announcement, World Vision reversed the policy change two days later.\n\n\n"}
