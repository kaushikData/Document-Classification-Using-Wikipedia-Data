It is directed by Wang Genfa and Zhang Zhenhui, and voiced by Cui Jie, Zhao Jing and Ma Shaohua.\n\nSet mainly in and around the Shanghai Ghetto in Japanese-occupied Shanghai during the Second World War, the film tells the story of three children. Rina and her younger brother Mishalli are Jewish refugees who escaped Europe but are without their parents. A-Gen is a Chinese orphan boy who meets Rina and helps her and her brother to survive. The children form strong friendships and have adventures as they try and fend off the Japanese army occupying the city, and their allies, the Nazis. In the background, the Second Sino-Japanese War takes place, while the children must face the uncertainty that concerns the fate of Rina and Mishalli's parents in Europe.\n\nWell received in China and internationally, \"A Jewish Girl in Shanghai\" has been heralded as the first animated Chinese film to address the Holocaust, and has been described as \"China's first homegrown Jewish film\". The film has been nominated for awards in China and Israel, and has been considered an important step towards improving China's relations with Israel and intercultural relations between the Chinese and Jewish peoples.\n\nModern day Shanghai, an old lady with blue eyes arrived in the city, while holding an old locket that belongs to her.\n\nRina and Mishalli, European Jews luckily escaped before they were caught by Nazis on their homeland, sought refuge within Shanghai Ghetto. A-Gen, a Chinese orphan sells bread for a living. Rina gave her locket in exchange of food. A-Gen tries to find Rina to return her locket.\n\nShe was welcomed upon by A-Gen to his home, as he was raised by his father's friend, who was once alongside his father, fought the Japanese, in which A-Gen's father died.\n\nTogether, they make their lives upon Shanghai normal, until a collaborator blows their locations to the local Japanese Army. A-Gen's guardian held and allowed himself to be caught by the soldiers.\n\n1945, the Japanese surrendered. A-Gen sees his friend Rina one last time as she was taken to the ship back to Europe.\n\nRina is the old woman from the beginning, trying to search for A-Gen, who came as an old man.\n\nDuring the Second World War, approximately 20,000 Jewish refugees fleeing German-occupied Europe were given an area of approximately one square mile in the Hongkou District of Shanghai by the Japanese Empire, designated the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees, one of the poorest and most overcrowded areas of the city. Shanghai had previously had a small population of Baghdadi Jews and Russian Jews, the latter mostly having fled the Russian Empire as a result of anti-Jewish pogroms.\n\nThe new Ashkenazi Jews that immigrated to Shanghai began arriving from 1933, firstly German Jews following the Nazi Party's rise to power. Despite the cultural differences they faced, and restrictions imposed by the Japanese under Nazi pressure, the Jews of Shanghai survived the war unharmed, as the Japanese refused to hand them over to the Germans.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, many Jews who had sought refuge in Shanghai returned to Europe or decided to settle in countries with much larger Jewish populations, such as the United States and Palestine. Most of the Jews that chose to stay in Shanghai left shortly afterwards as a result of the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, and by the late 1950s very few Jews remained in Shanghai. As a result of Chinese economic growth in recent years, however, the city's Jewish population has grown to around 1,500 in 2010. This compares to a Jewish population of fewer than 100 around 20 years before.\n\nWu, a former history teacher, first become interested in the history of Shanghai's Jews, obscure to both Jews and Chinese alike, in 2005, when many newspapers and magazines in Shanghai published the stories of Jewish refugees to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, seeing parallels between the Jewish and Chinese peoples' oppression by the Germans and Japanese respectively, and their struggles against fascism. Wu had previously lived in Los Angeles, and he based the character of Mishalli on Jerry Moses, a Jewish American friend who was originally from Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) who, like the characters of Rina and Mishalli, was offered a safe haven in Shanghai. Moses and other Jewish friends helped Wu to learn about Jewish religious practices. Wu has stated that his main reason for making the film was to let children know about what really happened, and to promote the story and the history so that people all over the world can learn from it.\n\nThe story was originally conceived for adults, but Wu decided to aim the film at children in the hope that the film could influence the future generation. Glenn Timmermans, the organiser of the Macau Jewish Film Festival, has stated that he believes the film's intended age group is between around eight and fourteen years, though he notes its wider appeal. One of the film's characters, a talking monkey, has been noted as one of the more child-orientated features of the film.\n\nWu first created a \"A Jewish Girl in Shanghai\" as a graphic novel, published in 2008 by East China Normal University Press. The graphic novel has been described as a \"great success\" by Wu, selling 4,000 copies in the first six months since its release, though, as it was only published in English, its Chinese market was naturally limited. Wu has stated that a Hebrew version of the graphic novel is under consideration.\n\nIn 2009, Wu began work on a film adaptation to bring the work to a broader audience in China. The film, produced using 35 mm film, is, unlike the graphic novel, in Mandarin Chinese, and was developed by the Shanghai Film Group Corporation and the Shanghai Animation Film Studio. The film score was composed by Shi Jiayang.\n\n\"A Jewish Girl in Shanghai\" made its world premiere in Shanghai in May 2010. The film began showing across China from 28 May. After a month following the film's general release, it was being shown in 200 Chinese cinemas. When it was first shown in China, it was in front of 700 school pupils, who, according to Wu, \"laughed and cried several times\". He described the emotional impact of the film as \"very rare for an animated film\".\n\nThe film subsequently made its premiere in Macau on 14 November 2010 at the Cultural Centre of the University of Macau, as part of the 1st Macau Jewish Film Festival. The Hong Kong premiere took place a week later, on 21 November, at the Jewish Community Centre on Robinson Road, as part of the 11th Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival.\n\nThe film's Israeli premiere took place in July 2010, when it was shown as part of the 27th Jerusalem Film Festival on 13 and 14 July. The film was well received by the Israeli audience.\n\nThe British premiere took place in November 2010, when it was shown at the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn, London. The film was first shown on 20 November as part of the 14th UK Jewish Film Festival. The film's subtitles in English were noted as containing a few mistranslations and mistakes, including the anachronistic use of the word \"badass\".\n\nThe critical reception to \"A Jewish Girl in Shanghai\" has been generally positive. The film was nominated for the Jewish Experience Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival, becoming the first Chinese film nominated for that award. At the China International Animation and Digital Arts Festival in Changzhou, Jiangsu, China, the film received the Golden Cartoon Award Best Chinese Film Prize.\n\nThe film's animation has been widely praised, being described as \"beautifully drawn\" with \"breathtaking traditional animation\" and as being \"artfully created with traditional animated imagery\".\n\nThe sensitive treatment of the Holocaust has also been commended: \"The fresh perspective of the main characters means that the events of the times are freed from cliched depictions of the Holocaust and the viewer is able to draw their own conclusions.\"\n\nSome criticism has been directed towards the historical grounding of the film. One flashback scene of the film, set in 1936, sees Rina and Michaili, in what appears to be an alpine setting in Europe, escaping being bombed by Nazi planes, despite the date preceding the aerial warfare of the Second World War. Wu himself has said that the film is \"both true and untrue\" in that it is a composition of fiction and history; \"the main characters were all based on real prototypes…I can’t promise it's 100% accurate, but I think it fits the background of the time.\"\n\nThe clothing of the Jews was notably inaccurate, especially in Europe, where the orthodox Jewish mother is wearing slacks and a T-shirt. The film also minimizes the Japanese role in saving most of these Jews. Most famously, 6,000 Jews Lithuanian Jews were saved by Japanese Vice-Consul Chiune Sugihara in Vilna, many of whom live through the war in Shanghai.\n\n\"A Jewish Girl in Shanghai\" has been praised by commentators for being a positive step towards improving Chinese–Jewish and Chinese–Israeli relations at a time where there is growing interest in China about Jewish life.\n\nWu has stated that only by remembering the past can friendship for the future be built, declaring that while \"the friendship between the Jewish people and the Chinese people is only a spray in the long river of world history\", it is \"extremely meaningful because it took place in the hard times of anti-Fascism.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Asian Jewish Life\", Wu revealed he was planning to write a sequel to \"A Jewish Girl in Shanghai\", stating his intentions that the second animated work would tell the as-yet unseen story of Rina and Mishalli's father. Wu explained the reason for this on the basis that he wrote \"the front of the face and now need to write from the back.\"\n\n\n"}

As of today they are entitled to reservations in Education sector and government jobs as they are recognised as Scheduled Caste. Ad Dharmis are 14.9% of the total Dalit population in Punjab.\n\nThe Ad-dharmi movement was started in 1920's, for the purpose of getting a distinct religious identity. The founder of the ad-dharmi movement was Mangu Ram Mugowalia and B L Gherra. The movement projected Ravidas as their spiritual Guru and a sacred book \"Ad Parkash\" for separate ritual traditions. The Ad-dharmi Dalits came together as a faith was in 1925 when the British ruled India. In the 1931 census, more than 450,000 registered themselves as members of the new Dalit faith called \"Ad Dharam\" (or \"Original Religion\"). But this faith and movement vanished after India's independence mainly because of lures of government jobs reserved for low-caste Sikhs and Buddhists.\n\nAlthough the Ad-Dharmi are followers of Guru Ravidas (\"now Ravidassia religion\"), and incorporate elements of Sikhism as they regard Shri Guru Granth Sahib as their religious text. Each of their settlement contains a gurdwaras and Ravidas Bhawans, which are both a centre of worship and as well as a focus of the community.\n\nThe traditional occupation of the Ad-Dharmis was leather tanning although a majority were agricultural labourers. There has greater upward mobility among groups in Punjab then other parts of India. As such, many Ad-Dharmis have started to migrate to towns and cities, where they have taken on a number of blue and white collar professions. A small but significant minority have also taken to education. Like other Punjabis, the Ad-Dharmis have participated in the overseas migration of the ethnic group. There are now fairly large Ad-Dharmis communities in Europe and North America, in particular the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

{"id": "6907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6907", "title": "Chakra", "text": "Chakra\n\nChakras (Sanskrit: चक्र, IAST: cakra, Pali: cakka, lit. \"wheel, circle\") are the various focal points in the subtle body used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as Tantra, or the esoteric or inner traditions of Indian religion, Chinese Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Japanese Esoteric Buddhism, and in postmodernity, in New Age medicine, and originally psychologically adopted to the western mind through the assistance of Carl Jung.\n\nThe concept is found in the early traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. They are treated as focal points, or putative nodes in the subtle body of the practitioner. These theories differ between the Indian religions, with many esoteric Buddhist texts consistently mentioning five Chakras, while separate esoteric Hindu sources will offer six, or even seven. They are believed to be embedded within the actual physical body, whilst also originating within the context of mental and spiritual fields, or complexes of electromagnetic variety, the precise degree and variety of which directly arise from a synthetic average of all positive and negative so-called \"fields\", this eventuating the complex Nadi. Within kundalini yoga breath exercises, visualizations, mudras, bandhas, kriyas, and mantras are focused on transmuting subtle energy through \"chakras\".\n\nThe very concept of the so-called chakra, etymologically originates directly from the Sanskrit root चक्र. The \"tsschakra\" remained in virtual linguistic conformity throughout possible adaptations throughout the relative temporal and linguist adversity of two thousand years. At heart, the chakra denotes a \"wheel\", a \"circle\", and a \"cycle\". One of the Hindu scriptures \"Rigveda\" mentions \"Chakra\" with the meaning of \"wheel\", with \"ara\" (spokes). According to Frits Staal, \"Chakra\" has Indo-European roots, is \"related to Greek \"Kuklos\" (from which comes English \"cycle\"), Latin \"circus\", Anglo-Saxon \"hveohl\" and English \"wheel\".\" However, the Vedic period texts use the same word as a simile in other contexts, such as the \"wheel of time\" or \"wheel of dharma\", such as in \"Rigveda\" hymn verse 1.164.11.\n\nIn Buddhism generally and Theravada specifically, the Pali noun \"cakka\" connotes \"wheel\". Within the central \"Tripitaka\", the Buddha variously references the \"dhammacakka\", or \"wheel of dharma\", connoting that his dharma, universal in its advocacy, should bear the marks which bear the very characteristic of any temporal dispensation. While further, it should be added that the Buddha himself insinuated freedom from cycles in and of themselves - sui generis - be they karmic, reincarnative, liberative, cognitive or emotional.\n\nIn Jainism, the term \"Chakra\" also means \"wheel\" and appears in various context in its ancient literature. Like other Indian religions, \"Chakra\" in esoteric theories in Jainism such as those by Buddhisagarsuri means yogic-energy centers.\n\nThe term \"Chakra\" appears to first emerge within the Vedas, the most authoritative Hindu text, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as \"chakravartin\" or the king who \"turns the wheel of his empire\" in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power. The iconography popular in representing the \"Chakras\", states White, trace back to the five symbols of yajna, the Vedic fire altar: \"square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling\".\n\nThe hymn 10.136 of the \"Rigveda\" mentions a renunciate yogi with a female named \"kunamnama\". Literally, it means \"she who is bent, coiled\", representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the \"Rigveda\". Some scholars, such as David Gordon White and Georg Feuerstein interpret this might be related to kundalini shakti, and an overt overature to the terms of esotericism that would later emerge in Post-Aryan Bramhanism. the Upanishad.\n\nBreath channels (nāḍi) of Yoga practices are mentioned in the classical Upanishads of Hinduism dated to 1st millennium BCE, but not psychic-energy Chakra theories. The latter, states White, were introduced about 8th-century CE in Buddhist texts as hierarchies of inner energy centers, such as in the \"Hevajra Tantra\" and \"Caryāgiti\". These are called by various terms such as \"cakka\", \"padma\" (lotus) or \"pitha\" (mound). These medieval Buddhist texts mention only four chakras, while later Hindu texts such as the \"Kubjikāmata\" and \"Kaulajñānanirnaya\" expanded the list to many more.\n\nIn contrast to White, according to Feuerstein, early Upanishads of Hinduism do mention \"cakra\" in the sense of \"psychospiritual vortices\", along with other terms found in tantra: \"prana\" or \"vayu\" (life energy) along with \"nadi\" (energy carrying arteries). According to Galvin Flood, the ancient texts do not present \"chakra\" and kundalini-style yoga theories although these words appear in the earliest Vedic literature in many contexts. The \"chakra\" in the sense of four or more vital energy centers appear in the medieval era Hindu and Buddhist texts.\n\nChakra is a part of the esoteric medieval era theories about physiology and psychic centers that emerged across Indian traditions. The theory posited that human life simultaneously exists in two parallel dimensions, one \"physical body\" (\"sthula sarira\") and other \"psychological, emotional, mind, non-physical\" it is called the \"subtle body\" (\"suksma sarira\"). This subtle body is energy, while the physical body is mass. The psyche or mind plane corresponds to and interacts with the body plane, and the theory posits that the body and the mind mutually affect each other. The subtle body consists of nadi (energy channels) connected by nodes of psychic energy it called \"chakra\". The theory grew into extensive elaboration, with some suggesting 88,000 chakras throughout the subtle body. The chakra it considered most important varied between various traditions, but they typically ranged between four and seven.\nThe important chakras are stated in Buddhist and Hindu texts to be arranged in a column along the spinal cord, from its base to the top of the head, connected by vertical channels. The tantric traditions sought to master them, awaken and energize them through various breathing exercises or with assistance of a teacher. These chakras were also symbolically mapped to specific human physiological capacity, seed syllables (bija), sounds, subtle elements (tanmatra), in some cases deities, colors and other motifs.\n\nThe chakra theories of Buddhism and Hinduism differs from the historic Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture. Unlike the latter, the \"chakra\" relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection. The tantric systems envision it as a continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy. It is useful in a type of yogic rituals and meditative discovery of radiant inner energy (\"prana\" flows) and mind-body connections. The meditation is aided by extensive symbology, mantras, diagrams, models (deity and mandala). The practitioner proceeds step by step from perceptible models, to increasingly abstract models where deity and external mandala are abandoned, inner self and internal mandalas are awakened.\n\nThese ideas are not unique to Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Similar and overlapping concepts emerged in other cultures in the East and the West, and these are variously called by other names such as subtle body, spirit body, esoteric anatomy, sidereal body and etheric body. According to Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, professors of Religious studies known for their studies on Yoga and esoteric traditions:\n\nChakra and related theories have been important to the esoteric traditions, but they are not directly related to mainstream yoga. According to Edwin Bryant and other scholars, the goals of classical yoga such as spiritual liberation (freedom, self-knowledge, moksha) is \"attained entirely differently in classical yoga, and the \"cakra / nadi / kundalini\" physiology is completely peripheral to it.\"\n\nThe classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe \"nadi\" and \"cakra\" in a \"subtle body\" context. To them, they are the parallel dimension of psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real. In the \"nadi\" and \"cakra\" flow the \"prana\" (breath, life energy). The concept of \"life energy\" varies between the texts, ranging from simple inhalation-exhalation to far more complex association with breath-mind-emotions-sexual energy. This essence is what vanishes when a person dies, leaving a gross body. Some of it, states this subtle body theory, is what withdraws within when one sleeps. All of it is believed to be reachable, awake-able and important for an individual's body-mind health, and how one relates to other people in one's life. This subtle body network of \"nadi\" and \"chakra\" is, according to some later Indian theories and many new age speculations, closely associated with emotions.\n\nDifferent esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements chakras, of which a classical system of seven is most prevalent. This seven-part system, central to the core texts of hatha yoga, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature. These texts teach many different Chakra theories.\n\nThe Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism. It is an important concept along with yantras, mandalas and kundalini yoga in its practice. Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an \"energy center\" within, as well as being a term of group rituals such as in \"chakra-puja\" (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice. The cakra-based system is one part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as laya yoga.\n\nBeyond its original Shakta milieu, various sub-traditions within the Shaiva and Vaishnava schools of Hinduism also developed texts and practices on Nadi and Chakra systems. Certain modern Hindu groups also utilize a technique of circular energy work based on the chakras known as \"kriya yoga\". Followers of this practice include the Bihar School of Yoga and Self Realization Fellowship, and practitioners are known as \"kriyaban\". Although Paramahansa Yogananda claimed this was the same technique taught as kriya yoga by Patañjali in the Yoga Sūtras and by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita (as karma yoga), Swami Satyananda of the Bihar school disagreed with this assessment and acknowledged the similarities between kriya and taoist inner orbit practices. Both schools claim the technique is taught in every age by an avatar of god known as Babaji. The historicity of its techniques in India prior to the early twentieth century are not well established. It believed by its practitioners to activate the chakras and stimulate faster spiritual development.\n\nThe esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach five chakras. It must be noted, that is possible that a system of Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha and the Usnisa Kamala chakras was absorbed into Tibetan thought, yet any source which alleges the employment of 3rd or manipura, chakra, within the context of thousand year history of broad Tantric monasticism, is here, not only conceptually inadequate, but technically misguided. In one development within the Nyingma lineage of the \"Mantrayana\" of Tibetan Buddhism a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: Nirmanakaya (gross self), Sambhogakaya (subtle self), Dharmakaya (causal self), and Mahasukhakaya (non-dual self), each vaguely - yet by no means directly - corresponding to the categories within the Shaiva \"Mantramarga\" universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc. However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.\n\nChakras clearly play a key role in Tibetan Buddhism, and are considered to be the pivotal providence of Tantric thinking. And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamete of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the \"organic harmony\" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute Buddhahood.\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as \"central to their soteriological process\". The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called \"yantra yoga\" or \"'phrul 'khor\". \n\nThe Chakras in the Tibetan practice are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated buddha counterpart.\n\nChakras, according to the Bon tradition, ennable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the six realms of woe.\n\nThe tsa lung practice embodied in the Trul khor lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana. Yoga awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities. In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and a attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.\n\nTantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light. The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.\n\nQigong () also relies on a similar model of the human body as an esoteric energy system, except that it involves the circulation of qì (, also \"ki\") or life-energy. The qì, equivalent to the Hindu prana, flows through the energy channels called meridians, equivalent to the nadi, but two other energies are also important: \"jīng\", or primordial essence, and \"shén\", or spirit energy.\n\nIn the principle circuit of qì, called the microcosmic orbit, energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various dantian (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined. These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows. The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or jīng, into qì. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qì into shén, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms shen into wuji, infinite space of void.\n\nTraditional spirituality in the Malay Archipelago borrows heavily from Hindu-Buddhist concepts. In Malay and Indonesian metaphysical theory, the chakras' energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Defensive energy emits outwards from the centre line, while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. This can be applied to energy-healing, meditation, or martial arts. Silat practitioners learn to harmonise their movements with the chakras, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements.\n\nThe more common and most studied esoteric system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra. These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel (sushumna nadi in Hindu texts, Avadhuti in some Buddhist texts). It was this chakra system that was translated in early 20th century by Sir John Woodroffe (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text \"The Serpent Power\". Avalon translated the Hindu text \"Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa\" meaning the examination (nirūpaṇa) of the six (ṣaṭ) chakras (cakra).\n\nThe Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids. The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent. In both the Hindu and Buddhist kundalini or candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra. In Hindu texts she is known as Kundalini, while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or Tummo (Tibetan: \"gtum mo\", \"fierce one\").\n\nBelow are the common new age description of these six chakras and the seventh point known as sahasrara. This new age version incorporates the newtonian colors that were completely unknown when these systems were created. The actual colors for the chakras vary from text to text and do not conform to the newtonian spectrum:\n\nMany systems include myriad minor chakras throughout the body. \"Talu,\" \"bindu,\" \"manas,\" and \"dvadashanta\" chakra are close to and associated with Ajna chakra. Situated just to the left of Anahata chakra (where the heart is situated anatomically) is \"Hridaya\" chakra. \"Lalance\" chakra is situated at the base of the mouth and is associated with Vishuddha chakra]]\n\nIn 1918, the translation of two Indian texts: the \"Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa\" and the \"Pādukā-Pañcaka\", by Sir John Woodroffe, alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled \"The Serpent Power\" introduced the shakta theory of seven main chakras in the West. This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by C. W. Leadbeater in his book \"The Chakras\". Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular Johann Georg Gichtel, a disciple of Jakob Böhme, and his book \"Theosophia Practica (1696)\", in which Gichtel directly refers to inner \"force centres\", a concept reminiscent of the chakras.\n\nA completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is Hesychasm, a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras. Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.\n\nIn \"Anatomy of the Spirit\" (1996), Caroline Myss describes the function of chakras as follows: \"Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...\". The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the spine to the top of the head. New Age practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of consciousness, a classical element, and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.\n\nThe chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered of life energy or prana (which New Age belief equates with \"shakti\", \"qi\" in Chinese, \"ki \"in Japanese, \"koach-ha-guf\" in Hebrew, \"bios \"in Greek, and \"aether\"\" \"in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called nadi. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.\n\nRudolf Steiner considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving. He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times. Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction. He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.\n\nAccording to Florin Lowndes, a \"spiritual student\" can further develop and deepen or elevate thinking consciousness when taking the step from the \"ancient path\" of schooling to the \"new path\" represented by Steiner's \"The Philosophy of Freedom\".\n\nChakras and their importance are posited to reside in the psyche. However, there are those who believe that chakras have a physical manifestation as well. Gary Osborn, for instance, has described the chakras as metaphysical counterparts to the endocrine glands, while Anodea Judith noted a marked similarity between the positions of the two and the roles described for each. Stephen Sturgess also links the lower six chakras to specific nerve plexuses along the spinal cord as well as glands. C.W. Leadbeater associated the Ajna chakra with the pineal gland, which is a part of the endocrine system. These associations remain speculative, however, and have no empirical validation.\n\n"}

They subsequently refused to leave, and the church remains in the possession of the SSPX to this day.\n\nThe various French municipal authorities have had ownership of the older churches in France since the enactment of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, though the buildings are permitted to be used by the appropriate religious denominations. Ducaud-Bourget maintained that the Traditionalist Catholics represented by the SSPX were the true heirs of the Catholics of 1905. Although the occupation was declared illegal by the French courts, the authorities reached the conclusion that, by comparison with forcibly evicting the SSPX, the continuing occupation would cause less disturbance to public order. An SSPX attempt in 1993 to occupy another church in Paris, that of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, was unsuccessful.\n\nThe views of Bishop Williamson have been a particular source of controversy. For example, the bishop has written:\n\nIn an interview with Swedish Television in November 2008, whose broadcast on 21 January 2009, the date on which the Holy See lifted the excommunication of the four SSPX bishops, gained wide publicity, Williamson repeated his opinion that the generally accepted history of the Holocaust is wrong. He accepted an estimate of only 200,000-300,000 Jews who perished in Nazi concentration camps, and denied that any were killed in gas chambers. Subsequently, former SSPX seminarians have come forward with additional information about Williamson's Jewish views. One former seminarian characterized Williamson as \"a sick man\" with \"a horrible attitude toward women and a horrible attitude toward Jews.\" The Vatican has repudiated Williamson's views as \"intolerable and altogether unacceptable.\" \n\nWilliamson's views on this and other subjects are controversial even within traditionalist Catholicism. After his interview, broadcast by Swedish Television on 21 January 2009, both the Superior General of the SSPX, Bishop Fellay, and the District Superior of the SSPX in Germany, Fr. Franz Schmidberger, stated that Williamson's views represented his own personal opinions; and Bishop Fellay, as superior general of the Society, \"prohibited him, pending any new orders, from taking any public positions on political or historical questions.\"\n\nAlthough the SSPX authorities have thus distinguished Williamson's views from those of the Society, the Anti-Defamation League has accused the Society of St. Pius X of being \"mired in anti-Semitism\", and journalist John L. Allen, Jr., has said it would be misleading to consider Williamson an isolated case: Father Florian Abrahamowicz, who after being the superior in Italy has since been expelled from the Society also said he was not sure the Nazis had used gas chambers for anything other than disinfection, seemed to cast doubt on the number of six million Jews killed, complained that the Jews had exalted the Holocaust above other genocides, and called the Jews first \"the people of God\" and then the \"people of deicide\", to be converted to Jesus Christ at the end times.\n\nWilliamson was forced out of the SSPX on 23 October 2012 for the \"common good of the society\", following his refusal to submit to the group's leadership.\n\nOn 24 May 1989 Paul Touvier, a former secret police official for Petain's Government, was arrested in a Society priory in Nice. The SSPX stated at the time that Touvier had no link to the Society and had been allowed to stay at the Priory as \"an act of charity to a homeless man\". In 1994, Touvier was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1944 summary execution of seven Jews at Rillieux-la-Pape. The massacre was a reprisal for the French Resistance's killing of Petain's Propaganda minister Philippe Henriot. On his death in 1996, a Requiem Mass for the repose of Touvier's soul was offered by Father Philippe Laguérie, an SSPX priest who was then the Rector of the Parisian church of St Nicolas du Chardonnet. Like Fr. Aulagnier, however, Fr. Laguerie subsequently left the Society and founded the Institute of the Good Shepherd with Papal approval.\n\nThe SSPX was also accused of anti-Semitism in a 2006 report on Traditionalist Catholicism published by the legal advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center. Defenders of the SSPX have strongly criticised the report and accused the SPLC of using accusations of anti-Semitism as a means of \"silencing opponents of liberalism.\"\n\nThe society was reported to have perpetuated the Jewish deicide and Jewish world domination plot canards in its official newsletters and on several of its websites internationally (although the offending websites have been removed since the controversy surrounding the bishops' reinstatement).\n\nThe website of the SSPX in the United States carried a 1997 \"The Angelus\" article titled \"The Mystery of the Jewish People in History\" which the \"Overland Express\" of Melbourne said \"methodically repeats every slur of medieval anti-Semitism.\" The piece was written by British priests Michael Crowdy and Kenneth Novak.\n\nOne of the Society's four bishops, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, has stated that Pope Benedict XVI \"has professed heresies in the past! He ... has never retracted his errors. When he was a theologian, he professed heresies, he published a book full of heresies.\" In the same interview, Bishop Mallerais said of the Second Vatican Council: \"You cannot read Vatican II as a Catholic work. It is based on the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. ...I will say, one day the Church should erase this Council. She will not speak of it anymore. She must forget it. The Church will be wise if she forgets this Council.\"\n\nSimilarly, Bishop Richard Williamson has said of Pope Benedict XVI: \"His past writings are full of Modernist errors. Now, Modernism is the synthesis of all heresies (\"Pascendi\", Pope St. Pius X). So Ratzinger as a heretic goes far beyond Luther's Protestant errors, as Bishop Tissier de Mallerais said.\" Williamson added that the documents of the Second Vatican Council \"are much too subtly and deeply poisoned to be reinterpreted. The whole of a partly poisoned cake goes to the trash can!\"\n\nA number of groups whose following overlaps with that of the SSPX, such as the Scouts d'Europe, have been accused of extremist leanings. In 1998, the \"Association Française de Scouts et Guides Catholiques\" faced international scrutiny following an accident at Perros-Guirec that claimed the lives of four marine Scouts and of a sailor who died in an attempt to save them. A media frenzy followed, and it was alleged that Fr. Cottard, the SSPX priest responsible for the children, had subjected them to a harsh disciplinary regimen, forcing them to spend the night before their deaths sleeping on a pebbled beach. Fr. Cottard had also failed to call the emergency services for almost 8 hours, and did not take basic safety precautions such as properly checking the weather forecast.\n\nWhen former S.S. Captain Erich Priebke died in October 2013, the Diocese of Rome forbade a Requiem Mass for him. The reasons cited were Priebke's involvement in murdering 335 Italians in the 1944 Ardeatine Massacre and his subsequent lack of remorse. SSPX offered to hold a funeral and issued a statement on their website saying, \"A Christian who was baptized and received the sacraments of confession and the Eucharist, no matter what his faults and sins were, to the extent that he dies reconciled with God and the church, has a right to the celebration of the holy Mass and a funeral.\" Nevertheless the ceremony was not held due to 500 protesters outside the SSPX headquarters in Albano. The lawyer, Paolo Giachini, told reporters outside the SSPX headquarters that the funeral Mass had not taken place, but that he had fulfilled his obligation to arrange a funeral. \"Now it's up to the authorities to decide what to do with the body,\" since he was unable to find a city where Priebke could be buried.\n\nOn 5 April 2017 \"Uppdrag Granskning\", a Swedish television program focused on investigative journalism, reported that four different clerics of the SSPX – three priests and a former seminarian – had molested at least a dozen young people in several different countries. The program also stated that evidence of abuse was kept secret by the SSPX and that the priests were allowed to continue in ministry.\n\nIn February 2008 Saint Mary's Academy, a school in Kansas affiliated with the SSPX, refused to allow a woman referee to officiate at a high-school basketball game in which St. Mary's was participating, reportedly on the grounds that it was not appropriate for a woman to be in a position of authority over male students. In response, the other referees refused to referee the game. The school issued a statement denying that the refusal was due to the reported reason. It stated instead that \"[the] formation of adolescent boys is best accomplished by male role models,\" and that \"teaching our boys to treat ladies with deference, we cannot place them in an aggressive athletic competition where they are forced to play inhibited by their concern about running into a female referee.\"\n\nIn May 2012, Our Lady of Sorrows Academy in Phoenix, Arizona, also affiliated with the SSPX, forfeited the Arizona Charter Athletic Association state baseball championship game rather than play against a team with a female player. The opposing team, from Mesa Preparatory Academy of Mesa, Arizona, included Paige Sultzbach, playing infield. Officials at Our Lady of Sorrows issued a statement saying that the decision to forfeit was consistent with a policy prohibiting co-ed sports. They stated that school teaches boys respect by not placing girls in athletic competition, where \"proper boundaries can only be respected with difficulty.\"\n"}

{"id": "80219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80219", "title": "Dodona", "text": "Dodona\n\nDodona (; Doric Greek: Δωδώνα, \"Dōdṓna\", Ionic and Attic Greek: Δωδώνη, \"Dōdṓnē\") in Epirus in northwestern Greece was the oldest Hellenic oracle, possibly dating to the second millennium BCE according to Herodotus. The earliest accounts in Homer describe Dodona as an oracle of Zeus. Situated in a remote region away from the main Greek poleis, it was considered second only to the oracle of Delphi in prestige.\n\nAristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes originated. The oracle was first under the control of the Thesprotians before it passed into the hands of the Molossians. It remained an important religious sanctuary until the rise of Christianity during the Late Roman era.\n\nDuring classical antiquity, according to various accounts, priestesses and priests in the sacred grove interpreted the rustling of the oak (or beech) leaves to determine the correct actions to be taken. According to a new interpretation, the oracular sound originated from bronze objects hanging from oak branches and sounded with the wind blowing, similar to a wind chime.\n\nAccording to Nicholas Hammond, Dodona was an oracle devoted to a Mother Goddess (identified at other sites with Rhea or Gaia, but here called Dione) who was joined and partly supplanted in historical times by the Greek deity Zeus.\n\nAlthough the earliest inscriptions at the site date to c. 550–500 BCE, archaeological excavations conducted for more than a century have recovered artifacts as early as the Mycenaean era, many now at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, and some in the archaeological museum at nearby Ioannina. There was an ancient tradition that Dodona was founded as a colony from the city, also named Dodona, in Thessaly.\n\nCult activity at Dodona was already established in some form during the Late Bronze Age (or Mycenaean period). During the post-Mycenaean period (or \"Greek Dark Ages\"), evidence of activity at Dodona is scant, but there is a resumption of contact between Dodona and southern Greece during the Archaic period (8th century BCE) with the presence of bronze votive offerings (i.e. tripods) from southern Greek cities. Archaeologists also have found Illyrian dedications and objects that were received by the oracle during the 7th century BCE. Until 650 BCE, Dodona was a religious and oracular centre mainly for northern tribes: only after 650 BCE did it become important for the southern tribes.\n\nZeus was worshipped at Dodona as \"Zeus Naios\" or \"Naos\" (god of the spring below the oak in the \"temenos\" or sanctuary, cf. Naiads) and as \"Zeus Bouleus\" (Counsellor). According to Plutarch, the worship of Jupiter (Zeus) at Dodona was set up by Deucalion and Pyrrha.\n\nThe earliest mention of Dodona is in Homer, and only Zeus is mentioned in this account. In the \"Iliad\" (circa 750 BCE), Achilles prays to \"High Zeus, Lord of Dodona, Pelasgian, living afar off, brooding over wintry Dodona\" (thus demonstrating that Zeus also could be invoked from a distance). No buildings are mentioned, and the priests (called \"Selloi\") slept on the ground with unwashed feet. No priestesses are mentioned in Homer.\n\nThe oracle also features in another passage involving Odysseus, giving a story of his visit to Dodona. Odysseus's words \"bespeak a familiarity with Dodona, a realization of its importance, and an understanding that it was normal to consult Zeus there on a problem of personal conduct.\"\n\nThe details of this story are as follows. Odysseus says to the swineherd Eumaeus (possibly giving him a fictive account) that he (Odysseus) was seen among the Thesprotians, having gone to inquire of the oracle at Dodona whether he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret (as the disguised Odysseus is doing). Odysseus later repeats the same tale to Penelope, who may not yet have seen through his disguise.\n\nAccording to some scholars, Dodona was originally an oracle of the Mother Goddess attended by priestesses. She was identified at other sites as Rhea or Gaia. The oracle also was shared by Dione (whose name simply means \"deity\"). By classical times, Dione was relegated to a minor role elsewhere in classical Greece, being made into an aspect of Zeus's more usual consort, Hera — but never at Dodona.\n\nMany dedicatory inscriptions recovered from the site mention both \"Dione\" and \"Zeus Naios\".\n\nAccording to some archaeologists, not until the 4th century BCE, was a small stone temple to Dione added to the site. By the time Euripides mentioned Dodona (fragmentary play \"Melanippe\") and Herodotus wrote about the oracle, the priestesses appeared at the site.\n\nThough it never eclipsed the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, Dodona gained a reputation far beyond Greece. In the \"Argonautica\" of Apollonius of Rhodes, a retelling of an older story of Jason and the Argonauts, Jason's ship, the \"Argo\", had the gift of prophecy, because it contained an oak timber spirited from Dodona.\n\nIn c. 290 BCE, King Pyrrhus made Dodona the religious capital of his domain and beautified it by implementing a series of construction projects (i.e. grandly rebuilt the Temple of Zeus, developed many other buildings, added a festival featuring athletic games, musical contests, and drama enacted in a theatre). A wall was built around the oracle itself and the holy tree, as well as temples to Dione and Heracles.\n\nIn 219 BCE, the Aetolians, under the leadership of General Dorimachus, invaded and burned the temple to the ground. During the late 3rd century BCE, King Philip V of Macedon (along with the Epirotes) reconstructed all the buildings at Dodona. In 167 BCE, Dodona was destroyed by the Romans (led by Aemilius Paulus), but was later rebuilt by Emperor Augustus in 31 BCE. By the time the traveller Pausanias visited Dodona in the 2nd century CE, the sacred grove had been reduced to a single oak. In 241 CE, a priest named Poplius Memmius Leon organized the Naia festival of Dodona. In 362 CE, Emperor Julian consulted the oracle prior to his military campaigns against the Persians.\n\nPilgrims still consulted the oracle until 391-392 CE when Emperor Theodosius closed all pagan temples, banned all pagan religious activities, and cut down the ancient oak tree at the sanctuary of Zeus. Although the surviving town was insignificant, the long-hallowed pagan site must have retained significance for Christians given that a Bishop Theodorus of Dodona attended the First Council of Ephesus in 431 CE.\n\nHerodotus (\"Histories\" 2:54–57) was told by priests at Egyptian Thebes in the 5th century BCE \"that two priestesses had been carried away from Thebes by Phoenicians; one, they said they had heard was taken away and sold in Libya, the other in Hellas; these women, they said, were the first founders of places of divination in the aforesaid countries.\" The simplest analysis of the quote is: Egypt, for Greeks as well as for Egyptians, was a spring of human culture of all but immeasurable antiquity. This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say \"sibyls\" – were women.\n\nHerodotus follows with what he was told by the prophetesses, called \"peleiades\" (\"doves\") at Dodona:\nIn the simplest analysis, this was a confirmation of the oracle tradition in Egypt. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. Was the \"pel-\" element in their name connected with \"black\" or \"muddy\" root elements in names like \"Peleus\" or \"Pelops\"? Is that why the doves were black?\n\nHerodotus adds:\n\nThesprotia, on the coast west of Dodona, would have been available to the seagoing Phoenicians, whom readers of Herodotus would not have expected to have penetrated as far inland as Dodona.\n\nAccording to Strabo, the oracle was founded by the Pelasgi:\nThis oracle, according to Ephorus, was founded by the Pelasgi. And the Pelasgi are called the earliest of all peoples who have held dominion in Greece.\nThe site of the oracle was dominated by Mount Tomaros, the area being controlled by the Thesprotians and then the Molossians:\nIn ancient times, then, Dodona was under the rule of the Thesprotians; and so was Mount Tomaros, or Tmaros (for it is called both ways), at the base of which the temple is situated. And both the tragic poets and Pindaros have called Dodona 'Thesprotian Dodona.' But later on it came under the rule of the Molossoi.\nAccording to Pindar, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:\nAt the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus.\nPindar also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:\n...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”\nIn a fragment of Pindar we find the following:\nAmong the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called \"peliai\" and old men \"pelioi,\" as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries \"peligones\" (compare the \"gerontes\" among the Laconians and the Massaliotes). And this, it is said, is the origin of the myth about the pigeons [peleiades] in the Dodonaean oak-tree.\nAccording to Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, the epithet \"Neuos\" of Zeus at Dodona primarily designated \"the god of streams, and, generally, of water\". Jebb also points out that Achelous, as a water deity, received special honours at Dodona. The area of the oracle was quite swampy, with lakes in the area and reference to the \"holy spring\" of Dodona may be a later addition.\n\nJebb mostly follows Strabo in his analysis. Accordingly, he notes that the Selloi, the prophets of Zeus, were also called \"tomouroi\", which name derived from Mount Tomares. \"Tomouroi\" was also a variant reading found in the \"Odyssey\".\n\nAccording to Jebb, the Peleiades at Dodona were very early, and preceded the appointment of Phemonoe, the prophetess at Delphi. The introduction of female attendants probably took place in the fifth century. The timing of change is clearly prior to Herodotus (5th century BC), with his narrative about the doves and Egypt.\n\nAristotle (\"Meteorologica\", 1.14) places 'Hellas' in the parts about Dodona and the Achelous and says it was inhabited by \"the Selloi, who were formerly called Graikoi, but now Hellenes.\"\n\nThe alternative reading of \"Selloi\" is \"Helloi\". Aristotle clearly uses \"Dodona\" as the designation of the whole district in which the oracle was situated. Thus, according to some scholars, the origin of the words \"Hellenes\" and \"Hellas\" was from Dodona. Also, the word \"Greece\" may have been derived from this area.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13936750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13936750", "title": "Dream yoga", "text": "Dream yoga\n\nDream Yoga or Milam (Standard Tibetan: \"rmi-lam\" or \"nyilam\"; , \"svapnadarśana\")—the Yoga of the Dream State—is a suite of advanced tantric sadhana of the entwined Mantrayana lineages of Dzogchen (Nyingmapa, Ngagpa, Mahasiddha, Kagyu and Bönpo). Dream Yoga are tantric processes and techniques within the trance Bardos of Dream and Sleep () Six Yogas of Naropa.\nIn the tradition of the tantra, Dream Yoga method is usually passed on by a qualified teacher to his/her students after necessary initiation. Various Tibetan lamas are unanimous that it is more of a passing of an enlightened experience rather than any textual information.\n\nIn a footnote on 'Zhitro' (Tibetan: \"zhi khro\") Namdak & Dixey, \"et al.\" (2002: p. 124) identify that the 'dream body' and the 'bardo body' is the 'vision body' (Tibetan: \"yid lus\"):\n\nIn the bardo one has...the \"yilu\" (\"yid lus\"), the vision body (\"yid\", consciousness; \"lus\", body). It is the same as the body of dreams, the mind body.\"\n\nShugchang, \"et al.\" (2000: p. 17) frames the importance of dreams and dream yoga in relation to maya and gyulu of the Buddhist tradition originating from Buddha Shakyamuni:\n\nBuddha Shakyamuni often told his disciples to regard all phenomena as dreams. He used many examples, like an echo, a city in the clouds or a rainbow to illustrate the illusory nature of the phenomenal world. Dreams represent just one type of illusion. The whole universe arises and dissolves like a mirage. Everything about us, even the most enlightened qualities, are also dreamlike phenomena. There's nothing that is not encompassed within the dream of illusory being; so in going to sleep, you're just passing from one dream state to another.\nPadmasambhava (c. 8th century) received the transmission he codified as The Yoga of the Dream State from the mindstream of the mysterious siddha-yogi Lawapa (c. 10th century).\n\nIn the Kagyu 'Lineage of the Four Commissioners' (Tibetan: \"Ka-bab-shi-gyu-pa\"), the lineage stream of Dream Yoga is identified as originating from the Dharmakaya Buddha Vajradhara. The Dharmakaya, synonymous with Vajradhara Buddha, is the source of all the manifestations of enlightenment. From Caryapa, Tilopa (988 – 1069 CE) of the Dzogchen Kham lineage, \"received the oral instructions on Dream yoga according to the method of the Mahamaya-tantra.\" From Nagarjuna (c. 150 – 250 CE), Tilopa received the radiant light (Sanskrit: \"prabhasvara\") and Illusory Body (Sanskrit: \"maya deha\") teachings. The Illusory Body, Clear Light and Dream Yoga sadhana are entwined.\nDüsum Khyenpa, the First Karmapa, realised the 'absolute siddhi' of \"bodhi\" (Sanskrit: बोधि) at the age of 50 whilst engaged in Dream Yoga sadhana.\n\nThe Nyingma lineage holds that there are 'Seven transmissions' (Tibetan: \"bka' babs bdun\"), or 'sacred streams of blessing and empowerment' (Tibetan: \"dam pa'i byin rlabs\") that may iterate the mindstream of a tantrika. Transmission is a communion of mindstreams though at the substratum there is a mindstream 'singularity' or 'oneness' (Wylie: \"gcig\"). Though the fortuitous emergence of these seven modalities or channels of transmission may occur in the waking state if the time, space, circumstance and karmic connection is opportune; they may similarly be initiated in a lucid, dream yoga state. One transmission type particularly emphasized in relation to Dream Yoga, symbolism and iconography, and trance states, is that of 'pure vision' (Tibetan: \"dag snang\") and the perception of Sambhogakaya thoughtforms and yidam simulacrum.\n\nThe Nyingma tradition views itself as the fruit of three streams of transmission, one of which is the 'pure vision' which includes Dream Yoga and trance visions within its auspice:\n\nShugchang, \"et al.\" (2000: p. 16) whilst explaining Zhitro discuss the primary importance of lucid dreaming to the practice of Dream Yoga and pinpoint its four stages:\n\nTo make the time we spend dreaming more meaningful, we must first recognize that we are dreaming. That is the first exercise. The next step is called transforming the dream; the third is known as multiplying. The fourth practice is to unify the dream with the clear light. Recognizing, transforming, multiplying and unifying the dream with the luminosity of the true nature; these four outline the essential applications of dream yoga.\n\nEvans-Wentz describes Tibetan Dream Yoga in his book \"Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines\" (London: Oxford University Press, 1935) as one of the six subtypes of yoga elaborated by the Tibetan guru Marpa and passed down by his disciple Milarepa. The author describes six stages of dream yoga. In the first stage, the dreamer is told to become lucid in the dream. In the second stage, the dreamer is instructed to overcome all fear of the contents of the dream so there is the realization that nothing in the dream can cause harm. For instance, the lucid dreamer should put out the fire with his hands and realize fire cannot burn him in the dream. Next, the dreamer should contemplate how all phenomena both in the dream and in waking life are similar because they change, and that life is illusory in both states because of this constant change. Both the objects in the dream and objects in the world in the Buddhist worldview are therefore empty and have no substantial nature. This is the stage of contemplating the dream as maya, and equating this sense of maya with everyday experience in the external world. Next, The dreamer should realize that he or she has control of the dream by changing big objects into small ones, heavy objects into light ones, and many objects into one object.\n\nAfter gaining control over objects and their transformations, in the fifth stage, the dreamer should realize that the dreamer's dream body is as insubstantial as the other objects in the dream. The dreamer should realize that he or she is not the dream body. The dreamer who has gained complete control over dream objects could, for instance, alter the body's shape or make the dream body disappear altogether. Finally, in the sixth stage, the images of deities (Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, or Dakinis) should be visualized in the lucid dream state. These figures are frequently seen in Tibetan religious art (thangkas) and used in meditation. They are said to be linked to or resonate with the clear light of the Void. They can, therefore, serve as symbolic doorways to this mystical state of being (the Void or clear light). The dreamer is instructed to concentrate on these symbolic images without distraction or thinking about other things so that the revelatory side of these symbols will become manifest.\n\nYuthok \"et al.\" (1997: p. 229) states that:\n\n...if we do sadhanas regularly and faithfully we will begin to dream about doing them. In the same way, if we practise illusory body we will begin to dream about it, too. There is a great correspondence between dream yoga and illusory body. The more we think of illusory body, the more dreams we will have. We will see them as dreams, rather than mistaking them for real life. We can do many things in dreams which we are unable to do while awake.\nYuthok \"et al.\" (1997: p. 230) states that:\n\nPeople who have practised dream yoga have been able to visit teachers they missed and travel to lands they never managed to get to in the waking state. The dream state is a very pure state of mind.\nAccording to contemporary Dzogchen teachers Namkhai Norbu, Lopön Tenzin Namdak and Tenzin Wangyal, the perceived reality and the phenomenal world are considered to be ultimately \"unreal\"—an \"illusion\" (refer Mahamaya): a dream, a phantasmagoria, a thoughtform. All appearances and phenomena are a dream or thoughtform, inter- and intra- reflecting and refracting jewels and mirrors of possibility and potentiality, \"arising in relationships\" or \"dependent co-arising\". These lineages hold it and due to the realisations of the sadhana, that the dream of life and regular nightly dreams are not dissimilar, and that in their quintessential nature are non-dual. The non-essential difference between the general dreaming state and the general waking experience is that the latter is generally more concrete and linked with attachments, saṅkhāra and skandha; whereas, standard non-lucid dreaming is ephemeral and transient, and generally culturally reinforced as baseless and empty. In Dream Yoga, living may become the dream, and the dream may become the living. Progressing the sadhana may be metaphorically likened to living the scientific hypothesis of a resolved superposition. The resolved superposition being a mindstream conflation of Dharmakaya with Shunyata and Indra's net. The entwined Mantrayana lineages of Nyingmapa, Bonpo, Ngagpa and Mahasiddha are saturated with trance and dream transmissions of teachings, doctrine, etcetera that transcend constructs of time, place and space, these are often called \"whispered traditions\" and terma. Refer Lucid living.\n\nAlso according to this teaching, there is a correspondence between the states of sleep and dream and our experiences when we die. After experiences of the intermediate state of bardo an individual comes out of it, a new karmic illusion is created, and another existence begins. Taking stock of store consciousness is the spontaneous perpetuant and fuel of the transmigration process.\n\nThe primary aim and foundation of dream practice are to realize during a dream that one is dreaming. Once lucidity has been established the applications are limitless. One can then dream with lucidity and do all sorts of things, such as: practice sadhana; receive initiations, empowerments and transmissions; go to different places, planes and lokas, communicate with yidam; dialogue with sentient beings, creatures and people such as guru; fly; shapeshift, etc. It is also possible to do different yogic practices while dreaming (usually such yogic practices one does in waking state through the product and fruit of sadhana is greatly accelerated due to the learning, play and practice context). In this way, the yogi can have a powerful experience and with this comes an understanding of the dream-like nature of daily life. This is very relevant to diminishing attachments, because they are based on strong beliefs that life's perceptions and objects are real and, as a consequence, important. Dream yoga mastery not only assists in the complete realisation of shunyata, but also in the lila of Mahamaya. When one realises and embodies the Shunyata Doctrine of Buddha Shakyamuni and Nagarjuna amongst others forded by Dream Yoga and other advanced sadhana, a complete realisation is imminent and elementary.\n\nNamkhai Norbu gives advice, that the realization that the life is only a big dream can help us finally liberate ourselves from the chains of emotions, attachments, and ego and then we have the possibility of ultimately becoming enlightened.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13873", "title": "Halakha", "text": "Halakha\n\nHalakha (; , ; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) ( ) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. Halakha is based on biblical laws or \"commandments\" (\"mitzvot\") (traditionally numbered as 613), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law, and the customs and traditions compiled in the many books, one of the most famous of which is the 16th-century \"Shulchan Aruch\" (literally \"Prepared Table\").\n\n\"Halakha\" is often translated as \"Jewish Law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word derives from the root that means \"to behave\" (also \"to go\" or \"to walk\"). \"Halakha\" guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but also numerous aspects of day-to-day life.\n\nHistorically, in the Jewish diaspora, \"halakha\" served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law – both civil and religious, since no differentiation exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (\"Haskalah\") and Jewish emancipation many have come to view the \"halakha\" as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the pure, written words recorded in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nUnder contemporary Israeli law, certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so are treated according to \"halakha\". Some differences in \"halakha\" itself are found among Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite, and other Jews who historically lived in isolated communities, such as in Ethiopia, reflecting the historic and geographic diversity of various Jewish communities within the Diaspora.\n\nThe word \"halakha\" is derived from the Hebrew root \"halakh\" – \"to walk\" or \"to go\". Taken literally, therefore, \"halakha\" translates as \"the way to walk\" rather than \"law\". The word \"halakha\" refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law.\n\nThe term may also be related to Akkadian ', a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as ', designating one or several obligations.\n\n\"Halakha\" is often contrasted with \"aggadah\" (\"the telling\"), the diverse corpus of rabbinic exegetical, narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other \"non-legal\" texts. At the same time, since writers of \"halakha\" may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. \"Halakha\" also does not include the parts of the Torah not related to commandments.\n\n\"Halakha\" constitutes the practical application of the 613 \"mitzvot\" (\"commandments\") in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical rabbinic literature, especially the Mishnah and the Talmud (the \"Oral Torah\") and as codified in the Mishneh Torah (\"Repetition of the Torah\") or \"Shulchan Aruch\" (\"Code of Law\").\n\nBecause \"halakha\" is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole \"official voice\", different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the Jewish diaspora, Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for \"halakha\".\n\n\"Halakha\" has been developed throughout the generations since before 500 BCE, in a constantly expanding collection of rabbinic literature initially consolidated in the Talmud. First and foremost, it forms a body of intricate judicial (rabbinical) opinions, legislation, customs, and recommendations, many of them passed down over the centuries, and an assortment of ingrained behaviors, relayed to successive generations from the moment a child begins to speak. It is also the subject of intense study in \"yeshivas\".\n\nBroadly, the \"halakha\" comprises the practical application of the 613 \"mitzvot\" in the Torah, as developed in subsequent rabbinic literature. According to the Talmud (\"Tractate Makot\"), 613 \"mitzvot\" are in the Torah, 248 positive (\"thou shall\") \"mitzvot\" and 365 negative (\"thou shall not\") \"mitzvot\", supplemented by seven \"mitzvot\" legislated by the rabbis of antiquity.\n\nClassical Rabbinic Judaism has two basic categories of laws:\n\nThis division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation. Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.\n\nA second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the Hebrew Bible, and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n\nCommandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments \"require\" an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) \"forbid\" a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.\n\nA further division is made between \"chukim\" (\"decrees\" – laws without obvious explanation, such as \"shatnez\", the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), \"mishpatim\" (\"judgments\" – laws with obvious social implications) and \"eduyot\" (\"testimonies\" or \"commemorations\", such as the Shabbat and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.\n\nA different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:\n\nWithin Talmudic literature, Jewish law is divided into the six orders of the Mishnah, which are categories by proximate subject matter: \"Zeraim\" (\"Seeds\") for agricultural laws and prayer, \"Moed\" (\"Festival\"), for the Sabbath and the Festivals, \"Nashim\" (\"Women\"), dealing primarily with marriage and divorce,\" Nezikin \"(\"Damages\"), for civil and criminal law,\" Kodashim\" (\"Holy things\"), for sacrifices and the dietary laws, and \"Tohorot\" (\"Purities\") for ritual purity. However, Talmudic texts often deal with laws outside these apparent subject categories. As a result, Jewish law came to be categorized in other ways in the post-Talmudic period.\n\nIn the major codes of Jewish law, two other main categorization schemes are found. Maimonides' \"Mishneh Torah\" divides the laws into 14 sections. The codification efforts that culminated in the \"Shulchan Aruch\" divide the law into four sections, including only laws that do not depend on being physically present in the Land of Israel.\n\nJudaism regards the violation of the commandments, the \"mitzvot\", to be a sin. The generic Hebrew word for any kind of sin is \"aveira\" (\"transgression\"). Based on the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) Judaism describes three levels of sin:\n\nRelatedly, the three terms – \"chayyav, patur, mutar\" – in the Gemara (literally: \"the finished [word]\") and Halakhic codes classify the permissibility of an action or the severity of its prohibition and punishment.\n\nJudaism understands that the vast majority of people, aside from those who are termed \"Tzadikim\" and those termed \"Tzadikim gemurim\" (Hebrew: צדיק, \"the righteous\" and \"the completely righteous\"), will succumb to sin in their lives. A sin or a state of sin does not condemn a person to damnation; a road of \"teshuva\" (Hebrew: תשובה; repentance, literally: \"return\") is always present. For some classes of people, this is exceedingly difficult, such as those who commit adultery, as well as those who slander others.\n\nIn earlier days, when ancient Jews had a functioning court system (the \"beth din\" and the \"Sanhedrin\" high court), courts were empowered to administer physical punishments for various violations, upon conviction by extremely high standards of evidence, far stricter than those required in western courts today. These punishments included execution, corporal punishment, incarceration, and excommunication. However, since the fall of the Second Temple, executions have been forbidden. Since the fall of the autonomous Jewish communities of Europe, most other punishments also have been discontinued.\n\nToday, then, one's accounts are reckoned solely by God. The Talmud says that although courts capable of executing sinners no longer exist, the prescribed penalties continue to be applied by Providence. For instance, someone who has committed a sin punishable by stoning might fall off a roof, or someone who ought to be executed by strangulation might drown.\n\nThe Seven Laws of Noah, also referred to as the Noahide Laws or the Noachide Laws, are a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God as a binding set of laws for the \"children of Noah\" – that is, all of humanity.\n\nThe development of \"halakha\" in the period before the Maccabees, which has been described as the formative period in the history of its development, is shrouded in obscurity. Y. Baer (in Zion, 17 (1951–52), 1–55) has argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of Bava Kamma, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.\n\nThe boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of \"halakha\" as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of \"halakha\" consulted include:\n\nIn antiquity, the \"Sanhedrin\" functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews—rulings of the Sanhedrin became \"halakha\"; see Oral law. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow \"halakha\", lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.\n\nSince the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, \"halakha\" has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic \"posek\" (literally \"he who makes a statement\", \"decisor\") proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.\n\nUnder this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in \"halakha\" not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or vow, unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the \"posek\" handling a then-current question. In addition, the \"halakha\" embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).\n\nNotwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in \"halakha\". Notably, \"poskim\" frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a \"change\" in \"halakha\". For example, many Orthodox rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative \"poskim\" consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by \"halakha\") than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative Judaism in some cases explicitly interprets \"halakha\" to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see How halakha is viewed today below).\n\nWithin certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the Rabbinical Council of America. Within Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly has an official Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.\n\nNote that Takkanot, the plural form of \"Takkanah\" above, in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah \"mitzvot\". (In common parlance sometimes people use the general term \"takkanah\" to refer either \"gezeirot\" or \"takkanot\".) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to \"uproot matters from the Torah\". In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (\"shev v'al ta'aseh\", literally \"thou shall stay seated and not do\"). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e.g. blowing the \"shofar\" on Shabbat, or taking the \"lulav and etrog\" on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath \"melakha\". Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for Esther's relationship with Ahasuerus (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article Takkanah. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism see Conservative halakha.\n\nThe antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (from Aramaic, literally \"repeater\") to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (literally \"measurements\", and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.\n\nThe Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim (\"Sages\") regarded them as Sinaitic (given by God to the people of Israel at the time of the Sinai presence). Modern historians believe that it is decidedly erroneous to consider the middot as traditional from the time of Moses on Sinai.\n\nThe middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. Akiba and Ishmael and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. Akiba devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiba, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.\n\nSome scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael's \"middot\" (e.g. \"kal vahomer\", literally a combination of the archaic form of the word for \"straw\" and the word for \"clay\" – \"straw and clay\", referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those \"middot\" are not Greek in origin.\n\nOrthodox Judaism holds that \"halakha\" is the divine law as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs combined. The rabbis, who made many additions and interpretations of Jewish Law, did so only in accordance with regulations they believe were given for this purpose to Moses on Mount Sinai, see Deuteronomy 17:11. See Orthodox Judaism, Beliefs about Jewish law and tradition.\n\nConservative Judaism holds that \"halakha\" is normative and binding, and is developed as a partnership between people and God based on Sinaitic Torah. While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that \"halakha\" is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See Conservative Judaism, Beliefs.\n\nReform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism both hold that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the traditionalist wing of these movements believe that the \"halakha\" represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person.\n\nThose in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counterproductive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even heretical, by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.\n\nHumanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe \"that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old\". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.\n\nDespite its internal rigidity, \"halakha\" has a degree of flexibility in finding solutions to modern problems that are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a \"sense of continuity between past and present, a self evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition.\" According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger’s book \"Rabbinic Authority\", the authority that rabbis hold “derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a \"communal\" decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.” Given this covenental relationship, rabbis are charged with connecting their contemporary community with the traditions and precedents of the past.\n\nWhen presented with contemporary issues, rabbis go through a halakhic process to find an answer. The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of electricity on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to \"consult your local rabbi or posek\". This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed onto higher rabbis who will then issue a \"teshuvot\", which is a \"responsa\" that is binding. Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other's work so as to maintain the truest sense of \"halakha\". Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life. Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the \"divine\" authority of \"halakha\", traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.\n\nOrthodox Jews maintain \"halakha\" is derived from the divine law of the Torah (Bible), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs combined. As such it should be adhered to as an unalterable authority. They also believe there are traditional formulas that date back to Moses on how the divine law may be interpreted – see above, \"Rules by which early Jewish law was derived\". Conservative Jews have varied views regarding the origin of the Torah and its authority today, and believe it can be continuously reinterpreted. Their view of \"halakha\" has given rise to substantial differences in approach as well as result.\n\nOrthodox Jews believe that \"halakha\" is a religious system whose core represents the revealed will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is non-specific, they did so only in accordance with regulations given to them by Moses on Mount Sinai (see Deuteronomy 5:8–13). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the Second Temple. They were then recorded in the Mishnah, and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history, including today. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as Mishneh Torah and the Shulchan Aruch. No rabbi has the right to change Jewish law unless he clearly understands how it coincides with the precepts of the Talmud and later codes of Jewish law. Later commentaries were accepted by many rabbis as final; however, other rabbis may disagree. \n\nOrthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and extent to which change is permissible. Haredi Jews generally hold that even \"minhagim\" (customs) must be retained and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. Modern Orthodox authorities are generally more inclined to permit limited changes in customs, and some reconsideration of precedent. All Orthodox authorities, however, agree that only later rabbinical interpretations are subject to reconsideration, and hold that core sources of Divine written and oral law, such as the Torah the Mishnah and the Talmud, cannot be overridden.\n\nOne view held by Conservative Judaism is that while God is real, the Torah is not the word of God in a literal sense. However, in this view the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's revelation, and thus still has divine authority. In this view, traditional Jewish law is still seen as binding. Jews who hold to this view generally try to use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are in some cases more willing to change Jewish law in the present.\n\nA key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body's powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by \"takkanah\" (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the \"driving teshuva\", which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on Mamzer status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of \"Kavod HaBriyot\" permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the Bible and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the role of women in Judaism, including counting women in the minyan, permitting women to chant from the Torah, and ordaining women as rabbis. The latter was accomplished by simple vote on the faculty of the JTS. Orthodox Judaism holds that \"takkanot\" (rabbinical decrees) can only supplement and can never nullify Biblical law, and significant decisions must be accompanied by scholarly responsa citing sources and halakhic precedent.\n\nAn example of how different views of the origin of Jewish law inform Conservative approaches to interpreting that law involves the CJLS's acceptance of rabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz's responsum decreeing the Biblical category of \"mamzer\" as \"inoperative\", in which The CJLS adopted the Responsum's view that of how, in the Conservative view of \"halakha\", the \"morality which we learn through the unfolding narrative of our tradition\" informs the application of Mosaic law:\n\nThe responsum cited several examples of how, in Spitz's view, the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the \"trial of the accused adulteress (Sotah)\", the \"Law of the Breaking of the Neck of the Heifer\" and the application of the death penalty for the \"rebellious child\". Spitz argues that the punishment of the Mamzer has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction (with a few rule-proving counterexamples, including the 18th century Orthodox rabbi Ismael ha-Kohen of Modena, who decreed that a child should have the word \"mamzer\" tattooed to his forehead). Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on \"mamzerut\". His motion was passed by the CJLS.\n\nThe decision represented a watershed for Conservative Judaism because it represented an explicit abrogation of a Biblical injunction on the grounds of contemporary morality, as distinct from exigency. The dissenters, who included rabbi Joel Roth as well as a partial concurrence by rabbi Daniel Nevins, argued for reaffirming the classical halakhic framework in which human decrees inform and often limit but never wholly abrogate law believed to be of Divine origin, stating that \"we should acknowledge that God's law is beyond our authority to eliminate\", but should continue the traditional approach of applying strict evidentiary rules and presumptions that tend to render enforcement unlikely. He also argued that the current framework is moral, both because proving mamzer status sufficiently beyond all doubt is already so difficult that it is rare, and because the mere existence and possibility of mamzerut status, even if rarely enforced, creates an important incentive for divorcing parties to obtain a get (Jewish religious divorce) to avoid the sin of adultery. He cited a responsum by prominent Haredi Orthodox rabbi Ovadiah Yosef as an example of how the traditional approach works. Rabbi Yosef was faced with the child of a woman who had left a religious marriage without religious divorce and had a child in the second marriage, seemingly an open-and-shut case of Mamzer status. Rabbi Yosef proceeded to systematically discredit the evidence that the former marriage had ever taken place. The Ketubah was mysteriously not found and hence disqualified, and the officiating rabbi's testimony was never sufficiently corroborated and hence not credible. Rabbi Yosef then found reason to doubt that the new husband was ever the father, finding that because the ex-husband occasionally delivered alimony personally, an ancient presumption (one of many) that any time a husband and wife are alone together the law presumes intercourse has taken place governed the case. He held that Jewish law could not disprove, and hence had to conclude, that the original husband really was the child's father and there was no case of Mamzer status.\n\nThere are many formal codes of Jewish law that have developed over the past two thousand years. These codes have influenced, and in turn, have been influenced by, the \"responsa\"; History of Responsa thus provides an informative complement to the survey below. The Torah and the Talmud are not formal codes of law - they are sources of law.\n\nThe major codes of Jewish law:\n\n\n"}

Each period has seen a progressive decline in morality, to the point that in Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or \"kalpas\". Each kalpa lasts 8.64 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for Brahma, who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by the vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavism. Some Shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world.\n\nAfter this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a singularity and then again will expand from that single point, as the ages continue in a religious fractal pattern.\n\nWithin the current \"kalpa\", there are four \"yugas\", or epochs, that encompass the evolution of this specific cycle. These ages encompass a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total decay.\n\n\nKali Yuga, the last of the four ages, is the one in which we currently reside. This epoch has been foretold to be characterized by impiety, violence, and decay.

Undisciplined barbarians will receive the support of rulers.\n\nFrom the four pillars of dharma—penance, charity, truthfulness, and compassion—charity will be all that remains, although it too will decrease daily. People will commit sin in mind, speech and action. Plague, famine, pestilence and natural calamities will appear. People will not believe one another, falsehoods will win disputes and brothers will become avaricious. As the each age progresses, the human life span decreases, starting from thousands of years in the Krutha Yuga to 100 years in the current Kali Yuga.\n\nSannyasins will wear red. There will be many false religions, and many will profess false knowledge to earn their livelihood. Life will be short and miserable. Marriage will be for pleasure alone. Being dry of water will be the only definition of land, and any hard to reach water will define a pilgrimage destination. People will hide in valleys between mountains, and suffering from cold and exposure, people will wear clothes of tree bark and leaves. People will live less than twenty-three years and the pretense of greatness will be the proof of it. Ultimately, humankind will be destroyed.\n\nAt this time of evil, the final incarnation of Vishnu known as Kalki will appear on a white horse. He will amass an army of those few pious souls remaining. These, together with all the incarnations of the Godhead (avatars) which have appeared throughout human history, will destroy all demons and sins in the world.\n\nAs written in the Gita:<br>\n<poem>:Yadaa Yadaa hi Dharmasya Glaanir bhavati Bhaarata\n\nAditi is the mother of the eight Adityas or solar deities. At the end of creation these eight suns will shine together in the skies. Kalki will amass an army to \"establish righteousness upon the earth\" and leave \"the minds of the people as pure as crystal.\" Those left, transformed by virtue, will be the new seeds for a higher form of humanity, and humanity will begin again.\n\nPuranas write: \n\nAt the completion of Kali Yuga, the next epoch will begin, Satya Yuga, in which everyone will be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma and piety. This, in turn, will be followed cyclically by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will repeat till the larger cycle of existence under Brahma returns to the singularity and a new universe is born.\n\nWithin Hinduism, there are more distinguishing scenarios in certain sects. Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi of the Brahma Kumari has written that their prediction of the imminent end of the world is hidden from non-members. Within their tradition, the majority of the planet is predicted to become submerged beneath the ocean, similar to the Ragnarök of Nordic mythology.\n\nSri Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami, wrote 400 years ago in his \"Divya Maha Kala Gnana,\" or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.\n\n"}
{"id": "15514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15514", "title": "Iblis", "text": "Iblis\n\nThe term \"Iblis\" () may have been derived from the Arabic verbal root (with the broad meaning of \"remain in grief\") or \"(\", \"he despaired\"). Furthermore, the name is related to \"talbis\" meaning confusion. Another possibility is that it is derived from Ancient Greek \"()\", which is also the source of the English word 'devil'. However, there is no general agreement on the root of the term. The name itself could not be found before the Quran.\n\nAlthough Iblis is often compared to the devil in Christian theology, Islam rejects the idea that the devil is an opponent of God. Furthermore, there is no mention of Iblis trying to take God's throne. According to the Quran he was banished due to his disdain towards humanity, a narrative already occurring in early apokrypha. As a mere creature, Iblis can not be the cause or creator of evil in the world, he is just a tempter who takes advantage of the inclination of humans to be self-centered and to lead them away from God's path.\n\nIblis is mentioned 11 times in the Quran by name, 9 times related to his rebellion against God's command to prostrate himself before Adam. The term Shaitan is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as Shaitan the terms are not interchangeable. The different fragments of Iblis' story are scattered across the Quran, in the aggregate the story can be summarized as follows :\n\nThen God created Adam, He ordered all the angels to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam. For his haughtiness, he was banished from heaven and condemned to hell. Therefore, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants. God grants his request but also warned that he will have no power over God's servants.\n\nSufism developed an unusual perspective of Iblis' refusal by regarding Muhammed and Iblis as the two true monotheists. Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was fully devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the satanic figure, dualism is also degraded, that corresponds with the Sufi cosmology of unity of existence rejecting dualistic tendecies. The belief in dualism or that \"Evil\" is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as \"shirk\" by some Sufis. For Iblis' preference to be damned to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for unrequited love.\n\nA famous narration about an encounter between Moses and Iblis on the slopes of Sinai, told by Mansur al-Hallaj, Ruzbihan Baqli and Ghazzali, emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a devil. Iblis responds, his form is just temporary and his love towards God remains the same.\n\nHowever, not all Sufis are in agreement with a positive depiction of Iblis. Rumi's viewpoint on Iblis is much more in tune with Islamic orthodoxy. Rumi views Iblis as the manifestation of the great sins haughtiness and envy. He states: \"(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam.\" Iblis represents the principle of \"one-eyed\" intellect; he only saw the outward earthly form of Adam, but was blind to the Divine spark hidden in him, using an illicit method of comparison. Hasan of Basra holds that Iblis was the first who used \"analogy\", comparing himself to someone else, this causing his sin. Iblis therefore also represents humans' psyche moving towards sin or shows how love can cause envy and anxiety losing a beloved one.\n\nIslam differs in regard of Iblis' nature. Some scholars such as Tabari, Ash'ari, Al-Baydawi and Mahmud al-Alusi, regard him as an angel. Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his tafsir: \"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state that He created the angels from any like of that. And God states he was of the jinn, so they said that it is not possible that he should be related to that which God does not relate him to; they said that Iblis had progeny and offspring, but the angels do not procreate or have children.\n\nBut these reasons only bespeak the weakness of these people's knowledge, for there is nothing objectionable in that God should have created the categories of His angels from all kinds of things that He had created: He created some of them from light, some of them from fire, and some of them from what He willed apart from that. There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring , because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was <one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the Quranic exegete Ibn Kathir, preferred to regard him as a jinni, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, Ja'far al-Sadiq,Al-Zamakhshari and Al-Munajjid, stating in his tafsir:\n\n\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying- and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, (. . .)\n\nWhen matters crucial every vessel leaks that which to contains and is betrayed by its true nature. Iblis used to do, what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship, so he was included when they were addressed, but he disobeyed and went what he was told to do. So Allah points out here that he was one of the Jinn, he was created from fire, as He says elsewhere.\"\n\nThe theological viewpoints can be summarized as follows:\n\nAs an angel, Iblis is described as an Archangel, the leader and teacher of the other angels, and a keeper of heaven. At the same time, he was the closest to the Throne of God. God gave him authority over the lower heavens and the earth. Iblis is also considered as the leader of those angels who battled the earthly jinn. Therefore, Iblis and his army drove the jinn to the edge of the world, Mount Qaf. Knowing about the corruption of the former earthen inhabitants, Iblis protested, when he was instructed to prostrate himself before the new earthen inhabitant, that is Adam. He assumed that the angels who \"praise God's glory day and night\" are superior in contrast to the mud-made human and their bodily flaws. He even regarded himself superior in comparison to the other angels, since he was (one of those) created from fire. However, he was degraded by God for his arrogance. But Iblis made a request to prove that he is actually right, therefore God entrusted him as a tempter for humanity as long as his punishment endures, concurrently giving him a change to redeem himself. Thus, his abode in hell could be a merely temporary place, until the Judgement Day and after his assignment as a tempter is over, he might return to God as one of the most cherished Angels, but this is not necessary.\n\nFurthermore, the transformation of Iblis from angelic into demonic is a reminder of God's capacity to reverse injustice even on an ontological level. It is both a warning and a reminder because the special gifts given by God can also be taken away by him.\n\nOn the other hand, as a jinni, Iblis is commonly placed as one of the jinn, who lived on earth during the battle of the angels. When the angels took prisoners, Iblis was one of them and carried to heaven. Since he, unlike the other jinn, was pious, the angels were impressed by his nobility and Iblis was allowed to join the company of angels and elevated to their rank. However, although he got the outer appeariance of an angel, he was still a jinn in essence, thus he was able to choose when the angels and Iblis were commanded to prostrate themselves before Adam. Iblis, abusing his free-will, disobeyed the command of God. Iblis considered himself superior because of his physical nature constituted of fire and not of clay. God sentenced Iblis to hell forever, but granted him a favor for his former worship, that is to take revenge on humans by attempting to mislead them until the Day of Judgment. Here, Iblis damnation is clear and he and his host are the first who enter hell to dwell therein forever, when he is not killed in a battle by the Mahdi, an interpretation especially prevalent among Shia Muslims.\n\nIllustrations of Iblis in Islamic paintings often depict him black-faced, a feature which would later symbolize any Satanic figure or heretic, and with a black body, to symbolize his corrupted nature. Another common depiction of Iblis shows him wearing special headcovering, clearly different from the traditional Islamic turban. In one painting however, Iblis wears a traditional Islamic headcovering. The turban probably refers to a narration of Iblis' fall: there he wore a turban, then he was sent down from heaven.\n\nIslamic traditions are undecided about the exact nature of Iblis. He may either be a fallen angel or a jinni or something entirely unique. These contradictions arise from the Quran itself, while Iblis is included into the command addressed to the angels and apparently among them, he is identified as a \"jinni\" ('الجِنِّ') in Surah . This combined with the fact, he himself boasts to be created from fire (nar), suggests that he is not an angel but a jinni, since according to \"hadith\" the angels are created from \"light\" (nur) and the jinn from \"fire\" (nar). But the term \"jinni\" itself is ambiguous. In Pre-Islamic Arabia the term denoted any type of invisible creature including angels known from Arab Christians, Arab Jews and Zorastrians. Additionally, the Quran does not mention \"light\" as a separate source from which the angels are supposed to be created. In Ancient Near Eastern traditions, the nature of angels was associated with fire, therefore Iblis could indeed be intended to represent an angel, such as a Seraphim. \n\nOtherwise, the nature of the jinn in later Islamic tradition is not always clear either. Some hold the jinn to be a sub-category of \"fiery angels\" who are guardians of \"jannah\", differing from the earthly jinn, who are like monsters or demons. Accordingly they are named 'Jinni', because of their relation to heaven. On the other hand, in another story, the earthen jinn themselves are related to angels. Therefore, they were angels sent down to earth to experience bodily pleasure and although they remained obedient towards God during the beginning, they later found themselves lost in wars, bloodshed, and other unjust deeds. Iblis, disgusted from his fellow beings, prayed for his return to heaven until his prayers were answered.\n\nAssuming Iblis was one of the jinn, who differ from the angels, scholars tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by Ibn Kathir, Iblis was once an ordinary earthly creature, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousand of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. To reveal his haughtiness, God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam. But Iblis refused, thus his own nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.\n\nOther scholars, such as Hasan of Basra and Ibn Taymiyyah, do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels. In this case, his stay in heaven is self explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the Forbidden Tree.\n\nThose scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since, angels do not procreate in Islam, pointing at . Islamic study scholar Fritz Meier also insist, that the Islamic Iblis can not be hold as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition. Otherwise Walther Eickmann argued that the \"progeny of Iblis\" does not correspond with \"progeny\" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis. Actually, according to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is indeed an asexuel being just like the other angels. On the other hand, he occurs as a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, for that he lays eggs, characteristical for Shayatin (demons). The Quran exegete Tabari however, who defends Iblis' angelic origin, asserts, that Iblis did not procreate until he lost his angelic state and became a demon. Therefore, the fact Iblis has progeny could not exclude him from an angelic origin.\n\nAnother central argument to determine Iblis essence, also relating to his theological significance, deals with his disobedience. Since angels are, according to Islam, merely servants of God, Iblis' disobedience speaks against his angelic nature, as opponents of Iblis' angelic origin argue. Unlike the angels, he was endowed with the ability to choose, but he decided to disobey due to his own arrogance. His nature to disregard God is thought of a part of the free-will given to jinn. On the otherhand, scholars who adhere to Iblis' angelic nature, do not regard him as \"free\". Actually Iblis is seen as just another instrument of God, a tester who acts within God's plan. It would be impossible to act against God's will anyway. Therefore, his disobedience was in accordance with God's will. Several narratives attempt to explain the reason why he choose to refuse the command, unlike the other angels. According to one, Iblis, as the teachers of the angels, was more knowledgeable than the others and knew about a command, not to prostrate himself, when all the other angels do. In another narrative, Iblis has stolen the secret writings of heaven, therefore he had insight into the future. Knowing about Adams future, he was no longer able to prostrate himself. However, this narrative is more unconvincing, since other angels protested alike, knowing about the corruption. In another explanation, Iblis is endowed with the task to seduce humans, comparable to other angels, such as Gabriel is endowed with the transmission of revelation, and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.\n\nIn some interpretations, Iblis is associated with \"light\" that misleads people. Hasan of Basra was quoted as saying: \"If Iblis were to reveal his light to mankind, they would worship him as god.\" Additionally, based on Iblis' role as \"keeper of heaven\" and \"ruler of earth\", Ayn al-Quzat Hamadani stated, Iblis represents the \"Dark light\" that is the earthen world, standing in opposite to the Muhammadan Light that represents the heavens. Quzat Hamadani traces back his interpretation to Sahl al-Tustari and Shayban Ar-Ra'i who in return claim to derive their opinions from Khidr. Quzat Hamadani relates his interpretation of \"Iblis' light\" to the \"shahada\": Accordingly, people whose service for God is just superficial, are trapped within the circle of \"la ilah\" (the first part of \"shahada\" meaning \"there is no God\") just worshipping their nafs rather than God. Only those who are worthy to leave this circle, can pass Iblis towards the circle of \"illa Allah\" the Divine presence.\n\nAlthough the Serpent is not mentioned in the Quran, Quranic commentaries as well as the Stories of the Prophets added the serpent borrowed from Gnostic and Jewish oral tradition circulating in the Arabian Peninsula. Iblis tries to enter the abode of Adam, but the angelic guardian keeps him away. Then Iblis invents a plan to trick the guardian. He approaches a peacock and tells him that all creatures will die and the peacock's beauty will perish. But if he gets the fruit of eternity, every creature will last forever. Therefore, the peacock convinces the serpent to slip Iblis into the Garden, by carrying him in his mouth. In the Garden, Iblis speaks through the serpent to Adam and Eve, and tricks them into eating from the forbidden tree. Modern Muslims accuse the Yazidis of devil-worship for venerating the peacock.\n\nIn Umm al Kitab, an Ismaili work offering an hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran, the \"peacock\" and the \"serpent\" were born after men mated with demonic women.\n\n"}

{"id": "2360572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2360572", "title": "Islamic schools and branches", "text": "Islamic schools and branches\n\nThis article summarizes the different branches and schools in Islam. The best known split, into Sunni Islam, Shia Islam, and Kharijites, was mainly political at first but eventually acquired theological and juridical dimensions. There are three traditional types of schools in Islam: schools of jurisprudence, Sufi orders and schools of theology. The article also summarizes major denominations and movements that have arisen in the modern era.\n\nThe traditional divisions between the branches of Islam can be traced back to disagreement over who would succeed Muhammad. A few months prior to his death, Muhammad delivered a sermon at Ghadir Khumm where he announced that Ali ibn Abi Talib would be his successor. After the sermon, Muhammad ordered the Muslims to pledge allegiance to Ali. Both Shia and Sunni sources agree that Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, and Uthman ibn Affan were among the many who pledged allegiance to Ali at this event. However, just after Muhammad died, a group of Muslims met at Saqifa, where Umar pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr then assumed political power, and his supporters became known as the Sunnis. Despite that, a group of Muslims kept their allegiance to Ali. These people, who became known as Shias, held that while Ali's right to be the political leader may have been taken, he was still the religious and spiritual leader after Muhammad.\n\nEventually, after the deaths of Abu Bakr and two other Sunni leaders, Umar and Uthman, the Sunni Muslims went to Ali for political leadership. After Ali died, his son Hasan ibn Ali succeeded him, both politically and, according to Shias, religiously. However, after six months, he made a peace treaty with Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan, which stipulated that, among other conditions, Muawiya would have political power as long as he did not choose who would succeed him. Muawiya broke the treaty and named his son Yazid ibn Muawiya his successor, thus forming the Umayyad dynasty. While this was going on, Hasan and, after his death, his brother Husain ibn Ali, remained the religious leaders, at least according to the Shia. Thus, according to Sunnis, whoever held political power was considered the successor to Muhammad, while according to Shias, the twelve Imams (Ali, Hasan, Husain, and Husain's descendants) were the successors to Muhammad, even if they did not hold political power.\n\nIn addition to these two main branches, many other opinions also formed regarding succession to Muhammad.\n\nThe first centuries of Islam gave rise to three major sects: Sunnis, Shias, and Kharijites. The original difference between Sunnis and Shias is over who the true successor to Muhammad is. Shias believe Ali ibn Abi Talib is the true successor to Muhammad, while Sunnis consider Abu Bakr to hold that position. The Khawarij broke away from both the Shias and Sunnis during the First Fitna (the first Islamic Civil War) and subsequently opposed both the Shias and the Sunnis, often violently.\n\nIn addition, there are several differences within Sunni Islam and Shia Islam. Sunni Islam is separated into four main schools of jurisprudence, namely, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali. These schools are named after Abu Hanifa, Anas bin Malik, al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, respectively.\n\nShia Islam, on the other hand, is separated into three major sects: Twelvers, Ismailis, and Zaydis. The vast majority of Shias are Twelvers (a 2012 estimate puts the figure as 94% of Shias being Twelvers) to the extent that the term \"Shia\" frequently refers to Twelvers by default. The Twelver Shias are also notably the only sect of Muslims that complies with the saying of Muhammad that he would have twelve successors, a saying accepted by both Shia and Sunni Muslims.\n\nAll Twelver Shia Muslims follow the same school of thought, the Jafari school of thought (named after Jafar as-Sadiq, the sixth Shia Imam). All four founders of the Sunni schools of thought gained knowledge, either directly or indirectly, through Jafar as-Sadiq.\n\nZaydis, also known as Fivers, do not follow the Jafari school of thought, but instead the Zayidi school of thought (named after Zayd ibn Ali). Ismailis are further divided into two groups, Tayyibi Ismailis and Nizari Ismailis. The term \"Ismaili\" frequently refers to Nizari Ismailis, while Tayyibi Ismailis are called Bohras and split between Da'udi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, and Alavi Bohras.\n\nSimilarly, Kharijites were initially divided into five major branches: Sufris, Azariqa, Najdat, Adjarites and Ibadis. Of these, Ibadis are the only surviving branch of Kharijites.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned sections, new schools of thought and movements like Quranist Muslims, and African American Muslims later emerged independently.\n\nSunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam and are known as \"Ahl as-Sunnah wa'l-Jamā'h\" or simply as \"Ahl as-Sunnah\". The word \"Sunni\" comes from the word \"sunnah\", which means the teachings and actions or examples of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Therefore, \"Sunni\" refers to those who follow or maintain the \"sunnah\" of Muhammad. In many countries, overwhelming majorities of Muslims are Sunnis, so that they simply refer to themselves as \"Muslims\" and do not use the Sunni label.\n\nThe Sunnis believe that Muhammad did not specifically appoint a successor to lead the Muslim \"ummah\" (community) before his death, and after an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent companions gathered and elected Abu Bakr, Muhammad's close friend and a father-in-law, as the first \"caliph\" of Islam. Sunni Muslims regard the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, Uthman Ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abu Talib) as \"al-Khulafā'ur-Rāshidūn\" or \"The Rightly Guided Caliphs.\" Sunnis also believe that the position of caliph may be attained democratically, on gaining a majority of the votes, but after the Rashidun, the position turned into a hereditary dynastic rule because of the divisions started by the Umayyads and others. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, there has never been another caliph as widely recognized in the Muslim world.\n\nIn recent times, followers of the classical Sunni schools of jurisprudence and \"kalam\" (rationalistic theology) on one hand and Salafis, who follow a literalist reading of early Islamic sources, on the other, have laid competing claims to represent orthodox Sunni Islam. Anglophone Islamic currents of the former type are sometimes referred to as \"traditional Islam\".\n\nShia Islam ( \"Shia\", sometimes \"Shi'a\"; adjective \"Shia\"/\"Shi'ite\") is the second-largest denomination of Islam, comprising 10–13% of the total Muslim population in the world. Shia Muslims, though a minority in the Muslim world, constitute the majority of the Muslim populations in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain and Azerbaijan as well as significant minorities in Kuwait, Yemen and Lebanon. In addition to believing in the authority of the Qur'an and teachings of Muhammad, Shia believe that Muhammad's family, the Ahl al-Bayt (the \"People of the House\"), including his descendants known as Imams, have special spiritual and political authority over the community and believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, was the first of these Imams and was the rightful successor to Muhammad, and thus reject the legitimacy of the first three Rashidun caliphs.\n\nThe Shia Islamic faith is broad and includes many different groups. There are various Shia theological beliefs, schools of jurisprudence, philosophical beliefs, and spiritual movements. The Shia identity emerged soon after the martyrdom of Hussain son of Ali (the grandson of Muhammad) and Shia theology developed as a result of a shift from the political to the ideological in second century Shi'ism and like the Sunni (for example, Umayyad caliphate), the first Shia governments (for example, Idrisid dynasty in Morocco or Justanids in Iran) were established by the 7th and 8th century.\n\n\nMuslim groups who either ascribe divine characteristics to some figures of Islamic history (usually a member of Muhammad's family, Ahl al-Bayt) or hold beliefs deemed deviant by mainstream Shi'i theology were called as \"Ghulāt\".\n\nKharijite (literally, \"those who seceded\") is a general term embracing a variety of Muslim sects which, while originally supporting the Caliphate of Ali, later on fought against him and eventually succeeded in his martyrdom while he was praying in the mosque of Kufa. While there are few remaining Kharijite or Kharijite-related groups, the term is sometimes used to denote Muslims who refuse to compromise with those with whom they disagree.\n\nThe major Kharijite sub-sect today is the Ibadi. The sect developed out of the 7th century Islamic sect of the Kharijites. While Ibadi Muslims maintain most of the beliefs of the original Kharijites, they have rejected the more aggressive methods.\n\nA number of Kharijite groups went extinct in the past:\n\nSufism is Islam's mystical-ascetic dimension and is represented by schools or orders known as \"Tasawwufī-Ṭarīqah.\" It is seen as that aspect of Islamic teaching that deals with the purification of inner self. By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of \"intuitive and emotional faculties\" that one must be trained to use.\n\nThe following list contains some notable Sufi orders:\n\nIslamic schools of jurisprudence, known as \"madhhabs\", differ in the methodology they use to derive their rulings from the Quran and hadith.\n\nIn terms of religious jurisprudence (\"fiqh\"), Sunnism contains several schools of thought (\"madhhab\") such as:\n\nThe major Shia school of jurisprudence is the Ja'fari or Imāmī school. It is further divided into two branches, the Usuli school, which favors the exercise of ijtihad, and the Akhbari school, which holds the traditions (\"aḵbār\") of the Imams to be the main source of religious knowledge. Minor schools include the Ismāʿīlī school (Mustaʿlī Fāṭimid Ismāʿīlīyah), and the Zaydī school, which have closer affinity to Sunni jurisprudence.\n\nThe fiqh or jurisprudence of Ibadis is relatively simple. Absolute authority is given to the Qur'an and hadith; new innovations accepted on the basis of qiyas, or analogical reasoning, were rejected as bid'ah by the Ibadis. That differs from the majority of Sunnis but agrees with most Shi'ites and the Zahiri and early Hanbali schools of Sunnism.\n\n\"Aqidah\" is an Islamic term meaning \"creed\", doctrine, or article of faith. There have existed many schools of Islamic theology, not all of which survive to the present day. Major themes of theological controversies in Islam have included predestination and free will, the nature of the Quran, the nature of the divine attributes, apparent and esoteric meaning of scripture, and the role of dialectical reasoning in the Islamic doctrine.\n\n\"Kalām\" is the Islamic philosophy of seeking theological principles through dialectic. In Arabic, the word literally means \"speech/words\". A scholar of \"kalām\" is referred to as a \"mutakallim\" (Muslim theologian; plural \"mutakallimūn\"). There are many schools of Kalam, the main ones being the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools in Sunni Islam.\n\nAsh'arism is a school of theology founded in the 10th century by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari. The Asharite view was that comprehension of the unique nature and characteristics of God were beyond human capability.\n\nMaturidism is a school of theology founded by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi, which is a close variant of the Ash'ari school. Points which differ are the nature of belief and the place of human reason. The Maturidis state that belief (\"iman\") does not increase nor decrease but remains static; it is piety (\"taqwa\") which increases and decreases. The Ash'aris say that belief does in fact increase and decrease. The Maturidis say that the unaided human mind is able to find out that some of the more major sins such as alcohol or murder are evil without the help of revelation. The Ash'aris say that the unaided human mind is unable to know if something is good or evil, lawful or unlawful, without divine revelation.\n\nTraditionalist theology, sometimes referred to as the Athari school, derives its name from the word \"tradition\" as a translation of the Arabic word \"hadith\" or from the Arabic word \"athar\", meaning \"narrations\". The traditionalist creed is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation. They rely on the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and sayings of the Sahaba, seeing this as the middle path where the attributes of Allah are accepted without questioning their nature (\"bi la kayf\"). Ahmad bin Hanbal is regarded as the leader of the traditionalist school of creed. The term \"athari\" has been historically synonymous with Salafi. The central aspect of traditionalist theology is its definition of Tawhid, meaning literally unification or asserting the oneness of Allah.\n\nMurji'ah was a name for an early politico-religious movement which came to refer to all those who identified faith (\"iman\") with belief to the exclusion of acts.\n\nQadariyyah is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted that humans possess free will, whose exercise makes them responsible for their actions, justifying divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world. Some of their doctrines were later adopted by the Mu'tazilis and rejected by the Ash'aris.\n\nMu'tazili theology originated in the 8th century in al-Basrah when Wasil ibn Ata left the teaching lessons of Hasan al-Basri after a theological dispute. He and his followers expanded on the logic and rationalism of Greek philosophy, seeking to combine them with Islamic doctrines and show that the two were inherently compatible. The Mu'tazili debated philosophical questions such as whether the Qur'an was created or eternal, whether evil was created by God, the issue of predestination versus free will, whether God's attributes in the Qur'an were to be interpreted allegorically or literally, and whether sinning believers would have eternal punishment in hell.\n\nJahmis were the alleged followers of the early Islamic theologian Jahm bin Safwan who associate himself with Al-Harith ibn Surayj. He was an exponent of extreme determinism according to which a man acts only metaphorically in the same way in which the sun acts or does something when it sets.\n\nThe \"Batiniyyah\" is a name given to an allegoristic type of scriptural interpretation developed among some Shia groups, stressing the \"bāṭin\" (inward, esoteric) meaning of texts. It has been retained by all branches of Isma'ilism and its Druze offshoot. The Alawites practice a similar system of interpretation.\n\nMany slaves brought from Africa to the Western hemisphere were Muslim. Although it is thought that the Islam of slaves did not survive past 1920, the early twentieth century saw the rise of distinct Islamic movements within the African-American community, such as the Moorish Science Temple of America and the Nation of Islam. They sought to ascribe Islamic heritage to African-Americans, thereby giving much emphasis on racial aspects (see \"Black nationalism\"). These Black Muslim movements often differed greatly in doctrine from mainstream. They included:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya movement was founded in India in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who claimed to be the promised Messiah (\"Second Coming of Christ\"), the Mahdi awaited by the Muslims and a \"subordinate\" prophet to Muhammad whose job was to restore the original Sharia given to Muhammad by guiding or rallying disenchanted Ummah back to Islam and thwart attacks on Islam by its opponents. The followers are divided into two groups, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam, the former believing that Ghulam Ahmad was a non-law bearing prophet and the latter believing that he was only a religious reformer though a prophet in an allegorical sense. Ahmadis consider themselves Muslims and claim to practice the pristine form of Islam as re-established with the teachings of Ghulam Ahmad.\n\nIn many Islamic countries the Ahmadis have been defined as heretics and non-Muslim and subjected to persecution and often systematic oppression.\n\nThe Gülen movement, usually referred to as the Hizmet movement, established in the 1970s as an offshoot of the Nur Movement and led by the Turkish Islamic scholar and preacher Fethullah Gülen in Turkey, Central Asia, and in other parts of the world, is active in education, with private schools and universities in over 180 countries as well as with many American charter schools operated by followers. It has initiated forums for interfaith dialogue. The Cemaat movement's structure has been described as a flexible organizational network. Movement schools and businesses organize locally and link themselves into informal networks. Estimates of the number of schools and educational institutions vary widely; it appears there are about 300 Gülen movement schools in Turkey and over 1,000 schools worldwide.\n\nIslamism is a set of political ideologies, derived from various fundamentalist views, which hold that Islam is not only a religion but a political system that should govern the legal, economic and social imperatives of the state. Many Islamists do not refer to themselves as such and it is not a single particular movement. Religious views and ideologies of its adherents vary, and they may be Sunni Islamists or Shia Islamists depending upon their beliefs. Islamist groups include groups such as Al-Qaeda, the organizer of the September 11, 2001 attacks and perhaps the most prominent; and the Muslim Brotherhood, the largest and perhaps the oldest. Although violence is often employed by some organizations, most Islamist movements are nonviolent.\n\nThe \"Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun\" (with Ikhwan brethren) or Muslim Brotherhood, is an organisation that was founded by Egyptian scholar Hassan al-Banna, a graduate of Dar al-Ulum. With its various branches, it is the largest Sunni movement in the Arab world, and an affiliate is often the largest opposition party in many Arab nations. The Muslim Brotherhood is not concerned with theological differences, accepting Muslims of any of the four Sunni schools of thought. It is the world's oldest and largest Islamist group. Its aims are to re-establish the Caliphate and in the mean time push for more Islamisation of society. The Brotherhood's stated goal is to instill the Qur'an and \"sunnah\" as the \"sole reference point for... ordering the life of the Muslim family, individual, community... and state\".\n\nThe \"Jamaat-e-Islami\" (or JI) is an Islamist political party in the Indian subcontinent. It was founded in Lahore, British India, by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi (with alternative spellings of last name Maudoodi) in 1941 and is the oldest religious party in Pakistan and India. Today, sister organizations with similar objectives and ideological approaches exist in India (Jamaat-e-Islami Hind), Bangladesh (Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh), Kashmir (Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir), and Sri Lanka, and there are \"close brotherly relations\" with the Islamist movements and missions \"working in different continents and countries\", particularly those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood (Akhwan-al-Muslimeen). The JI envisions an Islamic government in Pakistan and Bangladesh governing by Islamic law. It opposes Westernization—including secularization, capitalism, socialism, or such practices as interest based banking, and favours an Islamic economic order and Caliphate. \n\nLiberal and progressive movements have in common a religious outlook which depends mainly on Ijtihad or re-interpretations of scriptures. Liberal Muslims at thought have led to the birth of certain small denominations from primarily unaffiliated followers who believe in greater autonomy of the individual in interpretation of scripture, a critical examination of religious texts, gender equality, human rights, LGBT rights and a modern view of culture, tradition, and other ritualistic practices in Islam.\n\nMahdavia, or Mahdavism, is a Mahdiist sect founded in late 15th century India by Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri, who declared himself to be the Hidden Twelfth Imam of the Twelver Shia tradition. They follow many aspects of the Sunni doctrine. Zikri Mahdavis, or Zikris, are an offshoot of the Mahdavi movement.\n\nNon-denominational Muslims is an umbrella term that has been used for and by Muslims who do not belong to or do not self-identify with a specific Islamic denomination.\n\nTolu-e-Islam (\"Resurgence of Islam\") is a non-denominational Muslim organization based in Pakistan, with members throughout the world. The movement was initiated by Ghulam Ahmed Pervez.\n\nQuranism () is an Islamic branch that holds the Qur'an to be the only canonical text in Islam, as opposed to hadith and often sunnah collections. This is in contrast to orthodox Muslims, who consider hadiths essential to the Islamic faith. Quranistic movements include Abdullah Chakralawi's Ahle Qur'an and Rashad Khalifa's United Submitters International.\n\nAhl-i Hadith is a movement which emerged in the Indian subcontinent in the mid-19th century. Followers call themselves Ahl-i Hadith or Salafi, while others consider them to be a branch of the Salafi or Wahhabi movement.\n\nThe Salafi movement is an ultra-conservative reform movement within Sunni Islam that emerged in the second half of the 19th century and advocated a return to the traditions of the \"devout ancestors\" (the salaf). The doctrine can be summed up as taking \"a fundamentalist approach to Islam, emulating the Prophet Muhammad and his earliest followers—\"al-salaf al-salih\", the 'pious forefathers'...They reject religious innovation, or bid'ah, and support the implementation of sharia (Islamic law).\" The movement is often divided into three categories: the largest group are the purists (or quietists), who avoid politics; the second largest group are the activists, who get involved in politics; the smallest group are the jihadists, who form a small (yet infamous) minority. Most of the violent Islamist groups come from the Salafi movement and their subgroups. In recent years, the Salafi doctrine has often been correlated with the jihad of terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and those groups in favor of killing innocent civilians.< The Salafi movement is often described as being synonymous with Wahhabism, but Salafists consider the term \"Wahhabi\" derogatory.\n\nIslamic Modernism, also sometimes referred to as Modernist Salafism, is a movement that has been described as \"the first Muslim ideological response\" attempting to reconcile Islamic faith with modern Western values such as nationalism, democracy, civil rights, rationality, equality, and progress.\n\nThe Wahhabi movement was created by Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab in the Arabian peninsula, and was instrumental in the rise of the House of Saud to power. The terms Wahhabism and Salafism are often used interchangeably, although the word Wahhabi is specific for followers of Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab. Wahhabism has been accused of being \"a source of global terrorism\" and causing disunity in Muslim communities, and criticized for its followers' destruction of historic sites.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the few foreign-born Chinese citizens of non-Chinese origin to become a member of the Communist Party of China.\n\nIsrael Epstein was born on 20 April 1915 in Warsaw to Jewish parents; at the time, Warsaw was under Imperial Russian control (now the capital of Poland). His father had been imprisoned by the authorities of czarist Russia for leading a labor uprising and his mother had been exiled to Siberia. Epstein's father was sent by his company to Japan after the outbreak of the World War I; when the German Army approached Warsaw, his mother and Epstein fled and joined him in Asia. With his family experiencing anti-Jewish sentiment in several places, in 1917, Epstein came to China with his parents at the age of two and they settled in Tianjin (formerly \"Tientsin\") in 1920.\n\nIsrael Epstein began to work in journalism at age 15, when he wrote for the \"Peking and Tientsin Times\", an English-language newspaper based in Tianjin. He also covered the Japanese Invasion of China for the United Press and other Western news agencies. In the autumn of 1938, he joined the China Defense League, which had been established by Soong Ching-ling, Sun Yat-sen's widow, for the purpose of publicizing and enlisting international support for the Chinese cause. In 1941, he faked news about his own death as a decoy for the Japanese who were trying to arrest him. The misinformation even found its way into a short item printed in the \"New York Times\".\n\nAfter being assigned to review one of the books of Edgar Snow, Epstein and Snow came to know each other personally and Snow showed him his classic work \"Red Star Over China\" before it was published.\n\nIn 1934, Epstein married Edith Bihovsky Epstein, later Ballin, from whom he was divorced in the early 1940s. In 1944, Epstein first visited Britain and afterwards went to live in the United States with his second wife Elsie Fairfax-Cholmeley for five years.\n\nHe worked for Allied Labor News and published his book \"The Unfinished Revolution in China\" in 1947. His book was enthusiastically reviewed in \"The New York Times\" by Owen Lattimore of Johns Hopkins University. In 1951 Communist defector Elizabeth Bentley testified to the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, \"Israel Epstein had been a member of the Russian secret police for many years in China.\"\n\nMany years later, his wife, Fairfax-Cholmeley, would become known to a generation of Chinese-language students in China and around the world as a contributor to one of the most widely used Chinese-English dictionaries published in the PRC. After Fairfax-Cholmeley's death in 1984, Epstein married his third wife, Wan Bi.\n\nIn 1951, Soong Ching-ling invited him to return to China to edit the magazine \"China Reconstructs\", which was later renamed \"China Today\". He remained editor-in-chief of \"China Today\" until his retirement at age 70, and then editor emeritus. During his tenure at \"China Today\", he became a Chinese citizen in 1957 and a member of the Communist Party of China in 1964. In 1955, 1965 and 1976 Epstein visited Tibet, and based on these three visits in 1983 published the book \"Tibet Transformed\".\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, on charges of plotting against Zhou Enlai, he was imprisoned in 1968 in the north of Beijing in Qincheng Prison, where he was subjected to solitary confinement. In 1973, he was released, and Zhou apologized. His privileges were restored. Despite his 5 years imprisonment, he remained loyal to the ideals of Communism until his death. Israel Epstein was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body, in 1983.\n\nDuring his life, Israel Epstein was honored by Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. His funeral was held at the Babaoshan Cemetery for Revolutionaries, in Shijingshan District, Beijing on 3 June 2005 at 09:30. The ceremony was attended by many officials, among them President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, as well as Politburo Standing Committee members Jia Qinglin and Li Changchun. After the service, his body was cremated.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Brighouse was one of the first persons to claim to be the \"One Mighty and Strong\" that Joseph Smith, Jr. had prophesied of in 1832.\n\nOn December 7, 1884, a few members of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints met in Independence, Missouri to organize what they called the \"Order of Enoch\" or the \"Church or Kingdom of Christ\". The leaders of group were Brighouse and Lars Peterson. Brighouse was given the title \"Emmanuel\" and was later declared to be the 18th reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Later, Brighouse also claimed to be the reincarnation of Adam, Enoch, Moses, David, Ezekiel, George Washington, and Joseph Smith.\n\nBrighouse taught that Brigham Young had led the majority of Latter Day Saints astray by teaching plural marriage. Brighouse said that God had chosen Joseph Morris to set the Latter Day Saints in order, but that the wickedness of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had resulted in the Morrisite War and the scattering of the true Latter Day Saints. Brighouse claimed that he was the \"One Mighty and Strong\" that Joseph Smith had prophesied would come to \"set in order the house of God\".\n\nIn 1891, Brighouse travelled to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. It was believed by some Latter Day Saints that Joseph Smith had prophesied that Jesus Christ would return to earth in 1891; Brighouse went to the incomplete Salt Lake Temple and declared that he was Jesus, whose coming had been prophesied. Brighouse preached in Salt Lake City for a few days and converted a handful of followers.\n\nIn Utah Territory in 1892, Brighouse published a book of teachings called \"The Voice of the Seventh Angel, Proclaiming the End of Time! The Resurrection of the Dead! The Day of Final Judgment! and the Rule of Righteousness and Peace!\". In it, Brighouse set out his seven fundamental teachings:\nLittle is known of Brighouse's life after 1892, but his following remained small and it is believed Brighouse died in Utah.\n\n\n"}

He is a member of the National Integration Council (NIC) of India, Secretary-General of the All India Christian Council and a past president of the All India Catholic Union. He has taken ant-Indian Army stand time to time, and he is an Urban Naxalist. He has been outspoken in opposition to polarisation, in defence of church property and in support of churches.\n\nJohn Dayal was born in New Delhi to Christian parents from South India.\nHe studied Physics at St. Stephen's College, Delhi before deciding to become a journalist.\nHe served as War Correspondent or Foreign Correspondent in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Europe.\nHe became editor and CEO of the \"Delhi Mid Day\", a small afternoon newspaper, and treasurer of the Editors' Guild of India.\nIn June 1998 John Dayal was one of the signatories of a statement by a group of journalists calling on India to return to the global nuclear disarmament agenda.\nHe continues to provide commentary and analysis in print and on national TV and radio.\nDayal has headed the governing boards of several colleges of Delhi University, and has taught as a visiting teacher at several universities in north India.\n\nJohn Dayal became a Christian activist in the early 1970s. In this role he has worked on such issues as displacement of tribal people, special quotas in jobs and college admissions for Christians, opposition to nuclear weapons, forced disappearances and impunity.\nDuring more than forty years he has investigated a great many cases of human rights abuse aimed at minority group of Christians.\n\nDayal was one of the founders of the ecumenical All India Christian Council (AICC) and the United Christian Forum for Human Rights.\nDayal was National Secretary for Public affairs of the All India Catholic Union (AICU) during the presidency of Norbert D'Souza (1996–2000).\nIn 2000 he was elected vice-president of the AICU and on 20 September 2004 he was elected AICU president, succeeding Dr Maria Emelia Menezes.\nHe held that position until 2008 when he was succeeded by Dr. Remy Denis.\nIn March 2005 Dayal was a member of a delegation led by Vincent Conçessao that presented a memorandum on minorities to the prime minister. The delegation was assured that the government would issue a White Paper on minority communities.\n\nDayal has been appointed to many fact finding committees and tribunals.\nIn December 2007 he was one of a five-member Fact Finding Team that went Phulbani area of Kandhamal district in Orissa to investigate recent violence against Christians. \nAccording to his account, he was forcibly expelled by the police.\nIn September 2008 Dayal won the Maanav Adhikaar Paaritaushik (Human Dignity Award) in memory of Professor M. M. Guptara.\nIn 2010 Dayal was again nominated as a member of the National Integration Council.\nAs of March 2012 Dayal was secretary general of the All India Christian Council, founded in 1999.\nDayal is married and has a son and a daughter.\n\nIn January 2002 the AICC issued a statement signed by Joseph D'souza and John Dayal asking State governments and the national government to prevent efforts by the Sangh Parivar to stir up communal violence in the Adivasi tribal belt in Northern India. It talked of a \"vicious Hindutva communal rhetoric .. targeting Christians in the region\". It said RSS cadres were running schools that \"follow a curricula and textual material, which is outside the pale of any academic and public scrutiny, blatantly rewrites history, and poisons young minds\".\nIn 2005 Dayal again expressed concern that Ekal Vidyalaya (\"single teacher\") schools run by the RSS Hindu nationalist organisation in tribal districts were spreading hatred towards members of the Christian minority.\n\nDayal has made unsubstantiated claims that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to convert tribal people in central India into Hindu nationalists. \nOn 17 October 2004 a ceremony was organised by the World Hindu Council (Vishva Hindu Parishad – VHP) in Orissa at which about 300 tribal Christians were \"reconverted\" to Hinduism. Dayal said the event was part of a well-organized and respectful ghar vapasi program, that he wholeheartedly agrees with.\nIn a 2004 interview following the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the return to power of the Congress Party, Dayal said that the change was because \"People have rejected the ideology of hate, consisting of xenophobia, narrow nationalism and a sustained persecution of Muslims and Christians\". He went on to compare Hindutva to neo-Nazism and Apartheid.\n\nDayal has said that militant groups exploit economically backward people in attacks on Christians and Muslims: \"Dalits and tribals are used as instruments. He said, though the Irish and Scottish Missionaries introduced distilled alcohol (Indian-made foreign liquor or IMFL) the depiction of Anglo-Indians and Christians as alcoholics is real and threatens to consume Christianity. He also said Christians are paid, drugged, alcoholized, they are in a stupor. Even wine at communions should be banned\".\nSpeaking after the Bharatiya Janata Party had made gains in riot-affected parts of Gujarat, Dayal said \"[Christians] have never been more afraid ... I have been expecting the very worst since the B.J.P. came to power, and the worst, I think, may still be in the future.\nWith levels of violence in Gujarat rising, on 1 October 1998 Dayal remarked \"The AICU is surprised that Union Government and members of the ruling coalition, including the BJP, have not come out categorically in denouncing the violence against Christians\".\n\nIn February 2002 after a renewed series of attacks on Christians Dayal said \"Physically, many of the incidents are now less obvious, but there is a 24-hour reign of terror, which occasionally bursts into violence\".\n\nDayal represents the conservatives in the AICU.\nAt a seminar in Goa in August 2009, former Union minister Eduardo Faleiro said that church property should be brought under the ambit of state laws, as was the case with other religions. This was endorsed by Remy Denis and other liberals. \nHowever, Dayal opposed any change.\nHe said that the \"Christian situation\" was radically and materially different from that of the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh religions, and existing laws were sufficient.\n\nIn March 2012 two Baptist churches in Imphal, Manipur were ordered to vacate within 15 days.\nThe authorities threatened to use force if the churches were not dismantled on schedule.\nThe All India Christian Council took up the issue with the national and state minority commissions. According to Dayal \"Christians in Manipur are facing increasing threats from the public as well as the state government\".\nThe same month, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia said that it is \"necessary to destroy all the churches of the region\".\nAs AICC Secretary General, John Dayal asked that India and other countries help assure the safety of churches in other countries of the Arabian peninsula.\nThe AICC pointed out that destruction of churches would be counter to the United Nations Charter and to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance And of Discrimination Based on Religion Or Belief.\n\nA survey by the NGO Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan found that the \"Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers\" was being abused.\nApart from encouraging Dalits to remain in menial jobs, in many cases some or all of the money was embezzled.\nIn March 2012 Dayal said \"There is a massive scandal of graft between bank officials, politicians and middle men to fleece ignorant people who are given 50 per cent of the loan only but made liable for the full amount even as rest of the money is taken away by crooks. Collectors in villages must crack down on such miscreants and wherever such cases are found, government must waive off the loans or it would be condoning cheating and criminal actions\".\n\nJohn Dayal has spoken out against bills that prevent or penalise conversion to Christianity passed in various states in India.\nA deeply religious person, Dayal has written \"How a community treats its poor is, for the Bible, the acid test of its life. And the way a community will be changed is through the poor\".\n\nRediff.com columnist Varsha Bhosle wrote in 2002 that \"John Dayal and his Catholic cohorts are the worst act I've ever seen... Christian activists ... aggressively seek to weaken Hindu society in terms of numbers as well as space\". Noting that Dayal had objected that on the 2001 census form a scheduled caste, or Dalit, could choose only among the Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist faiths, she said \"If conversion to Christianity certifies social equality, why would there be a 'Dalit Christian'? As for guaranteeing economic freedom, don't make me laugh\".\n\nDiscussing Dayal's 2005 letter to the prime minister about attacks on Christians including the rape of nuns, murder of priests and destruction of churches, P.N Benjamin, coordinator of the Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue, said Dayal \"opens his mouth and wields his pen only to spew venom on the Hindu community\". Benjamin said most of the attacks on Christians had been in response to aggressive evangelizing.\nIn 2008, journalist François Gautier described Dayal as a fanatic who was \"radicalizing\" his flock. The assertion was made in an op-ed in \"The Indian Express\" that accused Sonia Gandhi of responsibility for the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.\n\nRajiv Malhotra, in his book \"Breaking India\", has also criticized Dayal for spreading lies about Hinduism and painting a biased picture of the situation of Indian minorities for a western audience..\n\nJohn Dayal on April 4, 2014, appeared at a hearing on \"The plight of religious minorities in India\" which was convened by Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. This commission is a mostly white bipartisan caucus of United States House of Representatives that was set up with the help of the Council on Foreign Relations. In his short testimony he made unsubstantiated remarks about his views of religious tolerance in India. While as a member of National Integration Council(government of India) he as a witness recommended the panel of commission to incorporates his concerns in U.S. India relationship and U.S. policy vis-a-vis the United States-India strategic dialogue which is framework of engagement of the United States Department of State with India. Further, he cited the house resolution 417 and urged that human rights should be the part of strategic U.S.-India dialogue. \nDayal's attempt to advance this resolution was strongly criticized by others, such as the United States India Political Action Committee, the Hindu American Foundation, as well as U.S. Congresswoman (D-HI) Tulsi Gabbard. The HAF expressed concerns that the panel was 'unbalanced' in favor of anti-Hindu activists. In particular, Gabbard characterized his testimony as a thinly veiled attempt to covertly influence the upcoming General Elections in India in favor of anti-Indian groups, an action deemed \"inappropriate\" for the US Congress and \"against the shared interests\" of both nations.\n\nA partial bibliography:\n"}

For some including the Shilluk, Dinka and Nuer, he is the Creator God and is omnipresent. Nyikang, a legendary king, is often invoked as an intermediary. Other Nilotic tribes, for example the Acholi and Lango, use the possibly related term Jok only for local and/or ancestral spirits.\n\nThe creator Juok moulded all people of earth. While he was engaged in the work of creation, he wandered about the world. In the land of the whites he found a pure white earth or sand, and out of it he shaped white people. Then he came to the land of Egypt and out of the mud of the Nile he made red or brown people. Lastly, he came to the land of the Shilluks, and finding there black earth he created black people out of it.The way in which he modeled human beings was this. He took a lump of earth and said to himself, \"I will make humans, but they must be able to walk and run and go out into the fields, so I will give each of them two long legs, like the flamingo.\" Having done so, he thought again, \"They must be able to cultivate millet, so I will give each of them two arms, one to hold the hoe, and the other to tear up the weeds.\" So he gave humans two arms. Then he thought again, \"They must be able to see the millet, so I will give them two eyes.\" He did so accordingly. Next he thought to himself, \"They must be able to eat their millet, so I will give each a mouth.\" And a mouth he gave accordingly. After that he thought within himself, \"They must be able to dance and speak and sing and shout, and for these purposes they must have tongues.\" And tongues he gave accordingly. Lastly the Deity said to himself, \"They must be able to hear the noise of the dance and the speech of the great ones, and for that they need two ears.\" So two ears each he gave, and sent them out into the world as perfect humans.\"Another story about Juok, is that he gave birth to several children—an elephant, a buffalo, a lion, a crocodile, a dog, and finally the first humans, a boy and a girl. Juok was not pleased with the humans, so he told the dog to get rid of them. Instead, the dog nurtured the children until they were grown. By then the land had become crowded, so Juok decided to set apart land for his different creatures and give them weapons. He planned to deal with the humans last of all. The dog knew that if this happened, there would be no land or weapons left for the humans; the animals would get it all. He told the man to tell Juok that he was the elephant, buffalo, and lion. When the man did, Juok gave him all the spears. When the animals arrived, there were no spears left for them. Instead, Juok gave the elephant tusks, the buffalo horns, the lion strong claws, and the crocodile sharp teeth. The man used his spears to drive off the animals; then he took the best land for himself.A myth about the origin of death describes how a dog helped people attain long lives. In the beginning, death was not permanent. People remained dead for three days and then came back to life. One day, Juok decided to make death permanent by throwing a rock into the river. The dog urged humans to get together and haul the rock out of the river, but they ignored him. The dog was unable to get the rock out by himself, but he managed to break off a large chunk of it and carry it home. Because of this, humans have longer lives than they might have had.\n"}

Though there are differing claims and no written accounts have been found to favor one over another, it is generally accepted that the Apostle Thomas arrived in what is now the state of Kerala and established a number of churches, converting mainly Brahmin families. He then traveled to what is now the modern state of Tamil Nadu and on to China, establishing small works along the way. After returning to Tamil Nadu, he was killed by some locals. Though he was buried in India, his body was taken, in the fourth or fifth century, to Edessa, in modern-day Turkey.\n\nThe name, Kalloor, also refers to a number of prominent families, in Hindu, Christian and Muslim communities. In Hindu communities, the Kalloor family is one of the few families that are part of the priestly Namboodhiri Brahmin caste. In Muslim communities also, the Kalloor family is large and prominent. There are \"suburbs\" around a number of the larger cities of Kerala, like Kochi, that bear this name. Many of these suburbs have large Muslim populations.\n\nIn Christian communities, there are a number of theories for the origin of this family name. One is that early converts to Christianity (Jewish people ) took this name in remembrance of accepting Jesus (Yeshua) as their \" messiah\" from Apostle Thomas, at a place named Kalloor, in Tamil Nadu. Another is that they are converts from the Hindu Kalloor family, reportedly converting in the seventh century. Members of this family are prominent in a number of the Christian traditions, including in Syriac groups such as the Indian Orthodox Church, Western groups such as the Roman Catholic Church, and Reform groups such as the Indian Brethren and Pentecostal churches. Listed among the more prominent Christians are Bishop Yoohanon Chrysostom Kalloor of the Catholic Church, from the Kalloor family in Pathanamthitta and the initial catalyst for the Pentecostal movement in Kerala, the late Kalloor Chacko, from the Kalloor family in Thrikkannamangal. The Kallor Family in Kanjiralli to Pala route is also now divided into Catholics and Protestants. It is believed that Devasia Kalloor broke from the Catholic chusch along with 5 other families and started the Kalaketty CSI Church. \n\nIt is suspected but not proven whether the two Kalloor families of Pathanamthitta and Thrikkannamangal are related. Because family names can be modified or even discarded by each generation that establishes a new home, and are often not used as last names for people in South India, the tracing of genealogies is very difficult, if not impossible, without written family trees. Many in the Kalloor family of Pathanamthitta remain in the Roman Catholic Church and some have risen to leadership within that tradition, like Bishop Yoohanon. The Kalloor family of Thrikkannamangal had nominally remained within the Syrian tradition even during the Portuguese blockade of the 16th and 17th centuries. This blockade prevented the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Assyrian Church of the East from communicating with their branches in India and forced the majority of the Syrian churches in India to join the Roman Catholic Church in order to preserve Apostolic succession. Some, however, made a public vow, known as the Coonen Cross Oath, to never succumb to the leadership of the Western Church. Later, many from Thrikkannamangal joined the Reformation movement within the Syrian Church in the 19th century which resulted in the establishment of the Mar Thoma Church. Members of this family were also prominent in the establishment of the Brethren churches in South India. It was while Chacko was in the Brethren church that he became acquainted with the American missionary Robert F. Cook, the \"Father of Indian Pentecostalism.\"\n"}

Individual cultures have their own names, in their respective Indigenous languages, for the spiritual healers and ceremonial leaders in their particular cultures. \n\nIn the ceremonial context of Indigenous North American communities, \"medicine\" usually refers to \"spiritual\" healing. Medicine men/women should not be confused with those who employ Native American ethnobotany, a practice that is very common in a large number of Native American and First Nations households.\n\nThe terms \"medicine people\" or \"ceremonial people\" are sometimes used in Native American and First Nations communities, for example, when Arwen Nuttall (Cherokee) of the National Museum of the American Indian writes, \"The knowledge possessed by medicine people is privileged, and it often remains in particular families.\"\n\nNative Americans tend to be quite reluctant to discuss issues about medicine or medicine people with non-Indians. In some cultures, the people will not even discuss these matters with Indians from other tribes. In most tribes, medicine elders are prohibited from advertising or introducing themselves as such. As Nuttall writes, \"An inquiry to a Native person about religious beliefs or ceremonies is often viewed with suspicion.\" One example of this is the Apache medicine cord or \"Izze-kloth\" whose purpose and use by Apache medicine elders was a mystery to nineteenth century ethnologists because \"the Apache look upon these cords as so sacred that strangers are not allowed to see them, much less handle them or talk about them.\"\nThe 1954 version of \"Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language\" reflects the poorly-grounded perceptions of the people whose use of the term effectively defined it for the people of that time: \"a man supposed to have supernatural powers of curing disease and controlling spirits.\" In effect, such definitions were not explanations of what these \"medicine people\" are to their own communities but instead reported on the consensus of socially and psychologically remote observers when they tried to categorize the individuals. The term \"medicine man/woman,\" like the term \"shaman,\" has been criticized by Native Americans, as well as other specialists in the fields of religion and anthropology.\n\nWhile non-Native anthropologists sometimes use the term \"shaman\" for Indigenous healers worldwide, including the Americas, \"shaman\" is the specific name for a spiritual mediator from the Tungusic peoples of Siberia and is not used in Native American or First Nations communities.\n\nThe term \"medicine man/woman\" has also frequently been used by Europeans to refer to African traditional healers, along with the offensive term \"witch doctors\".\n\nCherokee spiritual, ceremonial and healing knowledge has been passed down for thousands of years. The Cherokee people were among the first Native Americans to formalize a written language. Some of the information in the Cherokee ledgers is written in code to prevent other people from trying to misuse or exploit their medicine ways. As in all Native American cultures, Cherokee medicine people had to practice in secret from the post-contact era until 1978, when the American Indian Religious Freedom Act was passed. \n\nTraining a Cherokee medicine person takes many years due to the vast amount of knowledge needed to practice. Modern-day Cherokee medicine people must be born and raised in the Cherokee community and culture, and raised with the language. The skills of gifted and well-trained medicine people are still very important to the Cherokee people, though genocide and oppression have resulted in there being fewer now than pre-contact. There are many fraudulent healers and scam artists who pose as Cherokee \"shamans\", and the Cherokee Nation has had to speak out against these people, even forming a task force to handle the issue. In order to seek help from a Cherokee medicine person a person needs to know someone in the community who can vouch for them and provide a referral. Usually one makes contact through a relative who knows the healer. \n\n"}

Its founders were the British couple Mary Ann MacLean and Robert de Grimston and it spread across parts of the United Kingdom and United States during the latter 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe Process Church was established by MacLean and de Grimston in London in 1966. The pair had met several years previously, when they were both members of the Church of Scientology. The duo were ejected from the Church in 1962 and married the following year. They started a Scientology splinter group called Compulsions Analysis, which gained new religious elements and developed into the Process Church. Its members initially lived in a commune in Mayfair before moving to Xtul in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. They later established a base of operations in the United States in New Orleans. Prosecutors investigating the Los Angeles murders committed by the Manson Family in 1969 suggested that there were links between Charles Manson and the Process Church. Although no proof of such a connection was ever provided, the allegations damaged the Church's reputation.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the sociologist William Sims Bainbridge studied the group, producing an in-depth account of its activities. In 1974, MacLean and de Grimston separated. The latter tried to continue the group with a small following, but this folded in 1979. MacLean retained the allegiance of the majority of Church members, reforming the group as the Foundation Church of the Millennium and taking it into an explicitly Christian direction. It was later transformed into the Best Friends Animal Society, based at Kanab, Utah. \n\nVarious commentators have described the Process Church as a religion, and it has also been characterised as a new religious movement.\nThere has been some debate as to whether to categorise the Process Church as a form of Satanism or not; the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine noted that it was \"difficult to decide whether it was a truly Satanist organization\". The sociologist of religion Massimo Introvigne included the group in his study of religious Satanism, although added that \"its doctrine was not Satanism in the more classical sense of the term\". He distinguished it from other religious Satanic groups in that it did not have its origins in Anton LaVey's California-based Church of Satan, and thus was \"born on a different field from other contemporary satanic groups.\"\n\nThe Process Church of the Final Judgement was the creation of Mary Ann Maclean (1931–2005) and Robert De Grimston Moore (b.1935). Born in Shanghai, Moore had served in the British Household Cavalry from 1954 to 1958. Maclean was British but had spent a year in the United States. She later claimed that she had had a relationship with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, although Robinson's son later refuted this. Back in England, from 1959 she worked as a high-end prostitute in London, servicing prominent figures in British business and politics. Both Moore and Maclean independently involved themselves with the London branch of the Church of Scientology, and it was here that they met. Maclean worked as an auditor for the Church, although neither became senior figures within the organisation. In 1962, they were both declared \"suppressive persons\" and expelled from the Church. In 1963, the couple married.\n\nTogether they set up Compulsions Analysis, a group which utilised both the organisational methods of Scientology and the ideas of the psychologist Alfred Adler. In establishing this company, they were financially assisted by a lawyer friend.\nMoore distinguished the methods of Compulsions Analysis from Scientology in that it did not claim that its benefits were \"infinite\", stating that \"we are not offering super powers, but a means that people can live on this side more effectively\". In 1966, the regular clients of Compulsions Analysis formed into a new group, The Process, which took on an increasingly religious character. In March 1966, twenty-five members of the Process moved into a commune at 2 Balfour Place in Mayfair, an affluent area in the West End of London. In May, the group decided that they would leave London and relocate to a more remote area. On 23 June, around thirty Church members—accompanied by their six Alsatian dogs—moved to Nassau in the Bahamas. From there, they spent the rest of the summer seeking a more permanent location.\n\nIn September 1966, the group members moved to Mexico City. They obtained an old bus and began driving across the Yucatan Peninsula for a place to settle. They found a location known as Xtul; its name meant \"the end\" in the Mayan language, and the group took this as a portent that they should settle there. They set about establishing a community, although would only remain there for a month. They faced opposition from both locals and from the parents of several Church members, who enlisted anti-cult groups to try and recuperate their children through legal means. It was while there that the group clarified its hierarchical structure, with the De Grimstons at the top, who were referred to as \"the Omega\", followed by those regarded as \"masters\", then \"priests\", then \"prophets\", and finally \"messengers\". In late September, a tropical hurricane devastated their settlement, and while some of them elected to stay, the De Grimstons and most of their followers decided to leave. The Yucatan experience remained an important part of the Process Church's own mythology. After that point, there would be a crucial division within the group between those who had gone through the Xtul experience and those who did not.\n\nBy November 1966, most of the Process members were back in London. Between the end of that year and 1967, the Process began to operate as a church. It became increasingly evangelical and focused on attracting new members. It opened a library and an all-night coffee shop known as Satan's Cavern. It also began issuing a magazine, at first titled \"The Common Market\" and later renamed \"The Process\". The Church's activities attracted the interest of a number of celebrities active in the realms of music and cinema, among them Marianne Faithfull.\n\nIn 1967 and 1968, the De Grimstones made various further international travels, spending time in East Asia, the United States, Germany and Italy; in the latter they visited the ruins of Thelema Abbey on Cefalu, the commune established in the 1920s by British occultist Aleister Crowley. From late 1968 onward, they began spending most of their time in the United States. The Church opened \"chapters\" in many U.S. cities, the first of which was in New Orleans, where the remaining members of the Xtul colony settled. Several European chapters followed, in Munich, Rome, and London.\nIn the early 1970s it opened its largest chapter, in Toronto, Canada.\nIntrovigne thought that at its maximum capacity, the Process Church had \"a few hundred active members\".\n\nDuring its existence, the Process Church attracted much publicity.\nIn urban myth, the Process Church came to be associated with ritual murders, although no evidence of any such connection was ever forthcoming. Rumours spread that a number of Alsatians had been sacrificed around San Francisco, with these actions sometimes being associated with the Process Church, which kept Alsatians as pets. Nothing was ever proved that substantiated any of these rumours.\nBaddeley later related that the Process Church \"has become legendary, both in the annals of hippie history and Satanic lore\".\n\nPolice investigating the Tate-LaBianca Murders which were carried out by members of the Manson Family suspected a possible connection between the Family's leader Charles Manson and the Process Church. When they asked Manson if he knew Moore, he responded: \"You're looking at him. Moore and I are one and the same\". Two members of the Church subsequently visited the district attorney to stress that the group had nothing to do with Manson or his Family. The Church then included a brief article on Manson in the 1971 \"Death\" issue of its magazine, in which it included a short essay by Manson himself next to another by the Roman Catholic writer Malcolm Muggeridge. The inclusion of Manson's piece—gained by interviewing him in prison—was, according to Introvigne, because the De Grimstons \"probably wanted to take advantage of the strange popularity the criminal was enjoying in some youth groups\". \n\nVincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor of the Manson trial, later suggested in his book \"Helter Skelter\" that Manson may have borrowed philosophically from the Process Church. Introvigne suggested that while Manson had never been a member of the Process Church, he likely knew about it given his base in Haight Ashbury. Although no connection between the Process Church and Manson was ever substantiated, the group's reputation was damaged by the association. The number of donations received began to decline and Church members sometimes received abuse in public. To shift the group's image, its leaders played down their image of black garments and Alsatians and presented a softer interpretation of their four divinities doctrine to limit the Satanic elements.\n\nIn his 1972 book \"The Family\", Ed Sanders alleged that Manson had been a member of the Process Church, as evidence citing the fact that Manson once lived in the same road as the Church's San Francisco location. That year, the Church took legal action against Sanders and his U.S. publisher E. P. Dutton in the District Court of Chicago; the allegation was subsequently retracted from future printings of \"The Family\". It also brought legal action with the book's British publisher, although in a British court, the publisher won the case.\nBy the late 1970s—when the Church itself had disbanded—it was common for anti-Satanist literature to allege that Manson was a member of the group and that both were linked to blood sacrifices. In his 1974 book \"America Bewitched\", the journalist Daniel Logan cited the Process Church alongside Manson, the Church of Satan, and the British occultist Aleister Crowley. The journalist Maury Terry—whom Baddeley described as \"a sensationalist reporter with a nose for good scare stories\"—linked the Process Church to the Ordo Templi Orientis and claimed both as part of a grand Satanic conspiracy in his 1987 book \"The Ultimate Evil\". Claims about the Process Church being linked to a vast Satanic conspiracy and wide range of crimes were also endorsed by members of the LaRouche movement.\n\nA detailed account of the history of and life within the Process Church as told by a participant-observer is contained in William S. Bainbridge's book \"Satan's Power\". A sociologist, Bainbridge encountered the Process Church in 1970, while he was studying Scientology. He joined the Process Church, explaining to its leaders that he wanted to undergo participant observation in the group as part of his research towards a sociology doctorate. Bainbridge had conducted several months of fieldwork with the group during the early 1970s, particularly in its Boston branch. His observation took place largely in 1970–71, when he was an active group member, but became episodic between 1972 and 1974. In his book, he disguised the names of people to preserve their identities.\nAdam Parfrey noted that Bainbridge provided a \"more even-handed view\" of the Church that that provided by the likes of Sanders and Terry.\nBainbridge's study was later described as \"the main source of information\" about the group by La Fontaine.\n\nThe relationship between the De Grimstons grew strained; Robert had begun a relationship with a younger woman, Morgana, who later became his third wife. They also disagreed on the direction of the Process Church; Mary Ann believed that they should declare the \"Satanic\" phase to be over, to be replaced by a \"Christian\" phase, although Robert disagreed. In 1974, the De Grimstons separated. Robert took a minority of the group members with him, seeking to continue the Process Church in a manner akin to his original form, although abandoned the project in 1979, when he moved professionally into business. \n\nMost of the Church's members retained their allegiance to Mary Ann. She renamed the Church as the Foundation Church of the Millennium, which in 1977 became the Foundation Faith of the Millennium, and in 1980 the Foundation Faith of God; followers generally referred to it simple as \"The Foundation\". The group defined itself as \"a Christian church\" which required its members to believe in the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus Christ, and his second coming. It also promoted a healing ministry which was influenced by Pentecostalism. Like the Process Church, membership was organised according to a hierarchical system of degrees, and it was led by a nine-member Council of Luminaries. Mary Ann's principal collaborator in the group was longstanding Church member Timothy Wyllie. In 1977, he founded a group in New York City called the Unit, which he regarded as being part of the Foundation. Mary Ann disagreed with this move and sued Wyllie, although she lost. The Unit soon disbanded. Wyllie then pursued an independent career in the New Age milieu, with a focus on communicating with extraterrestrials, angels, and dolphins.\n\nIn 1982, the Process Church moved its base to Utah, where it established an animal rescue refuge in Kanab. In 1993, the organisation changed its name to Best Friends Animal Society; it removed all reference to religious ideas from its statutes. In 2004, a feature article in \"Rocky Mountain News\" publicly revealed Best Friends' origins in the Process Church. In 2005, Mary Ann died, and the management of her charity was left to her second husband, Gabriel De Peyer, a former Process Church member. Unverified rumours spread that Mary Ann had been killed by a pack of wild dogs that had escaped her centre.\n\nIn the initial phase of the group's beliefs, Moore and Maclean taught there was only one supreme divinity, God, and the focus of the group's activities was to transform those aspects of human nature which defied God. Many of the group's therapeutic practices or \"processes\" (hence the name) and concepts were derived from Scientology, including the term \"processing\". In these therapy sessions, the group utilised an electronic meter titled the \"P-Scope\", which was based on the Scientology E-meter.\n\nIn 1967, Moore introduced the notion of four divinities to the group's beliefs. Maclean and Moore were influenced by Jungian psychology, in particular Carl Jung's interpretation of the Christian Trinity. Jung had argued the Trinity concealed a fourth element, hidden in the human subconscious, which was the Devil. He believed that omitting this fourth component of the \"Quaternity\" resulted in psychological unbalance. \n\nIn his study of Satanism, Gareth Medway described the Process Church's beliefs as \"a kind of neo-Gnostic theology\". The Process Church preached the existence of four gods, who were regarded not as literal entities but as inner realities existing within each human personality. Accordingly, these deities were not worshipped. The names of its deities were drawn from traditional Judeo-Christian religion. They were known as Jehovah, Lucifer, Satan, and Christ, and were collectively referred to as the \"Great Gods of the Universe\".\n\nThe Church stated that \"Jehovah is strength. Lucifer is light. Satan is separation. Christ is unification\". Each member was instructed to follow the god, or gods, which were best suited to them. Each individual was understood as a combination of two of these gods. The Church taught that an individual's personality and relationships could be explained by reference to which gods they manifested. Moore for instance described himself as a blend of Luciferian and Christian traits, while Maclean regarded herself as a combination of Jehovan and Satanic traits. None of the deities were considered evil, but \"basic patterns of human reality\". Moore taught the real \"devil\" was humanity or the \"Grey Forces\", which were understood as representing the compromise and conformity typical of the masses. \n\nAs indicated by the group's name, The Process Church of The Final Judgment, the Church taught a form of millennialism. According to Process eschatology, the four separate divinities would be unified in the endtimes. The reconciliation of opposites was seen by Moore in , where Christ tells his followers to love their enemies. Moore taught Christ's enemy was Satan, and the \"reuniting of the Gods\" was achieved through love. \n\nThe communal life of the Church members was strictly regulated.\nAmong group members, sex and the use of drugs and alcohol were strictly rationed, with these practices being regarded as a distraction from spiritual work. Unlike other Satanic groups active during the same period, the Process Church did not practice magic.\nThe Process Church strongly opposed vivisection.\n\nThe Church held public rituals similar to Christian practices, such as baptisms, marriages and a weekly gathering titled the Sabbath Assembly. Baptisms were performed at every elevation of status in the hierarchy of the Church. The Processeans sang solemn hymns to the four deities during the assemblies. \n\nThe group used a swastika-like symbol (\"the P-Sign\") as its insignia. The symbol had four superimposed P letters, and was also seen as representing the trumpets of the four \"Great Gods\". The group also used a second symbol, \"the Sign of the Union\", which featured the letter Alpha inside the letter Omega, representing the intercourse of male Lucifer with female Jehovah. \n\nIn 1989 and 1990, several former members of the Church attempted to recreate it in Round Lake, New York. There were also reports of a revival group being based in Yorkshire, England.\n\nFunkadelic included an excerpt from the group's \"Process Number Five on Fear\" in the liner notes for their seminal album \"Maggot Brain\".\n\nIn 2009, Adam Parfrey noted that the original Process Church \"enjoys cultural influence\". \n\nThe industrial music group Skinny Puppy released an album titled \"Process\" that contained lyrics espousing anti-vivisection themes. The Process Church's rituals were later adopted and utilised by the band Psychic TV and the group that formed around it, Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY). Several TOPY members had previously been involved with the Process Church. Genesis P-Orridge worked with longstanding church member Timothy Wyllie to produce a book featuring reproductions of the church's magazines and reminiscences of several members. It was published as \"Love, Sex, Fear, Death: The Inside Story of The Process Church of the Final Judgment\" by Feral House in 2009.\n\nRobert de Grimston's writings and the Writ of The Process Church have long outlived the original cult. His 'Brethren Information' (those speeches meant for members of the church at the time) are widely available online\n\nA detailed discussion of the modern Process Church appeared in Disinfo in July 2015.\n\n\n"}

Ahmadiyya and Shia minorities are also present. the remaining 10 percent of Malians adhere to indigenous or traditional animist beliefs or Christianity. Atheism and agnosticism are believed to be rare among Malians, most of whom practice their religion on a daily basis, although some are Deist.\n\nAccording to the 2005 U.S. Department of State’s annual report on religious freedom, Islam as traditionally practiced in Mali was characterized as moderate, tolerant, and adapted to local conditions. Women were allowed to participate in social economical and political activities and generally do not wear veils. According to the 2012 Pew Forum study \"The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity\", 94% of Muslim in Mali surveyed believe that religion very important in their lives, and 71% believe there is \"only one true way to understand Islam’s teachings\" (24% believing that multiple interpretations of Islam are possible).\n\nThe constitution establishes a secular state and provides for freedom of religion, and the government largely respects this right. Relations between Muslims and practitioners of minority religious faiths are generally friendly, and foreign missionary groups (both Muslim and non-Muslim) are tolerated. Parties based on ethnic or religious lines are banned and public schools do not offer religious instruction.\n\nPrior to the Northern Mali conflict, human rights groups recorded \"no recent reports of persecution, discrimination, or imprisonment on the basis of religious convictions or affiliation.\" However, terrorist groups attempted to institute strict Islamic law in the northern parts of the country in 2012 and Mali was listed high (#7) in the Christian persecution index published by Open Doors, which described the persecution in the north as severe. In spite of this, a 2015 study estimated some 8,000 believers in Christ from a Muslim background in the country. Several Islamic sites in Mali were destroyed or damaged by vigilante activists linked to Al Qaeda, claiming that \"idol worship\" characterized the sites. Given the cultural and religious importance of the sites in the city of Timbuctu (Tomboctou), eight of the shrines on the UNESCO heritage list had been fully reconstructed, and another six were in the process of reconstruction, by July 2015. However, the occupation and Sharia law were both short-lived, cut short by a French and Chadian military intervention that began in January 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "56286237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56286237", "title": "Rishu", "text": "Rishu\n\nRishu is a Daoist term originated from China with its influence spread across East Asia. The term has variable significance in different religions and cultures. This term finds its first evident presence dated back to 217 BCE in China.\n\nIn Mainland China, the Rishu (日書) \"Day Book\" is one of the divinatory books discovered in late Warring States period tomb libraries which has confirmed the \"Baopuzi\" description of Yubu as a series of three steps. It has great cultural significance in ancient and medieval China. It is an almanac or hemerology which is one of the Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts recovered in 1975 in Shuihudi, Hubei, from a tomb dated 217 BCE. Donald Harper (1999:843) believes that for describing texts like the \"Rishu\" 日書, which determine lucky and unlucky days on sexagenary cycle numerology without reference to astrology, \"hemerology\" is a more accurate translation than \"almanac\" (typically meaning an annual publication for a single calendar year).\n\nThe \"Rishu\" has one occurrence of \"Yubu san\" 禹步三, \"'Steps of Yu, three times\", and one of \"Yubu sanmian\" 禹步三勉, \"Steps of Yu, three exertions\". This is consistent with the \"Baopuzi\" descriptions of \"Yubu\" in terms of \"sanbu\" \"three steps\" and \"jiuji\" 九跡, \"nine footprints/traces,\" where each \"step\" was composed of three separate steps. Andersen (1989:17) notes that the term \"Sanbu jiuji\" was later used synonymously with \"Yubu\".\n\nYu is closely associated with travel in the \"Rishu\" (Harper 1999:872). The section titled \"Yu xuyu\" 禹須臾 \"Promptuary/Instant of Yu\" begins by listing the stem and branch sexagenary cycle in five groups of twelve signs each, and gives, for the days in each group, a certain lucky time of day to safely begin a journey. This section concludes with a ritual to be performed before going out of the city gate.\nWhen traveling, on reaching the threshold-bar of the capital gate, perform the Pace of Yu thrice. Advance one pace. Call out, \"\"Kǝgw\" [\"gao\" 皋 \"name of the spirit being addressed\"], I dare make a declaration. Let so-and-so [to be filled in with the name of the traveler] travel and not suffer odium; he first acts as Yu to clear the road.\" Immediately draw five lines on the ground. Pick up the soil from the center of the lines and put it in your bosom. (tr. Harper 1999:873) \n\nIsabelle Robinet (1997:39) says this text lets us reconstruct the connection between \"exorcistic practices intended to ward off harmful demons, and therapeutic practices intended to ensure good hygiene and good physical balance\", in other words, \"the evolution of exorcism toward medicine, a shift from conceiving sickness as caused by demons to seeing sickness as the result of an imbalance\".\n\nIn Japan, the term has more varied and spreaded significances in different aspects of its culture. The most prominent of them are listed below:\n\nRishu-kyō (the Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sutra) is one of the primary literature for all the schools of orthodox Shingonshu. The others being the Mahavairocana Tantra, the Vajrasekhara Sutra, and the Susiddhikāra Sūtra (Soshitsuji-kyō 蘇悉地経). These are the four principle texts of Esoteric Buddhism. They are all Tantras, literally \"treatise\". These texts played a vital role in Tachikawa-ryu. But according to the author and Tachikawa-ryu historian, John Stevens as well as James Sanford, the most important text to the ryūha (流派) perhaps, was the \"Sutra of Secret Bliss\" (ca. 1100). This sutra contains the school's general teachings concerning sexuality and its role in reaching enlightenment. It was Rishu-kyō.\n\nRishu has a prominent presence across the various cultures of the contemporary world. Although due to the variation of phonetics in different languages, the exact translation may sometimes vary in the form of spelling, but the real importance is depicted well in every associated culture. It is evident from the walloping applications of the term in the various aspects of daily life as follows -\n\n\nThere are several places across Asia associated with this term in different aspects.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56378928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56378928", "title": "Sacca-kiriya", "text": "Sacca-kiriya\n\nSacca-kiriyā (Pāli; , but more often: \"satyādhiṣṭhāna\"), is a solemn declaration of truth, expressed in ritual speech. Most often found in Buddhism, it can be an utterance with regard to one's own virtue, or with regard to a certain fact, followed by a command or resolution. Such a statement is believed to effect a wonder-working power that can benefit oneself and others, depending on the truthfulness of the person making the statement. The \"sacca-kiriyā\" is a motif found in the stories of the Buddhist Pali Canon and its commentaries, as well as in post-canonical works such as the Milindapañhā and the Avadānas. In these stories it is found usually as a blessing, but sometimes as a curse. The motif can also be found in Hindu and Jain texts.\n\nThe \"sacca-kiriyā\" presumes a moral force of truth that is operating in the world, and is stronger than gods or humans. Although \"sacca-kiriyā\" often refer to characteristics of the Buddha, the Buddhist teaching, and the monastic community, it can also refer to facts with regard to natural phenomena, such as the sun or the moon. Some scholars believe that the effectiveness of a \"sacca-kiriyā\" as portrayed in stories depends on virtue and good character, whereas other scholars understand the \"sacca-kiriyā\" to be merely about speaking according to facts. Scholars theorize that the \"sacca-kiriyā\" is an ancient belief that precedes Buddhism, but was used in Buddhism as a teaching device to explain Buddhist ethics and other teachings. The principles underlying the \"sacca-kiriyā\" have also been connected with Mahatma Gandhi's ideal of non-violent resistance, and many other aspects of Asian culture and religious life.\n\n\"Sacca-kiriyā\" is a compound noun that derives from the root verb \"saccikaroti\", meaning 'to bring before one's eyes, see face to face, realize, experience, attain'. A \"sacca-kiriya\" is a solemn asseveration with regard to the truth, expressed as a ritualized speech act. It is usually a truthful utterance with regard to having performed a certain virtue, followed by a command or resolution, called a 'truth-command' (', '). The \"sacca-kiriyā\" will usually contain a phrase \"By this truth may...\" () or \"By this power may...\" (), followed by the command or wish. It is generally made with a specific end in mind, such as to control a spirit, a physical object, or cause something to be done. Other examples given in the traditional literature are restoring eyesight after blindness, causing other living beings to help, causing pregnancy, and causing a sea to retreat. Virtues referred to are to have never hurt a living being, having performed generosity, kindness, religious devotion and other virtues. The truthfulness in these virtues is considered the \"ground\" (\"\") for the realization of the \"sacca-kiriyā\", but the ground need not be causally related to it. Sometimes, the \"sacca-kiriyā\" is finished with certain symbolic rituals, such as the pouring of water, bathing and putting on new garments, and so forth. The \"sacca-kiriyā\" is always a formal act. Indologist George Thompson uses the term \"performative utterance\" as coined by philosopher J. L. Austin, because the \"sacca-kiriyā\" manages to realize the statement \"in the very uttering\".\n\nThe Indic \"sacca-kiriyā\" is in its essence very similar to oaths that can be found in ancient Indo-European literature. It differs, however, in that the speaker does not necessarily commit to a course of action, but rather expresses a performative utterance, which is immediate and miraculous in nature.\n\nThere are many examples in literature and in Asian history of people making a \"sacca-kiriyā\". The most well-known is that of the Buddha himself. On the evening of his enlightenment, as the Buddha is about to attain enlightenment, he is challenged by Māra, the Buddhist personification of evil. Māra tries to stop the Buddha from attaining enlightenment by accusing him he has no right to sit on the seat beneath the tree of enlightenment, and challenging him to find a witness to his claim of enlightenment. The Buddha-to-be then calls Mother Earth to testify of his perfections of virtue on the evening of his enlightenment, the earth symbolizing truth and righteousness. He refers to the virtues he has practiced for many lifetimes. When the earth confirms the Buddha's claims, Māra retreats. In another example, the Buddha-to-be places a bowl upon the surface of the water. He declares that if he is to attain Buddhahood that evening, let the bowl float upwards against the stream, which then happens according to his declaration. In another widely quoted Jātaka story, a quail is about to see its nest and fellow birds consumed by a forest fire. After the bird makes a statement about the \"efficacy of virtue\" (') and \"efficacy of truth\" ('), and by expanding on the virtues of the Buddhas in the past, the fire miraculously retreats.\n\nA legendary example of a \"sacca-kiriyā\" referring to a future act is emperor Ashoka, who vows that by the truth of his intention to support and sustain Buddhism, a dying Bodhi Tree may be saved, which then happens according to his vow. Another example raised by Indologist Richard Gombrich is that of the Sri Lankan King Duṭṭhagāmaṇi, who used a \"sacca-kiriyā\" in warfare. And more recently, the Buddhist reformer Anagārika Dharmapāla referred to his good intentions for restoring the pilgrimage site Bodh Gaya into Buddhist hands, and resolved that by those intentions help would come in this campaign.\n\nThe \"sacca-kiriyā\" is a motif found in the stories of the Buddhist Pali Canon and its commentaries, as well as in post-canonical works such as the Milindapañhā and the Avadānas. The motif can also be found in Hindu and Jain texts. The motif of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" presumes a natural moral force operating in the world. In some stories, as well as in aspirations recorded in inscriptions, mention is also made of merit (; doing good works) as a force behind the miracles that occur. Sometimes the spiritual power of the Triple Gem (the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha), or that of deities is also related to it. Nevertheless, the truth of the statement, its agreement to actual events or qualities, is the main principle that is believed to allow a \"sacca-kiriyā\" to work: in the words of Indologist Eugene Burlingame, \"There is nothing that cannot be accomplished by the Truth. Men, gods, powers of nature, all animate and inanimate things alike obey the Truth.\" In the Milindapañhā, considered the locus classicus about \"sacca-kiriyā\", The protagonist King Milinda asks how someone's eyesight (referring to a story of King Sivi) could be restored by divine means when this seems to contradict Buddhist doctrine. The monk Nāgasena's reply is that King Sivi did not receive divine help, nor is there a physical cause for the healing, but he was healed \"by truth alone\".\n\nAlthough the \"sacca-kiriyā\" usually refers to a past act, sometimes devotees may refer to a future act which they will perform, or a good intention that has not yet been acted upon. Sometimes the \"sacca-kiriyā\" refers to a fact in the present, but the expressed wish refers to the future. This form is also known as an 'aspiration' () and usually involves an aim in a future life. Moreover, a \"sacca-kiriyā\" can be performed for another person's benefit, for example to heal another person. In this case, the speaker may refer to the other's person virtue, rather than his own. Devotees performing a \"sacca-kiriyā\" may also refer to a truthful statement about the Triple Gem. An example of this is the statement that the Buddha is born \"for the salvation of all beings\". In the Buddhist text Ratana Sutta many other examples are given. Lastly, at times, a \"sacca-kiriya\" may refer to the reality of certain natural phenomena, such as the sun or moon, or the characteristics of certain places, or simply a factual statement, even a failure to do something or a mistake made. In general, however, the effectiveness of the utterance depends on the speaker's truthfulness and the religious merit the speaker possesses.\n\nBuddhist tales relate that not only spiritually advanced people can perform a \"sacca-kiriyā\", but also common people, although this is less common in pre-Buddhist Vedic literature. Furthermore, in the literature examples exist of people using a \"sacca-kiriyā\" to deceive or curse others, or in other ways act in an anti-social way. Even these people have the power to control the outside environment and people through a \"sacca-kiriyā\". Certain people with an immoral reputation in the stories, such as the courtesan Bindumatī, are also depicted as being able to do miracles, based on a truthful statement they make. In the case of the courtesan the truth is that she is \"free alike from fawning and contempt\" for her clients, regardless of their caste. Buddhism scholar Luis Gómez argued that the truth of the courtesan was simply that she never denied being a courtesan.\n\nScholars are not in agreement what determines the power of the \"sacca-kiriyā\". Judging from the story of courtesan Bindumatī, religion scholar Malcolm Eckel concludes that the \"sacca-kiriyā\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s power is in its underlying intention, not its words. However, South Asian Studies scholar Choy Fah Kong argues that intention is not the major factor that explains the power of the \"sacca-kiriyā\", but rather whether the statement made agrees with facts. In studying examples from Vedic texts, Thompson concludes that the emphasis on self-assertion is a common characteristic in \"sacca-kiriyā\" statements, and that they are not necessarily morally motivated. Both disagree with Indologist William Norman Brown, who stressed that the \"sacca-kiriyā\" was mostly ethical rather than magical. On the other hand, Indologist Heinrich Lüders stated that the \"sacca-kiriyā\" is somewhere \"in the middle between oath and magic\".\n\nAccording to Burlingame, the \"sacca-kiriyā\" derives from a belief found everywhere in the world, which underlies many forms of religiosity, both of major religions and of folk religion: the belief that truth has an inherent importance and power in it. He adds, however, that at times it may simply be a \"deux ex machina\" device to facilitate story-telling.\n\nIndologist William Norman Brown argued that the \"sacca-kiriyā\" is based on \"truth of life, personal integrity, truth in one's personal conduct in its totality, truth in acceptance of responsibilities and fulfillment of them\". Through this personal integrity, the speaker of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" \"can bend the cosmic forces to his will\". Brown believed that this interpretation of the \"sacca-kiriya\" dates back as early as the Rig Veda (1700–1100 BCE). For this argument, Brown referred to an ancient Vedic belief that human beings could derive a power out of truth by fulfilling their duties () according to the cosmic order (). Brown, as well as Indologist Heinrich Zimmer, described the \"sacca-kiriyā\" as such perfect and moral fulfillment of duty, referring to examples in Buddhist scripture and the Hindu Bhagavadgītā. This fulfillment implies a high commitment to a virtue or vow and a sense of sacrifice to that end. Zimmer further argued that living one's life in a virtuous way like this, is in itself a \"sacca-kiriyā\".\n\nThompson and Kong reject Brown's theory, however, both arguing that Brown is applying anachronisms. Kong states that such a belief had not yet developed in Vedic times. Thompson takes issue with the moral\nnature of Brown's theory. Kong also rejects that the \"sacca-kiriyā\" is a fulfillment of duty, and argues that it is more a statement of fact. Kong, as well as Lüders, do concur that as early as the Rig Veda and Atharvaveda, a belief is attested with regard to the efficacy of utterances of truth. Kong does describe the \"sacca-kiriyā\" as a pre-Buddhist \"old belief\". She does not believe it had much to do with fulfillment of duties, however. Drawing from textual analysis of Indic and other ancient Indo-European sources, Thompson also argues that the \"sacca-kiriyā\" was a pre-Buddhist practice, popular and widespread.\n\nKong theorizes that the idea of \"ṛta\" as cosmic order should be understood in terms of the original meaning of the word \"ṛta\" as 'truth'. The ancient Indians believed that the world was created through the working-power of speech. She also relates the motif of \"sacca-kiriyā\" to the ancient practice of calling out the names of gods and requesting something of them. The working-power of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" does not lie in its moral intention or fulfillment of duty, but rather whether the utterance agrees with the facts. Furthermore, for the ancient Buddhists, the fact that the Buddha never spoke untruth in itself provided the devotee with miraculous power. She construes that this ancient belief about the power of truthful facts has later been misunderstood by Buddhist commentators, and instead explained as the power of meditative attainment (), the power of loving-kindness and the power of morality. However, she continues, these are not the actual of truth: only through the manifestation of truth, i.e. the spoken word that corresponds with facts, can a \"sacca-kiriyā\" be accomplished.\n\nWith regard to the \"sacca-kiriyā\" scholars point out that speaking untruth in early Buddhist ethics was highly condemned, often more so than other vices: in other words, truthful speech was very important to Buddhist ethics.\n\nIn a story about the disciple Aṅgulimāla, he performs a \"sacca-kiriyā\" to help a woman deliver a baby safely. The words recorded in the story have become one of the \"paritta\" recitations, still chanted today for pregnant women. This example shows that the power of truth can still be invoked later, \"even when the person who first set the truth in motion has left the scene\". The blessing of Aṅgulimāla is believed to be a means to tap into Aṅgulimāla's power. Just like the Aṅgulimāla Sutta, the Ratana Sutta and other \"parittas\" are therefore still chanted today, as part of blessings given on special occasions. These texts will usually contain phrases typical for a truth-command in a \"sacca-kiriyā\", followed by a wish for the listeners.\n\nKong argues that the worship of relics in the early centuries of Buddhist history was based on the principle of \"sacca-kiriyā\". Thus, early Buddhists, as well as Theravādins, believed that a resolve made in front of the relics of an enlightened person could come true. They believed this not because of the invisible presence of the deceased master, but rather because of the truthfulness of the enlightened person: because the relics were of somebody who was believed to be \"incapable of speaking false speech\", what was said in front of the master's relics had also to come true. In Pure Land Buddhism, following a similar belief, the power of the vow that Amitābha Buddha once took to help all living beings can be invoked again by Pure Land devotees today. They can do so by calling Amitābha's name, because \"his Name is the Vow\".\n\nAlso, the principles of \"sacca-kiriya\" have been connected to the confessions of Buddhist and Jain monks. Moreover, the idea of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" may have motivated the aspirations () of ancient Buddhists as found in Buddhist scriptures and epigraphical findings, and informed devotional practices. For example, when devotees offer flowers to a Buddha image, they may make a resolve for enlightenment, based on the truth of the impermanence of the flowers on the one hand (a natural phenomenon), and based on the power of the accumulated merit on the other hand. Kong adds to that,\n\nKong concludes that the teachings on the efficacy of merit-making activities and the transference of such merit is \"promoted and sustained\" by the belief in the \"sacca-kiriyā\". Other Buddhist teachings such as those about the \"pāramis\" (virtues to be developed to be a Buddha), karma, loving-kindness, as well as the spiritual power of the Triple Gem and the worship of relics among Theravādins, have also been explained using the pre-Buddhist belief in \"sacca-kiriyā\". The motif of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" has also affected how the Hindu Upaniṣads explain Hindu doctrine. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad, for example, explains the doctrine on the self by an example of a \"sacca-kiriyā\" performed by a thief.\n\nScholars have further linked the concept of \"sacca-kiriyā\" to Gandhi's ideal of non-violent resistance (), literally meaning 'strict adherence to truth'. \"Satyāgraha\", as Zimmer states, was based on Gandhi's \"love of truth and dharma\", and scholars argue that non-violence was Gandhi's \"sacca-kiriyā\", which defined his \"satyāgraha\". Gandhi scholar Veena Howard does point out, however, that Gandhi's \"satyāgraha\" was a political community ideal, and was not limited to the individual as in the accounts of \"sacca-kiriyā\". Furthermore, in Gandhi's \"satyāgraha\", the divine will played an important role, whereas in the traditional \"sacca-kiriyā\" this was not the case. Nevertheless, Gandhi's concept of God was abstract and impersonal, and with regard to the \"sacca-kiriyā\", religion scholar Arvind Sharma notes that Gandhi equated God with truth, or even placed truth above God, and morality above the metaphysical.\n\nBrown argued that the idea of the \" sacca-kiriyā\" has not only influenced Gandhian philosophy, but has also inspired the national Indian motto \"Satyaṃ eva jayate\", meaning 'Truth alone conquers', originating from the Muṇḍaka Upaniśad.\n\n\"Sacca-kiriyās\" may have been used as a device to prove someone's innocence or truthfulness during an ordeal, as has been recorded in ancient Indian epics and classical dramas. This involved entering into a fire, and it was believed the innocent would survive the ordeal by the power of their truthfulness, expressed through a \"sacca-kiriyā\". However, in a Jain story relating a fire-ordeal, the accused survives by admitting her wrongdoing, rather than her innocence. Brown did not think that such ordeals were actual \"sacca-kiriyā\", though, as such passages merely teach \"the widespread belief that Truth protects the righteous\".\n\nOther applications of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" have also been observed. A \"sacca-kiriyā\" is inscribed at the gateway of the first \"stupa\" (monument) at Sanchi with a deterrent statement to the effect that a vandal of the \"stupa\" will be cursed. Also, the Vedic \"ṛṣi\" poets would usually close their hymns with a \"sacca-kiriyā\". Furthermore, statements very similar to the \"sacca-kiriyā\" were part of religious debates in ancient India, as the participants of the debate wagered their own lives, should they follow incorrect procedure during the debates. Thus, participants of debates are found to put their lives on the line in this manner in the Upaniṣads, in early Buddhist discourses, and in the accounts of the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang (602–664 CE).\n\nThe motif of the \"sacca-kiriyā\" continues to feature in South-Asian literature, up until modern times. For example, Asian Studies scholar Keller Kimbrough writes that 18th-century Japanese poems contain statements very similar to a \"sacca-kiriya\". Sometimes used to conjure rain and alleviate drought, it was believed that such poetry had to be written with an honest intention to be effective.\n\nApart from applications in religions that date from India, it has also been suggested some Zorastrianist texts can be explained as forms of \"sacca-kiriyā\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "700375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700375", "title": "Saci (Brazilian folklore)", "text": "Saci (Brazilian folklore)\n\nSaci ( ) is a character in Brazilian folklore. He is a one-legged black or mulatto youngster, who smokes a pipe and wears a magical red cap that enables him to disappear and reappear wherever he wishes (usually in the middle of a dust devil). Considered an annoying prankster in most parts of Brazil, and a potentially dangerous and malicious creature in others, he nevertheless grants wishes to anyone who manages to trap him or steal his magic cap. However, his cap is often depicted as having a bad smell. Most people who claimed to have stolen this cap say they can never wash the smell away.\n\nThere are several variants of the myth, including: Saci-pererê (), black as coal (the best known); Saci-trique (), mulatto and more benign; Saci-saçurá (), with red eyes. \n\nSaci-pererê is also the name of a Brazilian cocktail consisting of of cachaça and of honey, which is a home remedy said to be useful in treating the common cold.\n\nAn incorrigible prankster, the Saci causes no major harm, but there is no little harm that he won't do. He hides children's toys, sets farm animals loose, teases dogs—and curses chicken eggs, preventing them from hatching. In the kitchen, the Saci spills salt, sours the milk, burns the bean stew, and drops flies into the soup. \n\nIf a popcorn kernel fails to pop, it is because the Saci cursed it. Given half a chance, he dulls the seamstress's needles, hides her thimbles, and tangles her sewing threads. If he sees a nail lying on the ground, he turns the point up. In short, people blame anything that goes wrong—in or outside the house—on the Saci.\n\nBesides disappearing or becoming invisible (often with only his red cap and the red glow of his pipe still showing), the Saci can transform himself into a \"Matitaperê\" or \"Matita Pereira\", an elusive bird whose melancholic song seems to come from nowhere. One can escape a pursuing Saci by crossing a water stream. the Saci dares not cross, for then he loses all his powers. Another way is to drop ropes full of knots. The Saci is compelled to stop and undo the knots. One can also try to appease him by leaving behind some cachaça, or some tobacco for his pipe.\n\nHe is fond of juggling embers or other small objects and letting them fall through the holes on his palms. An exceedingly nimble fellow, the lack of his right leg does not prevent him from bareback-riding a horse, and sitting cross-legged while puffing on his pipe (a feat comparable to the Headless Mule's gushing fire from the nostrils).\n\nEvery dust devil, says the legend, is caused by the spin-dance of an invisible Saci. One can capture him by throwing into the dust devil a rosary made of separately blessed prayer beads, or by pouncing on it with a sieve. With care, the captured Saci can be coaxed to enter a dark glass bottle, where he can be imprisoned by a cork with a cross marked on it. He can also be enslaved by stealing his cap, which is the source of his power. However, depending on the treatment he gets from his master, an enslaved Saci who regains his freedom may become either a trustworthy guardian and friend, or a devious and terrible enemy.\n\nWhile some claim that the Saci myth originated in Europe in the 13th century such as the Monopod (creature), it probably derives from the \"Ŷaci-ŷaterê\" of Tupi-Guarani mythology, a magic one-legged child with bright red hair who would spell-bind people and break the forest's silence with his loud shouts and whistles. He was originally a creature of the night, and indeed the \"ŷaci\" () means \"Moon\" in Old Tupi.\n\nThis indigenous character was appropriated and transformed in the 18th century by the African slaves who had been brought in large numbers to Brazil. Farm slaves would tell Saci stories to amuse and frighten the children. In this process the creature became black, his red hair metamorphosed into a red cap, and, as the African elders who usually told the tales, he came to be always smoking his clay-and-reed pipe. His name mutated into various forms, such as \"Saci Taperê\" and \"Sá Pereira\" (a common Portuguese name), and eventually \"Saci Pererê.\"\n\nHis red cap may have been inspired on the Trasgo a mythical Portuguese creature with exact same powers as the Saci. The Saci-Pererê concept shows some syncretism with Christian elements: he bolts away when faced with crosses, leaving behind a sulphurous smell — classical attributes of the devil in Christian folklore.\n\nThe concepts of imprisoning a supernatural being in a bottle by a magically marked cork, and of forcing him to grant wishes in return of his liberty, have obvious parallels in the story of Aladdin from the Arabian Nights. This may be more than just a coincidence, since some slaves were Muslims and thus presumably familiar with the Arabian tales. Moreover, the occupation of parts of the Portuguese territory (namely in the south) by the Muslim Moors, between the years 711 and 1249, provides another possible path for Arabian influence on the Saci legend. Some people believe that Saci does exist.\n\n\nA novel species of dinosauromorph, discovered in 2001 at Agudo (southern Brazil), was named \"Sacisaurus\" because the fossil skeleton was missing one leg.\n\nThe names of the Brazilian satellites SACI-1 and SACI-2 were backronyms on the character's name, as well as four retrotransposons in the DNA of the fluke \"Schistosoma mansoni\" were named Saci-1, Saci-2, Saci-3, and Perere, for their ability to jump around in the parasite's genome\nSince the Saci's one-legged physique reminds us of people with a physical disability, a social network named SACI (an acronym of \"Solidariedade, Apoio, Comunicação e Informação\", or Solidarity, Support, Communication and Information) was created at the University of São Paulo with the purpose of stimulating these four efforts towards the social and medical rehabilitation of physically disabled people.\n\nDespite being a one-legged creature, the character is believed to be very agile and powerful, always defeating his enemies. As so, it's a mascot of some sport clubs in Brazil such as Sport Club Internacional and Social Futebol Clube.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "383899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383899", "title": "Seth MacFarlane", "text": "Seth MacFarlane\n\nSeth Woodbury MacFarlane (; born October 26, 1973) is an American actor, animator, filmmaker, and singer, working primarily in animation and comedy, as well as live-action and other genres. MacFarlane is the creator of the TV series \"Family Guy\" (1999–2003, 2005–present) and \"The Orville\" (2017–present), and co-creator of the TV series \"American Dad!\" (2005–present) and \"The Cleveland Show\" (2009–2013). He also wrote, directed, and starred in the films \"Ted\" (2012), its sequel \"Ted 2\" (2015), and \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" (2014).\n\nMacFarlane is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, where he studied animation. Recruited to Hollywood, he was an animator and writer for Hanna-Barbera for several television series, including \"Johnny Bravo\", \"Cow and Chicken\", \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"I Am Weasel\", and \"Larry & Steve\". He made several guest appearances on TV series such as \"Gilmore Girls\", \"The War at Home\" and \"FlashForward\". In 2008, he created his own YouTube series titled \"Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy\". He won several awards for his work on \"Family Guy\", including four Primetime Emmy Awards and an Annie Award. In 2009, he won the Webby Award for Film & Video Person of the Year. He occasionally speaks at universities and colleges throughout the United States, and is an active supporter of gay rights.\n\nMacFarlane has performed as a singer at several venues, including Carnegie Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. MacFarlane has released four studio albums, in the same vein of his musical idol Frank Sinatra, beginning with \"Music Is Better Than Words\" in 2011. He has been nominated for four Grammy Awards for his musical work. \nMacFarlane hosted the 85th Academy Awards in 2013 and was also nominated for Best Original Song for the song \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\" from \"Ted\".\n\nMacFarlane served as executive producer of the Neil deGrasse Tyson-hosted \"\", an update of the 1980s hosted by Carl Sagan. MacFarlane was instrumental in providing funding for the series, as well as securing studio support for it from other entertainment executives.\n\nMacFarlane was born and raised in Kent, Connecticut. His parents, Ronald Milton MacFarlane (born 1946) and Ann Perry (née Sager; 1947–2010), were born in Newburyport, Massachusetts. His sister is voice actress Rachael Ann MacFarlane (born 1976). He has roots in New England going back to the 1600s, and is a descendant of \"Mayflower\" passenger William Brewster. MacFarlane's parents met in 1970, when they both lived and worked in Boston, Massachusetts, and married later that year. The couple moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann began working in the Admissions Office at South Kent School. She later worked in the College Guidance and Admissions Offices at the Kent School, a selective college preparatory school, where Ronald was a teacher.\n\nDuring his childhood, MacFarlane developed an interest in illustration and began drawing cartoon characters Fred Flintstone and Woody Woodpecker, as early as two years old. By the age of five, MacFarlane knew that he would want to pursue a career in animation, and began by creating flip books, after his parents found a book on the subject for him. Four years later, aged nine, MacFarlane began publishing a weekly comic strip titled \"Walter Crouton\" for \"The Kent Good Times Dispatch\", the local newspaper in Kent, Connecticut, which paid him five dollars per week. In one anecdote from the time, MacFarlane said in an October 2011 interview that as a child he was always \"weirdly fascinated by the Communion ceremony\". He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking \"Can I have fries with that?\" The paper printed it and he got an \"angry letter\" from the local priest; it led to \"sort of a little mini-controversy\" in the town.\n\nMacFarlane received his high school diploma in 1991 from the Kent School. While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and his parents gave him an 8 mm camera. MacFarlane went on to study film, video, and animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. As a student, he had intended to work for Disney but changed his mind after graduating.\n\nAt RISD MacFarlane created a series of independent films, meeting future \"Family Guy\" cast member Mike Henry, whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane's classmate. During his time at RISD, he performed stand-up comedy. In his senior year he made a thesis film titled \"The Life of Larry\", which became the inspiration for \"Family Guy\". A professor submitted his film to the animation studio Hanna-Barbera, where he was later hired.\n\nMacFarlane was recruited during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President Fred Seibert. He went to work at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of \"The Life of Larry\", rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent. He worked as an animator and writer for Cartoon Network's \"Cartoon Cartoons\" series. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an \"old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another\". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Cow and Chicken\", \"I Am Weasel\", and \"Johnny Bravo\". Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on \"Johnny Bravo\". He found it easier to develop his own style at \"Johnny Bravo\" through the show's process of scriptwriting, which \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Cow and Chicken\", and \"I Am Weasel\" did not use. As a part of the \"Johnny Bravo\" crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as Adam West and Jack Sheldon of \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his \"Family Guy\" series.\n\nHe also did freelance work for Walt Disney Television Animation, writing for \"Jungle Cubs\", and for Nelvana, where he wrote for \"\". Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on \"Ace Ventura\"). MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled \"Zoomates\" for Frederator Studios' \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\" on Nickelodeon. In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to \"The Life of Larry\" entitled \"Larry & Steve\", which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of Cartoon Network's \"World Premiere Toons\". Executives at Fox saw both \"Larry\" shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series.\n\nAlthough MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor. He first pitched \"Family Guy\" to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive for Hanna-Barbera, who was trying to get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of \"King of the Hill\" in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million). Recalling the experience in an interview with \"The New York Times\", MacFarlane stated, \"I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot\".\n\nAfter six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a \"very, very simply, crudely animated film – with just enough to get the tone of the show across\" to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and ordered the series immediately. In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of \"Family Guy\" for a January 1999 debut. \"Family Guy\" was originally intended to be a series of shorts on \"MADtv\", much in the same way \"The Simpsons\" had begun on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's \"MADtv\" connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns. At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.\n\n\"Family Guy\" first aired January 31, 1999. MacFarlane's work in animating \"Family Guy\" has been influenced by Jackie Gleason and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from \"The Simpsons\" and \"All in the Family\". In addition to writing three episodes, \"Death Has a Shadow\", \"Family Guy Viewer Mail 1\" and \"North by North Quahog\", MacFarlane voices \"Family Guy\"s main male characters – Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake Tucker, and additional characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and established fan loyalty, \"Family Guy\" developed into a US$1-billion franchise. On May 4, 2008, after approximately two and a half years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a US$100-million agreement with Fox to keep \"Family Guy\" and \"American Dad!\" until 2012. The agreement makes him the world's highest paid television writer.\n\nMacFarlane's success with \"Family Guy\" has opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer Walter Murphy created \"\". The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track \"Stewie's Sexy Party\". A fan of Broadway musicals, MacFarlane comments on using musicals as a component to \"Family Guy\":\n\nIn addition, a \"Family Guy\" video game was released in 2006. Two years later, in August 2007, he closed a digital content production deal with AdSense. MacFarlane takes cast members on the road to voice characters in front of live audiences. \"Family Guy Live\" provides fans with the opportunity to hear future scripts. In mid-2007, Chicago fans had the opportunity to hear the then upcoming sixth-season premiere \"Blue Harvest\". Shows have been played in Montreal, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.\nOn July 22, 2007, in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although \"nothing's official\". In September 2007, Ricky Blitt gave TV.com an interview confirming that he had already started working on the script. Then in \"TV Week\" on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released \"Family Guy\" feature film sometime \"within the next year\". He came up with an idea for the story, \"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie\". He later went on to say he imagines the film to be \"an old-style musical with dialogue\" similar to \"The Sound of Music\", saying that he would \"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel\". On October 13, 2011, MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a \"Family Guy\" film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt. On November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a \"Family Guy\" film.\n\nDespite its popularity, \"Family Guy\" has often been criticized. The Parents Television Council frequently criticizes the show for its content, once organized a letter-writing campaign aimed at removing it from Fox's lineup, and has filed complaints with the Federal Communications Commission alleging that some episodes of the show contained indecent content. MacFarlane has responded to the PTC's criticism by saying, among other things, \"That's like getting hate mail from Hitler. They're literally terrible human beings.\"\n\n\"Family Guy\" has been cancelled twice, although strong fan support and DVD sales have caused Fox to reconsider. MacFarlane mentioned how these cancellations affected the lineup of writers each time Fox approved the show. \"One of the positive aspects of \"Family Guy\" constantly being pulled off [the air] is that we were always having to restaff writers\".\n\nDuring the sixth season, episodes of \"Family Guy\" and \"American Dad!\" were delayed from regular broadcast due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike (which MacFarlane participated in to support the writers while Fox aired three \"Family Guy\" episodes without MacFarlane's permission). On February 12, 2008, the strike ended, and the series resumed airing regularly, beginning with \"Back to the Woods\".\n\nMacFarlane has a second long-running, successful adult animated series in \"American Dad!\" which has been in production since early 2005. To date, \"American Dad!\" is MacFarlane's only animated series never to have suffered an official cancellation, though it did undergo a network relocation from Fox to TBS on October 20, 2014, following the show's 11th season. TBS announced on July 16, 2013, that they had picked up the series for a 15-episode 12th season. Reportedly, the purpose of the network relocation was originally to make room for new animated broadcasts on Fox's now-defunct \"Animation Domination\" lineup. It was reported that the relocation of \"American Dad!\" allowed room for other shows, such as \"Mulaney\" and another animated series from Seth MacFarlane called \"Bordertown\". \"Bordertown\" ran during the 2015–16 television season.\n\nWhile MacFarlane regularly does extensive voice acting work for \"American Dad!\", he has left much of the show's creative direction up to Weitzman and Barker. MacFarlane has credited this move with helping to give the series its own distinct voice and identity. Though, as announced on November 4, 2013, Barker departed \"American Dad!\" after 10 seasons of serving as the show's producer/co-showrunner, resulting from creative differences as production for season 11 on TBS commenced.\n\n\"American Dad!\" was first shown after Super Bowl XXXIX, debuting with the episode \"Pilot\", which MacFarlane co-wrote. This February 6, 2005 series premiere was somewhat of an early sneak preview as the program would not begin airing regularly as part of Fox's Animation Domination until May 1, 2005. Because of atypical scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, \"American Dad!\" has a controversial season number discrepancy in which many are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between \"American Dad!\" creators and the show's official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website. At Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, \"American Dad!\" co-creator Mike Barker hinted that an \"American Dad!\" movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. What with Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear if any of these plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.\n\nMacFarlane has described the initial seasons of \"American Dad!\" as being similar to \"All in the Family\", likening title character Stan Smith's originally bigoted persona to Archie Bunker. MacFarlane has also stated that his inspiration to create \"American Dad!\" derived from his and Weitzman's exasperation with George W. Bush's policies as former United States President. After the early couple of seasons however, the series discontinued using these elements of political satire and began to serve up its own brand of entertainment and humor. MacFarlane was described as having difficulty understanding the series in its early going; however, he heavily warmed up to the series after its early seasons once he felt the show truly came into its own. His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed he is an \"American Dad!\" fan himself. He has taken note of the positive reaction to the \"Roger\" character by fans via his Twitter.\n\nThe show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the endangering, dog-eat-dog, rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family's breadwinner, he works as a CIA officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show is known for its story arc elements and other distinguishing plot techniques); Stan's paradoxically moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, Francine; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter Hayley and nerdy son Steve. Accompanying the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which belong to non-human species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien Roger, who's full of disguises/alter egos and has few if any limits on his behaviors. He was rescued by Stan from Area 51; Klaus, the man-in-a-fish-body pet. Klaus's unenviable situation came about from the brain of an East German Olympic skier being shrunk and transplanted into a fish body; and Jeff Fischer, Hayley's boyfriend turned \"whipped\" husband, known for his infatuation with Hayley's mom, Francine. Together, the Smiths and their three housemates run what is only at a first glance the typical middle-class American lifestyle, but is anything but.\n\nSeth MacFarlane provides the voices of Stan and Roger, basing Roger's voice on Paul Lynde (who played Uncle Arthur in \"Bewitched\"). His sister Rachael MacFarlane provides the voice of Hayley.\n\nMacFarlane developed a \"Family Guy\" spin-off called \"The Cleveland Show\", which focuses on the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by \"Family Guy\" writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. Due to strong ratings, Fox picked up the back nine episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44. The series ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 4 seasons and 88 episodes, and the character of Cleveland returned to \"Family Guy\" in the episode \"He's Bla-ack!\".

Critical response to MacFarlane's performance was mixed.

The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write \"Oklahoma!\" for 2011?\" He has also said that, \"The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate. It gets done when it gets done.\"\n\nIn late 2011, it was confirmed that MacFarlane is working on another animated series with Alex Borstein and Gary Janetti. Currently not much is known about the series other than it will be about a family and will have a female lead role. Janetti stated that the series has not yet been greenlit by Fox.\n\nMacFarlane has appeared in sitcoms, comedy and news programs, independent films, and other animated shows.

MacFarlane also appeared as the engineer Ensign Rivers on \"\" in the third-season episode \"\" and the fourth-season episode \"\". During 2006, MacFarlane had a role in the independent film \"Life is Short\". He portrayed Dr. Ned, a psychologist who advises a short man (played by \"Freaks and Geeks\" star Samm Levine) to have relationships with taller women. He is a frequent guest on the radio talkshow \"Loveline\", hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky.\nMacFarlane appeared on the November 11, 2006 episode of Fox's comedy show \"MADtv\" and performed a live action re-enactment of a scene from the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High\". In the scene, Peter and Lois suspect Chris of murdering his teacher's husband. As a reaction, a terrified Meg jumps out the window. For the live-action sequence, besides MacFarlane, Nicole Parker played Lois, Ike Barinholtz played Chris, Nicole Randall Johnson played Meg, and Keegan-Michael Key played Stewie. According to MacFarlane, the live-action thing didn't work too well. After that clip, MacFarlane showed the same scene, but with celebrities who didn't pay attention to the script. They messed up their lines so badly that MacFarlane, in his Peter voice, screamed \"The script, guys! Come on!\" MacFarlane served as a host to the Canadian Awards for the Electronic & Animated Arts's Second Annual Elan Awards on February 15, 2008. MacFarlane has also appeared on news shows and late night television shows such as \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"Late Show with David Letterman\".

Victory is mine!\" Three months later on March 24, 2007, MacFarlane was interviewed on Fox's \"Talkshow with Spike Feresten\", and closed the show by singing the Frank Sinatra song \"You Make Me Feel So Young\". He also provided Stewie's voice when he appeared as a brain tumor-induced hallucination to Seeley Booth in an episode of \"Bones\", writing his own dialogue for the episode. On May 8, 2009, MacFarlane was a guest on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\".\n\nOther than \"Family Guy\" and \"American Dad!\", MacFarlane voices characters in other cartoon shows and films. He voiced Wayne \"The Brain\" McClain in an episode of \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\". He has also voiced various characters on Adult Swim's \"Robot Chicken\", including a parody of Lion-O and Emperor Palpatine as well as Peter Griffin in the Season 2 premiere – he even parodied himself in the Season 4 premiere, in which he renewed the show simply by mentioning it in a \"Family Guy\"-like cutaway after its fictitious cancellation at the end of Season 3.

In 2010, he reappeared at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a Christmas concert special. In 2012, it was announced he would again appear at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a concert celebrating Broadway musicals. In 2015, MacFarlane again appeared at The Proms as a vocalist with the John Wilson Orchestra, this time in a Sinatra program. Regarding his musical passion, MacFarlane has said, \"I love and am fascinated by exciting orchestration—what you can do with a band that size—and I think in many ways it's a lost art.\" His music is predominantly vocal, vocal jazz, show tunes, and swing. He will occasionally use musical comedy for either his shows or movies.\n\nMacFarlane has a baritone voice. He is a pianist and singer who, in his early years, trained with Lee and Sally Sweetland, the vocal coaches of Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra. In an interview with NPR, MacFarlane commented on their vocal training, to which he said \"They really drill you,\" he said. \"They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help. ... [They teach you to] show your teeth. If you look at old photos of Sinatra while he's singing, there's a lot of very exposed teeth. That was something that Lee Sweetland hit on day in and day out, and correctly so, because it just brightens the whole performance.\" His comedy influences include people like Woody Allen, Jackie Gleason, Mel Brooks, and the creators of Monty Python, while his musical influences include people like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Vic Damone, Johnny Mercer, Bing Crosby, Bobby Darin, Gordon MacRae, and the Rat Pack.\n\nMacFarlane is a supporter of the Democratic Party.

After the primaries, MacFarlane then supported Hillary Clinton for president during the general election.\n\nMacFarlane is passionate about his support for gay rights. In 2008 he called it \"infuriating and idiotic\" that two gay partners \"have to go through this fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'\" He went on to say, \"I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time\". MacFarlane continued, \"Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?\"\n\nMacFarlane, in recognition of \"his active, passionate commitment to humanist values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues\", was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011.\n\nHowever, MacFarlane was criticized for his portrayal of transsexualism in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Quagmire's Dad\". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin—as well as a scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father—to be \"shockingly insensitive\". Hartinger continued, \"Frankly, it's literally \"impossible\" for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I come to the conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot\". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared \"serious concerns being voiced from members of the community\" about the episode. MacFarlane said he was \"surprised\" by the negative reaction to \"Quagmire's Dad\", saying that \"it seemed that [gay commentators] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character\". He further added, \"Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'\"\n\nMacFarlane is a frequent speaking guest on college campuses. On April 16, 2006, he was invited by Stanford University's ASSU Speakers' Bureau to address an audience of over 1,000 at Memorial Auditorium. MacFarlane was invited by Harvard University's class of 2006 to deliver the \"class day\" address on June 7, 2006. He spoke as himself, and also as Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin and Glenn Quagmire. He also has delivered speeches at George Washington University, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Texas, the University of Missouri, University of Toledo, Bowling Green State University, and Loyola Marymount University.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, MacFarlane publicly sided with the Writers Guild, and fully participated in the strike. Official production of \"Family Guy\" was halted for most of December 2007 and various periods afterwards. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, and although he refused to work on the show during the strike, his contract with Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it subsequently produced. Rumors of continued production on \"Family Guy\" prompted the statement from MacFarlane that \"...it would just be a colossal dick move if they did that\". During the strike, MacFarlane wrote an inside joke into an episode of \"Family Guy\" about Jon Stewart's choice to return to the air and undermine the writers of \"The Daily Show\", causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the \"moral arbiter\" of Hollywood. The strike ended on February 12, 2008.\n\nMacFarlane donated money to create The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive at the Library of Congress. MacFarlane said, \"The work of Carl Sagan has been a profound influence in my life, and the life of every individual who recognizes the importance of humanity's ongoing commitment to the exploration of our universe [...] The continuance of our journey outward into space should always occupy some part of our collective attention, regardless of whatever Snooki did last week.\"\n\nIn a 2004 interview with \"The Daily Princetonian\", MacFarlane noted his similarities to Brian Griffin from \"Family Guy\", revealing, \"I have some Brian type issues from time to time—looking for the right person—but I date as much as the next guy\".\n\nOn July 16, 2010, MacFarlane's mother, Ann Perry Sager, died after a long battle with cancer. Her death was reported by Larry King on his show \"Larry King Live\", who acknowledged a conversation he had with her during an interview with her son in May 2010.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was scheduled to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15 a.m. instead of 7:45 a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight, as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46 a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said:The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people have a lot of close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car . . . this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the back of my head.\n\nOn October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing \"Family Guy\" of infringing its copyright on the song \"When You Wish upon a Star\", through a parody song titled \"I Need a Jew\" appearing in the episode \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\". Bourne Co., which holds the copyright, alleged the parody pairs a \"thinly veiled\" copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, and Walter Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that \"I Need a Jew\" uses the copyrighted melody of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that \"Family Guy\" did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.\n\nIn December 2007, \"Family Guy\" was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in \"\", in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature magic parody act, involving absurd faux magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune \"Fine and Dandy\". MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox, Steve Callaghan, and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit. In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—\"purpose and character of the use\", \"nature of the infringed work\", and \"amount and substantiality of the taking\"—counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth—\"economic impact\"—had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers—not Metrano or his act. The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, MacFarlane was served with a lawsuit from the production company of a series of Internet videos called \"Charlie the Abusive Teddy Bear\" claiming that \"Ted\" infringes on the copyright of its videos due to the Ted bear largely matching the background story, persona, voice tone, attitude, and dialogue of the Charlie bear. The suit was dropped on March 23, 2015, after the plaintiffs withdrew the suit.\n\nMacFarlane has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on \"Family Guy\" and has been nominated twenty-two times, winning in 2000, 2002 and 2016. He has been nominated for five Grammy Awards for his work in \"\", \"Music Is Better Than Words\", \"Family Guy\", \"No One Ever Tells You\", and \"In Full Swing\". He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing the opening song, \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\", from his film \"Ted\" with the film's composer Walter Murphy.\n\nHe has received numerous awards from other organizations, including the Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production and the Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation for the \"Family Guy\" episode titled \"Blue Harvest\", the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo and the Empire Award for Best Comedy for \"Ted\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33802", "title": "Werewolf", "text": "Werewolf\n\nIn folklore, a werewolf (, \"man-wolf\") or occasionally lycanthrope ( \"lukánthrōpos\", \"wolf-person\") is a human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolflike creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called lycanthropy , are Petronius (27–66) and Gervase of Tilbury (1150–1228).\n\nThe werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore, existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period. From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World with colonialism. Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches, in the course of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland (especially the Valais and Vaud) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.\n\nThe persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the \"witch-hunt\" phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials. During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of Peter Stumpp (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves, primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of wolf-charmers recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia and Styria.\n\nAfter the end of the witch-trials, the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies and in the emerging Gothic horror genre; werewolf fiction as a genre has pre-modern precedents in medieval romances (e.g. \"Bisclavret\" and \"Guillaume de Palerme\") and developed in the 18th century out of the \"semi-fictional\" chap book tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern popular culture.\n\nThe word \"werewolf\" continues a late Old English \"wer(e)wulf\", a compound of \"were\" \"man\" and \"wulf\" \"wolf\". The only Old High German testimony is in the form of a given name, \"Weriuuolf\", although an early Middle High German \"werwolf\" is found in Burchard of Worms and Berthold of Regensburg. The word or concept does not occur in medieval German poetry or fiction, gaining popularity only from the 15th century. Middle Latin \"gerulphus\" Anglo-Norman \"garwalf\", Old Frankish \"*wariwulf\".\nOld Norse had the cognate \"varúlfur\", but because of the high importance of werewolves in Norse mythology, there were alternative terms such as \"ulfhéðinn\" (\"one in wolf-skin\", referring still to the totemistic or cultic adoption of wolf-nature rather than the superstitious belief in actual shape-shifting). In modern Scandinavian also \"kveldulf\" \"evening-wolf\", presumably after the name of Kveldulf Bjalfason, a historical berserker of the 9th century who figures in the Icelandic sagas.\n\nThe term \"lycanthropy\", referring both to the ability to transform oneself into a wolf and to the act of so doing, comes from Ancient Greek λυκάνθρωπος \"lukánthropos\" (from λύκος \"lúkos\" \"wolf\" and ἄνθρωπος, \"ánthrōpos\" \"human\").\nThe word does occur in ancient Greek sources, but only in Late Antiquity, only rarely, and only in the context of clinical lycanthropy described by Galen, where the patient had the ravenous appetite and other qualities of a wolf; the Greek word attains some currency only in Byzantine Greek, featuring in the 10th-century encyclopedia \"Suda\".\nUse of the Greek-derived \"lycanthropy\" in English occurs in learned writing beginning in the later 16th century (first recorded 1584 in \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\" by Reginald Scot, who argued \"against\" the reality of werewolves; \"Lycanthropia is a disease, and not a transformation.\" v. i. 92), at first explicitly for clinical lycanthropy, i.e. the type of insanity where the patient imagines to have transformed into a wolf, and not in reference to supposedly real shape-shifting. Use of \"lycanthropy\" for supposed shape-shifting is much later, introduced ca. 1830.\n\nSlavic uses the term \"vlko-dlak\" (Polish \"wilkołak\", Czech \"vlkodlak\", Slovak \"vlkolak\", Serbo-Croatian \"вукодлак\" - \"vukodlak\", Slovenian \"volkodlak\", Bulgarian \"върколак/vrkolak\", Belarusian \"ваўкалак/vaukalak\", Ukrainian \"вовкулака/vovkulaka\"), literally \"wolf-skin\", paralleling the Old Norse \"ulfhéðinn\". However, the word is not attested in the medieval period. The Slavic term was loaned into modern Greek as \"Vrykolakas\". Baltic has related terms, Lithuanian \"vilkolakis\" and \"vilkatas\", Latvian \"vilkatis\" and \"vilkacis\". The name \"vurdalak\" (вурдалак) for the Slavic vampire (\"ghoul, revenant\") is a corruption due to Alexander Pushkin, which was later widely spread by A.K. Tolstoy in his novella \"The Family of the Vourdalak\" (composed in French, but first published in Russian translation in 1884).\n\nGreek λυκάνθρωπος and Germanic \"werewulf\" are parallel inasmuch as the concept of a shapeshifter becoming a wolf is expressed by means of a compound \"wolf-man\" or \"man-wolf\".\n\nThe werewolf folklore found in Europe harks back to a common development during the Middle Ages, arising in the context of Christianisation, and the associated interpretation of pre-Christian mythology in Christian terms. Their underlying common origin can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European mythology, where \"lycanthropy\" is reconstructed as an aspect of the initiation of the warrior class. This is reflected in Iron Age Europe in the \"Tierkrieger\" depictions from the Germanic sphere, among others. The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is McCone (1987).\nSuch transformations of \"men into wolves\" in pagan cult were associated with the devil from the early medieval perspective.\n\nThe concept of the werewolf in Western and Northern Europe is strongly influenced by the role of the wolf in Germanic paganism (e.g. the French \"loup-garou\" is ultimately a loan from the Germanic term), but there are related traditions in other parts of Europe which were not necessarily influenced by Germanic tradition, especially in Slavic Europe and the Balkans, and possibly in areas bordering the Indo-European sphere (the Caucasus) or where Indo-European cultures have been replaced by military conquest in the medieval era (Hungary, Anatolia).\n\nIn his \"Man into Wolf\" (1948), Robert Eisler tried to cast the Indo-European tribal names meaning \"wolf\" or \"wolf-men\" in terms of \"the European transition from fruit gathering to predatory hunting.\"\nA few references to men changing into wolves are found in Ancient Greek literature and mythology. Herodotus, in his \"Histories\", wrote that the Neuri, a tribe he places to the north-east of Scythia, were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days, and then changed back to their human shape. In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias related the story of Lycaon, who was transformed into a wolf because he had ritually murdered a child. In accounts by the \"\"Bibliotheca\"\" (3.8.1) and Ovid (\"Metamorphoses\" I.219-239), Lycaon serves human flesh to Zeus, wanting to know if he is really a god. Lycaon's transformation, therefore, is punishment for a crime, considered variously as murder, cannibalism, and impiety.\nOvid also relates stories of men who roamed the woods of Arcadia in the form of wolves.\n\nIn addition to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. Virgil wrote of human beings transforming into wolves. Pliny the Elder relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes, he mentions a man who hung his clothes on an ash tree and swam across an Arcadian lake, transforming him into a wolf. On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he would be free to swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes Agriopas regarding a tale of a man who was turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.\n\nIn the Latin work of prose, the \"Satyricon\", written circa AD 60 by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, one of the characters, Niceros, tells a story at a banquet about a friend who turned into a wolf (chs. 61-62). He describes the incident as follows, \"When I look for my buddy I see he'd stripped and piled his clothes by the roadside... He pees in a circle round his clothes and then, just like that, turns into a wolf!... after he turned into a wolf he started howling and then ran off into the woods.\"\n\nThere was no widespread belief in werewolves in medieval Europe before the 14th century. There were some examples of man-wolf transformations in the court literature of the time. Liutprand of Cremona reports a rumour that Bajan, son of Simeon I of Bulgaria, could use magic to turn himself into a wolf. Marie de France's poem \"Bisclavret\" (c. 1200), in which the nobleman Bizuneh, for reasons not described, had to transform into a wolf every week. When his treacherous wife stole his clothing needed to restore his human form, he escaped the king's wolf hunt by imploring the king for mercy and accompanied the king thereafter. His behaviour at court was so much gentler than when his wife and her new husband appeared at court, that his hateful attack on the couple was deemed justly motivated, and the truth was revealed.\n\nThe German word \"werwolf\" is recorded by Burchard von Worms in the 11th century, and by Bertold of Regensburg in the 13th, but is not recorded in all of medieval German poetry or fiction. References to werewolves are also rare in England, presumably because whatever significance the \"wolf-men\" of Germanic paganism had carried, the associated beliefs and practices had been successfully repressed after Christianization (or if they persisted, they did so outside of the sphere of literacy available to us).\n\nThe Germanic pagan traditions associated with wolf-men persisted longest in the Scandinavian Viking Age. Harald I of Norway is known to have had a body of \"Úlfhednar\" (wolf coated [men]), which are mentioned in the Vatnsdœla saga, Haraldskvæði, and the Völsunga saga, and resemble some werewolf legends. The Úlfhednar were fighters similar to the berserkers, though they dressed in wolf hides rather than those of bears and were reputed to channel the spirits of these animals to enhance effectiveness in battle. These warriors were resistant to pain and killed viciously in battle, much like wild animals. Úlfhednar and berserkers are closely associated with the Norse god Odin.\n\nThe Scandinavian traditions of this period may have spread to Kievan Rus', giving rise to the Slavic \"werewolf\" tales. The 11th-century Belarusian Prince Vseslav of Polatsk was considered to have been a Werewolf, capable of moving at superhuman speeds, as recounted in \"The Tale of Igor's Campaign\": \n\n\"Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan. The path of Great Sun, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed. For him in Polotsk they rang for matins early at St. Sophia the bells; but he heard the ringing in Kiev.\"\n\nThe situation as described during the medieval period gives rise to the dual form of werewolf folklore in Early Modern Europe. On one hand the \"Germanic\" werewolf, which becomes associated with the witchcraft panic from around 1400, and on the other hand the \"Slavic\" werewolf or \"vlkolak\", which becomes associated with the concept of the revenant or \"vampire\". The \"eastern\" werewolf-vampire is found in the folklore of Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, Romania and the Balkans, while the \"western\" werewolf-sorcerer is found in France, German-speaking Europe and in the Baltic.\n\nThere were numerous reports of werewolf attacks – and consequent court trials – in 16th-century France. In some of the cases there was clear evidence against the accused of murder and cannibalism, but none of association with wolves; in other cases people have been terrified by such creatures, such as that of Gilles Garnier in Dole in 1573, there was clear evidence against some wolf but none against the accused. The \"loup-garou\" eventually ceased to be regarded as a dangerous heretic and reverted to the pre-Christian notion of a \"man-wolf-fiend\". The \"lubins\" or \"lupins\" were usually female and shy in contrast to the aggressive \"loups-garous\".\n\nWerewolvery was a common accusation in witch trials throughout their history, and it featured even in the Valais witch trials, one of the earliest such trials altogether, in the first half of the 15th century. Likewise, in the Vaud, child-eating werewolves were reported as early as 1448. A peak of attention to lycanthropy came in the late 16th to early 17th century, as part of the European witch-hunts.\nA number of treatises on werewolves were written in France during 1595 and 1615. Werewolves were sighted in 1598 in Anjou, and a teenage werewolf was sentenced to life imprisonment in Bordeaux in 1603. Henry Boguet wrote a lengthy chapter about werewolves in 1602. In the Vaud, werewolves were convicted in 1602 and in 1624. A treatise by a Vaud pastor in 1653, however, argued that lycanthropy was purely an illusion. After this, the only further record from the Vaud dates to 1670: it is that of a boy who claimed he and his mother could change themselves into wolves, which was, however, not taken seriously. At the beginning of the 17th century witchcraft was prosecuted by James I of England, who regarded \"warwoolfes\" as victims of delusion induced by \"a natural superabundance of melancholic\".\nAfter 1650, belief in Lycanthropy had mostly disappeared from French-speaking Europe, as evidenced in Diderot's Encyclopedia, which attributed reports of lycanthropy to a \"disorder of the brain. although there were continuing reports of extraordinary wolf-like beasts (but not werewolves). One such report concerned the Beast of Gévaudan which terrorized the general area of the former province of Gévaudan, now called Lozère, in south-central France; from the years 1764 to 1767, an unknown entity killed upwards of 80 men, women, and children.\nThe only part of Europe which showed vigorous interest in werewolves after 1650 was the Holy Roman Empire. At least nine works on lycanthropy were printed in Germany between 1649 and 1679. In the Austrian and Bavarian Alps, belief in werewolves persisted well into the 18th century.\n\nUntil the 20th century, wolf attacks on humans were an occasional, but still widespread feature of life in Europe.\nSome scholars have suggested that it was inevitable that wolves, being the most feared predators in Europe, were projected into the folklore of evil shapeshifters. This is said to be corroborated by the fact that areas devoid of wolves typically use different kinds of predator to fill the niche; \"werehyenas\" in Africa, \"weretigers\" in India, as well as \"werepumas\" (\"runa uturuncu\") and \"werejaguars\" (\"yaguaraté-abá\" or \"tigre-capiango\") in southern South America.\n\nAn idea is explored in Sabine Baring-Gould's work \"The Book of Werewolves\" is that werewolf legends may have been used to explain serial killings. Perhaps the most famous example is the case of Peter Stumpp (executed in 1589), the German farmer, and alleged serial killer and cannibal, also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.\n\nIn Asian Cultures, the \"were\" equivalent is a weretiger or wereleopard. (See werecats)\n\nCommon Turkic folklore holds a different, reverential light to the werewolf legends in that Turkic Central Asian shamans after performing long and arduous rites would voluntarily be able to transform into the humanoid \"Kurtadam\" (literally meaning Wolfman). Since the wolf was the totemic ancestor animal of the Turkic peoples, they would be respectful of any shaman who was in such a form.\n\nSome modern researchers have tried to explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled \"On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves\", in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital porphyria, stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity, reddish teeth and psychosis could have been grounds for accusing a sufferer of being a werewolf. This is however argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims. Others have pointed out the possibility of historical werewolves having been sufferers of hypertrichosis, a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe. People suffering from Down syndrome have been suggested by some scholars to have been possible originators of werewolf myths. Woodward suggested rabies as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies. However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way is not part of the original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.\n\nThe beliefs classed together under lycanthropy are far from uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his double whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his soul, which goes forth seeking whomever it may devour, leaving its body in a state of trance; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real animal or a familiar spirit, whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.\n\nWerewolves were said in European folklore to bear tell-tale physical traits even in their human form. These included the meeting of both eyebrows at the bridge of the nose, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. One method of identifying a werewolf in its human form was to cut the flesh of the accused, under the pretense that fur would be seen within the wound. A Russian superstition recalls a werewolf can be recognised by bristles under the tongue.\nThe appearance of a werewolf in its animal form varies from culture to culture, though it is most commonly portrayed as being indistinguishable from ordinary wolves save for the fact that it has no tail (a trait thought characteristic of witches in animal form), is often larger, and retains human eyes and voice. According to some Swedish accounts, the werewolf could be distinguished from a regular wolf by the fact that it would run on three legs, stretching the fourth one backwards to look like a tail. After returning to their human forms, werewolves are usually documented as becoming weak, debilitated and undergoing painful nervous depression.\nOne universally reviled trait in medieval Europe was the werewolf's habit of devouring recently buried corpses, a trait that is documented extensively, particularly in the \"Annales Medico-psychologiques\" in the 19th century.\nFennoscandian werewolves were usually old women who possessed poison-coated claws and had the ability to paralyse cattle and children with their gaze.\n\nVarious methods for becoming a werewolf have been reported, one of the simplest being the removal of clothing and putting on a belt made of wolfskin, probably as a substitute for the assumption of an entire animal skin (which also is frequently described). In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic salve. Drinking rainwater out of the footprint of the animal in question or from certain enchanted streams were also considered effectual modes of accomplishing metamorphosis.\nThe 16th-century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus says that the Livonian werewolves were initiated by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his \"Songs of the Russian People\" gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, it was said that a man or woman could turn into a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.\n\nIn other cases, the transformation was supposedly accomplished by Satanic allegiance for the most loathsome ends, often for the sake of sating a craving for human flesh. \"The werewolves\", writes Richard Verstegan (\"Restitution of Decayed Intelligence\", 1628), are certayne sorcerers, who having annoynted their bodies with an ointment which they make by the instinct of the devil, and putting on a certayne inchaunted girdle, does not only unto the view of others seem as wolves, but to their own thinking have both the shape and nature of wolves, so long as they wear the said girdle. And they do dispose themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and most of humane creatures.\n\nThe phenomenon of repercussion, the power of animal metamorphosis, or of sending out a familiar, real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician, male and female, all the world over; and witch superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the phenomenon of repercussion is asserted to manifest itself in connection with the bush-soul of the West African and the \"nagual\" of Central America; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the \"nagual\" with a human being are not termed lycanthropy. \n\nThe curse of lycanthropy was also considered by some scholars as being a divine punishment. Werewolf literature shows many examples of God or saints allegedly cursing those who invoked their wrath with werewolfism. Such is the case of Lycaon, who was turned into a wolf by Zeus as punishment for slaughtering one of his own sons and serving his remains to the gods as a dinner. Those who were excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church were also said to become werewolves.\n\nThe power of transforming others into wild beasts was attributed not only to malignant sorcerers, but to Christian saints as well. \"Omnes angeli, boni et Mali, ex virtute naturali habent potestatem transmutandi corpora nostra\" (\"All angels, good and bad have the power of transmutating our bodies\") was the dictum of St. Thomas Aquinas. St. Patrick was said to have transformed the Welsh King Vereticus into a wolf; Natalis supposedly cursed an illustrious Irish family whose members were each doomed to be a wolf for seven years. In other tales the divine agency is even more direct, while in Russia, again, men supposedly became werewolves when incurring the wrath of the Devil.\n\nA notable exception to the association of Lycanthropy and the Devil, comes from a rare and lesser known account of an 80-year-old man named Thiess. In 1692, in Jürgensburg, Livonia, Thiess testified under oath that he and other werewolves were the Hounds of God.\nHe claimed they were warriors who went down into hell to do battle with witches and demons. Their efforts ensured that the Devil and his minions did not carry off the grain from local failed crops down to hell. Thiess was steadfast in his assertions, claiming that werewolves in Germany and Russia also did battle with the devil's minions in their own versions of hell, and insisted that when werewolves died, their souls were welcomed into heaven as reward for their service. Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for Idolatry and superstitious belief.\n\nVarious methods have existed for removing the werewolf form. In antiquity, the Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the power of exhaustion in curing people of lycanthropy. The victim would be subjected to long periods of physical activity in the hope of being purged of the malady. This practice stemmed from the fact that many alleged werewolves would be left feeling weak and debilitated after committing depredations.\n\nIn medieval Europe, traditionally, there are three methods one can use to cure a victim of werewolfism; medicinally (usually via the use of wolfsbane), surgically, or by exorcism. However, many of the cures advocated by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal to the patients. A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured if one were to simply address it three times by its Christian name, while one Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it. Conversion to Christianity is also a common method of removing werewolfism in the medieval period; a devotion to St. Hubert has also been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.\n\nBefore the end of the 19th century, the Greeks believed that the corpses of werewolves, if not destroyed, would return to life in the form of wolves or hyenas which prowled battlefields, drinking the blood of dying soldiers. In the same vein, in some rural areas of Germany, Poland and Northern France, it was once believed that people who died in mortal sin came back to life as blood-drinking wolves.\nThese \"undead\" werewolves would return to their human corpse form at daylight. They were dealt with by decapitation with a spade and exorcism by the parish priest. The head would then be thrown into a stream, where the weight of its sins was thought to weigh it down. Sometimes, the same methods used to dispose of ordinary vampires would be used. The vampire was also linked to the werewolf in East European countries, particularly Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. In Serbia, the werewolf and vampire are known collectively as \"vulkodlak\".\n\nIn Hungarian folklore, the werewolves used to live specially in the region of Transdanubia, and it was thought that the ability to change into a wolf was obtained in the infant age, after the suffering of abuse by the parents or by a curse. At the age of seven the boy or the girl leaves the house and goes hunting by night and can change to person or wolf whenever he wants. The curse can also be obtained when in the adulthood the person passed three times through an arch made of a Birch with the help of a wild rose's spine.\n\nThe werewolves were known to exterminate all kind of farm animals, especially sheep. The transformation usually occurred in the Winter solstice, Easter and full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary not only were conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist creating connections between both kinds. Also the vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungary, being both feared in the antiquity.\n\nAmong the South Slavs, and also among the Kashubs of what is now northern Poland, there was the belief that if a child was born with hair, a birthmark or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they wished, it was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.\n\nSerbian \"vukodlak\"s traditionally had the habit of congregating annually in the winter months, when they would strip off their wolf skins and hang them from trees. They would then get a hold of another \"vulkodlak\"s skin and burn it, releasing from its curse the \"vukodlak\" from whom the skin came.\n\nAccording to Armenian lore, there are women who, in consequence of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form. In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.\n\nThe Naskapis believed that the caribou afterlife is guarded by giant wolves which kill careless hunters venturing too near. The Navajo people feared witches in wolf's clothing called \"Mai-cob\".\n\nWoodward thought that these beliefs were due to the Norse colonization of the Americas.\nWhen the European colonization of the Americas occurred, the pioneers brought their own werewolf folklore with them and were later influenced by the lore of their neighbouring colonies and those of the Natives. Belief in the \"loup-garou\" present in Canada, the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan and upstate New York, originates from French folklore influenced by Native American stories on the Wendigo. In Mexico, there is a belief in a creature called the \"nahual\", which traditionally limits itself to stealing cheese and raping women rather than murder. In Haiti, there is a superstition that werewolf spirits known locally as \"Jé-rouge\" (red eyes) can possess the bodies of unwitting persons and nightly transform them into cannibalistic lupine creatures. The Haitian \"jé-rouges\" typically try to trick mothers into giving away their children voluntarily by waking them at night and asking their permission to take their child, to which the disoriented mother may either reply yes or no. The Haitian \"jé-rouges\" differ from traditional European werewolves by their habit of actively trying to spread their lycanthropic condition to others, much like vampires.\n\nMost modern fiction describes werewolves as vulnerable to silver weapons and highly resistant to other injuries. This feature appears in German folklore of the 19th century. The claim that the Beast of Gévaudan, an 18th-century wolf or wolf-like creature, was shot by a silver bullet appears to have been introduced by novelists retelling the story from 1935 onwards and not in earlier versions.\nEnglish Folk-lore, prior to 1865, showed shape shifters to be vulnerable to silver.\n\"...till the publican shot a silver button over their heads when they were instantly transformed into two ill-favoured old ladies...\" c. 1640 the city of Greifswald, Germany was infested by werewolves. \"A clever lad suggested that they gather all their silver buttons, goblets, belt buckles, and so forth, and melt them down into bullets for their muskets and pistols. ... this time they slaughtered the creatures and rid Greifswald of the lycanthropes.\"\n\nThe 1897 novel \"Dracula\" and the short story \"Dracula's Guest\", both written by Bram Stoker, drew on earlier mythologies of werewolves and similar legendary demons and \"was to voice the anxieties of an age\", and the \"fears of late Victorian patriarchy\". In \"Dracula's Guest,\" a band of military horsemen coming to the aid of the protagonist chase off Dracula, depicted as a great wolf stating the only way to kill it is by a \"Sacred Bullet\". This is also mentioned in the main novel Dracula as well. Count Dracula stated in the novel that legends of werewolves originated from his Szekely racial bloodline, who himself is also depicted with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf at will during the night but is unable to do so during the day except at noon.\n\nThe first feature film to use an anthropomorphic werewolf was \"Werewolf of London\" in 1935. The main werewolf of this film is a dapper London scientist who retains some of his style and most of his human features after his transformation, as lead actor Henry Hull was unwilling to spend long hours being made up by makeup artist Jack Pierce. Universal Studios drew on a Balkan tale of a plant associated with lycanthropy as there was no literary work to draw upon, unlike the case with vampires. There is no reference to silver nor other aspects of werewolf lore such as cannibalism.\n\nA more tragic character is Lawrence Talbot, played by Lon Chaney, Jr. in 1941's \"The Wolf Man\". With Pierce's makeup more elaborate this time, the movie catapulted the werewolf into public consciousness. Sympathetic portrayals are few but notable, such as the comedic but tortured protagonist David Naughton in \"An American Werewolf in London\", and a less anguished and more confident and charismatic Jack Nicholson in the 1994 film \"Wolf\". Over time, the depiction of werewolves has gone from fully malevolent to even heroic creatures, such as in the \"Underworld\" and \"Twilight\" series, as well as \"Blood Lad\", \"Dance in the Vampire Bund\", \"Rosario + Vampire\", and various other movies, anime, manga, and comic books.\n\nOther werewolves are decidedly more willful and malevolent, such as those in the novel \"The Howling\" and its subsequent sequels and film adaptations. The form a werewolf assumes was generally anthropomorphic in early films such as \"The Wolf Man\" and \"Werewolf of London\", but larger and powerful wolf in many later films.\n\nWerewolves are often depicted as immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to silver objects, such as a silver-tipped cane, bullet or blade; this attribute was first adopted cinematically in \"The Wolf Man\". This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf's skin will cause burns. Current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or being transmitted like an infectious disease by the bite of another werewolf. In some fiction, the power of the werewolf extends to human form, such as invulnerability to conventional injury due to their healing factor, super-human speed and strength and falling on their feet from high falls. Also aggressiveness and animalistic urges may be intensified and harder to control (hunger, sexual arousal). Usually in these cases the abilities are diminished in human form. In other fiction it can be cured by medicine men or antidotes.\n\nAlong with the vulnerability to the silver bullet, the full moon being the cause of the transformation only became part of the depiction of werewolves on a widespread basis in the twentieth century. The first movie to feature the transformative effect of the full moon was \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" in 1943.\n\nNazi Germany used \"Werwolf\", as the mythical creature's name is spelled in German, in 1942–43 as the codename for one of Hitler's headquarters. In the war's final days, the Nazi \"Operation Werwolf\" aimed at creating a commando force that would operate behind enemy lines as the Allies advanced through Germany itself.\n\nTwo fictional depictions of \"Operation Werwolf\"—the US television series \"True Blood\" and the 2012 novel \"Wolf Hunter\", by J.L. Benét—mix the two meanings of \"Werwolf\" by depicting the 1945 diehard Nazi commandos as being actual werewolves.\n\n\n\n"}
