{"id": "4180890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4180890", "title": "Archaic Triad", "text": "Archaic Triad\n\nThe Archaic Triad comprised the original three deities worshipped on the Capitoline Hill in Rome: Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. This structure was no longer clearly detectable in later times, and only traces of it have been identified from various literary sources and other testimonies. Many scholars dispute the validity of this identification.\n\nGeorg Wissowa, in his manual of the Roman religion, identified the structure as a triad on the grounds of the existence in Rome of the three \"flamines maiores\", who carry out service to these three gods. He remarked that this triadic structure looks to be predominant in many sacred \"formulae\" which go back to the most ancient period and noted its pivotal role in determining the \"ordo sacerdotum\", the hierarchy of dignity of Roman priests: Rex Sacrorum, Flamen Dialis, Flamen Martialis, Flamen Quirinalis and Pontifex Maximus in order of decreasing dignity and importance. He remarked that since such an order no longer reflected the real influence and relationships of power among priests in the later times, it should have reflected a hierarchy of the earliest phase of Roman religion.\n\nWissowa identified the presence of such a \"triad\" also in the Umbrian ritual of Iguvium where only Iove, Marte and Vofionus are granted the epithet of Grabovius and the fact that in Rome the three \"flamines maiores\" are all involved in a peculiar way in the cult of goddess Fides.\n\nHowever Wissowa did not pursue further the analysis of the meaning and function of the structure (which he called \"Göttersystem\") he had identified.\n\nGeorges Dumézil in various works, particularly in his \"Archaic Roman Religion\" advanced the hypothesis that this triadic structure was a relic of a common Proto-Indo-European religion, based on a trifunctional ideology modelled on the division of that archaic society. The highest deity would thus be a heavenly sovereign endowed with religious, magic and legal powers and prerogatives (connected and related to the king and to priestly sacral lore in human society), followed in order of dignity by the deity representing braveness and military prowess (connected and related to a class of warriors) and lastly a deity representing the common human worldly values of wealth, fertility, and pleasure (connected and related to a class of economic producers). According to the hypothesis, such a tripartite structure must have been common to all Indoeuropean peoples on accounts of its widespread traces in religion and myths from India to Scandinavia, and from Rome to Ireland. However it had disappeared from most societies since prehistoric times, with the notable exception of India.\n\nIn Vedic religion the sovereign function was incarnated by Dyaus Pita and later appeared split into its two aspects of uncanny and awe inspiring almighty power incarnated by Varuna and of source and guardian of justice and compacts incarnated by Mitra. Indra incarnated the military function and the twins Ashvins (or Nasatya) the function of production, wealth, fertility and pleasure. In human society the raja and the class of the brahmin priests represented the first function (and enjoyed the highest dignity), the warrior class of the kshatriya represented the second function and the artisan and merchant class of the vaishya the third.\n\nSimilarly in Rome Jupiter was the supreme ruler of the heavens and god of thunder, represented on earth by the \"rex\", king (later the \"rex sacrorum\") and his substitute, the Flamen Dialis, the legal aspect of sovereignty being incarnated also by Dius Fidius, Mars was the god of military prowess and a war deity, represented by his flamen Martialis; and Quirinus the enigmatic god of the Roman \"populus\" (\"people\") organised in the curiae as a civilian and productive force, represented by the Flamen Quirinalis.\n\nApart than from the analysis of the texts already collected by Wissowa, Dumezil stressed the importance of the tripartite plan of the regia, the cultic centre of Rome and official residence of the rex. As recorded by sources and confirmed by archeological data it was devised to lodge the three major deities Iupiter, Mars, and Ops, the deity of agricultural plenty, in three separate rooms.\n\nThe cult of Fides involved the three \"Flamines Maiores\": they were carried to the \"sacellum\" of the deity together in a covered carriage and officiated with their right hand wrapped up to the fingers in a piece of white cloth. The association with the deity that founded divine order (Fides is associated with Iupiter in his function of guardian of the supreme juridical order) underlines the mutual interconnections among them and of the gods they represented with the supreme heavenly order, whose arcane character was represented symbolically in the hidden character of the forms of the cult.\n\nThe spolia opima were dedicated by the person who had killed the king or chief of the enemy in battle. They were dedicated to Jupiter in case the Roman was a king or his equivalent (consul, dictator or tribunus militum consulari potestate), to Mars in case he was an officer and to Quirinus in case he was common soldier. The sacrificial animals too were in each case the ones of the respective deity, i. e. an ox to Jupiter, \"solitaurilia\" to Mars and a male lamb to Quirinus.\n\nBesides Dumézil analysed the cultural functions of the Flamen Quirinalis to better understand the characters of this deity. One important element was his officiating on the \"feriae\" of the Consualia \"aestiva\" ( of the Summer), which associated Quirinus to the cult of Consus and indirectly of Ops (Ops Consivia). Other feriae on which this flamen officiated were the Robigalia, the Quirinalia that Dumezil identifies with the last day of the Fornacalia, also named \"stultorum feriae\" because on that day the people who had forgot to roast their spelt on the day prescribed by the curio maximus for their own curia were given a last chance to make amends, and the Larentalia held in memory of Larunda. These religious duties show Quirinus was a civil god related to the agricultural cycle and somehow to the worship of Roman ancestry.\n\nIn Dumézil's view the figure of Quirinus became blurred and started to be connected to the military sphere because of the early assimilation to him of the divinised Romulus, the warring founder and first king of Rome. A coincident facilitating factor of this interpretation was the circumstance that Romulus carried with himself the quality of twin and Quirinus had a correspondence in the theology of the divine twins such the Indian Ashvins and the Scandinavians Vani. The resulting interpretation was the mixed civil and military, warring and peaceful personality of the god.\n\nA detailed discussion of the sources is devoted by Dumézil to showing that they do not support the theory of an agrarian Mars. Mars would be invoked both in the Carmen Arvale and in Cato's prayer as the guardian, the armed protector of the fields and the harvest. He is definitely not a deity of agricultural plenty and fertility.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that according to tradition Romulus established the double role and duties, civil and military, of the Roman citizen. In this way the relationship between Mars and Quirinus became a dialectic one, since Romans would regularly pass from the warring condition to the civil one and vice versa. In the yearly cycle this passage is marked by the rites of the Salii, they themselves divided into two groups, one devoted to the cult of Mars (Salii Palatini, created by Numa) and the other of Quirinus (Salii Collini, created by Tullus Hostilius).\n\nThe \"archaic triad\" in Dumézil's view was not strictly speaking a triad, it was rather a structure underlying the earliest religious thought of the Romans, a reflection of the common Indoeuropean heritage.\n\nThis grouping has been interpreted as a symbolic representation of early Roman society, wherein Jupiter, standing in for the ritual and augural authority of the Flamen Dialis (high priest of Jupiter) and the chief priestly colleges, represents the priestly class, Mars, with his warrior and agricultural functions, represents the power of the king and young nobles to bring prosperity and victory through sympathetic magic with rituals like the October Horse and the Lupercalia, and Quirinus, with his source as the deified form of Rome's founder Romulus and his derivation from \"co-viri\" (\"men together\") representing the combined military and economic strength of the Roman people.\n\nAccording to his trifunctional hypothesis, this division symbolizes the overarching societal classes of \"priest\" (Jupiter), \"warrior\" (Mars) and \"farmer\" or \"civilian\" (Quirinus). Though both Mars and Quirinus each had militaristic and agricultural aspects, leading later scholars to frequently equate the two despite their clear distinction in ancient Roman writings, Dumézil argued that Mars represented the Roman gentry in their service as soldiers, while Quirinus represented them in their civilian activities. Although such a distinction is implied in a few Roman passages, such as when Julius Caesar scornfully calls his soldiers \"quirites\" (\"citizens\") rather than \"milites\" (\"soldiers\"), the word \"quirites\" had by this time been dissociated with the god Quirinus, and it is likely that Quirinus initially had an even more militaristic aspect than Mars, but that over time Mars, partially through synthesis with the Greek god Ares, became more warlike, while Quirinus became more domestic in connotation. Resolving these inconsistencies and complications is difficult chiefly because of the ambiguous and obscure nature of Quirinus' cult and worship; while Mars and Jupiter remained the most popular of all Roman gods, Quirinus was a more archaic and opaque deity, diminishing in importance over time.\n"}

{"id": "197394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197394", "title": "Bon", "text": "Bon\n\nBon, also spelled Bön (), is a Tibetan religion. Although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology as Tibetan Buddhism, its followers consider Bon a separate religion. According to traditional Bon beliefs and legends, the religion predates the arrival of Buddhism in Tibet, however in reality it arose in the eleventh century alongside the revival of Buddhism. According to Sam Van Schaik, \"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\". Its scriptures are derived primarily from termas (hidden teachings) and visions by tertöns (discoverers of hidden teachings) such as Loden Nyingpo. \n\nAs Bon only arose in the eleventh century through the work of tertöns, Sam van Schaik states it is improper to refer to the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet as Bon:\n\nThree Bon scriptures—\"mdo <nowiki>'</nowiki>dus\", \"gzer mig\", and \"gzi brjid\"—relate the mythos of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. The Bonpos regard the first two as \"gter ma\" rediscovered around the tenth and eleventh centuries and the last as \"nyan brgyud\" (oral transmission) dictated by Loden Nyingpo, who lived in the fourteenth century. In the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a terma known as \"The Brilliance\" (), which contained the story of Tonpa Shenrab. He was not the first Bonpo tertön, but his terma became one of the definitive scriptures of Bon religion. It states that Shenrab established the Bon religion while searching for a horse stolen by a demon. Tradition also tells that he was born in the land of Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring (considered an axis mundi) which is traditionally identified as Mount Yung-drung Gu-tzeg (“Edifice of Nine Sauwastikas”), possibly Mount Kailash, in western Tibet. Due to the sacredness of Tagzig Olmo Lungting and Mount Kailash, the Bonpo regard both the swastika and the number nine as auspicious and as of great significance.\n\nTonpa Shenrab Miwoche visited Kongpo and found people whose practice involved spiritual appeasement with animal sacrifice. He taught them to substitute offerings with symbolic animal forms made from barley flour. He only taught according to the student's capability with lower shamanic vehicles to prepare; until with prayer, diligence, devotion and application they could incarnate to achieve sutra, tantra and Dzogchen.\n\nBon teachings feature Nine Vehicles, which are pathway-teaching categories with distinct characteristics, views, practices and results. Medicine, astrology, and divination are in the lower vehicles; then sutra and tantra, with Dzogchen great perfection being the highest. Traditionally, the Nine Vehicles are taught in three versions: as Central, Northern and Southern treasures. The Central treasure is closest to Nyingma Nine Yānas teaching and the Northern treasure is lost. Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche elaborated the Southern treasure with shamanism.\n\n“A Cavern of Treasures” () is a Bon terma uncovered by Shenchen Luga () in the early 11th century. Martin identifies the importance of this scripture for studies of the Zhang-Zhung language:\nFor students of Tibetan culture in general, the \"mDzod phug\" is one of the most intriguing of all Bon scriptures, since it is the only lengthy bilingual work in Zhang-zhung and Tibetan. (Some of the shorter but still significant sources for Zhang-zhung are signalled in Orofino 1990.)\n\nThe Dzungar people invaded Tibet in 1717 and deposed a pretender to the position of Dalai Lama who had been promoted by Lhabzang, the titular King of Tibet. This was met with widespread approval. However, they soon began to loot the holy places of Lhasa, which brought a swift response from the Kangxi Emperor in 1718, but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars not far from Lhasa.\n\nMany Nyingmapas and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras, which was said to make the tongue black or brown. This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapas and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras. A habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom into modern times.\n\nIn the 19th century, Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen, a Bon master whose collected writings comprise eighteen volumes significantly rejuvenated the tradition. His disciple Kagya Khyungtrul Jigmey Namkha trained many practitioners to be learned in not only the Bon religion, but in all Tibetan schools.\n\nAccording to the Bonpo, eighteen enlightened entities will manifest in this aeon and Tönpa Shenrab Miwoche, the founder of Bon, is considered the enlightened Buddha of this age (compare yuga and kalpa). The 33rd lineage holder of Menri Monastery, Menri Trizin Lungtog Tenpei Nyima and Lopön Tenzin Namdak are important current lineage holders of Bon.\n\nMore than three hundred Bon monasteries had been established in Tibet prior to Chinese annexation. Of these, Menri Monastery and Shurishing Yungdrung Dungdrakling Monastery were the two principal monastic universities for the study and practice of Bon knowledge and science-arts.\n\nEthnic Tibet is not confined culturally to China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The broader area of ethnic Tibet also includes, to the east and north, parts of the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan and the southern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; to the southwest, the Indian territories of Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti and the Baltistan region of Pakistan; the extreme northwest of Assam; and to the south, Bhutan, Sikkim, and parts of northern Nepal, such as Mustang and Dolpo, the regions in northeastern Nepal inhabited by Sherpa and Tamang peoples, and extreme northern Burma (Myanmar). Even parts of modern Bangladesh were once a part of this \"Greater Tibet.\"\n\nBonpos cultivate household gods in addition to other deities:\n\nAnother set of deities are the White Old Man, a sky god, and his consort. They are known by a few different names, such as the Gyalpo Pehar called “King Pehar” (). Pehar is featured as a protecting deity of Zhangzhung, the center of the Bon religion. Reportedly, Pehar is related to celestial heavens and the sky in general. In early Buddhist times, Pehar transmogrified into a shamanic bird to adapt to the bird motifs of shamanism. Pehar's consort is a female deity known by one of her names as Düza Minkar (, Stein1954 in Hummel 1962).\n\nAccording to a recent Chinese census, an estimated 10 percent of Tibetans follow Bon. When Tibet was annexed into the People's Republic of China, there were approximately 300 Bon monasteries in Tibet and the rest of western China. According to a recent survey, there are 264 active Bon monasteries, convents, and hermitages.\n\nThe present spiritual head of the Bon is Lungtok Tenpa'i Nyima (1929–2017), the thirty-third Abbot of Menri Monastery (destroyed in the Cultural Revolution, but now rebuilt), who now presides over Pal Shen-ten Menri Ling in Dolanji in Himachal Pradesh, India, for the abbacy of which monastery he was selected in 1969.\n\nA number of Bon establishments also exist in Nepal; Triten Norbutse Bonpo Monastery is one on the western outskirts of Kathmandu. Bon's leading monastery is the refounded Menri Monastery in Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh, India.\n\nMany Bon elements are in the Hangui (韩规) religion of the Pumi people.\n\nLobsang Yeshe, recognized as the 5th Panchen Lama by the 5th Dalai Lama, was a member of the Dru family, an important family of the Bon religion. Under Lozang Gyatso, Bon became respected both philosophically and politically. However, the Bonpo remained stigmatized and marginalized until 1977, when they sent representatives to Dharamshala and the 14th Dalai Lama, who advised the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration to accept Bon members.\n\nSince then, Bon has had official recognition of its status as a religious group, with the same rights as the Buddhist schools. This was re-stated in 1987 by the Dalai Lama, who also forbade discrimination against the Bonpos, stating that it was both undemocratic and self-defeating. He even donned Bon ritual paraphernalia, emphasizing \"the religious equality of the Bon faith\".\n\nHowever, Tibetans still differentiate between Bon and Buddhism, referring to members of the Nyingma, Shakya, Kagyu and Gelug schools as \"nangpa\", meaning \"insiders\", but to practitioners of Bon as \"Bonpo\", or even \"chipa\" (\"outsiders\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

The stage musical is based on a story about a half-bat half-boy from the tabloid \"Weekly World News\". Flemming co-wrote \"Bat Boy\" with Keythe Farley and Laurence O'Keefe. The musical grew from a Los Angeles theater to winning the LA Weekly Theater Award for Musical of the Year Award for 1999, plus four Ovation Award nominations and six Drama-Logue Awards.\n\n\"Bat Boy: The Musical\" made its way to a New York production in March 2001, for which the play won the Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical, the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical Off-Broadway, and six Drama Desk nominations. \"The New Yorker\" described \"Bat Boy\" as a \"giggling cult hit\". \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It is astonishing what intelligent wit can accomplish\". The musical ran in New York through December 2001.\n\nFlemming released a faux documentary about the assassination of Bill Gates called \"Nothing So Strange\". Bill Gates said through a spokesman that it was \"very disappointing that a movie maker would do something like this\". \"Nothing So Strange\" debuted at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. \"Variety\" called it, \"a crackling good movie... [that] may be the ideal prototype film for the digital age\". The film won the Claiborne Pell New York Times Award for Original Vision at the 2002 Newport Film Festival.\n\nOn 24 October 2003 the film had a simultaneous debut in theaters and as an Internet download. It was released on DVD in December 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Flemming released his third feature-length film, the documentary \"The God Who Wasn't There\". Through interviews with biblical and folklore scholars, Flemming investigates the evidence for the existence of Jesus, concluding that it is highly improbable that the Christian savior ever actually lived. He then discusses the beliefs of conservative Christian fundamentalists, Christian moderates (who, he states, simply enable the fundamentalists), and returns to confront the principal of the fundamentalist Christian school he attended as a child. Flemming launched three media campaigns to support his documentary: War on Christmas, War on Easter, and Blasphemy Challenge. The Blasphemy Challenge was the most successful of the three publicity stunts, gaining coverage by Newsweek, NBC News, Fox News and many other media outlets, and participation by Penn Jillette.\n\nIn addition to working in film and theater, Flemming is an activist on copyright issues. He has released \"Nothing So Strange\" as an open source project, which means all of the raw footage that makes up the film is released without copyright restrictions for anyone to use. The final cut of the film, however, remains protected by copyright.\n\nFlemming founded the organization Free Cinema, which encourages feature filmmakers to create films under two rules:\n\nFlemming claims that filmmaking can now be \"as inexpensive as writing novels\" and that the copylefting practice is a way for new artists to gain notice and distribution in a marketplace dominated by large corporations. Free Cinema was inspired by the Free Software Movement, which is guided by similar principles of freedom. Flemming is also the owner and operator of Fair Use Press, which distributes e-books critical of public figures such as Bill O'Reilly and Arnold Schwarzenegger for their stance on intellectual property law.\n\nDuring the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, Flemming, who had been invited to sit on the festival's documentary jury, saw a demo of the video game Super Columbine Massacre RPG! and hearing about it having its nomination pulled by the festival's founder, convinced fellow jurors to award it a \"Special Jury Prize\" for Best Documentary (an unofficial award not endorsed by the festival). The festival's founder, Peter Baxter, later told Flemming that legal considerations prevented SCMRPG from receiving the award.\n\n"}

The demolition has focused on mosques, burial sites, homes and historical locations associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad and many of the founding personalities of early Islamic history. In Saudi Arabia, many of the demolitions have officially been part of the continued expansion of the Masjid al-Haram at Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and their auxiliary service facilities in order to accommodate the ever-increasing number of Muslims performing the pilgrimage (\"hajj\").\n\nMuch of the Arabian Peninsula was politically unified by 1932 in the third and current Saudi State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The military campaign led by King Abdulaziz ibn Saud and his Bedouin army of tribesmen conquered the Hejaz and ousted the ruling Hashemite clan. The new Najdi rulers, nomadic Arabs largely tribal and illiterate, found themselves at the reins of a highly sophisticated society. A cohesive political structure based on the Majlis al-Shura (consultative council) system had been in place for centuries. A central administrative body managed an annual budget which allocated expenditure on secondary schools, military and police forces. Similarly, the religious fabric of the Najd and the Hejaz were vastly different. Traditional Hejazi cultural customs and rituals were almost entirely religious in nature. Celebrations honouring Muhammad, his family and companions, reverence of deceased saints, visitation of shrines, tombs and holy sites connected with any of these were among the customs indigenous to Hejazi Islam. As administrative authority of the Hejaz passed into the hands of Najdi Wahabi Muslims from the interior, the Wahabi Ulama viewed local religious practices as unfounded superstition superseding codified religious sanction that was considered a total corruption of religion and the spreading of heresy. What followed was a removal of the physical infrastructure, tombs, mausoleums, mosques and sites associated with the family and companions of Muhammad.\n\nIn 1801 and 1802, the Saudis under Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud attacked and captured the Shia holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in today's Iraq, massacred parts of the Shia Muslim population and destroyed the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali, Muhammad's son-in-law. In 1803 and 1804, the Saudis captured Mecca and Medina and destroyed historical monuments and various holy Muslim sites and shrines, such as the shrine built over the tomb of Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, and even intended to destroy the grave of Muhammad himself as idolatrous, causing outrage throughout the Muslim world. In Mecca, the tombs of direct relations of Muhammad located at Jannatul Mualla cemetery, including that of his first wife Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, were demolished. The initial dismantling of the sites began in 1806 when the Wahhabi army of the First Saudi State occupied Medina and systematically levelled many of the structures at the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery. This is the vast burial site adjacent the Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid al-Nabawi) housing the remains of many of the members of Muhammad’s family, close companions and central figures of early Islam. The Ottoman Turks, practitioners themselves of more tolerant and at times mystical strains of Islam, had erected elaborate mausoleums over the graves of Al-Baqi. These were levelled in their entirety. Mosques across the city were also targeted and an attempt was made to demolish Muhammad's tomb. Widespread vocal criticism of this last action by Muslim communities as far away as India, eventually led to abandoning any attempt on this site. Political claims made against Turkish control of the region initiated the Ottoman–Saudi war (1811–1818) in which the Saudi defeat forced Wahhabi tribesmen to retreat from the Hejaz back into the interior. Turkish forces reasserted control of the region and subsequently began extensive rebuilding of sacred sites between 1848 and 1860, many of them done employing the finest examples of Ottoman design and craftsmanship.\n\nOn 21 April 1925 the mausoleums and domes at Al-Baqi in Medina were once again levelled and so were indicators of the exact location of the resting places of Muhammad’s family members and descendants, as it remains to the present day. Portions of the famed Qasida al-Burda, the 13th century ode written in praise of Muhammad by Imam al-Busiri, inscribed over Muhammad's tomb were painted over. Among specific sites targeted at this time were the graves of the Martyrs of the Battle of Uhud, including the grave of the renowned Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, uncle of Muhammad and one of his most beloved supporters, the Mosque of Fatimah Al Zahraa’, daughter of Mohammad, the Mosque of the Two Lighthouses (Manaratayn) as well as the Qubbat Al-Thanaya, the cupola built as the burial place of Mohammad’s incisor tooth, which was broken from a blow received during the Battle of Uhud. In Medina, the Mashrubat Umm Ibrahim, the home of Mohammad’s Coptic Egyptian wife Mariah and birthplace of their son Ibrahim, as well as the adjacent burial site of Hamida al-Barbariyya, mother of Musa al-Kadhim, were destroyed during this time. The site was paved over and is today part of the massive marble esplanade beside the Mosque. The government-appointed permanent scholarly committee of Saudi Arabia has ordered the demolition of such structures in a series of Islamic rulings noting excessive veneration leading to shirk.\n\nThe twenty-first century has seen an increase in the demolition of sites in Mecca and Medina by Saudi authorities, alongside expansion of luxury development.\n\nAs the annual \"hajj\" continues to draw larger crowds year after year, the Saudi authorities deemed it necessary to raze large tracts of formerly residential neighborhoods around the two important mosques to make way for pilgrimage-related infrastructure. In 2010, it was forecast that developers were going to spend an estimated $13 billion on the largest expansion project in the city’s history. \n\nWhile there is widespread agreement for the need of facilities that can accommodate greater numbers of pilgrims, the development of upscale hotels and condominium towers, restaurants, shopping centres and spas has caused some to criticize the over-commercialization of a site which many consider to be a divinely ordained sanctuary for Muslims. \n\nThe rapid influx of capitalist investment in Mecca and Medina leads many to believe that money and economic growth are the ultimate reason for Saudi authorities. Critics argue that this monetary focus works with Wahhabi state policy that imposes a massive cultural and social deletion within the Holy Cities, erasing any elements that encourage practices counter to the Wahhabi creed. \n\nAccording to \"The Independent\", the House of Mawalid where Muhammad is said to have been born is about to be replaced by a huge royal palace, as a part of a multibillion-pound construction project in Mecca which has resulted in the destruction of hundreds of historic monuments.\n\nThe Saudis are turning Diriyah, the domain of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, into a major tourist attraction, with Diriyah becoming an important place of touristic visitation within Saudi Arabia's modern borders.\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of destroyed sites:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

F. Sloan in mid-1964. Several artists have recorded it, but the best-known recording was by Barry McGuire. This recording was made between July 12 and July 15, 1965, and released by Dunhill Records. The accompanying musicians were top-tier Los Angeles session players: P. F. Sloan on guitar, Hal Blaine (of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew) on drums, and Larry Knechtel on bass guitar. The vocal track was thrown on as a rough mix and was not intended to be the final version, but a copy of the recording \"leaked\" out to a disc jockey, who began playing it. The song was an instant hit and as a result the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded.\n\nMcGuire's single hit #1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #3 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1965.\n\nThe song had initially been presented to The Byrds as a Dylanesque potential single, but they rejected it. The Turtles, another L.A. group who often recorded The Byrds' discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead. Their version was issued as a track on their 1965 debut album \"It Ain't Me Babe\", shortly before McGuire's version was cut; it was eventually released as a single and hit #100 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1970. The song was also recorded by Jan and Dean on their album \"Folk 'n Roll\" in 1965, using the same backing track as the McGuire version, and by The Grass Roots on their first album \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" in 1966.\n\nMcGuire recalled in later years that \"Eve of Destruction\" had been recorded in one take on a Thursday morning, reading lyrics scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper. The following Monday morning he got a phone call from the record company at 7:00 am, telling him to turn on the radio—his song was playing.\n\nAfter becoming a born-again Christian, McGuire re-recorded \"Eve of Destruction\" as the lead track on his second contemporary Christian release: \"Lighten Up\". He updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line about the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches replaced by the words \"Columbine, Colorado\", referring to the student massacre of 1999. On March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show \"Spicks and Specks\", performing an updated version of \"Eve of Destruction\", with new lines such as \"You're old enough to kill/you just started voting\" and \"...can live for ten years in space\". The reference to \"Red China\" was also removed, and in its place were the more generic \"Now think of all the hate, still living inside us/it's never too late, to let love guide us\".\n\nIn the first week of its release, the single was at #103 on the \"Billboard\" charts. By August 12 Dunhill released the LP, \"Eve of Destruction\". It reached its peak of #37 on the Billboard album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to #1 on the chart, and repeated the feat on the \"Cashbox\" chart, where it had debuted at #30. McGuire would never again break into the top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It went to #1 in Norway for two weeks.\n\nThe American media helped popularize the song by using it as an example of everything that was wrong with the youth of that time. The song also drew flak from conservatives. A group called The Spokesmen released a partial parody and answer record entitled \"The Dawn of Correction\". A few months later, Green Beret medic SSgt. Barry Sadler released the patriotic \"Ballad of the Green Berets\". Johnny Sea's spoken word recording, \"Day For Decision\", was also a response to the song.\n\nDue to its controversial lyrics, some American radio stations, \"claiming it was an aid to the enemy in Vietnam\", and Radio Scotland banned the song. It was placed on a \"restricted list\" by the BBC, and could not be played on \"general entertainment programmes\".\n\nIn the late 1970s Los Angeles punk band The Dickies recorded a cover of \"Eve of Destruction\". The Undead (Fronted by Ex-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele) recorded a cover of \"Eve of Destruction\" in 1986 and was released on their album \"Act Your Rage\" in 1989. New wave group Red Rockers covered the song in their 1984 album \"Schizoprenic Circus\". Johnny Thunders recorded it on his 1984 album \"Hurt Me\" and also frequently covered the song in concert (a live version is included on his 2000 CD, \"Belfast Nights\"), while veteran Canadian punk outfit D.O.A. also covered the song on their 2004 album \"Live Free Or Die\". Tiny Tim included a 23-minute cover of the song as the final track of his 1993 album \"Rock\". The song has also been covered by Australian band Screaming Jets on their 1997 album \"World Gone Crazy\". Christian rock pioneer Larry Norman released his cover version on a maxi-single CD in 2004. Left-wing Christian punk band Crashdog also covered it on their album \"Cashists, Fascists, and Other Fungus\". Post-Industrial psychedelic rock outfit Psychic TV released \"Eve Of Destruction\" as a limited edition single in the late 1980s. In 2003, the reggae singer Luciano recorded a version of the song. The band Bishop Allen also released a song titled \"Eve of Destruction\" on their 2003 album, \"Charm School\", which takes its chorus from this song. The Cookeville, Tennessee, rock band MerseySide released a rocked up version in 2012 with the lyric \"Think of all the hate there is in Al Qaeda\", with the Mayan Calendar as the cover. Irish singer-songwriter Eleanor McEvoy also covered the song on her 2011 album \"Alone\", and often performs the song live with the lyrics altered to acknowledge more contemporary issues.\n\nThe Temptations' song \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\" mentions the song title. The song was briefly featured on Stephen King's 1994 miniseries \"The Stand\". With a burning Des Moines, Iowa, as a backdrop, Larry Underwood sits atop the hood of a car, belting out the song to amuse himself until interrupted by another survivor of the superflu. It also appeared in \"The Simpsons\" episode GABF16, \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\", and was featured in Michael Winterbottom's 1997 film \"Welcome to Sarajevo\". A Joey Scarbury cover was played repeatedly in the original airing of \"The Greatest American Hero\" episode \"Operation Spoil Sport\" to encourage the hero to prevent an automated nuclear strike being triggered by a renegade U.S. general (the aliens who provided the hero's super-powers commandeered his car radio and tuned it to stations playing the song). Due to copyright issues, the song does not appear in the DVD version of the episode. A French translation is used in the closing credits of Michael Moore's film \"Sicko\". An Italian version, \"Questo vecchio pazzo mondo\" (\"This old crazy world\"), was recorded by Gino Santercole in 1967; a 1984 recording by Adriano Celentano was included in his album \"I miei americani\" (a collection of US hits translated into Italian). This song also makes an appearance in \"The Doors\" (directed by Oliver Stone), as the opening act performs it before The Doors take the stage in Miami.\n\nPublic Enemy covered the song on their 2007 \"How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul\" album.\n\n\"The Greatest American Hero\" opened its second (and only full) season with the episode \"Operation: Spoilsport,\" in which reluctant superhero Ralph Hinkley must prevent an insane, rogue general from launching a nuclear attack on Russia. Hinkley's alien friends contact him secretly, through a radio station, and use the song as a way of getting their point across without being too obvious.\n\nThe song is played during the fourth-season finale of \"The A-Team\", \"The Sound of Thunder,\" when the team returns to Vietnam and flashbacks recall their tours of duty. The song is featured in the fourth level of the Vietnam War video game \"Men of Valor\". While the song is playing, the main character's lieutenant is dying of his wound on the battlefield.\n\nThe song, like many other popular songs of the day, gave its name to a gun truck used by United States Army Transportation Corps forces during the Vietnam War. The truck is on display at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum and is believed to be the only surviving example of a Vietnam era gun truck.\n\n\"Eve of Destruction\" is featured in the video game \"Mafia III\", released October 7, 2016.\n\n\nESPN sportscaster Chris Berman, famous for inventing nicknames for sports figures, and often bringing song titles into the play on words, dubbed slugger Mark McGwire as \"Mark 'Eve of Destruction' McGwire\".\n\nThe indie rock group Bishop Allen performs a version of \"Eve of Destruction\" borrowing heavily from the original, but with an even more sharply apocalyptic theme. It includes the lyrics \"And if this moment is gone in a flash/And my hand in yours becomes ash in ash\", followed in the next verse by an imagining of rejection from Heaven: \"Then we'll have a dance, yeah a dance, on the head of a pin/Then God will grin, and shoo us away\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8546801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8546801", "title": "Gorgoneion", "text": "Gorgoneion\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion (Greek: Γοργόνειον) was a special apotropaic amulet showing the Gorgon head, used most famously by the Olympian deities Athena and Zeus: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective pendant. It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal aegis to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the Hellenistic age, as shown, for instance, on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo.\n\nAccording to Marija Gimbutas, gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the Mother Goddess cult associated with \"dynamic life energy\" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: \"The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster\".\n\nHomer refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that \"Medusa is a head and nothing more... a mask with a body later appended\". Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.\n\nThe direct frontal stare, \"seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer\", was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (\"But see\" the common depiction of the evil eye on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, eye-cups, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an orgiastic deity akin to Dionysus.\n\nGorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.\n\nGorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an electrum stater discovered during excavations at Parium. Other early eighth-century examples were found at Tiryns. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the Knossos palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that \"the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates\", and in her book, \"Language of the Goddess\", she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in Neolithic art motifs, especially in anthropomorphic vases and terracotta masks inlaid with gold.\n\nIn the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical \"lion mask type\" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest occurrence being in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on antefixes of smaller structures throughout the next century.\n\nApart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in numismatic ubiquity only to several principal Olympian gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On Attic kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.\n\nThe Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus, and was revived in the West by the Italian Renaissance artists.\n\nMore recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company.\n\n\n"}

Many hookah lounges incorporate such elements as Islamic decor and Arabic music or Indian music. In Europe this is no longer a fact and hookah lounges are simply a bar without the eastern cultural elements.\n\nHookah lounges are mostly found in college towns and urban areas and are regarded by some as a novel and chic way to socialize and embrace multiculturalism. Certain lounges offer modern hookahs with fruit bowls or other kinds of improvements over smoking hookah at home. Some people of Middle Eastern or South Asian extraction consider them a continuation of their own cultural traditions. Hookah lounges nowadays often distance themselves from the eastern cultures offering hookah and alcohol without the cultural elements. These bars differ from other bars only in the fact that they offer hookah. \n\nTypically a disposable mouthpiece is provided for each user for hygiene reasons. Hookah lounges do not typically have liquor licenses but instead derive the bulk of their revenue from sales of coffee, tea, soft drinks and snack foods. Almost all offer Turkish coffee. \n\nSome hookah lounges have well-equipped kitchens and are more akin to bistros. In the broadest sense, any restaurant or nightclub can be considered a hookah lounge if it offers patrons hookahs, shisha and a comfortable place to smoke. Some offer Middle Eastern cuisine menu items.\n\nDue to several state anti-tobacco laws, many hookah bars have made the transition from smoking traditional shisha to smoking herbal shisha because it contains no tobacco, or nicotine and is legal indoors in areas specific to the prohibition of tobacco smoking. Herbs do produce tar when they burn.\n\nThe hookah in its first and simplest form originated in India. It soon traveled west to Iran, Turkey, and Egypt, where it gained mass popularity The hookah lounge has clear antecedents in the tradition of coffee houses in the Middle East and Turkey, where people smoke tobacco from hookahs or other styles of water pipe provided by the establishment. In this traditional setting the hookah is typically of the single-hose variety. This is in contrast with the multi-hose variety favored in the hookah lounge and intended to emphasize the communal nature of the activity.\n\n\nIn the United States, establishments akin to hookah lounges first opened decades ago in the immigrant quarters of New York City and Los Angeles, California as coffee and tea houses. The Hookah was not the central focus of the businesses until the Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas featured it as the primary offering. Patrons were typically men of Middle Eastern descent The first establishment to call itself the Hookah Lounge, is in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Hookah Lounge created the entire experience of the Hookah, specialty cocktails and Middle Eastern food. The decor is Moroccan. They registered the name in 2000 and began using the URL Hookahlounge.com. They have two locations in Las Vegas. It was the first full service bar that focused its business around serving hookahs. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas was opened in 2000 by owner Paymon Raouf and operator Jeff Ecker. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas originally defended the use of the name Hookah Lounge but it became too commonly used and too costly to defend. They now use the term America's Original Hookah Lounge in advertisements to better identify them as the first to operate in a major lounge setting. \n\nMany hookah lounges in the United States have modernistic elements such as glass tables, plasma televisions, and oxygen bars. Most bars in the U.S. require patrons to be at least 18 years of age to smoke shisha and 18 years of age to purchase (exceptions are Utah, Arizona, Alabama, and New Jersey: 19 years of age to smoke; New York is 21 years of age). \n\nOne purveyor of hookahs and shisha claims:\n\nOver the recent years hookah in general has become increasingly popular for the young-adults; those who are just at the legal age to smoke in their state. It is not uncommon now to find hookah bars within short distance of college campuses and in the surrounding towns. This younger generation has revitalized the hookah market, hookah bars are successful and remaining open despite indoor smoking bans For private hookah smokers, many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets now offer hookah products for sale.\n\nHookah use has increased dramatically among American and European youth in recent years because of the social atmosphere it creates, and because many young adults know it as an alternative to cigarette smoking.\n\nMany municipalities, especially in North America and Europe have enacted smoking bans in public places. Sometimes, however, businesses can obtain special permits allowing smoking within; these permits are typically available only for hookah lounges, cigar bars, tobacconists, and similar establishments where smoking is the focus of activity. They are less frequently available for places in which alcohol or food is served.\n\nIn some cases, the ban is against tobacco smoking specifically. When this is the case, a hookah lounge may remain in business by replacing traditional, tobacco-based shisha with a tobacco-free Mu‘assel.\n\nIn order to remain open, many hookah lounges cannot sell food or beverages. Approximately 90% of the cities that have put a ban on smoking in public places have exemptions for hookah lounges. The cities with these kinds of exemptions, typically, have more dense populations.\n\nBecause hookah lounges are exempt from the smoking bans, and because the hookah trend is increasing at a high rate among youth, many believe it is becoming a public health concern. Many hookah users do not understand the health risks that come along with it. Common beliefs include shisha is not addictive, and the smoke contains less carcinogens.\nHookah smoke contains the same chemicals found in cigarettes, it is not safer because it is smoked as often, it is addictive, and even if the tobacco is filtered with water, the carcinogens are not filtered out.\n\n"}

The \"Jaap Sahib\" is reminiscent of \"Japji Sahib\" composed by Guru Nanak, and both praise God.\n\nFollowing are some accepted meanings of Jaap:\n\n\"Jaap\" is a Sanskrit word meaning \"to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter (especially prayers or incantations); to invoke or call upon in a low voice\".\n\"Jaap Sahib\" is a rhythmic hymn composed like a necklace of pearls and gems, beauteously arranged around a string: the string is the Supreme God; the pearls and gems are His attributes, excellences, and glories. It basically helps reader do a daily Greetings to Waheguru in 199 verses, just like we do hello to each other. The glories sung by Guru Sahib revolve around the following attributes of God:\n\n\nThe Jaap Sahib is a recitation and praise of God. It includes various names of God in various languages. Understand the fact that god has no name but is called by various names by devotees based on their experience and the blessings they have obtained from him. There is only one sole religion of humans - humanity, and the worldly path that we choose to understand the natural power, our source, source of creation - is called faith only.\n\nAll faiths are rivers and are destined to merge into one great \"Ocean - the lord, the light\"; whatever you may call, think, believe or perceive.\n\n\"Jaap Sahib\" is made up of 199 verses and is the first Bani of the Dasam Granth (p. 1-10).\n\nThe Jaap Sahib begins with the words:\n\nThis line is clearly intended to authenticate Guru Gobind Singh Ji as the Author of the Dasam Granth.\n\n\"Jaap\" is a Sanskrit word which means \"to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter (especially prayers or incantations); to invoke or call upon in a low voice.\" The form of the word here is \"Japu\", which makes it a noun, meaning \"meditation on nothing but the Truth; ('God') (or The True God).\n\nThe language of Jaap, is close to classical with words and compounds drawn from Sanskrit, Brij Bhasha, Arabic and Urdu. The contents of Jaap Sahib, are divided into various \"Chhands\" bearing the name of the related meter according to the then prevalent system of prosody in India.\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib starts with \"Japji Sahib\", while Dasam Granth starts with Jaap Sahib also called Japu Sahib. Guru Nanak is credited with the former, while Guru Gobind Singh is credited with the latter. The Jaap Sahib, unlike Japji Sahib, is composed predominantly in Braj-Hindi, Sanskrit language and Arabic words, and with 199 stanzas is longer than Japji Sahib. The Jaap Sahib is, like Japji Sahib, a praise of God as the unchanging, loving, unborn, ultimate power.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1881 he became ill and allegedly fell into a trance where he was transported to heaven where he met an angel who instructed him to start a new religion. While in trance he was told how to bring Native American peoples to salvation. This experience was similar to that described by other 19th-century Native American prophets, including Wovoka, Tavibo and Smohalla. In 1886, he began preaching a message he designated \"Tschadam\".\n\nAbout a year later, Slocum once again became ill. While his wife, Mary Thompson Slocum, cared for him, she started shaking uncontrollably in his presence. When he recovered, he interpreted her shaking as a spiritual manifestation which saved him from death. Slocum incorporated shaking or twitching into the religion as a way to brush off sin, sickness, or bad feelings. This practice led non-natives to call the Church the \"Indian Shaker Religion.\" Slocum and some of his followers were imprisoned regularly for their opposition to government-mandated acculturation programs for Pacific Coast peoples.\n\nThe Indian Shaker Religion is still practiced and combines many traditional native beliefs and customs with Christian beliefs about God and the realities of heaven and hell.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1384400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1384400", "title": "Letters from the Earth", "text": "Letters from the Earth\n\nLetters from the Earth is a posthumously published work of celebrated American author Mark Twain (1835–1910) collated by Bernard DeVoto. It comprises essays written during a difficult time in Twain's life (1904–09), when he was deeply in debt and had recently lost his wife and one of his daughters. The content concerns morality and religion and strikes a sarcastic — Twain's own term throughout the book — tone. Initially, another of his daughters, Clara Clemens, objected to its publication in March 1939, probably because of its controversial and iconoclastic views on religion, claiming it presented a \"distorted\" view of her father. Henry Nash Smith helped change her position in 1960. Clara explained her change of heart in 1962 saying that \"Mark Twain belonged to the world\" and that public opinion had become more tolerant. She was also influenced to release the papers by her annoyance with Soviet reports that her father's ideas were being suppressed in the United States. The papers were selected, edited and sequenced for the book in 1939 by Bernard DeVoto.\n\n\"Letters from the Earth\" consists of a series of commentaries in essay and short story form. Many of these pieces express Twain's discomfort with and disdain for Christianity, both as a theological position and a lifestyle. The title story consists of eleven letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels Gabriel and Michael, about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. Other pieces in the book include a morality tale told as a bedtime discussion with Twain's children, Susy and Clara, about a family of cats, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man.\n\n\"Letters from the Earth\" was written after the deaths of Twain's daughter Suzy (1896) and of his wife Olivia (1904). Textual references make clear that sections, at least, of \"Letters from the Earth\" were written shortly before his death in April 1910. (For instance, Letter VII, in discussing the ravages of hookworm, refers to the $1,000,000 gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr. to help eradicate the disease – a gift that was announced on October 28, 1909, less than six months before Twain's death.) However, the following excerpt appears in a discussion of the Palestinian town of Nablous, in \"The Innocents Abroad\". This passage was written more than four decades before his death, in 1867 or 1868, and appears to be an oblique reference to the idea that later became \"Letters from the Earth.\" \nLouis J. Budd, editor of \"Mark Twain: Collected Tales, Sketches, Speeches, and Essays: Volume 2: 1891-1910\" (1992), a volume in the Library of America series, places \"Letters from the Earth\" sequentially in 1909.\n\nA stage adaptation of \"Letters from the Earth\" by Dan Savage was produced in Seattle in 2003.\n\nLetter VIII on \"the law of God\" expressed by each gender's physical construction:\n\n\n"}

Single structure shrines are the most common. Shrine buildings might also include oratories (in front of main sanctuary), purification halls, offering halls called \"heiden\" (between \"honden\" and \"haiden\"), dance halls, stone or metal lanterns, fences or walls, \"torii\" and other structures. The term \"National Treasure\" has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897.\nThe definition and the criteria have changed since the inception of the term. The shrine structures in this list were designated national treasures when the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties was implemented on June 9, 1951. As such they are eligible for government grants for repairs, maintenance and the installation of fire-prevention facilities and other disaster prevention systems. Owners are required to announce any changes to the National Treasures such as damage or loss and need to obtain a permit for transfer of ownership or intended repairs. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their \"especially high historical or artistic value\". This list presents 40 entries of national treasure shrine structures from 12th-century Classical Heian period to the early modern 19th-century Edo period. The number of structures listed is actually more than 40, because in some cases groups of related structures are combined to form a single entry. The structures include main halls (\"honden\"), oratories (\"haiden\"), gates, offering halls (\"heiden\"), purification halls (\"haraedono\") and other structures associated with shrines.\n\nThe practice of marking sacred areas began in Japan as early as the Yayoi period (from about 500 BC to 300 AD) originating from primal religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting \"kami\", and subsequently were worshiped as \"yorishiro\". Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or \"torii\". Later, temporary structures similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: \"taisha-zukuri\", \"shinmei-zukuri\" and \"sumiyoshi-zukuri\". They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha, respectively, and date from before 552 AD. According to the tradition of \", the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.\n\nBeginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism was brought to Japan from Baekje, new styles of shrine architecture were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples as a place of assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (\"haiden\") in addition to the main hall (\"honden\"). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.\nAt the end of the 8th century as architectural styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in \"kasuga-zukuri\" (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or \"nagare-zukuri\" (Shimogamo Shrine), \"hachiman-zukuri\" (Usa Shrine) and \"hiyoshi-zukuri\" (Hiyoshi Taisha). The \"nagare-zukuri\" continues to be the more popular style, followed by the \"kasuga-zukuri\". The \"honden\" of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period. At the end of the Heian period \"torii\" and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential \"shinden-zukuri\" style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as Itsukushima Shrine.\n\nThe auxiliary Marōdo Shrine at Itsukushima Shrine originates from the 13th-century Kamakura period, and the \"honden\" and \"haiden\" of the Kibitsu Shrine date from the 15th-century Muromachi period. In the late 16th century and early 17th century, during the Momoyama period, \"gongen-zukuri\" was introduced as a new plan of building shrines. The main hall was joined to the oratory via a connecting structure called the \"ai-no-ma\", derived from the \"hachiman-zukuri\" style. Examples of \"gongen-zukuri\" are the \"honden\" at Kitano Tenman-gū and Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine. Tōshō-gū dates from the Edo period and was completed in 1636. It is a complex assembly of richly adorned shrines, temples and a mausoleum. Such complexes are a result of the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism which began to appear during the Heian period; Kitano Tenman-gū, built in 947 for the spirit of Sugawara no Michizane, was the first of these \"byō\" or \"jingū-ji\".\n\nThe 40 entries in the list consist of the following: main halls (\"honden\"), combined structures of \"honden\", \"haiden\" with or without an \"ai-no-ma\" or \"heiden\" in between, oratories (\"haiden\"), offering halls (\"heiden\"), corridors, gates, fences, purification halls and other halls that are related to a shrine.\n\nThe table's columns (except for \"Remarks\" and \"Images\") are sortable pressing the arrow symbols. \n\n\n"}

Created to resource moderate to more liberally-minded Christians, Living the Questions (LtQ) offers an alternative to the Alpha Course. the LtQ curriculum is in use in nearly 5000 churches across North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nLiving the Questions does not offer a \"systematic theology\", but is more of a thematic overview born of day-to-day conversation and questions raised in local parishes. Utilizing both written material (downloadable from the web) and DVD-based input from \"some of the most outspoken and respected voices in today's theological circles\", LtQ curricula seek to expose lay people to the complex theological questions and perspectives that are taught in seminaries but that often don't \"trickle down\" into the local churches. The programs do not aim to spell out new doctrine or to develop new dogma, but to resource people who are in the midst of a lifelong conversation about the mysteries of faith and life. In her book, \"Christianity for the Rest of Us\", Diana Butler Bass notes that both the Living the Questions program and its methodology were part of the success and vitality of one of her subject churches, Trinity Episcopal Church in Santa Barbara, California. In \"Big Christianity: What's Right with the Religious Left\", author Jan G. Linn wrote: \"Living the Questions is a welcomed ... alternative to literalism that has promise in helping Christians find the biblical grounding for Bigger Christianity.\" He affirms that \"faith questions are consistent with a desire to grow into spiritual maturity\" with a quote from the mission of the Living the Questions series:\nReviewers have called Living the Questions both \"enlightening and inspiring\" and \"fascinating\" in that the series raises questions many have \"thought about but have been afraid to ask, and topics they know are important but don't hear mentioned in church\". The US liberal flagship mainline church magazine \"The Christian Century\" criticizes the original 12-session version of Living the Questions for taking a fundamentalist-like position, \"close to a mirror image\" of \"fundamentalists\". The principle course has since been expanded to nearly twice the original length, doubling the number of contributing participants and broadening the mix of contributors to include more women, more racial minorities, and more representation from the LGBT community.\n\nLiving the Questions is co-created by the Arizonan United Methodist ministers Jeff Procter-Murphy and David Felten. They have been recognized by Bishop John Shelby Spong as \"two of the most gifted young clergy I have ever met\" and being among the younger generation of clergy and theological future thinkers saying,\n\nBased on the Living the Questions curriculum and written by the series creators, David Felten and Jeff Procter-Murphy, the book \"Living the Questions: The Wisdom of Progressive Christianity\" was released by HarperOne (an imprint of HarperCollins) in August 2012.\n\nAll of the following contributors appear in \"Living the Questions 2.0\"; some appear in other curricula in the Living the Questions catalog:\n\nThe 2010 release of LtQ2's \"Home Edition\" adds the insights of Brian McLaren, Robin Meyers, and Diana Butler Bass.\n\nDeveloped originally for use at Asbury United Methodist and Via de Cristo United Methodist in Arizona, what started out as just one DVD series is now a growing catalog of curriculum.\n\n\nMany of the titles are now available in Home Editions licensed for personal use.\n\n"}

His resignation came after his arrest for lewdness. He was later acquitted of the lewdness charge on March 7, 2007.\n\nLonnie Latham was elected director of missions for the Tulsa Metro Baptist Association during their November 13–14, 2000 meeting. The meeting also saw the controversial adoption of the Baptist Faith and Message, a pivotal document in the Southern Baptist Convention's \"Conservative Resurgence.\" According to one report, Latham has spoken out against expansion of tribal gaming in Oklahoma, as well as against homosexuality. In the latter vein, he supported the SBC's adoption of a policy encouraging Baptists to befriend gays and lesbians and to help them \"reject their sinful, destructive lifestyle.\"\n\nThe September 16, 2001 edition of \"Tulsa World\" describes Latham as executive director of the Tulsa Metro Baptist Association.\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2004, one week before the 2004 General Election, Latham addressed the subject of State Question 712, a referendum on the expansion of tribal gaming and installation of gambling machines at three local racetracks. Speaking to attendees of the Tulsa Press Club’s “Two Views” luncheon, Latham said:\n\n“The petition would be to allow the state’s people to vote on whether or not they want this kind of casino gambling in the state,” he said. “... We’re hoping that we can gather not only 51,000 names but also many more who will see this as the moral issue that it is.”\n\nLatham also said the social costs of gaming outweigh its benefits, and he opposed efforts to establish a state lottery.\n\nState voters eventually approved both expanded Indian gaming and a lottery.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 3, 2006, Latham was arrested and booked into the Oklahoma County Jail by members of the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. The misdemeanor charge was that of \"Offering to Engage In An Act of Lewdness,\" a charge carrying penalties of up to a year in jail and a US$2,500 fine. Reports sourced to a police department spokesman said that he had propositioned a plainclothes police officer for oral sex in an area of the community which had been the subject of public complaints of cruising related to male prostitution.\n\nLatham was arrested around 9:45 p.m. and his automobile was impounded. The arrest took place in the parking lot of The Habana Inn. Reportedly, Latham followed a plainclothes police officer's car for several blocks, ultimately pulling up beside it. Latham told the officer that he enjoyed \"a particular lewd act\" and then solicited the police officer to perform the act at a room Latham said he had booked at the nearby Holiday Inn Express. Latham did not offer money in exchange, so he was not charged with soliciting prostitution.\n\nUpon posting bail, Latham contested the charge to local television reporters, saying \"I was set up. I was in the area pastoring to police.\"\n\n\"I was involved in a prayer ministry in that area, and I had a dialogue with police,\" he said, according to the website of the Daily Oklahoman newspaper. \"The officer made many suggestions.\"\n\nAccording to police officials, Latham made no mention of prayer, told the officer his name was \"Luke,\" and said he was from Dallas and worked frequently in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\n\nThis was not Latham's first visit to the area. Public records show that on December 2, 1998, at about 11:30 p.m., Latham was issued a traffic ticket for \"failure to stop for a stop sign\" at NW 39th and Frankford. This intersection is only blocks from where Latham was arrested and serves as rear access to the Habanna Inn.\"\n\nSouth Tulsa Baptist Church issued the following statement:\n\n\"We are deeply grieved to hear the news about our pastor, Lonnie Latham. Our first concerns are with Lonnie, his family, and our church family. We will be focused on doing what we can to minister to everyone in this difficult time. Our church has a great history and a great future of ministry in this community. We would appreciate your prayers.\"\n\nOn January 8, 2006 Rev. Lonnie Latham notified The Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma that he was resigning from the BGCO Board of Directors effective immediately.\n\n“We are deeply saddened by the recent events regarding Lonnie. We continue to be concerned for South Tulsa Baptist Church and the Latham family. We pray Lonnie will find healing and restoration as he seeks help for the issues he faces,” said Heidi B. Wilburn, spokeswoman for the BGCO. \"Lonnie’s resignation has been accepted without the BGCO Board of Directors having to take initiative regarding the matter. Lonnie also indicated he has resigned from the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.\"\nAnthony Jordan, BGCO executive director-treasurer, spoke with Baptist Press after having talked with Latham.\n\n\"We have a dual responsibility,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"From the standpoint of the church and, certainly, as brothers in Christ, we are to hold Lonnie to the biblical standard of morality and to hold him accountable for his actions.\" He added, \"Lonnie has responded to that admonition by resigning from his church, asking their forgiveness and stepping aside to seek healing.\n\n\"At the same time, in the midst of failure, the church is to be a place of restoration,\" he said. \"That is the biblical admonition.\"\n\nOn January 9, 2006 a letter from Latham to his congregation was released. Morris Chapman, CEO of the Southern Baptist Convention, says of Latham - \"In spite of his denials soon after his arrest, he now acknowledges the incident did happen and that he needs help.\"\n\nDr. Charles A. Cruce, Director of Missions for The Tulsa Metro Association of Baptist Churches posted the following message:\n\nJamie McDaniel, a spokesperson for Soulforce who works to change the antigay policies of the SBC, said: \"It’s tragic that so many, like Rev. Latham, have never been told the truth that they can live with dignity and express their God-given sexuality in ways that are open, honest, loving and life-affirming. Trapped by Southern Baptist misinformation, many people of faith think their only option is to live a dark and secretive double-life. The SBC needs to be held accountable for causing this kind of needless suffering.\"\n\nWrites Leslie Robinson of the gay newspaper, \"The Dallas Voice\", \"Whew, good thing I’m not required to take such a high-minded approach. I appreciate that Latham has likely been suffering a long time, and that his family is in pain. But the man has been a colonel in the campaign against us, so I prefer to point, yell 'Hypocrite!' and resign myself to the fact that I won’t be on Soulforce’s Christmas-card list.\"\n\nIn a January 6 press release, The National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce commented: \"This isn't the first time he's been in the area, having received a traffic violation there a few years back.\n\n\"Rev. Latham has been an outspoken opponent of...rights for\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. And, of course,\nin recent years the Southern Baptist Convention - the nation's\nlargest Protestant denomination - has become increasingly\nhomophobic and aligned itself with the worst elements of the far\nright in working to stop Marriage Equality for gay people...\n\n\"These kinds of situations involving anti-gay political and religious leaders being caught, literally, with their pants down are hardly uncommon. My instinctual reaction has always been one\nof smug satisfaction - \"serves the damn hypocrite right.\"\n\n\"...I only feel sadness for Rev. Latham and his family.\"\n\nRev. Dr. Mel White, founder of Soulforce, an organization which works on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people to oppose religious and political oppression, commented about Rev. Latham's arrest: \"No one should have to come out via an undercover sting operation. That is its own evil.

He had a strong religious interest from an early age, probably under the influence of his devout father. He chose the profession of fisherman. After a failed marriage he met Mien Wiertz and began to believe under her influence that he must save the world from the devil.\n\nVoorthuijzen sold his boat and took up employment as an eel vendor at the Dappermarkt in Amsterdam, where he became known as \"Lou de Palingboer\" (\"Lou the eel vendor\"). From his market stall, he preached to his customers that he was \"the resurrected body of Jesus Christ\". He would elaborate further in a nearby café. A circle of followers formed around him. In 1954, he began holding weekly meetings in the \"Frascati\" and \"De Brakke Grond\" theatres, where he captivated his audience with a mix of mystical language and down-to-earth humour.\n\nIn 1957, a rich supporter bought a large house in Muiderberg in the municipality Muiden. They called it the \"White House\", and lived in it communally. His followers believed him to be a God. According to Harry Mulisch's \"Voer voor psychologen\" (\"Fodder for Psychologists\"), he claimed to be the author of the Bible. Some members of his group rejected medicine in favour of his blessing as a cure for ailments. Lou himself claimed to be immortal.\n\nAround this time, Dutch society began to see them as a cult. Tensions frequently arose when one partner of a couple was not \"in Lou\" and the other one was. This resulted in a number of divorces in which Lou was summoned to testify, which he disliked. Lou moved to Agimont in the French-speaking part of Belgium to avoid summons of this kind.\n\nAfter his death in Belgium in 1968, the movement seems to have dissipated. Wiertz, who moved to Spain, continues to have faith in him and there are a few other elderly believers left.\n\n"}
{"id": "56076526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56076526", "title": "Lur (deity)", "text": "Lur (deity)\n\nLur (Lurs, Luridus, Lurmitla) is an Etruscan deity with not much known history. Lurs does not have many depictions but the ones that have been found show the deity as a male. He has been noted to be associated with a prophetic nature, while also bearing oracular and martial characteristics. He has been linked to another deity by the name of Laran, which suggest is where Lur derives his name from. The context of the name has been associated with darkness and the underworld. A fifth century vase found near a sanctuary in Sans Giovenale reads an inscription that translates: \"I am Lurs, that of Laran.\" Another inscription has been found with the spelling of his name as \"lartla\", noting relations to a Lar, which gives a label to Lur that describes features of protection.\n\nThere is not much information about Lur except from the various evidence found in differing areas. In Corchiano, a candelabrum dating around 400-350 BCE was found with an inscription in dedication to Lur. A bucchero chalice founded by a small shrine near a bridge in San Giovenale does not specifically have inscribed but \"laruniθla\", again, relating Lur to other gods with similar name epithets. A bronze sheet from Perugia reads a translation \"dedicated to Lvrmita\", suggesting the gods' oracular characteristic. In addition, a bronze statuette possibly from Orvieto features a man, perhaps Vel Matunas, given the inscription on the cloak. The statuette has another votive inscription that translates to \"precious/sacred gift to Lur\", also contributing to his oracular nature.\nLur has also been mentioned on two lead tablets, one from Magliano and another from Santa Marinella. The latter shows a connection to Tinia and reinforces this relation with other findings in Bolsena inscribed with \"lurs\" near two Tinia altars. However, the most prominent evidence discovered concerning Lur is a bronze mirror from Vulci. The mirror is an extension of Lurs relationship with Tinia. In the \"Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae\", H.L Stoltenberg describes the scene present with three figures, Tinia, Lur, and an unknown young man. Tinia is in the middle, identifiable by the lightning bolt. He is wearing a chiton and looking to his right with his right arm raised. The unknown young man sits, appearing to be listening to whatever Tinia might be saying. To the left of the mirror, and Tinias right, sits Lur. He is naked except for a cloak, which is only noticeable from the seal around his neck. His head is thrown back, hair frizzled, and mouth partially open. He carries a sword in his right hand and his left is gesturing towards Tinia. A head coming from the clouds is also seen and has been implied to be delivering a message to Lur. With the combinations of Lurs behavior and gestures, the mirror amplifies a prophetic deity.\n\nThe numerous candelabra founded with Lur inscriptions suggest the object was notable as an offering to the god. An excavation at a sanctuary in Cetamura where a shard with an inscribed Lurs was found, likewise pieces of iron founded fit together to indicate potentially a candelabrum. The bronze Vel Matunas statuette again enforces the cult of Lur. In Gravisca, by the Sacellum Alpha, a miniature shrine, an impasto bowl inscribed with Lur was found. Additionally, a bronze strip from Perugia, as well as a small altar in Vulci both including dedications to \"lurmitla\". The gods name furthermore, is including on the Piacenza liver twice. Scholars have debated with the evidence at hand what exactly the deity Lur oversees. Archaeologist Giovanni Colonna asserts a dark and underworld type of god, while D.F Maras thought of him as more of a warlike and prophetic god. Contrastingly, L. Bouke Van der Meer labels Lur as having the combined qualities.\n"}

Among the Hausas the word \"Mallam\" is additionally used as equivalent of English \"Mr\". A more likely explanation for this word (and for the Swahili \"mwalimu\") is the Arabic word \"mu'allim\" (), which in Moroccan Arabic is pronounced \"m'allam\" and means ‘teacher’ or ‘master’ in a Qur'anic school.\n\nIn the Central Asian and South Asian / Indian subcontinent context, where \"Mullah\" does not carry a formal sense, \"Maulana\" is often the word of choice for addressing or referring to Muslim religious scholars that are respected, while \"Mullah\" is used often derogatorily for people the speaker considers to be more rabble-rousers than scholars.\n\nAlthough the words \"Maulvi\" and \"Maulana\" are interchanged in the Indian Subcontinent as a title of respect, \"Maulana\" is more often associated with formal qualification following study at a madrassa or darul uloom and \"Maulvi\" is usually more a general title for religious figures. In Bangladesh, in the government Aliyah madrassa system, \"Maulvi\" is also associated with formal degrees for those who have passed the course of \"Maulvi\" (basic), \"Maulvi Alim\" (intermediate) or \"Maulvi Fazil\" (advanced).\n\n"}
{"id": "18364149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18364149", "title": "Mesivta", "text": "Mesivta\n\nMesivta (also metivta; Aramaic: מתיבתא, \"academy\") is an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva secondary school for boys. The term is commonly used in the United States to describe a yeshiva that emphasizes Talmudic studies for boys in grades 9 through 11 or 12; alternately, it refers to the religious studies track in a yeshiva high school that offers both religious and secular studies. The comparable term in Israel is Yeshiva Ketana (, lit. \"small yeshiva\"). After graduation from a mesivta, students progress to a beis medrash, or undergraduate-level, yeshiva program.\n\nIn practice, yeshivas that call themselves mesivtas are usually a combination of mesivta (high-school) and beis medrash (post-high-school) programs. Students in the beis medrash program are often called upon to mentor those in the mesivta.\n\nThe term \"metivta\" first appears in the Talmud, where it refers to a yeshiva of Talmudic sages. Abba Arika learned in the metivta in Sepphoris under Judah the Prince, his son, and grandson. Under the leadership of Rav and Shmuel, the Talmudic Academy of Sura during the Babylonian Exile was called a \"sidra\", but under Rav Huna, the second dean of the Academy of Sura, the yeshiva began to be called a \"metivta\" and Huna was the first to hold the title of \"resh metivta\" (corresponding to \"rosh yeshiva\"). According to Graetz, the \"metivta\" convened in certain months of the year. \"Metivta\" frameworks continued to operate throughout the era of the Geonim, a period of approximately 1000 years.\n\nRabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz introduced the concept of a mesivta as a Talmudic studies program for boys aged 14 and older in New York in 1926. Until that time, religious boys attended Talmud Torah (elementary school) until their bar mitzvah and then went on to public high school and college, where their level of Torah observance and commitment were sorely tested. The only post-bar mitzvah religious education available at the time was at Yeshivat Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchonon's Talmudical Academy (founded 1916), which prepared students for a career in the rabbinate. When Mendlowitz, who had begun teaching at the Yeshiva Torah Vodaas elementary school in 1923, suggested the innovation, he was met with widespread resistance. An editorial in the \"Yiddish Morgen Journal\" stated:\nJust as the Reform have a rabbinical Seminary in Cincinnati, and the Conservative have the Solomon Schechter Seminary in New York, so should Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchonon suffice [to produce Orthodox rabbis].\n\nWith the support of three Torah Vodaas board members – Binyomin Wilhelm, Ben Zion Weberman, and Abraham Lewin – Mendlowitz successfully opened Mesivta Torah Vodaas in its own building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in September 1926. The mesivta opened with four classes of post-bar mitzvah students and 11 students in the advanced, beis medrash program. The mesivta went on to graduate generations of students who became Torah scholars and leaders in the American Jewish world.\n\nMendlowitz also influenced the administration at Yeshivas Chaim Berlin to expand beyond eighth grade and open a mesivta as well. Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin opened in the 1930s. Other mesivtas founded in the 1930s and 1940s were Mesivta Tifereth Jerusalem, Kaminetzer Mesivta of Boro Park, and Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. In the 1950s, the latter four mesivtas had their own basketball league.\n\nIn 1937 Mendlowitz founded Camp Mesivta, the first yeshiva summer camp in America, in Ferndale, New York. This became the summer camp of choice for thousands of students from other yeshivas and a prototype for yeshiva learning camps in later decades. Mendlowitz instituted the practice of inviting Gedolim to visit the camp for a few days or a few weeks, giving campers the experience of seeing Torah greats in action. The Gedolim who regularly stayed at Camp Mesivta included Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky, Rabbi Shlomo Heiman, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, and Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz. Camp Mesivta operated until the early 1960s; in 1966, it was succeeded by Camp Ohr Shraga-Beis Medrash LeTorah in Greenfield Park, New York, headed by Rabbi Zelik Epstein and Rabbi Nesanel Quinn.\n\nToday mesivtas are located in cities throughout the United States that have a sizable Orthodox Jewish population. Since the 1980s, the number of mesivtas in the New York/New Jersey area has mushroomed. Whereas before there were at most a handful of schools to choose from, today every city with a religious Jewish population and nearly every township has a yeshiva high school. Because of the proliferation, mesivtas have developed reputations that reflect the academic level of their students. There are schools for \"metzuyanim\" (top learners), schools for average students, and schools for students with \"serious scholastic and/or \"yirat shamayim\" (religious belief) challenges\". Some mesivtas operate different \"tracks\" to satisfy a diverse student body.\n\nMesivtas, like yeshivas, do not follow the public education schedule of terms and vacations, but organize the school year according to the Hebrew calendar. School is in recess during Jewish holidays, and the term ends in the month of Av, the traditional break for yeshivas since the days of the Talmud. There is also a dress code: whereas in elementary school, boys wear casual clothes to school, upon entering mesivta, they are expected to dress in dark suits and white shirts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8625424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8625424", "title": "Nudity in religion", "text": "Nudity in religion\n\nThis article on nudity in religion deals with the differing attitudes to nudity and modesty among world religions.\n\nHesiod the writer of the poem \"Theogony\", which describes the origins and genealogies of the Greek gods in Ancient Greek religion, suggested that farmers should \"Sow naked, and plough naked, and harvest naked, if you wish to bring in all Demeter's fruits in due season.\" Demeter is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all recount the legend of the Garden of Eden, found in the Hebrew Bible, in which Adam and Eve are unaware of their nakedness until they eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. After this, they feel ashamed and try to cover themselves with fig leaves. Judaism does not share the Christian association of nakedness with original sin, an aspect integral to the doctrine of redemption and salvation. In Islam the garden is in Paradise, not on Earth. This is to show that women and men should be covered in clothing, for nudity has the stigma of shame attached to it. Each of these religions has its own unique understanding of what is meant to be taught with the recounting of the story of Adam and Eve.\n\nIn Judaism, nudity is an aspect of body modesty which is regarded as very important in most social and familial situations. Attitudes to modesty vary between the different movements within Judaism as well as between communities within each movement. In more strict (orthodox) communities, modesty is an aspect of Tzniut which generally has detailed rules of what is appropriate behaviour. Conservative and Reform Judaism generally promote modesty values but do not regard the strict Tzniut rules as binding, with each person being permitted (at least in principle) to set their own standards. With the exception of the Haredi community, Jewish communities generally tend to dress according to the standards of the society in which they find themselves.\n\nA person who enters a ritual bath (a \"mikveh\") does so without clothing, and with no jewelry or even bandages.\n\nCare needs to be taken when reading the Bible, where some references to nakedness serve as a euphemism for intimate sexual behaviour. For example, in the story of Noah we see the hesitancy of two of Noah's sons when they have to cover their father's nakedness, averting their eyes, after Noah's youngest son \"saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside\" what he had done to his father. Nakedness may also be a metaphor for empty-handedness, specifically in situations where a sacrifice or offering to God is expected.\n\nThe early Christian Church reflected the contemporary attitudes of Judaism towards nudity. The Old Testament is not positive towards nudity. In the Old Testament, Isaiah in walk nude as a sign of shame against Egypt. \n\nThe first recorded liturgy of baptism, written down by Saint Hippolytus of Rome in his \"Apostolic Tradition\", required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings. , however argues that complete nudity for baptism candidates (especially women) would not be the norm. He notes that at certain times and in certain places candidates may have been totally naked at the point of baptism, but the Jewish taboo of female nakedness would have mitigated widespread practice of naked baptism.\n\nLater Christian attitudes to nudity became more restrictive, and baptisms were segregated by sex and then later were usually performed with clothed participants. Some of the Eastern Orthodox churches today maintain the early church's liturgical use of baptismal nudity, particularly for infants but also for adults.\n\nSeveral saints, such as a number of the Desert Fathers as well as Basil Fool for Christ, practiced nudity as a form of ascetic poverty.\n\nEarly Christian art included depictions of nudity in baptism. When artistic endeavours revived following the Renaissance, the Catholic Church was a major sponsor of art bearing a religious theme, many of which included subjects in various states of dress and including full nudity. Painters sponsored by the Church included Raphael, Caravaggio and Michelangelo, but there were many others. Many of these paintings and statues were and continue to be displayed in churches, some of which were painted as murals, the most famous of which are at the Sistine Chapel painted by Michelangelo.\n\n, in discussing logion 37 of the Gospel of Thomas, notes that early Christian art depicts, as one would expect, Adam and Eve in Paradise naked. The only other Old Testament figures who are depicted nude are Jonah emerging from the mouth of the Great Fish, Daniel emerging from the Lion's Den, and the resurrected in Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones: these Old Testament scenes containing nude figures are precisely those which were held to be types of the resurrection. Among the New Testament illustrations, apart from baptismal scenes, there are nudes only in one representation of the raising of Lazarus and one representation of the Miracle at Cana.\n\nIn 1981, Pope John Paul II expressed the Catholic Church's attitude to the exposure of the human body in \"Love and Responsibility\": \"The human body can remain nude and uncovered and preserve intact its splendour and its beauty... Nakedness as such is not to be equated with physical shamelessness... Immodesty is present only when nakedness plays a negative role with regard to the value of the person... The human body is not in itself shameful... Shamelessness (just like shame and modesty) is a function of the interior of a person.\"\n\nSects have arisen within Christianity from time to time that have viewed nudity in a more positive light. For example, to the Adamites and the Freedomites social nudity was an integral part of their ritual.\n\nToday, Christian naturists maintain that social nudity is a normal part of Christianity and is acceptable. argues that the significance of the human need for clothing by far exceeds its theological meaning.\n\nIn Islam the area of the body not meant to be exposed in public is called the \"awrah\", and while referred to in the Qur'an, is addressed in more detail in hadith. In the Sunni tradition, the male \"awrah\" is from the navel to knees. Other denominations have differing interpretations. For women, there are different classifications of \"awrah\". In public, many Muslim women wear the hijab and long dresses which covers most of their head and body, with only specific body parts such as hands and face exposed. But in front of direct family (parents, children, siblings), the \"awrah\" is relaxed further, allowing them to be uncovered, except between the chest and the thighs. Sharia law in some Islamic countries requires women to observe purdah, covering their entire bodies, including the face (see niqab and burqa), However, the degrees of covering vary according to local custom and/or interpretation of Sharia law.\n\n\n\nIn ancient Indian cultures, there was a tradition of extreme asceticism (obviously minoritarian) that included full nudity. This tradition continued from the gymnosophists (philosophers in antiquity) to certain holy men (who may however cover themselves with ashes) in present-day Hindu devotion and in Jainism.\n\nThe philosophical basis of nudity arises out of the concept of ‘Purushartha’ (four ends of human life). ‘Purushartha’ (Puruṣārtha) are ‘Kama’ (enjoyment), ‘Artha’ (wealth), ‘Dharma’ (virtue) and ‘Moksha’ (liberation). It is ‘Purushartha’ which impels a human being towards nudity or any of its related aspect(s) either for spiritual aim or for the aim of enjoyment. Practice of ‘Dharma’ (virtue) brings good result(s) and non-practice of ‘Dharma’ leads to negative result(s).\nIn the spiritual aspect of Hinduism nudity symbolizes renunciation ('tyaga' in Hindi) of the highest type. A nude person or deity (for example Kali is a nude deity) denotes one who is devoid of Maya or attachment to the body and one who is an embodiment of infinity. \nTrailanga Swami, the famous nude saint of India, had given an explanation for nudity in religion in the following words, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!”\n\nIn comparison in the material aspect nudity is considered an art. This view is supported by Sri Aurobindo in his book \"The Renaissance in India\". He says about Hinduism in the book – “Its spiritual extremism could not prevent it from fathoming through a long era the life of the senses and its enjoyments, and there too it sought the utmost richness of sensuous detail and the depths and intensities of sensual experience. Yet it is notable that this pursuit of the most opposite extremes never resulted in disorder…”\nExtreme hedonists and materialists like the Charvakas are very candid with regard to pursuing of sensual pleasures. They say, “Marthakamaveva purusharthau” (Riches and pleasure is the summum bonum of life). ).There is another sloka in support of their view – “Anganalingananadijanyam sukhameva purusatha” (The sensual pleasure arising from the embrace of a woman and other objects is the highest good or end) ).\nFor non-hedonists pursuing kama (sensual pleasures) accompanied with dharma (virtue) can be the highest ideal or goal in life. There is nothing wrong in it. ).\n\nSome of the famous nude male and female yogi (male and female saints of India) of Hinduism include Lalla Yogishwari (Lalleshwari) , Trailanga Swami, Harihar Baba, Tota Puri. Also in the biography of saint Gorakhnath we have reference to nude male and female yogis who had visited the famous Amarnath Temple during medieval period of India. \n\nAmong the Hindu religious sects, only the sadhus (monks) of the Nāga sect can be seen nude. They usually wear a loin-cloth around their waist, but not always; and usually remain in their Akhara or deep forest or isolation and come out in public only once every four years during Kumbh Mela. They have a very long history and are warrior monks, who usually also carry a \"talwar\" (sword), \"trishul\" (trident), \"bhala\" (javelin) or such weapons, and in medieval times have fought many wars to protect Hindu temples and shrines.\n\nIn the \"Digambara\" sect of Jainism, monks and nuns are \"sky-clad\" and the members of this sect also keep their holy statues naked. However, the \"Shwetambar\" sect is \"white-clad\" and their holy statues wear a loin cloth.\n\nIn many modern neopagan religious movements, such as Wicca, social and ritual nudity is (relatively) commonplace. In Wicca, the term \"skyclad\" refers to ritual nudity instead of social nudity.\n\nIn Raëlism, nudity is not problematic. Raëlists in North America have formed GoTopless.org, which organizes demonstrations in support of topfreedom on the basis of the legal and public attitudes to the gender inequality. GoTopless sponsors an annual \"Go Topless Day\" protest (also known as \"National GoTopless Day\", \"International Go-Topless Day\", etc.) in advocacy for women's right to go topless on gender equality grounds.\n\n\n"}

They are common across the Middle East and can be found anywhere there are communities of Muslims. Ramadan tents provide a place for people to meet with friends and family after the daily fast is broken at sunset. People gather there to eat Iftar, drink tea, and smoke shisha. Ramadan tents are traditionally a family or neighborhood affair in the Middle East. A Jordanian journalist described a typical Ramadan tent thus in 2008:\n\nIn recent years, restaurants and hotels have begun running Ramadan tents to attract customers. Most luxury hotels (4- or 5-star) hotels in Jordan, the UAE, and other countries set up Ramadan tents. These for-profit Ramadan tents typically charge an entrance fee of $10 to $15, though more expensive ones at nice hotels will charge $36 or more. More upscale Ramadan tents also often have music or other entertainment. The highly commercial and materialistic nature of these Ramadan tents has led many in the Middle East to criticize them for cheapening the holiday and in particular for associating \"corporate-sponsored materialism with morality.\" However, some do not share this negative opinion of Ramadan tents; the aforementioned Jordanian journalist writes that:\n\nIn contrast to this materialism, some charitable organizations and individuals host free Ramadan tents that are open to strangers, especially the poor and those who otherwise have nowhere to go for Iftar. These charitable Ramadan tents are rarer than the lavish, commercial kind, although they can be found in countries with Muslim populations around the world. One such organization, the Ramadan Tent Project (RTP), hosts free Iftar dinners in open Ramadan tents that have served more than 50,000 people on four continents. These open Ramadan tents have been in operation since RTP was founded in 2011 by a graduate student at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. The open Iftar dinners of the RTP are open to people of all faiths.\n\nRamadan tents are a relatively recent tradition, and they do not date back to the origins of the holiday. Ramadan tents are believed to have their origin in Egyptian \"\"saradek\",\" tents set up in Cairo for people to offer their condolences. Over time, organizations and merchants began to use these \"saradek\". \"Saradek\" became venues for providing food and shelter to the needy, particularly during the winter months. This marked the beginning of its transition to becoming the Ramadan tent that is well-known today. Soon, the \"saradek\" merged with the preexisting traditions of Arab hospitality and lavish Iftar dinners to create the modern Ramadan tent. However, Ramadan tents only became popular in the Levant following the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990, when they were introduced to Lebanon by a prominent businessman from the Tabbara family.

In circles such as the Hasidic dynasty of Belz, the girls schools are run by the rebbetzin.\n\nThe rabbi's wife plays an important community role, especially in small communities. In many ways, she is called on to be as knowledgeable as the rabbi in the realm of woman's observances: In this manner, for something that does not require a \"psak\" (ruling), she can be approached when a woman does not feel comfortable approaching the rabbi, or where the rabbi maybe should not be approached. For instance, the rebbetzin may be consulted in personal questions regarding female sexuality.\n\nWhen a rabbi is a \"pulpit rabbi\" (versus a teacher or a \"lay rabbi\"), his wife becomes something of a first lady of the community, and performs social tasks and \"outreach\" roles, freeing her husband to attend to rabbinical duties. \n\nWith the growth of independent scholarship among Orthodox women, some women have received the title on their own merit, irrespective of their husbands.\n"}

The people who formed the Reidenbach Mennonites Church were more conservative than the members of the Groffdale Conference. The original name of the new church in 1946 was \"Reidenbach Mennonite Church\".\n\nDuring World War II around the year 1942 there was a conflict among the Groffdale Conference Mennonites about the question if members of the Conference should send their male youth to government-run Civilian Public Service camps or if the young males should rather go to jail. A minority group of 35 church members who opted against Civilian Public Service camps on May 30, 1946 formed the \"Reidenbach Mennonite Church\". The later history is characterized by a long series of splits, the major one being a division in 1977 about the use of bottled gas, which left the 158 members in two groups, one of 90 members, the John J. Martin group, who forbade bottled gas, and one of 68 members, the Amos Martin group, who allowed it. The John J. Martin group later saw several further splits.\n\nThe table below lists all splits of more than one family until the middle of the year 1996:\n\nThe belief of the Reidenbach Mennonites almost does not differ from other Old Order Mennonites. Their Ordnung (set of church rules) does not allow cars, rubber wheels on buggies, tractors for fieldwork, TV, radio, telephones and electricity from public lines. Pennsylvania German is the language used at home and with other Old Orders, children go to parochial schools and dress is a very conservative form of plain dress. Their Ordnung is more conservative than that of mainstream horse and buggy Old Order Mennonites (\"Wenger\" and Ontario) but less conservative than the Ordnung of the \"Pikers\".\n\nThere are basically four family names among the Reidenbachs: Martin, Hoover, Reiff and Nolt, because there was only a small founder group. First cousin marriages are avoided among Old Order Mennonites, if it is possible, but in the first years of the Reidenbachs the small size of the group led to a high percentage of such marriages, as young members could not find partners inside the church who were less close related and marrying outside the church was no option because of the Ordnung (set of rules) of the church. From 1947 to 1965 83.3 percent of all marriages were first cousin marriages. The fast natural growth of the group improved the situation and from 1965 to 1977 only 5.9 percent of all marriages were first cousin marriages. The split in 1977 aggravated the situation again and the old problem arose anew. Therefore, the Reidenbachs are in all likelihood the most inbred group of Anabaptists. There are two genetic diseases among them: Hirschsprung's disease and Maple syrup urine disease.\n\nIn 1994 there were about 300 adult members divided into 10 subgroups. In 2008/9 membership was about 375 in 10 subgroups. In 2015 the membership of all branches was 371\nin 18 congregations and the total population was 740.\n\n\n"}

This group is primarily connected by the Pāli Canon, monasticism and its prevalent monastic rules, and ritual practices. Southern Buddhism tends to be in agreement that the canonical Pali scriptures and commentaries are considered its textual authority, and a strong monastic tradition along with the ideal of renunciation (considered the best way to live one's life) allows its adherents to disregard worldly concerns and devote all of their attention to religious practice. It is usually considered to be synonymous with the Theravada. Theravada means from the elders; teaching come from immediate disciple of Buddha, Ananda and Kassapa. Buddhists in this region place their trust in the Triple Gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha and is of utmost important in order to seek refuge to the Triple Gem for conducting a Buddhist ritual. The sangha includes both nuns and lay supports of the monastic community while referring to the overall body of the spiritually advanced community. However, monks are predominately the symbol of the sangha and the symbol of many individual’s worship. Ranking for the sangha is based off seniority by the time of entry and gender, while many decisions are made ideally by consensus. \n\nSouthern Buddhism Monastic Members\n\nThe monastic members of Southern Buddhism are characterized by celibacy, detachment, and monastic discipline. These monastic members are valued above the lay Buddhist. There are two distinctions of monastic members, those with book duty, where they would be a resident in a monastic institution intending to preserve and teach the traditions that are passed down, whereas those on meditation duty would instead focus on gaining realizations (often through reclusive forest retreats). The monastic community is an important social institution that provides education and social mobility for the bright and ambitious. \n\n\"Northern Buddhism\" sometimes refers to Buddhism as practiced in East Asia and the Tibetan region- particularly China, Tibet, Korea, Mongolia, Japan, and Vietnam. It is often held to by synonymous with Mahayana. However, the term Northern Buddhism is also sometimes used to refer specifically to Tibetan (including Mongolian) Buddhism. In this terminology, the Buddhism of China, Japan etc. is called Eastern Buddhism. The Brill \"Dictionary of Religion\" uses the term Northern Buddhism in a sense exclusive of tantric Buddhism.\n\nIn early Buddhism, doctrinal variations did not necessarily imply separate organizations, so the Mahāyāna movement spread within rather than institutionally separating itself from the early monastic orders. The same is generally true of Tibetan Buddhist monasticism; the monastic code followed is that of the Mūlasarvastivāda, an ancient Indian order. Tibetan Buddhists also share Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna (tantric) practices and perspectives, while they are divided into monastic orders are loosely organized schools based on different lineages of teachers and not, in most cases, on strictly doctrinal differences. Additionally, the main four traditions are Kaguy(bka' brgyud), Sakya(sa skya'), Nyingma(rnying ma), and Geluk(dge lugs), but each of these major schools contains groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous. Certain doctrinal positions or specialisms in specific practices are associated with each school, but just as in the ancient Buddhist orders, there are no rigid sectarian boundaries. The Buddhism of this branch derives from later Indian Buddhism especially of the Pāla dynasty (Bengal, eighth to twelfth centuries CE), incorporating Buddhist monastic scholarship, Mahāyāna, and tantric traditions. It preserves large collections of scriptural and commentarial texts in Tibetan language, including a comprehensive set of translations from Sanskrit sources as well as a vast indigenous literature. The four main traditions are Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma, and Geluk, but each of these major schools contain groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous.\n\nThe use and meaning of these terms reflects only the contemporary situation of the various schools of Buddhism in Asia, and even that only imperfectly. While the Theravada presently dominates in Southeast Asia, prior to the 13th Century the Mahayana was also well established in that region. The survival of certain Mahayana notions in popular Southeast Asian Buddhism (such as the worship of Lokesvara- a form of Avalokitesvara- in Thailand) reflect the early presence of Mahayana ideology in the \"Southern Buddhist\" world. Ongoing contact between Southeast Asia and India brought a variety of doctrines, relics, and texts into Southeast Asia from both the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions, as well as the Theravada and the other early Buddhist schools. Only after the decline of Buddhism in India did Theravada Buddhism begin to dominate in Southeast Asia, with Theravada-dominated Sri Lanka replacing India as the source of new texts and teachers.\n\nIn East Asia and Tibet, the lands traditionally described as \"Northern Buddhist\", share Mahayana and Vajrayana (tantric) practices and perspectives, while they are divided into monastic orders or loosely organized schools based on different lineages of teachers and not, in most cases, on strictly doctrinal differences. The main four traditions are Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma, and Geluk, but each of these major schools contains groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous. The historical evidence for the cohabitation of Mahayana and non-Mahayana monks in some South Asian monasteries during the spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia provides additional evidence that the form of Buddhism practiced in the \"Northern\" territories likely retains many non-Mahayana influences. Furthermore, in certain regions of China and East Asia (notably in Southern China), non-Mahayana forms were sometimes dominant.\n\nVietnam represents an interesting case of a country lying in the liminal region between the Northern and Southern Buddhist schools. As might be expected, Vietnamese Buddhism shows both a strong Mahayana and Theravada influence.\n\n"}
{"id": "35824160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35824160", "title": "Temple of Hibis", "text": "Temple of Hibis\n\nThe Temple of Hibis is the largest and best preserved ancient Egyptian temple in the Kharga Oasis, as well as the only structure in Egypt dating to the 26th dynasty or Saite-Persian period (664-404 BCE) which has come down to modern times in relatively good condition. Located about 2 km north of Kharga, it was devoted to a syncretism of two local forms of the deity Amun: \"Amun of Hibis\" and \"Amun-Ra of Karnak who dwells in Hibis\".\n\nThe temple of Hibis was once surrounded by the city of Hibis (Egyptian: \"Hebet\", meaning \"the plough\"), which nowadays lies under the crops. Construction of the temple started during the 26th Dynasty, most likely under Pharaoh Psamtik II, or possibly even earlier, during the 25th Dynasty. Archaeological evidences suggest that an older temple, dating back to the New Kingdom, was already present in the same place. Several decades after Psamtik II, during the 27th Dynasty, the Achaemenid pharaoh Darius I took a particularly active part in its building, being credited of the decoration of the walls. Later, several other rulers made additions or decorations here, such as Hakor of the 29th Dynasty, notably Nectanebo I and Nectanebo II of the 30th Dynasty, possibly Ptolemy IV (Ptolemaic Dynasty), and at least one Roman emperor.\n\nA first excavation campaign, organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York, took place in 1909–11. A more recent one, led by Eugene Cruz-Uribe, began in 1985.\n\nThe temple bears a close resemblance – both architecturally and regarding inscribed texts – to Theban temples of the New Kingdom and also of the Ptolemaic period, yet it differs from both because of some peculiarities, such as the rather bold style of the decorations.\n\nA long hallway, lined with sphinxes, crosses a series of pylons and arrives to the proper temple. This was originally surrounded by a lake, now long-gone. The hypostyle hall has its walls shaped like huge papyrus rolls, bearing various decorations and several hynms dedicated to the deity Amun, many of which are known since earlier times. Among the decorations, notable is a depiction of Seth defeating Apep, a theme believed by some art historian to be a foreshadowing of Saint George and the Dragon.<br>\nThe walls and the roof are dedicated to the Theban theology and to Osiris respectively, while the \"naos\" is subdivided in nine registers, fully decorated with a \"pantheon\" of Egyptian deity and royal figures, for a total of almost 700 figures. At the beginning of each register, the king is depicted while performing a ritual; the Egyptian \"nomoi\" are also present, each one represented in an Osirian form. In stark contrast with the richness of these representations, the accompanying inscriptions are brief, when not absent at all.\n\nThe relatively good preservation of the Temple of Hibis may be attributed to its seclusion. However, since several decades the building is endangered by a rise of ground water which is damaging its foundations, and the Egyptian Antiquities Service was taking into consideration a complete dismantling and relocation of the whole temple.\n\n"}
{"id": "525358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=525358", "title": "The Five Ks", "text": "The Five Ks\n\nIn Sikhism, the Five Ks ( \"Pañj Kakār\") are five items that Guru Gobind Singh commanded Khalsa Sikhs to wear at all times in 1699. They are: Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb for the hair), Kara (an iron bracelet), Kachera (100% cotton tieable undergarment (not an elastic one)) and Kirpan (an iron dagger large enough to defend oneself).\n\nThe Five Ks are not just symbols, but articles of faith that collectively form the external identity and the Khalsa devotee's commitment to the \"Sikh rehni\" \"Sikh way of life\". A Sikh who has taken Amrit and keeps all five Ks are known as \"Khalsa\" (\"pure\") or \"Amritdhari Sikh\" (\"Amrit Sanskar participant\"), while a Sikh who has not taken Amrit but follows the teachings of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is called a \"Sahajdhari Sikh\".\n\nThe Kesh, or uncut, long hair, is considered by Sikhs as an indispensable part of the human body. Long known as a sign of spiritual devotion, it also emulates the appearance of Guru Gobind Singh and is one of the primary signs by which a Sikh can be clearly and quickly identified. A Sikh never cuts or trims any hair as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The uncut long hair and the beard, in the case of men, form the main kakār for Sikhs.\n\nThe turban is a spiritual crown, which is a constant reminder to the Sikh that they are sitting on the throne of consciousness and is committed to living according to Sikh principles. Guru Gobind Singh told his Sikhs: \n\"Khaalsa mero roop hai khaas. Khaalsa mai ho karo nivaas... The Khalsa is my image. Within the Khalsa I reside.\" Wearing a turban declares sovereignty, dedication, self-respect, courage and piety.\n\nA noted figure in Sikh history is Bhai Taru Singh, who was martyred when he refused to get his Kesh cut.\n\nA Kangha is a small wooden comb that Sikhs use twice a day. It is supposed to be worn only in the hair and at all times. Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the hair, and is a symbol of cleanliness. Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that their lives should be tidy and organized.\n\nThe comb keeps the hair tidy, a symbol of not just accepting what God has given, but also an injunction to maintain it with grace. The Guru Granth Sahib said hair should be allowed to grow naturally; this excludes any shaving for both men and women. In the Guru's time, some holy men let their hair become tangled and dirty. The Guru said that this was not right; that hair should be allowed to grow but it should be kept clean and combed at least twice a day.\n\nThe Sikhs were commanded by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear an iron bracelet called a Kara at all times. The Kara is a constant reminder to always remember that whatever a person does with their hands has to be in keeping with the advice given by the Guru. The Kara is an iron/steel circle to symbolise God as never ending. It is a symbol of permanent bonding to the community, of being a link in the chain of Khalsa Sikhs (the word for link is \"kari\").\n\nThe Kachera is a shalwar-undergarment with a tie-knot worn by baptized Sikhs. Originally, the Kachera was made part of the five Ks as a symbol of a Sikh soldier's willingness to be ready at a moment's notice for battle or for defence. The confirmed Sikh (one who has taken the Amrit) wears a Kachera every day. Some go to the extent of wearing a Kacheraye while bathing, to be ready to at a moment's notice, changing into the new one a single leg at a time, so as to have no moment where they are unprepared. Further, this garment allowed the Sikh soldier to operate in combat freely and without any hindrance or restriction, because it was easy to fabricate, maintain, wash and carry compared to other traditional under-garments of that era, like the dhoti. The Kachera symbolises self-respect, and always reminds the wearer of mental control over lust, one of the Five Evils in Sikh philosophy.\n\nKachera follow a generally practical and roomy design. It features an embedded string that circles the waist which can be tightened or loosened as desired, and then knotted securely. The Kachera can be classed between underwear and an outer garment, as in appearance it does not reveal private anatomy, and looks and wears like shorts. As with all of the Five Ks, there is equality between men and women, and so women are also expected to wear it. Considering the hot climate in India, the Kachera is often worn by men as an outer garment, keeping the wearer cool and being practical in manual work such as farming, but it is generally not considered respectful for women to wear the Kachera as an outer garment (on its own) as it is considered too revealing.\n\nThe Kirpan is a dagger which symbolizes a Sikh's duty to come to the defence of those in peril. All Sikhs should wear kirpan on their body at all times as a defensive side-arm, just as a police officer is expected to wear a side-arm when on duty. Its use is only allowed in the act of self-defense and the protection of others. It stands for bravery and protecting the weak and innocent. \nThe kirpan is kept sharp and is actually used to defend others, such as those who are oppressed by harsh rulers, women who are raped in the streets, or a person who was being robbed or beaten. The true Sikh cannot turn a blind eye to such evils, thinking that they are \"someone else's concern.\" It is the duty of the true Sikh to help those who suffer unjustly, by whatever means available, whether that means alerting the police, summoning help, or literally defending those who cannot defend themselves, even if that means putting oneself in harm's way.\n\n\n"}

He is noted for having played an important role in the diffusion of Western medicine into Iranian society. He is also noted as the only westerner to have met the Báb.\n\nWilliam Cormick was born in Tabriz to the Irish physician John Cormick and a local Armenian woman. Having been sent to England at the age of ten in order to gain an education, he was subsequently enrolled into the medical faculty of the University College of London. He received his qualification as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 17July 1840. A year later he was admitted into membership of the Society of Apothecaries, as well as being awarded a doctors degree in medicine from St. Andrew's in London.\n\nFrom 1844 to 1855 Cormick worked as a physician in London and in Paris. He was summoned to Iran, by the then incumbent king Mohammad Shah Qajar, as the second physician to the British mission and to become the personal physician to the king. In 1846 he was appointed as the second physician to the family of Abbas Mirza. Later he became the personal physician to the crown prince and the future king Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, when the latter was given the governorship of Azerbaijan province, which he held for seven months. Upon the ascension of Naser al-din Shah Qajar to the throne in 1848, Cormick travelled with him to Tehran. However, on the decision of the prime minister (\"vazīr\"), Amir Kabir, he was replaced by the French physician Ernest Cloquet. This was part of Iran's policy of avoiding becoming over-dependent on either Russia or Great Britain. Cormick returned to Tabriz, where he lived for the rest of his life, continuing to practice medicine and becoming rich.\n\nDuring the trial of the Báb in Tabriz in July 1848, William Cormick and two Iranian physicians were given the task of certifying whether the former could be classified as mentally incompetent. The governing authorities were reported to be \"reluctant\" to give the Báb the death sentence. Cormick, at the request of the Báb, visited him several times as part of the medical treatment for his having been \"bastinadoed\" following his trial. This made Cormick the only Westerner recorded as having personally met the Báb. He presented an account of his meetings with the Báb in a letter to an American missionary friend named J. H. Shedd.\n\nHe was awarded the Order of the Lion and the Sun (2nd class).
