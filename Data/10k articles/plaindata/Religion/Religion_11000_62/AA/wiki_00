Aaron was the youngest of five brothers, all rabbinic scholars; the others were Shallum, Baruch, Moses, and Isaac. He studied in Treviso, Italy, and was familiar with the scientific and philosophic literature of his age; he was a good grammarian, and well acquainted with the Arabic language. Like his father, he believed in astrology, and loved to observe the horoscope. He was also an adept in the Cabala, though at times his critical spirit came in conflict with its doctrines. On his travels he visited Turkey, Egypt, Palestine, Damascus, and Kaffa in the Crimea. In Jerusalem he had many disputations with the Karaites, to which his commentary on the Pentateuch refers with evident pride, as having vindicated the cause of rabbinical theology. While in Rome he was admitted to the presence of Pope Martin V, who was surrounded by his cardinals. Martin V was kindly disposed toward the Jews, and often discussed religious questions with them in a friendly manner. On this occasion he propounded to Aaron a number of very pointed questions concerning Biblical and Talmudical passages. Among other things he asked if the use of the cherubim in the Holy of Holies was not rather antagonistic to the Second Commandment, which prohibits idolatry. Aaron in his commentary refers several times to this discussion and to the answers he gave.\n\nComing often in contact with learned Christians, Aaron had many occasions to defend Judaism against the polemics of the Church, on the one hand, and the attacks of the Karaites on the other. It was this unceasing conflict that induced him to write a book, called \"Maṭṭeh Aharon\" (The Staff of Aaron), in defense of the Law and tradition. Keenly observant, and of an independent and critical spirit, he judged persons and opinions freely and openly. He excels as a writer and as a Bible commentator, and often upbraids the Jews of his native land for their ignorance and hollow pretensions, at the same time pointing with admiration to the numerous Jews of high breeding he has met on his travels. Following the principle of a rational Biblical exegesis, he does not hesitate occasionally to refute haggadic traditions which seem to conflict with reason and common sense; and at times, like Abraham ibn Ezra and Samuel ben Meir, he even states his disagreement with halakic interpretation. He was fully conversant with the views of the Karaites and Samaritans and eager, in his explanation of the Bible, to refute now Christian and now Muslim doctrines. He boldly exposes errors wherever he finds them, claiming \"that it is more honorable for the wise to commit an error than knowingly to misrepresent the truth.\"\n\nNor does he shrink from pointing out the blemishes he finds in the character of the Patriarchs. Being guided solely by a love of truth, he, as a matter of course, does not spare such great Bible commentators as Rashi and Nahmanides. For the former Aaron entertained a very high regard; of the latter he frequently says, \"With due deference to his honor, he misunderstood the Talmud\" (see his commentary upon Gen. xxvii. 22; Ex. xxiii. 11, xxv. 9). Like Samuel ben Meir and Maimonides, he explains the law, \"Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk\" (Ex. xxiii. 19), as a warning against a certain idolatrous practise. Notwithstanding his liberal mind and his keen investigating spirit, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries, as may be seen from David Abi Zimra's mention of him as \"Aaron our Rabbi\" in No. 10 of his responsa, where he commends him for his liberty of thought. He was a devoted Jew, who deeply deplored the political and social condition of the Jews of his time, and all the more fervently gave expression to his hope for the speedy advent of the Messiah. For his cabalistic views he quotes Recanate and Joseph Sar Shalom, but not the Zohar.\n\nAaron states that he wrote a Hebrew grammar entitled \"\"Ha-Meyasher\" (\"The Leveler of the Road\"); \"Maṭṭeh Aharon\",\" referred to above, a cabalistic or metaphysical work; \"\"Nezer ha-Ḳodesh\" (\"The Crown of Holiness\"); \"Peraḥ ha-Elohut\" (\"The Blossoming of the Godhead\"), probably of a similar character, and \"Sefer ha-Nefesh\"\" (\"The Book of the Soul\"). All of these works are known only through his own quotations in his supercommentary on Rashi. This work, published from an incomplete manuscript, together with another supercommentary on Rashi by Samuel Almosnino, by Moses Albelda, and by Jacob Canizal, is one of the earliest books printed at Constantinople, and is therefore very rare. According to his own testimony, it was written in 1420 (as Perles has shown); but he intended to compose, or, as Perles thinks, actually did compose, a larger commentary on the Pentateuch. Perles has furnished ample proof that Aaron Aldabi—or, as he called himself, Aaron Alrabi—was a man of great originality and merit, and it is to be hoped that his lost works will be discovered, and that editions of his commentary, based on clear manuscripts existing in Oxford and elsewhere, will fully vindicate his character, though Graetz and Karpeles, in their histories, have attacked him.\n\nJ. H. Schorr, in \"Zion,\" 1840, first called attention to Abu al-Rabi, erroneously calling him Aaron ben Mose Alrabi; but, owing to a misunderstanding of his remarks, he ascribes to him the strange assertion that Moses translated the Pentateuch from the Arabic into Hebrew—a misunderstanding repeated by Grätz, \"Gesch. d. Juden\" (third edition), viii. 250, and by Karpeles, \"Gesch. der Jüdischen Literatur,\" p. 771—whereas the author, in his commentary upon Gen. xviii. 5, referring to the rabbinical Haggadah that the angels who came to Abraham appeared as Arabs, says that they spoke in Arabic, and that Moses rendered their words in Hebrew—a remark which he repeats in his comments upon Gen. xxiv. 23 and Ex. ii. 10. Zunz, \"Z. G.,\" pp. 518–520, and Steinschneider, \"Cat. Bodl.,\" call him Alrabi. Aaron's true name, however, is given in the acrostic written by him at the end of his published commentary.\n\n"}

The current Bishop of Bermuda, seated at the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity in the City of Hamilton, is Nicholas Dill.\n\nAs an extra-provincial diocese, both metropolitan and primatial authority come directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Among its Parish churches is St. Peter's Church, in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of St. George's Town. St. George's is the oldest English town in the New World, and St. Peter's is the oldest Anglican, and the oldest Protestant, church in the New World.\n\nThe first Church of England services in Bermuda were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck, one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the Sea Venture who began Bermuda's permanent settlement. Nine parishes, each with its own church and glebe land, were created when colonisation became official in 1612, but there was rarely more than a pair of ordained Ministers to share between them over the following two centuries. From 1625 to 1839, Bermuda was attached to the See of Nova Scotia. Bermuda then became part of the \"Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda\" from its creation in 1839 until 1919. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the \"Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda\" until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop.\n"}
{"id": "40049745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40049745", "title": "Armenian Native Faith", "text": "Armenian Native Faith\n\nThe Armenian Native Faith, also termed Armenian Neopaganism or Hetanism (Armenian: Հեթանոսութիւն \"Hetanosutiwn\"; a cognate word of \"Heathenism\"), is a modern Pagan new religious movement that harkens back to the historical, pre-Christian belief systems and ethnic religions of the Armenians. The followers of the movement call themselves \"Hetans\" (Armenian: հեթանոս \"Hetanos\", which means \"Heathen\", thus \"ethnic\", both of them being loanwords from the Greek \"ἔθνος\", \"ethnos\") or \"Arordi\", meaning the \"Children of Ari\", also rendered as \"Arordiners\" in some scholarly publications.\n\nThe Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of \"Tseghakron\" (Ցեղակրօն, literally \"national religion\") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist Garegin Nzhdeh. It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a climate of national reawakening, when the armenologist Slak Kakosyan founded the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (\"Arordineri Ukht\").\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; \"Arordineri Ukht\" in Armenian) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936–2005). He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from Soviet Armenia; in 1979 he fled to the United States where he became familiar with the ideas of Garegin Nzhdeh (1886–1955).\n\nNzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and \"fedayi\" of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of Armenia, and is still one of the driving forces of Armenian nationalism. Kakosyan praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\". Nzhdeh founded a movement named \"Tseghakron\" (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the Armenian Youth Federation. In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as Atlas upholding the ordered world, and it makes reference to Hayk, the mythical patriarch of the Armenians, and to Vahagn, the solar and warrior god \"fighter of the serpent\", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide of 1915.\n\nDuring his exile, Slak Kakosyan made extensive use of Nzhdeh's works to codify the \"Ukhtagirk\" (\"Book of Vows\"), the sacred text of the Armenian Native Faith movement. In the book, Garegin Nzhdeh is deified as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the Aryan values. While still in the United States, Kakosyan claimed that he had been initiated to the ancient Armenian hereditary priesthood mentioned by Moses of Chorene, changing his forename from \"Edik\" to \"Slak\". He likely became acquainted with Zoroastrian communities in the United States.\n\nReturning to Armenia in 1991, Slak Kakosyan gathered a community and founded the Children of Ari. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holydays. The Temple of Garni became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites. During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society. According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern Pagan movements, but also Hindu and Protestant movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.\n\nAshot Navasardyan (1950–1997) and Andranik Margaryan (1949–2007), founding fathers of the Republican Party of Armenia, were Arordiners like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni. The Republican Party provided financial support for the Children of Ari until recent times, sponsored the publication of \"Ukhtagirk\" and the set up of a memorial stele to Slak Kakosyan on the grounds of the Temple of Garni. Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities. Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, the Children of Ari does not declare a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations, and among the Armenian diaspora. Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from mysticism to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be infertile, and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty. The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital Yerevan. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.\n\nAnother party that was closely associated to the Arordiners is the Union of Armenian Aryans, led by Armen Avetisyan, headquartered in Abovyan, a city which is the second most important center of the Armenian Native Faith movement after Yerevan. The relations with the party, known for its extreme views, were cut in 2009 when Avetisyan proclaimed himself a spiritual leader and announced the initiative to build a central temple in Yerevan; as the Children of Ari expressed their opposition to the project, Avetisyan founded a separate religious group, the Armenian Aryan Order.\n\nBeliefs among the individual Arordiners vary, though there is a common theological underpinning provided by \"Ukhtagirk\". This theology is a monism: The beginning of the first section of the book recites that \"in the beginning was the Ar, and Ara was the creator\". The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, transcendent principle begetting the universe, while Ara is his personal, present form as \"the Creator\". The book continues telling the myth of how Ara generates the gods and how the goddess Anahit gives birth to Ari (Aryan), the form of mankind. According to Arordiner theology, \"Ar\" is the life-giving word root, and it is the origin of words like, for instance, \"art\" (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), \"aryyun\" (\"blood\"), \"argand\" (\"womb\"), \"armat\" (\"root\"), \"arka\" (\"king\"), \"ara\" (\"male\"), \"Arev\" (the Sun), \"Ara\" (manifested Ar), \"Ari\" (acting with Ar), \"Chari\" (opposing Ar). The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by \"swastika\" motifs.\n\nThe different deities are conceived by the supreme Ara. Some Arordiners do not consider them to be separate beings, but as \"incarnations of different aspects of Ara\". They are organised in a cosmic duality, representing the \"light side\" and the \"dark side\" of the universal power, with the latter led by Vishap, the great snake, whom is identified as being the same as Yahweh. The history of mankind itself is seen as a constant struggle between these two forces: One represented by Ari (Aryans), the right men of the creative light side; the other one represented by Chari, destructive dark-sided creatures made from soil by Vishap.\n\nThe Armenian Native Faith is polytheistic in practice. The gods of the Arordiners include: Hayk, the mythical founder of the Armenian nation, Aray the god of war, Barsamin the god of sky and weather, Aralez the god of the dead, Anahit the goddess of fertility and war, Mihr the solar god, Astghik the goddess of love and beauty, Nuneh the goddess of wisdom, Tir the god of art and inspiration, Tsovinar the goddess of waters, Amanor the god of hospitality, Spandaramet the goddess of death, and Gissaneh the mother goddess of nature.\n\nThe Arordiners have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the reincarnation of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living. According to Arordiner doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.\n\nThe struggle between light and dark forces unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ara, they are not nourished by cosmic energy, and they fall prey of the evil Chari forces. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn manifests again and brings the Ari forces back to life.\n\n\"Ukhtagirk\", the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005. Kakosyan, however, is not credited as the \"author\" of the \"Ukhtagirk\", but rather as the \"recorder\" of an eternal truth understood by inspiration, its \"compiler\" (\"kazmogh\"). The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: ① \"Astvatsashoonch\" (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root \"Ar\"; ② \"Tsagumnaran\" (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; ③ \"Avetaran\" (\"Book of Testaments\") and ④ \"Dzonaran\" (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; ⑤ \"Veharan\" (\"Book of Greatness\") and ⑥ \"Patgamaran\" (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, ⑦ \"Hymnergaran\" (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the \"Ukhtagirk\". At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.\n\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the \"Ukhtagirk\". For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to Mount Khustup, where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn. The priests' aim is to replicate such experience. The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Arordiners. In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including Mount Ararat and Mount Aragats, function as pilgrimage destination for Arordiners.\n\nThe memory of Slak Kakosyan is also part of the cults celebrated by the Arordiner priests. The celebrations in honour of Vahagn at the Temple of Garni usually start at the memorial monument of Kakosyan, set up after his death on the site where his ashes were dispersed. The figure of Kakosyan has been mythologised in a collection of poems composed by Aren Haykyan and published in 2007. In these poems he is described as a divine man. Haykyan is also the author of poems devoted to Nzhdeh and to the gods.\n\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three rites of passage: The \"knunk\", a complex ritual of initiation; the \"psak\", that is wedding; and death rituals. The death rituals require the cremation of the body, and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the Garni Gorge, and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River. Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch. The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself, at a time when cremation was illegal in Armenia. Later, Arordiners obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.\n\nThe Armenian term \"knunk\" may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life). Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each \"knunk\" ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many Arordiners who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.\n\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins. The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common. The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries. They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of apricot trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock. The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood. Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the Metsamor Castle (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the Erebuni Fortress (eighth century BCE), Shengavit (fourth to second millennium BCE) and Zorats Karer (third millennium BCE), and the mountains. Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.\n\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays: Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, Vardavar and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the Armenian Apostolic Church have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:\n\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:\n\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution. Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres. According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The Arordiners find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of \"matagh\", Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the Arordiners believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the \"swastika\".\n\nArordiners generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Arordiners in disguise: The \"catholicoi\" (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954–1994) and Garegin I (1995–1999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the \"swastika\" and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Place both palms under the shoulders. Draw your elbows towards your side body. Keeping the gaze down towards your mat, maintain a neutral neck. As you inhale, push down through the palms and lift the chest, engaging the core and lifting the quads off the ground. Tops of the feet should still press into the ground.

{"id": "1352171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1352171", "title": "Donyi-Polo", "text": "Donyi-Polo\n\nDonyi-Polo (also Donyi-Poloism) is the designation given to the indigenous religions, of animistic and shamanic type, of the Tani and other Tibeto-Burman peoples of Arunachal Pradesh, in north-eastern India. The name \"Donyi-Polo\" means \"Sun-Moon\", and was chosen for the religion in the process of its revitalisation and institutionalisation started in the 1970s in response to inroads made by Christianity and the possibility of absorption into Hinduism.\n\nThe religion has developed a congregational system, hymns to be sung composed in the Tani ritual language of shamans, a formalised philosophy-theology and iconography of the gods and temples. The pioneer of the revival was Talom Rukbo. Donyi-Polo is related to the Hemphu-Mukrang religion of the Karbi and the Nyezi-No of the Hruso.\n\nIn the Donyi-Polo belief, the fountain god that begets the universe (God or the Godhead) is referred to as \"Sedi\" by the Minyong and \"Padam\", \"Jimi\" by the Galo. All things and beings are parts of the body of \"Sedi\": in creation, the hair of \"Sedi\" becomes the plants of the earth, his tears become rain and water, his bones become rocks and stones, and his two eyes become \"Donyi\" (the Sun) and \"Polo\" (the Moon). \"Sedi\", after creation, is a \"deus otiosus\" but continues to observe creation through his eyes, his double aspect veiling-unveiling-revealing himself.\n\nIn Galo beliefs, \"Jimi\" manifests as \"Melo\" (Sky) and \"Sidi\" (Earth), out of the interaction of which all things and beings are born, including \"Donyi\" and \"Polo\". There are other myths explaining the meaning of the duality \"Donyi\" and \"Polo\".\n\nAccording to Talom Rukbo's theology, all celestial bodies including Earth, all things, originate from one source, \"Keyum\" (nothingness or the vacuum). \"Donyi\"-\"Polo\" is the polar force that generates all stars; the physical Sun and Moon (respectively, \"Bomong\" and \"Boo\") near the Earth and humanity, are bodily manifestations of the universal unseen power \"Donyi\"-\"Polo\", with \"Bomong\" carrying out the centralising power of \"Donyi\", and \"Boo\" the \"Polo\" power of life-giving.\n\n\"Donyi\" (Sun) and \"Polo\" (Moon)—which are, respectively, female and male in the Tibeto-Burman tradition; called \"Ane Donyi\" (\"Mother Sun\") and \"Abo Polo\" (\"Father Moon\")—constitute a notion similar to the yin and yang of Chinese culture. It is the analogy through which the Divinity (\"Sedi\") can be described, representing the way in which the divine principle manifests itself, that is: eternally veiling, unveiling and then revealing himself in nature; providing harmony and balance to the universe, for example in the alternation of light and darkness, heat and cool, or unity (analogically, the Sun of the daily sky) and multiplicity (analogically, the stars of the night sky).\n\nThe practical expression of the faith in Donyi-Polo can be found in the daily life and actions of people: they call themselves \"Donyi O, Polo Ome\", meaning \"children of the sun and the moon\". When a believer is distressed he invokes \"\"Donyi\"-\"Polo\". If a man is falsely accused of lying he invokes \"Donyi-e!\"\", \"oh Sun!\". All these are expressions of faith in Donyi-Polo upholding providently the world, rewarding the righteous and punishing wrong-doers. The divine pair is revered as the highest holy figure governing fate.\n\n\"Donyi-Polo\" is also used in the sense of \"truth\" in sacral speech. \"Donyi-Polo\" is an epitome for wisdom, enlightenment, right conscience, truthfulness, and selflessness. Aware people are called \"\"Donyi\"-\"Polo Ome\"\", which means \"children of truth\". Elders are regarded as \"\"Donyi\"-\"Polo Abu\"\", \"representatives of the truth\".\n\nThe followers of Donyi-Poloism worship a variety of gods and goddesses that enliven nature. These gods are believed to partake in the universal balance of \"Donyi\" and \"Polo\", and to be multiple manifestations or identities of \"Sedi\"—\"Donyi\"-\"Polo\", each with specific functions and roles. It is believed that they take care of the earth and humanity. The main deities in Donyi-Polo are \"Donyi\" and \"Polo\", \"Kine Nane\", \"Doying Bote\", \"Pedong Nane\" and \"Guumin Soyin\".\n\nTani-speaking peoples (Apatani, Galo, Nishi, Tagin, Na, Mishing; Adi-Lhoba) share a myth telling of their descendance from the progenitor Abotani. Other Tibeto-Burman peoples of Arunachal Pradesh who share the Donyi-Polo faith don't subscribe to the descendance from Abotani.\n\nAbotani is thought to represent the evolution of the human being from the source \"Donyi\", \"Sedi\", the eye of the universe as important to man as the eye of the body. The Divinity has projected man showing him the right way to go.\n\nDonyi-Poloists describe the \"Donyi-Polo\" nature of the universe as the eyes of human conscience. Happiness is given through right action, and right action is that which follows the order of nature (Donyi-Polo).\n\nOshang Ering, a philosopher of the religion, has written that as the two objects in the sky (\"Bomong\" and \"Boo\") focus light to enable us to see what is what, Donyi-Polo makes us aware of what is wrong and right. Right conscience naturally prevails. When a person does wrong things (acts against the natural order) and tries to hide it, or masks it as good, then the force of conscience (Donyi-Polo) imposes a psychological pression, and the wrong doer loses happiness.\n\nRight conscience naturally guides man. According to the traditional belief, love, compassion, equality and selflessness are naturally ordained by Donyi-Polo; they are inscribed in nature. The ethical dimension of Donyi-Polo also means purity, beauty, simplicity, and frankness.\n\nOn 28 August 1968, a meeting of Adi intellectuals was held in Along, West Siang, to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the gradual erosion of indigenous identity and traditions attributed to India's policy of integration of Arunachal Pradesh, and particularly the rapid, aggressive and coercive proselytizing of Christianity in the area since the 1950s which has caused an enduring crisis in the cultural mosaic of the north-eastern state. The meeting's aim was also that of uniting the Tibeto-Burman folks under a collective identity and values for a good life.\n\nTalom Rukbo emerged as the father of Donyi-Poloism, a term that was coined for the institutionalisation of the Tibeto-Burman folk religion. According to Rukbo, the main reason of the easy erosion of the traditional culture was that it lacked a written literature. So, with the aim of recovering the endangered rituals, prayers and hymns, within 1986 three major cultural organisations were founded: the Tani Jagriti Foundation, the Donyi-Polo Youth Federation and the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang.\n\nRukbo expressed the need for institutionalisation of the traditional faith in these terms:\n\nMany Adi and Tani intellectuals reflected Rukbo's ideas, and these gradually spread across the tribes and even beyond the Tani people. The 31 December, the day of establishment of the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang in 1986, has been made the \"Donyi-Polo Day\" celebrated each year.\n\nSince then, templar areas (\"gangging\") have been consecrated, religious literature and prayer hymns have been collected and published. To meet the growing number of adherents in the revival, the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang established orientation courses—which take place twice a year—and trained groups of youth to send back with books and icons to their home village, to encourage people to construct temples and conduct prayers. During the last two decades the spiritual revival has spread all over Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nSupporters of the revival have coined the slogan «\"Loss of culture is loss of identity\"» which has become very popular. The indirect implication is that those who convert to Christianity lose their culture and hence their identity. \n\nA \"gangging\" is a general name for a prayer place of the Donyi-Poloist faith, and especially in the Adi areas. The \"gangging\" as a sacred enclosure is a concept popularised by the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang since 1996. \n\nAccording to Talom Rukbo, the word \"gangging\" is derived from \"Gangging Siring\", the concept of a land or holy tree that mediates between the spiritual and the natural worlds, and from which any thing, living or non-living, comes into existence.\n\n\"Gangging\" congregants have to follow certain rules: for example, male members must sit on the left in rows, and female members on the right, cross-legged. Within the prayer place, there should not be any noise during prayer except the sound of the hymns. Prayers are organized in the prayer place on Sundays, and all of the \"gangging\" branches established in each of the villages under the Siang district are centrally regulated by the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang. Through the prayer place, codified rituals and practices, and iconographies of the Gods and Goddesses have been introduced.\n\nIn Galo areas, the prayer place and community halls (\"dere\") have come up under the patronage of the Donyi-Polo Welfare Association and they are being built since the 2000s. Priests (\"nyibu\") conduct prayers in the prayer place on Sundays. In Apatani areas, the religion is called \"Danyi-Piilo\" and prayer place are called \"meder nello\" (\"purified place\"), the first of which was built in 2004 Songs and prayers are collected in a prayer book called \"Lyambope\". Donyi-Poloist prayer place in Nishi areas are called \"nyedar namlo\" (\"pure place\"), and also among them the movement has been started only in the early 2000s.\n\nMore recently, the success of Donyi-Polo has crossed the Tani cultural borders inspiring the rise of Rangfraism among the Tangsa, and of Intayaism among the Mishmi, respectively in Changlang and Dibang Valley.\n\n\n\n"}

The small papyrus roll was discovered among the documents of an auxiliary cohort, the \"Cohors XX Palmyrenorum\" (Twentieth Cohort of Palmyrenes), in the Temple of Azzanathkona. The calendar, written in Latin, is arranged in four columns, with some gaps. It offers important evidence for the religious life of the Roman military and the role of Imperial cult in promoting loyalty to the Roman emperor, and for the coexistence of Roman state religion and local religious traditions.\n\nFestivals named include Quinquatria (a purification of arms), the birthday of Rome, Neptunalia and two Rosaliae at which the military standards were adorned with roses. The calendar prescribes sacrifices for deities of traditional Roman religion such as the Capitoline triad of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as well as Mars and Vesta. About twenty members of the imperial family are honored as \"divi\", divinized mortals, including six women and Germanicus, who was never an emperor. Twenty-seven of the forty-three entries that remain legible pertain to Imperial cult. No Eastern mystery religions, which were widely celebrated in the Empire during this period, nor local cults are recorded as an official observance of the army, but the \"feriale\" was found in the temple with a dipinto depicting a Roman officer offering incense to the local deity Iarḥibol, and Romans, including a standard-bearer with the cohort's \"vexillum\", standing before the altar of the Syrian gods Iarḥibol, Aglibol and Arṣu. It has also been argued that the three gods represent the emperors Pupienus, Balbinus, and Gordian III. A copy of the calendar may have been issued to each unit throughout the Empire to further military cohesion as well as Roman identity among troops from other cultures.\n\nThe cache of documents was discovered by a team of archaeologists from Yale University working at Dura-Europos in 1931–32. It was first published by R. O. Fink, A. S. Hooey, and W. S. Snyder (1940), \"The \"Feriale Duranum\",\" \"Yale Classical Studies\" 7: 1–222.\n\nIn 2011, a facsimile of the partial document was part of the Dura-Europos exhibition at Boston College, and it contained the following translation:\n\n\n"}

Some Hindu texts regard Buddha as an avatar of the god Vishnu, who came to Earth to delude beings away from the Vedic religion. He is also regarded as a prophet by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.\n\nGautama Buddha is mentioned as an Avatar of Vishnu in the Puranic texts of Hinduism. In the Bhagavata Purana he is twenty fourth of twenty five avatars, prefiguring a forthcoming final incarnation. A number of Hindu traditions portray Buddha as the most recent of ten principal avatars, known as the Dashavatara (\"Ten Incarnations of God\").\n\nSiddhartha Gautama's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and consequently [at least atheistic] Buddhism is generally viewed as a \"nāstika\" school (heterodox, literally \"It is not so\") from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism.\n\nMany of the eighteen orthodox Puranas mention the Buddha in a less favouring light. They present the birth of the Buddha as a ploy by the Supreme God Vishnu to corrupt demons and sway them from Vedic teachings. Only by leading them astray with his teachings could the demons be destroyed. This belief is sometimes associated with the Asuras of Tripura (the three citadels) as well as others. Literature from the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, on the other hand, maintains that Krishna took the appearance of an atheistic teacher out of benevolence, in order to trick atheists into worshipping God (i.e., himself).\n\nBuddha is mentioned as the 23rd avatar of Vishnu in the Chaubis Avtar, a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nSome early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of Lao Tzu.\n\nIn Japan, since one of the symbols of Dainichi Nyorai (one of the non-historical buddhas of Mahayana Buddhism) was the sun, many equated Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, with a previous reincarnation (bodhisattva) of Dainichi Nyorai.\n\nMirza Tahir Ahmad, the Fourth Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, in his book \"Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth\", argues that Buddha was indeed a prophet of God who preached Monotheism. He quotes from the inscriptions on Ashoka's stupas which mention \"Isa'na\" which means God. He quotes, \"'Thus spake Devanampiya Piyadasi: \"Wherefore from this very hour, I have caused religious discourses to be preached, I have appointed religious observances that mankind, having listened thereto, shall be brought to follow in the right path, and give glory to God* (Is'ana).\" The Ahmadiyya hold the view that the Buddha was indeed a Prophet of God.\n\nMirza Tahir Ahmad has also stated that the Qur'anic figure called Dhul-Kifl may have been the Buddha in his book \"An Elementary Study of Islam.\"\n\nIn fact, a verse in the Qur'an quotes that God has sent many prophets to thee (Humanity). However, only a few have been named. It is believed by some that Buddha may (or may not) have been a Prophet of God sent to his people who taught Monotheism.\n\nThe Greek legend of \"Barlaam and Ioasaph\", sometimes mistakenly attributed to the 7th century John of Damascus but actually written by the Georgian monk Euthymius in the 11th century, was ultimately derived, through a variety of intermediate versions (Arabic and Georgian) from the life story of the Buddha. The king-turned-monk Ioasaph (Georgian \"Iodasaph\", Arabic \"Yūdhasaf\" or \"Būdhasaf\": Arabic \"b\" could become \"y\" by duplication of a dot in handwriting) ultimately derives his name from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva, the name used in Buddhist accounts for Gautama before he became a Buddha. Barlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the Greek Orthodox calendar of saints on 26 August, and in the West they were entered as \"Barlaam and Josaphat\" in the Roman Martyrology on the date of 27 November.\n\nThe story was translated into Hebrew in the 13th century by Abraham Ibn Chisdai (or Hasdai) as \"Ben-Hamelekh Vehanazir\" (\"The Prince and the Nazirite\").\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, Buddha is classified as one of the Manifestations of God which is a title for a major prophet in the Bahá'í Faith. Similarly, the Prophet of the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh, is believed by Bahá'ís to be the Fifth Buddha, among other prophetic stations.\n\n"}

The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as Dukh Nivaran, literally meaning \"eradicator of suffering\". Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the sarovar attached to the shrine.\n\nRaja Amar Singh of Patiala (1748–82) had a garden laid out on the site as a memorial which he entrusted to Nihang Sikhs. Records of a court case in 1870 mention a Guru's garden and a Nihangs' well being in existence here.In 1920, during a survey for the proposed construction of Sirhind-Patiala-Jakhal railway line, it appeared that the banyan tree under which had sat Guru Tegh Bahadur would have to be removed. But men charged with felling it refused to touch it.\n\nUltimately, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh ordered cancellation of the entire project. No gurudwara building had, however, been raised. It was only in 1930 that a committee was formed to collect funds and commence construction and was completed twelve years later in the year 1942. Maharaja Yadavindra Singh who was a devout Sikh built the present building and sarovar. The Gurdwara when completed passed under the administrative control of the Patiala state government. It was later transferred to the Dharam Arth Board of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union and eventually to the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee.\n\nThe building complex sprawls over several acres. The two storey gateway has a collapsible iron gate and black and white marble floor. On the left of the pathway leading to the principal building is a small marble shrine marking the site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat under the banyan tree. The central two storey building, with a domed pavilion on top, is on a raised base having an octagonal domed chamber at each corner. The pinnacled lotus dome on top has a round sun-window on each side with a curved coping, projected horizontally at the ends. There are decorative domed pavilions at the corners and lotus blossoms in leaf in the middle on top of the walls.\n\nThe interior is paved with marble slabs in white and grey against black and white of the outer platform. The walls and pillars are also panelled with white marble slabs. The ceiling is decorated with stucco work in floral design. The Guru Granth Sahib is seated under a square canopy at the far end. The 75metre square sarovar, since considerably extended, is on the right and Guru ka Langar on the left as one enters. The Gurdwara is administered by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. A big gathering is held on the fifth day of the light half of each lunar month. The festival of the year is Basant Panchmi which marks the day of Guru Tegh Bahadur's visit.\n\n"}
{"id": "2135106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2135106", "title": "Hell money", "text": "Hell money\n\nHell money is a form of joss paper printed to resemble legal tender bank notes.The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors’ financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century. Early 20th century examples bore resemblance to minor commercial currency of the type issued by businesses across China until the mid-1940s.\n\nThe identification of this type of joss paper as \"hell bank notes\" or \"hell money\" is largely a Western construct, since these items are simply regarded as yet another form of joss paper (冥幣, 陰司紙, 紙錢, or 金紙) in East Asian cultures and have no special name or status.\n\nThe word \"hell\" on hell bank notes refers to \"Diyu\" (, \"underworld prison\"; also 地府, \"dìfǔ\", \"underworld court\"). These words are printed on some notes. In traditional Chinese belief, it is thought to be where the souls of the dead are first judged by the Lord of the Earthly Court, Yan Wang. After this particular judgement, they are either escorted to heaven or sent into the maze of underworld levels and chambers to atone for their sins. People believe that even in the earthly court, spirits need to use money.\n\nA popular story says that the word \"hell\" was introduced to China by Christian missionaries, who preached that all non-Christian Chinese people would go to hell after death. The word \"Hell\" was thus misinterpreted to be the proper English term for the afterlife and hence adopted as such. Some printed notes attempt to correct this by omitting the word \"hell\" and sometimes replacing it with \"heaven\" or \"paradise\". These particular bills are usually found in joss packs meant to be burned for Chinese deities, and usually have the same design as hell bank notes but with different colours.\n\nEarlier examples of these notes were issued in denominations of 5 and 10 yuan and upwards, with such amounts being considered adequate until inflation took hold within China from 1944. The soaring denominations of authentic currency was soon reflected in that issued for the afterlife, and after 1945 the majority of Hell banknotes were issued in denominations of $10,000 or higher. These earlier issues more commonly depict landscape scenes, temples or trains, and the numerous varieties may literally number into the millions.\n\nModern Hell bank notes are known for their large denominations, ranging from $10,000 to several billions. The obverse usually bears an effigy of the Jade Emperor, the presiding monarch of heaven in Taoism; his signature, romanised as \"Yu Wong\" or \"Yuk Wong\"; and the countersignature of Yanluo, King of Hell (閻羅). There is usually an image of the Bank of Hell on the reverse of the notes.\n\nA commonly sold Hell bank note is the $10,000 note that is styled after the old United States Federal Reserve Note. The obverse contains, apart from the portrait of the Jade Emperor, the seal of the Bank of Hell consisting of a picture of the bank itself. Many tiny, faint \"Hell Bank Note\"s are scattered on the back in yellow. These are sold in packs of 50 to 150, and are wrapped in cellophane.\n\nStores that specialize in selling ritual items, such as the religious goods stores in Malaysia, also sell larger and elaborately decorated notes that have a larger denomination than the usual $10,000 note. Some bills do not portray the Jade Emperor, and portray other famous figures from Chinese mythology instead, such as the Eight Immortals, the Buddha, Yama, or images of dragons. Some even portray famous people who are deceased, such as US President John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nWhen burning the notes, the notes are placed as a loose bundle, in a manner considered respectful. Alternatively, in some customs, each bank note may be folded in a specific way before being tossed into the fire because of the belief that burning real money brings bad luck.\n\nWhile the custom of burning \"hell bank notes\" remains legal in China, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has as of 2006 banned the practice of \"vulgar\" burnt-offerings for the deceased, which include paper \"luxury villas, sedan cars, mistresses, and other messy sacrificial items\", as well as Viagra and simulated models of \"karaoke hostesses\" and \"Supergirls\" based on the hit TV contest \"Mongolian Cow Yoghurt Supergirl\", according to the Ministry, in effort to eradicate \"feudal\" and superstitious behavior.\n\n\n"}

A Sufi is a Muslim who seeks annihilation of the ego in God.\n\nThe exact origin of Sufism is disputed. Some sources state that Sufism is the inner dimensions of the teachings of Muhammad whereas others say that Sufism emerged during the Islamic Golden Age from about the 8th to 10th centuries. However Islamic scholars predating the Islamic Golden Age were referred to as Sufis, like Hasan of Basra. According to Ibn Khaldun Sufism was already practiced by the Sahaba, but with the spread of material tendencies, the term Sufi was just applied to those who emphasize the spiritual practice of Islam. \n\nTowards the end of the first millennium CE, a number of manuals began to be written summarizing the doctrines of Sufism and describing some typical Sufi practices. Two of the most notable are \"Kashf al-Mahjûb\" (Revelation of the Veiled) of Hujwiri, and \"Risâla\" (The Message) of Al-Qushayri. According to the late medieval mystic Jami, Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a \"Sufi\". \n\nTwo of Al Ghazali's greatest treatises, the \"Revival of Religious Sciences\" and the \"Alchemy of Happiness,\" argued that Sufism originated from the Qur'an and was thus compatible with mainstream Islamic thought, and did not in any way contradict Islamic Law—being instead necessary to its complete fulfillment. This became the mainstream position among Islamic scholars for centuries, challenged only recently on the basis of selective use of a limited body of texts . Ongoing efforts by both traditionally trained Muslim scholars and Western academics are making Al-Ghazali's works available in English translation for the first time, allowing English-speaking readers to judge for themselves the compatibility of Islamic Law and Sufi doctrine.\n\nAll Sufi orders claim a direct chain of leadership to Muhammad, through Ali, with the exception of the Naqshbandis who claim a direct connection to Muhammad through Abu Bakr. In the eleventh century, Sufi orders (Tariqa) were instrumental in the institutional spread of Sufism.\n\nBeginning in the 9th century and continuing throughout the 10th century, al-Andalus was home to fairly strict, orthodox beliefs and practices. Quranic studies and jurisprudence (fiqh) were the accepted and promoted types of scholarship that shaped the region’s beliefs and practices. Early fuqaha in Spain were somewhat skeptical of philosophical thought as well as of Sufism. In later centuries, especially the twelfth and thirteenth, Sufism became more accepted and somewhat assimilated into Andalusi Islam. Scholars have generally seen this later flourishing in two different ways. For some, it reflects the influence of the mystical tradition in Cordoba attributed to Ibn Masarra. Others give exclusive credit to the influence of eastern mystics, most often including al-Ghazali's thoughts and teachings.\n\nOne figure in particular has often been credited as being the earliest introduction of Sufism to Spain: Ibn Masarra. He lived from 883 to 931 and was born outside of Cordoba. Many consider him to have established the first Sufi school in the province; however, his teachings were outside of the so-called \"mainstream\" Sufism that was more common in the East during his lifetime. With Ibn Masarra there was a “brief flowering” of Sufism in Spain, and later Spanish Sufis reflected his influence on them. After Ibn Masarra’s death, in 940 his followers fell under heavy persecution under the jurists who destroyed Ibn Masarra's works and also forced his followers to recant. The effects of his thought and that of his disciples would appear again in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries amidst later Sufis such as Ibn Arabi.\n\nBy the twelfth century, shifts towards the acceptance—or at least tolerance—of philosophy and Sufism into what had previously been strictly orthodox beliefs were occurring. Many people began to read and translate the works of philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato. At the forefront of the philosophical movement in Spain were Ibn Bajjah, Ibn Tufail, Ibn Rushd, and a Jewish scholar named Ibn Maimun. Ibn Tufail introduced the element of Sufism into this philosophical way of thinking. Andalusi Sufism was at its peak at this time. Also at this time, eastern Sufism was developing more as a communal movement, whereas that of the West (including in al-Andalus), it remained largely an individual pursuit.\n\nA group of Sufi masters who defended the works of theosophists such as Ghazali and al-Qushayri began emerging in the late eleventh and early- to mid-twelfth centuries. Abu l-‘Abbas ibn al-‘Arif (1088-1141) was one of the most prominent Sufis in Spain and one of the earliest ones during Sufism's peak in the peninsula. He belonged to what Spanish scholar of Islam, Miguel Asin Palacios, termed the \"School of Almeria,\" so named for its geographical location. Ibn al-Arif was one of the first to interpret Ghazali in the West, and he also founded a method of spiritual training called tariqah. Ibn al-‘Arif's disciple Ibn Qasi set up a group of religious followers in Portugal and built a monastery in Silves. He authored the Khal al-Na’lain, which Ibn ‘Arabi would later write a commentary on. Ibn Barrajan (d. 1141), who a student and friend of Ibn al-‘Arif, lived and taught in Seville but was originally from North Africa, has been called the Ghazali of the West. Ibn Barrajan and Ibn al-‘Arif were both tried for heresy because their views conflicted with those of the Almoravids in power; however, Ibn Barrajan appears to have been more active in using Sufism as a means of challenging Quranic scholars and jurists.\n\nIbn Arabi, another key figure of this period of Sufism in the region, was born in Murcia in 1165 at the beginning of the Almohad reign. He is one of the most important Sufis of Spain, although he--like many other Andalusi Sufis--would eventually leave the peninsula and travel throughout North Africa and the East. His works in Andalusia focused mainly on the perfect human individual, monastic metaphysics, and mystical path to spiritual and intellectual perfection. Central themes of Ibn 'Arabi's were the unity of all beings, or “wahdat al-wujud,” and also how God reflects God’s self in the world. According to Ibn ‘Arabi, the main practices of Andalusi Sufis included ascesis, poverty, and devotion to the Qur’an.\n\nNot long after the death of Ibn ‘Arabi, al-Andalus experienced a “spiritual aridity” in the mid-fourteenth century. The one exception to that trend was Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (1332-1390), a member of the Shadhiliyya order who was born in Ronda and whose scholarship brought together mystical and juridical paths. His work helped Sufism become more accepted within the Islamic sciences.\n\nAlthough Sufism would no longer directly be a part of Andalusi life after the Catholic Monarchs expelled Muslims from Spain, in the Spanish Christian mystics of the sixteenth century, such as San Juan de la Cruz and Teresa of Avila, many have seen Sufism’s lasting influence in Spain.\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries CE, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a \"Golden Age\" whose physical artifacts are still present. In many places, a lodge (known variously as a \"zaouia\", \"khanqah\", or \"tekke\") would be endowed through a pious foundation in perpetuity (\"waqf\") to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge. The same system of endowments could also be used to pay for a complex of buildings, such as that surrounding the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, including a lodge for Sufi seekers, a hospice with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures. No important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in this period.\n\nSufism was an important factor in the historical spread of Islam, and in the creation of regional Islamic cultures, especially in Africa and Asia. Recent academic work on these topics has focused on the role of Sufism in creating and propagating the culture of the Ottoman world, including a study of the various branches of the Naqshbandi and Khalwati orders, and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South Asia.\n\nMuslims of South Asia prominently follow the Chishtiyya, Naqshbandiyyah, Qadiriyyah and Suhrawardiyyah orders. Of them the Chishti order is the most visible. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, a disciple of Khwaja Usman Harooni, the propounder of this order, introduced it in India. He came to India from Afghanistan with the army of Shihab-ud-Din Ghuri in 1192 AD and started living permanently in Ajmer from 1195. Centuries later, with the support of Mughal rulers, his shrine became a place of pilgrimage. Akbar used to visit the shrine every year. Some Sufis were not against absorbing ideas from Hinduism for their devotional songs with Sufism playing the primary role as a point of contact between Hinduism and Islam. This conversion left many of those who converted via Sufism more Hindu in practice than Muslim.\n\nTurkic conquests in South Asia were accompanied by four Sufi mystics of the Chishtiyya order from Afghanistan: Moinuddin (d. 1233 in Ajmer), Qutbuddin (d. 1236 in Delhi), Nizamuddin (d.1335 in Delhi) and Fariduddin (d.1265 in Pakpattan now in Pakistan) . During the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq, who spread the Delhi sultanate towards the south, the Chistiyya spread its roots all across India. The Sufi shine at Ajmer in Rajasthan and Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, Ashraf Jahangir Semnani in Kichaucha Shariff belong to this order.\n\nThe Suharawardi order was started by Abu al-Najib Suhrawardi, a Persian Sufi born in Sohrevard near Zanjan in Iran, and brought to India by Baha-ud-din Zakariya of Multan. The Suhrawardiyyah order of Sufism gained popularity in Bengal. In addition, the Suhrawardiyyah order, under the leadership of Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi (d. 1234), also bequeathed a number of teachings and institutions that were influential in shaping other order that emerged during later periods.\n\nThe Khalwati order was founded by Umar al-Khalwati, an Azerbaijani Sufi known for undertaking long solitary retreats in the wilderness of Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran. While the Indian Subcontinent branches of the order did not survive into modern times, the order later spread into the Ottoman Empire and became influential there after it came under persecution by the rise of the Safavid Shahs during the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Qadiriyyah order founded by Abdul Qadir Gilani whose tomb is at Baghdad. It is popular among the Muslims of South India.\n\nBaha-ud-Din Naqshband (1318-1389) of Turkestan founded Naqshbandi order of Sufism. Khwaja Razi-ud-Din Muhammad Baqi Billah whose tomb is in Delhi, introduced the Naqshbandi order in India. The essence of this order was insistence on rigid adherence to Sharia and nurturing love for the Prophet. It was patronized by the Mughal rulers, as its founder was their ancestral Pir (Spiritual guide). \"The conquest of India by Babur in 1526 gave considerable impetus to the Naqshbandiyya order\" . Its disciples remained loyal to the throne because of the common Turkic origin. With the royal patronage of most of the Mughal rulers, the Naqshbandi order caused the revival of Islam in its pure form.\n\nCurrent Sufi orders include Ba 'Alawiyya, Chishti, Khalwati, Naqshbandi, Nimatullahi, Oveyssi, Qadria Noshahia, Qadiria Boutshishia, Qadiriyyah, Qalandariyya, Sarwari Qadiri, Shadhliyya and Suhrawardiyya.\n\nSufism is popular in such African countries as Morocco and Senegal, where it is seen as a mystical expression of Islam. Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism around contemporary spiritual teachers such as Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutshishi. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the mystical.\n\nSufism suffered setbacks in North Africa during the colonial period; the life of the Algerian Sufi master Emir Abd al-Qadir is instructive in this regard. Notable as well are the lives of Amadou Bamba and Hajj Umar Tall in sub-Saharan Africa, and Sheikh Mansur Ushurma and Imam Shamil in the Caucasus region.\n\nIn the 20th century some more modernist Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion that holds back Islamic achievement in the fields of science and technology.\n\nA number of western converts to Islam have also embraced Sufism, sometimes resulting in considerable syncretism or generic spiritualism detached from Islam, as in the case of \"Universal Sufism\" or the writings of René Guénon or G. I. Gurdjieff.\n\nOne of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the Ivan Aguéli.\nOther noteworthy Sufi teachers who were active in the West include Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Inayat Khan, Nazim Al-Haqqani, Javad Nurbakhsh, Bulent Rauf, Irina Tweedie, Idries Shah and Muzaffer Ozak.\n\nCurrently active Sufi academics and publishers include Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, Nuh Ha Mim Keller, Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee, Abdal Hakim Murad, Syed Waheed Ashraf and the Franco-Moroccan Faouzi Skali.\n\nOrientalists proposed a variety of origin theories regarding Sufism, such as that it originated as an Aryan response to Semetic influence, Buddhism, Neo-Platonism, and Christian ascetism or Gnosticism. Modern academics and scholars, however, have rejected early Orientalist theories asserting a non-Islamic origin of Sufism, Carl Ernst states that the tendency to try and disassociate Islam from Sufism was an attempt by Orientalists to create a divide between what they found attractive within Islamic civilization (i.e. Islamic spirituality) and the negative stereotypes of Islam that were present in Britain. Hosein Nasr states that non-Islamic origin theories are false according to the point of view of Sufism. Many have asserted Sufism to be unique within the confines of the Islamic religion, and contend that Sufism developed from people like Bayazid Bastami, who, in his utmost reverence to the sunnah, refused to eat a watermelon because he did not find any proof that Muhammad ever ate it. According to William Chittick Sufism can simply be described as \"the interiorization, and intensification of Islamic faith and practice.\"\n\n\n\nFurther Reading:\n"}

The Sangeet Natak Akademi recognizes eight – Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Sattriya, Manipuri and Mohiniyattam. Scholars such as Drid Williams add Chhau, Yakshagana and Bhagavata Mela to the list. The Culture Ministry of the Government of India includes Chhau in its classical list. These dances are traditionally regional, all of them include music and recitation in local language or Sanskrit, and they represent a unity of core ideas in a diversity of styles, costumes and expression. Indian classical dance is made from India and classical dance is played by various actors.\n\nThe \"Natya Shastra\" is the foundational treatise for classical dances of India, and this text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.\nWhile the \"Natya Shastra\" is the revered ancient text in the Hindu tradition, there are numerous other ancient and medieval Sanskrit dance-drama related texts that further discuss and expand on the classical repertoire of performance arts, such as the \"Abhinaya Darpana\", \"Abhinaba Bharati\", \"Natya Darpana\", \"Bhava Prakasa\" and many others. The term \"classical\" (Sanskrit: \"Shastriya\") denotes the Natya Shastra-based performing arts.\n\nThe text Natya Shastra describes religious arts as a form as \"margi\", or a \"spiritual traditional path\" that liberates the soul, while the folk entertainment is called \"desi\", or a \"regional popular practice\".\n\nIndian classical dances are traditionally performed as an expressive drama-dance form of religious performance art, related to Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, pan-Hindu Epics and the Vedic literature, or a folksy entertainment that includes story-telling from Sanskrit or regional language plays. As a religious art, they are either performed inside the sanctum of a Hindu temple, or near it. Folksy entertainment may also be performed in temple grounds or any fairground, typically in a rural setting by traveling troupes of artists; alternatively, they have been performed inside the halls of royal courts or public squares during festivals.\n\nThe Natya Shastra mentions four \"Pravrittis\" (traditions, genres) of ancient dance-drama in vogue when it was composed – \"Avanti\" (Ujjain, central), \"Dakshinatya\" (south), \"Panchali\" (north, west) and \"Odra-Magadhi\" (Odisha-Bihar-Bengal, east).\n\nSources differ in their list of Indian classical dance forms. Encyclopædia Britannica mentions six dances. The Sangeet Natak Akademi has given recognition to nine Indian dances. The Indian government's Ministry of Culture includes eleven dance forms. Scholars such as Drid Williams and others include Chhau, Yaksagana and Bhagavata Mela to the eight classical Indian dances in the Sangeet Natak Akademi list.\n\nThe classical dance forms recognised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Ministry of Culture are:\n\nAll major classical Indian dance forms include in repertoire, three categories of performance in the \"Natya Shastra\". These are \"Nritta\", \"Nritya\" and \"Natya\":\n\n\nAll classical dances of India used similar symbolism and rules of gestures in \"abhinaya\" (acting). The roots of \"abhinaya\" are found in the \"Natyashastra\" text which defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. A performance art, asserts \"Natyashastra\", connects the artists and the audience through \"abhinaya\" (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music. Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the \"ras\" (sentiment, emotional taste) and \"bhava\" (mood) of the underlying story. In Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance:\n\n\n"}

These lanterns are generally hung in front of homes during the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali. Kandeel in Sanskrit is known as \"akasha deepa\" (lantern of the sky), 'akash diwa' (sky light), and in Kannada, Goodu Deepa (nested light), or Nakshatra Gudu (star-like nest).\nHindus in earlier days set kandeels afloat high, a gesture to invite the spirits of their ancestors moving around to come back home and be with them during the festival time; hence the name \"akasha deepa\" (lantern of the sky) or AkashaKandil.\n\nIn Kerala, especially in Fort Kochi, a city in Ernakulam District, it is known as akasha vilakku. Hindu Vaishyas (Konkani-speaking linguistic minority of Kerala), who had skulked out from Goa during the Portuguese regime, dwelt in Kerala. During the Hindu lunar month of 'Kartika', the people use to put akasha deepam, colloquially known in Konkani dialect \"Panjire\", in place on roof tops of the houses and light them in the evening until dawn breaks in and up to the Karthika Paurnami (full moon) day or Dev Dewali day. Earlier oil lamps were used, which are fixed in the panjire (cage models), now colourful electrical lights are used instead. By lighting the panjiras it is believed that during Kartika those who had died used to visit their houses and wish their relatives wellbeing, or if the lights were not lit in front of the house, the curses them to live them in darkness in life.\nKandeels are hung for around a month from the first day of Diwali. Kandeels are traditionally built in a crystal shape with tails at the bottom; shapes include stars, globes, delicate dotted designs, and simple drawings. Opaque papers cut into a complex design give more beauty to a Kandeel by blocking some of the light behind it. \n"}

His experience in the 1947 Partition of India inspired him to write \"Train to Pakistan\" in 1956 (made into film in 1998), which became his most well-known novel.\n\nBorn in Punjab, Khushwant Singh was educated in New Delhi, and studied law at St. Stephen's College, Delhi, and King's College London. After working as a lawyer in Lahore Court for eight years, he joined the Indian Foreign Service upon the Independence of India from British Empire in 1947. He was appointed journalist in the All India Radio in 1951, and then moved to the Department of Mass Communications of UNESCO at Paris in 1956. These last two careers encouraged him to pursue a literary career. As a writer, he was best known for his trenchant secularism, humour, sarcasm and an abiding love of poetry. His comparisons of social and behaviour characteristics of Westerners and Indians are laced with acid wit. He served as the editor of several literary and news magazines, as well as two newspapers, through the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1980-1986 he served as Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.\n\nKhushwant Singh was bestowed with the Padma Bhushan in 1974. But he returned the award in 1984 in protest against Operation Blue Star in which the Indian Army raided Amritsar. In 2007 he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award in India.\n\nKhushwant Singh was born in Hadali, Khushab District, Punjab (which now lies in Pakistan), in a Sikh family. He was the younger son of Sir Sobha Singh and Veeran Bai. Births and deaths were not recorded in his time, and for him his father simply made up 2 February 1915 for his school enrolment at Modern School, New Delhi. But his grandmother Lakshmi Bai asserted that he was born in August, so he later set the date for himself as 15 August. Sobha Singh was a prominent builder in Lutyens' Delhi. His uncle Sardar Ujjal Singh (1895–1983) was previously Governor of Punjab and Tamil Nadu.\n\nHis birth name, given by his grandmother, was Khushal Singh (meaning \"Prosperous Lion\"). He was called by a pet name \"Shalee\". At school his name earned him ridicule as other boys would mock at him with an expression, \"Shalee Shoolie, Bagh dee Moolee\" (meaning, \"This shalee or shoolee is the radish of some garden.\") He chose Khushwant so that it rhymes with his elder brother's name Bhagwant. (He declared that his new name was \"self-manufactured and meaningless\". But he later discovered that there was a Hindu physician with the same name, and the number subsequently increased.)\n\nHe entered Delhi Modern School in 1920 and studied there till 1930. There he met his future wife, Kawal Malik, one year his junior. He continued higher education at Government College, Lahore, St. Stephen's College in Delhi and King's College London, before reading for the Bar at the Inner Temple.\n\nKhushwant Singh started his professional career as a practising lawyer in 1939. He worked at Lahore Court for eight years. In 1947 he entered Indian Foreign Service for the newly independent India. He started as Information Officer of the Government of India in Toronto, Canada. He was Press Attaché and Public Officer for the Indian High Commission for four years in London and Ottawa. In 1951 he joined the All India Radio as a journalist. Between 1954 and 1956 he worked in Department of Mass Communication of the UNESCO at Paris. From 1956 he turned to editorial services. He founded and edited \"Yojana\", an Indian government journal in 1951 -1953; \"The Illustrated Weekly of India\", a newsweekly; and two major Indian newspapers, \"The National Herald\" and the \"Hindustan Times\". During his tenure, \"The Illustrated Weekly\" became India's pre-eminent newsweekly, with its circulation raising from 65,000 to 400000. After working for nine years in the weekly, on 25 July 1978, a week before he was to retire, the management asked Singh to leave \"with immediate effect\". A new editor was installed the same day. After Singh's departure, the weekly suffered a huge drop in readership. In 2016 Khushwant Singh enters Limca Book of Records as a tribute.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1986, Singh was a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. He was awarded the Padma bhushan in 1974 for service to his country. In 1984, he returned the award in protest against the siege of the Golden Temple by the Indian Army. In 2007, the Indian government awarded Khushwant Singh the Padma Vibhushan.\n\nAs a public figure, Singh was accused of favouring the ruling Congress party, especially during the reign of Indira Gandhi. He was derisively called an 'establishment liberal'. Singh's faith in the Indian political system was shaken by the anti-Sikh riots that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination, in which major Congress politicians are alleged to be involved; but he remained resolutely positive on the promise of Indian democracy and worked via Citizen's Justice Committee floated by H. S. Phoolka who is a senior advocate of Delhi High Court.\n\nSingh was a votary of greater diplomatic relations with Israel at a time when India did not want to displease Arab nations where thousands of Indians found employment. He visited Israel in the 1970s and was impressed by its progress.\n\nSingh was married to Kawal Malik. Malik was his childhood friend who had moved to London earlier. They met again when he studied law at King's College London, and soon got married. They had a son, named Rahul Singh, and a daughter, named Mala. His wife predeceased him in 2001. Actress Amrita Singh is the daughter of his brother Daljit Singh's son - Shavinder Singh and Rukhsana Sultana. He stayed in \"Sujan Singh Park\", near Khan Market New Delhi, Delhi's first apartment complex, built by his father in 1945, and named after his grandfather. His grandniece Tisca Chopra is a noted TV and Film Actress.\n\nSingh was a self-proclaimed agnostic, as the title of his 2011 book \"Agnostic Khushwant: There is no God\" explicitly revealed. He was particularly against organised religion. He was evidently inclined towards atheism, as he said, \"One can be a saintly person without believed in God and a detestable villain believing in him. In my personalised religion, There Is No God!\" He also once said, \"I don't believe in rebirth or in reincarnation, in the day of judgement or in heaven or hell. I accept the finality of death.\" His last book \"The Good, The Bad and The Ridiculous\" was published in October 2013, following which he retired from writing. The book was his continued critique of religion and especially its practice in India, including the critique of the clergy and priests. It earned a lot of acclaim in India.\n\nSingh died of natural causes on 20 March 2014 at his Delhi residence, at the age of 98. His death was mourned by many including the President, Vice-President and Prime Minister of India. He is survived by his son and daughter. He was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in Delhi at 4 in the afternoon of the same day. During his lifetime, Khushwant Singh was keen on burial because he believed that with a burial we give back to the earth what we have taken. He had requested the management of the Bahá'í Faith if he could be buried in their cemetery. After initial agreement, they had proposed some conditions which were unacceptable to Singh, and hence the idea was later abandoned.

This forms a prominent feature of Koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the \"kalasam\", a bulbous stone finial. They function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex.\n\nThe gopuram's origins can be traced back to early structures of the Tamil kings Pallavas and by the twelfth century under the Pandya rulers these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the gopuram's colossal size. It also dominated the inner sanctum in amount of ornamentation. Often a shrine has more than one gopuram.\n\nA koil may have multiple gopurams, typically constructed into multiple walls in tiers around the main shrine.\n\nGopurams are widespread in south Indian temples, predominantly in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\"Vimanas\" are structures over the sanctum of temples, predominantly in Odisha and Tamil Nadu. In Odia/Kalinga style of architecture, Vimana is the sanctum sanctorum/ Garbhagruha of the temple housing the main deities and they are the tallest part of the entire temple. In many cases the \"vimanams\" are confused with \"gopurams\". In Tamil Nadu, \"Vimanams\" are present above the Garbhagruha or Sanctum sanctorum in of a Hindu temple and will be relatively smaller in size compared to the gopurams, which are usually present at the entrance of the temple.\n\n"}
{"id": "428356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428356", "title": "Maison Carrée", "text": "Maison Carrée\n\nThe Maison Carrée (; French for \"square house\") is an ancient building in Nîmes, southern France; it is one of the best preserved Roman temple façades to be found in the territory of the former Roman Empire.\n\nIn about 4-7 AD, the Maison carrée was dedicated or rededicated to Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar, grandsons and adopted heirs of Augustus who both died young. The inscription dedicating the temple to Gaius and Lucius was removed in medieval times. However, a local scholar, Jean-François Séguier, was able to reconstruct the inscription in 1758 from the order and number of the holes on the front frieze and architrave, to which the bronze letters had been affixed by projecting tines. According to Séguier's reconstruction, the text of the dedication read (in translation): \"To Gaius Caesar, son of Augustus, Consul; to Lucius Caesar, son of Augustus, Consul designate; to the princes of youth.\" During the 19th century the temple slowly began to recover its original splendour, due to the efforts of Victor Grangent.\n\nThe Maison Carrée is an example of Vitruvian architecture. Raised on a 2.85 m high podium, the temple dominated the forum of the Roman city, forming a rectangle almost twice as long as it is wide, measuring 26.42 m by 13.54 m. The façade is dominated by a deep portico or pronaos almost a third of the building's length. It is a hexastyle design with six Corinthian columns under the pediment at either end, and pseudoperipteral in that twenty engaged columns are embedded along the walls of the cella. Above the columns, the architrave is divided by two recessed rows of petrified water drips into three levels with ratios of 1:2:3. Egg-and-dart decoration divides the architrave from the frieze. On three sides the frieze is decorated with fine ornamental relief carvings of rosettes and acanthus leaves beneath a row of very fine dentils.\n\nA large door (6.87 m high by 3.27 m wide) leads to the surprisingly small and windowless interior, where the shrine was originally housed. This is now used to house a tourist oriented film on the Roman history of Nîmes. No ancient decoration remains inside the cella.\n\nThe building has undergone extensive restoration over the centuries. Until the 19th century, it formed part of a larger complex of adjoining buildings. These were demolished when the Maison Carrée housed what is now the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes (from 1821 to 1907), restoring it to the isolation it would have enjoyed in Roman times. The pronaos was restored in the early part of the 19th century when a new ceiling was provided, designed in the Roman style. The present door was made in 1824.\n\nIt underwent a further restoration between 1988–1992, during which time it was re-roofed and the square around it was cleared, revealing the outlines of the forum. Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to build a modern art gallery and public library, known as the Carré d'Art, on the far side of the square, to replace the city theater of Nîmes, which had burnt in 1952. This provides a startling contrast to the Maison Carrée but renders many of its features, such as the portico and columns, in steel and glass. The contrast of its modernity is thus muted by the physical resemblance between the two buildings, representing architectural styles 2000 years apart.\n\nThe Maison Carrée inspired the neoclassical Église de la Madeleine in Paris, St. Marcellinus Church in Rogalin, Poland, and in the United States the Virginia State Capitol, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson, who had a stucco model made of the Maison Carrée while he was minister to France in 1785.\n\n\n"}

His father, Hiyya Rofe, was a very learned rabbi from Safed. Orphaned at a young age, Meir studied in Hebron, leaving about 1648 as an emissary to Italy, Holland, and Germany. On his return journey, he stayed for two years in Italy to publish \"Ma'aseh Ḥiyya\" (Venice, 1652), his father's talmudic novellae and responsa. In Amsterdam he had influenced the wealthy Abraham Pereyra to found a \"yeshiva\" in Hebron to be called \"Hesed le-Avraham\", of which Meir himself became the head scholar.\n\nMeir was in Gaza in 1665 when Nathan of Gaza began to prophecy on the messianism of Sabbatai Zevi. In a subsequent letter to Amsterdam, to Abraham Pereyra, he wrote that \"Nathan of Gaza is a wise man fit for the divine presence to rest upon him,\" and urged Pereyra to come to Gaza. Pereyra reached Venice, but returned to Holland. Meir maintained his belief even after Sabbatai's conversion in 1666. In 1672 Meir left, again as an emissary of Hebron, for Turkey. He stayed for a time in Adrianople, where he was in contact with Sabbatai. On Sabbatai's exile to Albania in 1673, Meir returned to Gaza where he stayed with Nathan and even copied his writings for his own use. He then traveled again to Italy, and from 1675 to 1678 resided in the home of the Sabbatean Abraham Rovigo in Modena. Throughout his stay in Italy Meir did much to encourage those who believed in Sabbatai Zevi and spread the writings of Nathan of Gaza. During the last ten years of his life he was recognized as the outstanding scholar of Hebron.\n\nMeir Rofe persisted in his Sabbatean faith long after Sabbatai's apostasy, and even after Sabbatai's death. Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with Abraham Rovigo between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement.\n"}

The government arrested all prominent members of the largest Sikh political party, the Akali Dal, and banned the All India Sikh Students Federation, a large students' union. In addition, the Indian Army conducted operations in the countryside during which thousands of Sikhs, overwhelmingly young men, were detained for interrogation and subsequently tortured. Despite its purported success in controlling the armed insurgency in the Punjab region, the operation was criticized by human-rights groups for the suspension of civil liberties and habeas corpus, resulting in the disappearances of thousands of Sikh men. After the operation, the central government was criticized for using \"draconian legislation\" to repress a minority community.\n\nThe operation consisted of the rounding up of thousands of Sikh youth, including several presumably innocent civilians. According to estimates published by Inderjit Singh Jaijee, approximately 1 million individuals were reported as missing or killed as a result of Army operations during this period. According to Dr.Sangat Singh, Joint Intelligence Committee, about 100,000 youth had been taken into custody within first four to six weeks of the operation and he adds that many of them were not heard of again. He further adds about 20,000 youth crossing over to Pakistan.\n\nTo allow for the legality of the operation, the states of Punjab and Chandigarh had been declared by the Indian government as 'disturbed areas' by the enactment of the Punjab Chandigarh Disturbed Area Act 1983, while the Army was given unprecedented powers to detain and arrest civilians by the enactment of the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Act 1983.

Ruse is in the northeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the Danube, opposite the Romanian city of Giurgiu, approximately south of Bucharest, Romania's capital, from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and from the capital Sofia. It is the most significant Bulgarian river port, serving an important part of the international trade of the country.\n\nRuse is known for its 19th- and 20th-century Neo-Baroque and Neo-Rococo architecture, which attracts many tourists. It is often called the Little Vienna. The Ruse-Giurgiu Friendship Bridge, until 14 June 2013 the only one in the shared Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river here.\n\nRuse is the birthplace of the Nobel laureate in Literature Elias Canetti and the world-famous writer Michael Arlen.\n\nRuse is on the right bank of the river Danube, which is the high bank, having two underwater terraces and three river terraces at , , and . The average altitude is AMSL. The urban area is an approximately 11-km ellipse running along the river. The city extends from the land-connected Matey () island and the mouth of Rusenski Lom on the west to Srabcheto () hill on the east. During the 20th century, the west end of the city was significantly modified by moving the mouth of Rusenski Lom to the west, as well as by moving the bank itself with its fairway considerably to the north. Sarabair () hill is to the south of the city and is high. The Rousse TV Tower is built there on the remains of Leventtabia, a former Turkish fortification.\n\nRuse has a continental climate () with very hot summers and relatively cold winters. Owing to its position on the Danubian Plain, the city's winters can get windy.\n\nWinter temperatures often dip below , sometimes even to . In summer, the average temperature is . Temperatures frequently reach in mid-summer in the city centre and stay as low as during the nights. During spring and autumn, daytime temperatures vary between , and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain. The highest temperature recorded was 44.0 C and the lowest was −22.8 C.\n\nScholars suggest that the city on the river bank derived its present name from the Finnish root \"ruskea\" meaning \"brown\", or \"*ru-\" (\"river\", \"stream\") or from the Cherven fortress, meaning \"red,\" through the root \"rous\", which is present in many Slavic languages.\n\nA popular legend claims that the name \"Ruse\" comes from Finnish ruskea, or the name of a female founder of the city, whose name was Rusa, meaning \"brown hair\". In the 13th and 14th centuries, during the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, a fortified settlement called \"Rusi\", first mentioned in 1380, emerged near the ruins of the earlier Roman town.\n\nOther theories include settlement by people from Ruthenia; a connection to the village of Rusokastro in Burgas Province; an unattested tribe of Getae with a name such as \"Riusi\", or; the pagan festival of Rosalia.\n\nThe city emerged from a Neolithic settlement of the 3rd to 2nd millennium BCE, when pottery, fishing, agriculture, and hunting developed. Excavations have revealed several layers, suggesting that the place was attacked by neighbouring tribes and suffered from natural disasters. Ancient sanctuaries were found nearby, where idols of a pregnant woman, a fertility goddess, were prevalent.\n\nThe later Thracian settlement developed into a Roman military and naval centre during the reign of Vespasian (69–70 CE), as part of the fortification system along the northern boundary of Moesia. Its name, \"Sexaginta Prista\", suggests a meaning of \"a city of 60 ships\" (from  — \"60\" and  — a special type of guard ship), based on the supposed 60 nearby berths.\n\nThe fortress was on the main road between Singidunum (modern Belgrade) and the Danube Delta and was destroyed in the 6th century by Avar and Slavic raids. Hungarian historian Felix Philipp Kanitz was the first to identify Sexaginta Prista with Ruse, but the Škorpil brothers demonstrated the link later through studying inscriptions, coins, graves, and objects of daily life. An inscription from the reign of Diocletian proves that the city was rebuilt as a \"praesidium\" (a large fortification) after it was destroyed by the Goths in 250 CE.\n\nThe settlement was mentioned as \"Golyamo Yorgovo\" in the Middle Ages, whose present successor is Giurgiu in Romania.\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, the invaders destroyed the town, reacting to a 1595 unsuccessful liberation attempt by a joint Vlach-Bulgarian army, led by Michael the Brave. After its rebuilding in the following years, Ruse was dubbed \"Rusçuk\" (Turkish for \"little Ruse\") and had again expanded into a large fortress by the 18th century. It later grew into one of the most important Ottoman towns on the Danube and an administrative centre of Tuna Vilayet, which extended from Varna and Tulcea to Sofia and Niš.\n\nThe \"Dunav\" newspaper appeared — it was the first printed in Bulgaria and in Bulgarian. Some Bulgarian schools were founded. The streets are renamed and numbered for the first time in Bulgarian lands. A post office, hospital, home for the aged were founded. Three empires met here for trading: Austro-Hungary, Russia, British Empire. France and Italy opened consulates in Ruschuk. The modern city arose from the shades of the settlement. In 1865 the Obraztsov Chiflik was founded on the place where the English Consul's farm was; it was the first modern farm on the territory of the whole Ottoman Empire of that time.\n\nRuse developed into a centre of the Bulgarian National Revival and hosted the headquarters of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee.\n\nAfter it became part of modern Bulgaria on 20 February 1878, Ruse was one of the key cultural and economic centres of the country. Intensive building during the period changed the city's architectural appearance to a typical Central European one. Ruse is famous for the many first innovations in Bulgaria, including:\n\nRuse had the first Bulgarian factories for soda water, lemonade, and for neckties. The first aviator Simeon Petrov was born in Ruse.\n\nIn the newly liberated Bulgaria of the late 19th century, Ruse was a cosmopolitan city with a multiethnic population. According to the first census conducted in 1883, ethnic Bulgarians made up 43% of the population, Turks 39%, and Jews 7%.\n\n\"All façades on main streets of Russe shall have rich decorations with plastic stone\", postulate the Regulations for Constructions of Private Buildings of 1893, issued by the Municipality of Russe.\n\nAfter knyaz Alexander Battenberg's 1886 abdication, and as a reaction to the regentship's course led by prime minister Stefan Stambolov, a group of Russophile (pro-Russian) military officers revolted in Ruse. The riot was violently crushed, and 13 of the leaders were quickly sentenced to death and executed near the city, which caused much public discontent. Decades later, in 1934, local citizens raised funds and built a monument at the place where the Russophile officers were executed. The monument was blown up in 1940 but rebuilt in 1966 at approximately the same spot.\n\n\n\nBetween World War I and II, after Southern Dobruja was lost to Romania, the economic significance of the city decreased. So did the population: Ruse was no longer the second-largest city in Bulgaria (after former East Rumelian capital Plovdiv), being quickly surpassed by Sofia and Varna. Foreign consulates were closed, except for the Russian one, which has remained functional since. Only for the period between 1919 and 1920 the capital loss is estimated of around 40 million leva.\n\nThe return of Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria in September 1940 fostered good conditions for restoration of the city's leading role. It became a provincial centre, and economic activity revived. Typical for the post-war architecture of the city was the wide use of iron, concrete and glass as construction materials. Examples are the River port – 1931, the Freight station – 1935, Market Hall – 1939 and the Court house – 1940.\n\nSee also:\n\nThe construction of the Ruse-Giurgiu bridge in 1954 and the fast industrialization gave a new push to development. Ruse emerged again as an important economic, transport, cultural, and education hub. Engineering, chemical, and light industries expanded; a large harbor was built; and the city became a university centre. At the 1985 census, a population of more than 186,000 was reported.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ruse entered a dark period. The Verachim factory was built in Giurgiu, which polluted the air between 1980 and 1991, impacting the city's development. Population decreased, and 15,000 people moved out between 1985 and 1992. The first informal organization in Bulgaria under the communist regime was established here - The Public Committee for Environmental Protection of Ruse, which provoked the first nationwide demonstrations and strongly influenced the change to democracy. In 1991, the Romanian factory ceased the pollution, after the fall of the communist regime in Romania. \n\nLike other post-socialist regimes in eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism rather painful and not easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets and could not adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment in the city and emigration waves in 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status. The urban economics were positively influenced by the 2007's accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union, which allowed deeper cross-border cooperation. The flow of investments through EU funds restarted long suspended projects which were finally completed.\n\nAfter decades of construction the new corpus of the University of Ruse was inaugurated in 2010.\n\nIn 2011 city's centre was renovated through an EU project, worth 10 million leva. Included in the project, a Dry Deck Fountain was introduced in an urban environment for the first time in Bulgaria. The exterior of the Rousse State Opera was reconditioned.\n\nA water treatment facility, an investment worth 57 million Euro, is now functional.\n\nIn 2012 the Rousse Regional Historical Museum completed a project, which allowed the rehabilitation and display of the remains of the Roman city Sexaginta Prista.\n\nIgnat Kaneff, a Bulgarian-born Canadian business magnate, endowed about half of the amount necessary for the construction of a modern conference complex named after him, the Kaneff Centre, at the University of Ruse.

The famous market hall Gradski Hali, located in the city centre, is now operated by CBA, a Hungarian supermarket chain.\n\nRuse is a major road and railway hub in Northern Bulgaria. Railway transportation in the city dates back to 1867 when it became a station of first railway line in Bulgaria Ruse – Varna. There are railways to Southern Bulgaria, Sofia, Varna and Bucharest. Ruse has two railway stations for passenger services (Ruse Central and Ruse Razpredelitelna) and two for freight transport services. There are intercity buses that link Ruse with cities and towns all over the country and some European countries. They are based in two bus stations: South and East.\n\nRuse has an extensive public transport system with around 30 bus and trolleybus lines, including the Ruse trolleybus system. Most of the buses are operated under a concession by the Bulgarian subsidiary of the Israeli transport holding Egged Ruse. There are also several suburban bus lines, operated by various private Bulgarian transport companies. A 14 kilometer bicycle network is currently under development in the city.\n\nApproximately southeast of Ruse is the village of Shtraklevo, near which is the former military and passenger Ruse Airport. It is owned by the municipality of Ruse, with an active license for small passenger and cargo flights (license issued on 21.12.2016). The runway is long enough for Boeing 747s (Jumbo Jets). The Henri Coandă International Airport in Otopeni, Romania is north of Ruse.\n\nThe Danube bridge is located east of Ruse. It was the only road and rail bridge between Bulgaria and Romania until the opening of a second bridge crossing to Romania on 14 June 2013 at Vidin.\n\nRuse is the biggest Bulgarian port towns on the bank of the Danube River.

It consists of nine interlocking triangles that surround a central point known as a \"bindu\". These triangles represent the cosmos and the human body. Because of its nine triangles, Sri Yantra is also known as the \"Navayoni Chakra\". When the two-dimensional Sri Yantra is represented in three dimensions, it is called a \"Maha Meru\". Mount Meru derives its name from this shape. In addition to Mount Meru, all other yantras derive from the Sri Yantra.\n\nIn the 2009 issue of Brahmavidya (the journal of the Adyar Library), Subhash Kak argues that the description of Sri Yantra is identical to the \"yantra\" described in the Śvetāśvatara Upanisad.\n\nThe Sri Yantra's 9 constituent triangles vary in size and shape and intersect to form 43 smaller triangles, organized in 5 concentric levels. Together they represent the totality of the cosmos and express Advaita or non-duality. In the middle, the power point (\"bindu\") represents the cosmic center. The triangles are circumscribed by two concentric circles composed of 8 and 16 petals, representing the lotus of creation and reproductive vital force. The entire configuration is framed by the broken lines of an earth square, representing a temple with four doors open onto the regions of the universe.\n\nThe worship of the Sri Yantra is central to the Shri Vidya system of Hindu worship. It represents the goddess in the form of Shri Lalita or Tripura Sundari, \"the beauty of the three worlds\": Bhu Loka (Physical Plane, Consciousness of the Physical Plane), Bhuvar Loka (Antariksha or Intermediate Space Consciousness of the Prana) and Swar Loka (Svarga or Heaven or Consciousness of the Divine Mind). The Sri Yantra is the symbol of Hindu tantra, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of Shaktism. The Sri Yantra is the object of devotion in Sri Vidya.\n\nThe Sri Yantra represents the union of Masculine and Feminine Divine. The four upward-pointing isosceles triangles represent the goddess's masculine embodiment Shiva, while the five downward-pointing triangles symbolize the female embodiment Shakti.\n\nThe Sri Yantra is also known as the \"nav chakra\" because it can be seen to consist of nine concentric layers that radiate outward from the \"bindu\". (\"Nau\" or \"nava\" means \"nine\" in Sanskrit.) Each level corresponds to a mudra, a yogini and a specific form of the deity Tripura Sundari along with her mantra. The various deities residing in the nine levels of the Sri Yantra are described in the Devi Khadgamala Mantra. These levels, listed from outermost to innermost, are:\n\n\n\n"}

This establishment is significant to followers because it is built around the \"Jiba\", the spot where followers believe the god Tenri-O-no-Mikoto conceived humankind.\n\nThe organization of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters consists primarily of the headquarters proper (本部 \"honbu\"), grand churches (大教会 \"daikyōkai\"), branch churches (分教会 \"bunkyōkai\"), and dioceses (教区 \"kyōku\"). Under the management of the main headquarters is a dual organizational structure, such that the grand churches and branch churches minister to adherents genealogically while the dioceses minister to adherents geographically.\n\nAt the top of the church hierarchy is the \"Shinbashira,\" who is defined as the \"spiritual and administrative leader\" of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.\n\nMany of the current grand churches were established by missionaries around the turn of the twentieth century, and typically the head ministers of the grand churches are hereditary or adoptive successors of those first missionaries. The head ministers of the grand churches are closely affiliated with the headquarters and supervise the daughter and granddaughter churches under their pastoral care, called branch churches. Therefore, the majority of branch churches belong to a grand church, and the two form the ecclesiastical equivalent of a parent-child relationship. However, a small group of branch churches happen to be directly affiliated with the headquarters for historical or administrative reasons.\n\nThe diocese is responsible for supervising the Tenrikyo churches in a given prefecture. The diocese administrator approves church maintenance, fiscal budgets, and the hiring and dismissal of church staff.\n\nThe Main Sanctuary (神殿 \"Shinden\") houses the \"Kanrodai,\" the stand that marks the \"Jiba\" where adherents believe God conceived humankind.\n\nThe earliest sanctuary was the \"Tsutome basho\" (Place for the Service), constructed by the carpenter Iburi Izo in 1864. In the Taishō period, a major construction project was undertaken, and as a result what is currently the north section of the Main Sanctuary was completed in December 1913. Another construction project took place during the Shōwa period, which led to the completion of the south section in 1934. The west and east sections were expanded from 1977 to 1984.\n\nThe Foundress' Sanctuary (教祖殿 \"Kyōsoden\") is a building dedicated to the foundress of Tenrikyo, Nakayama Miki. \n\nThe first sanctuary was a temporary structure constructed in 1895. As part of a major construction effort during the Taishō period, the Foundress’ Sanctuary was completed in April 1914. This building is currently used as the Memorial Hall (see below). In the Shōwa period, another major construction took place, and as a result a larger Foundress' Hall was completed and dedicated on October 25, 1933.\n\nThe Memorial Hall (祖霊殿 \"Soreiden\") is a memorial that honors deceased Tenrikyo adherents, located northwest of the Main Sanctuary and connected by a sanctuary corridor. \n\nThe earliest memorial dedicated to Tenrikyo followers was inside the \"Tsutome basho\" (Place for the Service), an early worship hall. As part of a major construction effort during the Taisho era, a memorial was built in the middle of the corridor connecting the Main Sanctuary and the Foundress' Sanctuary. The current Memorial Hall structure was also built during this time, though it was conceived originally as the Foundress' Sanctuary. In 1914, memorial services (\"mitamasai\") began to be conducted in the spring and fall of each year. In 1933, the current structure for the Foundress’ Sanctuary was constructed, and the previous structure was renamed the Memorial Hall.\nInside the Memorial Hall, there are three altars. The middle altar honors deceased members of the Nakayama family, including the late Shinbashiras and their wives, as well as the early disciples Izo Iburi, Naraito Ueda, and Chushichi Yamanaka. The right altar honors deceased performers of the Service conducted at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. The left altar honors deceased church ministers and followers.\n\nDue to constant persecution from local government authorities and from members of established religions, the followers of Tenrikyo wanted to apply for legal authorization to establish a church. However, Japanese law during the Meiji period stipulated that legal authorization could only be granted if the church were classified under an established tradition, such as Shinto, Buddhism, or Christianity. Though Tenrikyo does not consider itself a Shinto tradition, early followers agreed to file under Shinto in order to obtain the protections from legal authorization. Several failed attempts were made; the first one was in April 29, 1885 to the governor of Osaka Prefecture.\n\nTenrikyo Church Headquarters was established in 1888 as a religious organization belonging to the Shinto Main Bureau (神道本局 \"Shinto Honkyoku\"). The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers could seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for missionary work. The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers, who labeled the religion as \"anti-social.\"\n\nOn April 6, 1896, the Home Ministry (内務省 \"Naimu-shō\") issued \"Directive No. 12,\" which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the state polity of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together, the obstruction of medical treatment and the alleged policy of enforced donations.\"\n\nThe Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state's demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the \"Service\". The name of the Tenrikyo deity Tenri-O-no-Mikoto was changed to Tenri-no-Okami. Tenrikyo's doctrine was altered to conform with the official State Shinto doctrine. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by Miki Nakayama.\n\nIn 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the Meiji government, which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908.\n\nOn April 1, 1900, Tenri Seminary, Tenrikyo’s first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities.\n\nIn 1903, a edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the \"Meiji kyoten\", or the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present edition because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the \"Mikagura-uta\" (\"The Songs for the Service\"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures.\n\nAround this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in Taiwan (1897), Korea (1904), Manchuria (1911), the U.S. (1927), Brazil, and Southeast Asian countries.\n\nThe fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first \"shinbashira\", the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the (三教会同 \"Sankyokaido\") including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners. Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of section one of the Mikagura-uta was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministry’s directive. \n\nIn 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become Tenri Central Library. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girls’ school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. \n\nIn 1928, the \"Ofudesaki\" was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the \"Osashizu\" was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. \n\nOn the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the Kagura Service was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896.\n\nAs the war between Japan and China grew from the Mukden Incident to the Second Sino-Japanese War, state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of Omotokyo Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation.\n\nAfter the National Mobilization Law was passed in 1938, Japan’s wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the \"Ofudesaki\" and \"Osashizu\" were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the \"Mikagura-uta\", and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 Religious Organizations Law further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan.\n\nIn its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the surrender of Japan and the conclusion of World War II as \"fukugen\", or \"restoration.\" One of the significant aspects of the \"restoration\" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the \"Mikagura-uta\" in 1946, the \"Ofudesaki\" in 1948, and the \"Osashizu\" in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949.\n\nAnother aspect of the \"restoration\" was the construction of the Oyasato-yakata, begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.\n\nThe \"Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue,\" a symposium cosponsored by Tenri University and Pontifical Gregorian University, was held in Rome, Italy from March 9–11, 1998. Three years later, the universities cosponsored another symposium, \"Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II,\" held at Tenri, Japan from September 28–30, 2002.\n"}

{"id": "4144550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4144550", "title": "Theistic Satanism", "text": "Theistic Satanism\n\nTheistic Satanism or spiritual Satanism is an umbrella term for religious beliefs that consider Satan as an objectively existing supernatural being or force worthy of supplication, with whom individuals may contact, convene and even praise, rather than him being just an archetype, symbol or idea as in LaVeyan Satanism. The individual belief systems under this umbrella are practiced by loosely affiliated or independent groups and cabals. Another characteristic of Theistic Satanism is the use of ceremonial magic.\n\nThe history of theistic Satanism, as an existing spiritual path practiced by people, is obscured by a number of groups accused of being devil-worshippers who asserted that they were not, such as in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe. Most actual theistic Satanist religions exist in relatively new models and ideologies, many of which claim to be independent of the Abrahamic religions.\n\nThe internet has increased awareness of different beliefs among Satanists, and has led to more diverse groups, but Satanism has always been a pluralistic and decentralised religion. Scholars outside Satanism have sought to study it by categorizing forms of it according to whether they are theistic or atheistic, and referred to the practice of working with a literal Satan as theistic or \"traditional\" Satanism. It is generally a prerequisite to being considered a theistic Satanist that the Satanist accept a theological and metaphysical canon involving one or more god(s) who are either Satan in the strictest, Abrahamic sense, or a concept of Satan that incorporates gods from other religions (usually pre-Christian), such as Ahriman or Enki. A small, now-defunct Satanist group called Children of the Black Rose equated Satan with the pantheistic the All.\n\nMany theistic Satanists believe their own individualized concept based on pieces of all these diverse conceptions of Satan, according to their inclination and spiritual guidance, rather than only believe in one suggested interpretation. Some may choose to live out the myths and stereotypes, but Christianity is not always the primary frame of reference for theistic Satanists. Their religion may be based on dark pagan, left hand path, black magic, and occult traditions. Theistic Satanists who base their faith on Christian ideas about Satan may be referred to as “reverse Christians” by other Satanists, often in a pejorative fashion. However, those labeled by some as “reverse Christians” may see their concept of Satan as undiluted or sanitized. They worship a stricter interpretation of Satan: that of the Satan featured in the Christian Bible. This is not, however, shared by a majority of theistic Satanists. Wiccans may consider most Satanism to be reverse Christianity, and the head of the atheistic Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, considers “devil worship” to be a Christian heresy, that is, a divergent form of Christianity. The diversity of individual beliefs within theistic Satanism, while being a cause for intense debates within the religion, is also often seen as a reflection of Satan, who encourages individualism.\n\nIn Luciferianism, Michael W. Ford, author and founder of The Order of Phosphorus, Black Order of the Dragon and later co-founder of the Assembly of Light Bearers, presents both a Theistic and Atheistic approach to Luciferianism, all centered in the foundation of the 11 Luciferian Points of Power, the core of the philosophy. Theistic Luciferianism is considered a individualistic, personal spirituality which is established via initiation and validation of the Adversarial philosophy. Luciferians, if Theistic, do not accept the submission of 'worship' yet rather a unique and subjective type of Apotheosis via the energies of perceived deities, spirits and demons. \n\nA notable group that outwardly considers themselves to be traditional Satanists is the Order of Nine Angles. This group became controversial and was mentioned in the press and in books, because they promoted human sacrifice. The O9A believes that Satan is one of two 'acausal' eternal beings, the other one being Baphomet, and that Satan is male and Baphomet is female.\n\nA group with very different ideology to the ONA is the Satanic Reds, whose Satanism has a communist element. However, they are not theistic Satanist in the manner of believing in Satan as a god with a personality, but believe in dark deism, the belief that Satan is a presence in nature. The First Church of Satan believe the philosophy propounded by Anton LaVey himself was deism or panentheism but is propounded as atheism by the leaders of the Church of Satan in order to distance themselves from what they see as pseudo-Satanists.\n\nOne other group is the Temple of the Black Light, formerly known as the Misanthropic Luciferian Order prior to 2007. The group espouses a philosophy known as “Chaosophy”. Chaosophy asserts that the world that we live in, and the universe that it lives in, all exists within the realm known as Cosmos. Cosmos is made of three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension. Cosmos rarely ever changes and is a materialistic realm. Another realm that exists is known as Chaos. Chaos exists outside of the Cosmos and is made of infinite dimensions and unlike the Cosmos, it is always changing. Members of the TotBL believe that the realm of Chaos is ruled over by 11 dark gods, the highest of them being Satan, and all of said gods are considered manifestations of a higher being. This higher being is known as Azerate, the Dragon Mother, and is all of the 11 gods united as one. The TotBL believes that Azerate will resurrect one day and destroy the Cosmos and let Chaos consume everything. The group has been connected to the Swedish black/death metal band Dissection, particularly its front man Jon Nödtveidt. Nödtveidt was introduced to the group “at an early stage”. The lyrics on the band's third album, \"Reinkaos\", are all about beliefs of the Temple of the Black Light. Nödtveidt committed suicide in 2006.\n\nTheistic Luciferian groups, such as the former Children of the Black Rose, are particularly inspired by Lucifer (from the Latin for ‘bearer of light’), who they may or may not equate with Satan. While some theologians believe the Son of the Dawn, Lucifer, and other names were actually used to refer to contemporary political figures, such as a Babylonian King, rather than a single spiritual entity (although on the surface the Bible explicitly refers to the King of Tyrus), those that believe it refers to Satan infer that by implication it also applies to the fall of Satan.\n\nSome writers equate the veneration of Set by the Temple of Set to theistic Satanism. However, the Temple of Set do not identify as theistic Satanists. They believe the Egyptian deity Set is the real Dark Lord behind the name Satan, of whom Satan is just a caricature. Their practices primarily center on self-development. Within the temple of Set, the Black Flame is the individual's god-like core which is a kindred spirit to Set, and they seek to develop. In theistic Satanism, the Black Flame is knowledge which was given to humanity by Satan, who is a being independent of the Satanist himself and which he can dispense to the Satanist who seeks knowledge.\n\nSome groups are mistaken by scholars for Theistic Satanists, such as the First Church of Satan. However, the founder of the FCoS considers what he calls \"devil-worship\" to often be a symptom of psychosis. Other groups such as the 600 Club, are accepting of all types of Satanist, as are the Sinagogue of Satan, which aims for the ultimate destruction of religions, paradoxically including itself, and encourages not self-indulgence, but self-expression balanced by social responsibility.\n\nThe diversity of beliefs amongst Satanists, and the theistic nature of some Satanists, was seen in a survey in 1995. Some spoke of seeing Satan not as someone dangerous to those who seek or worship him, but as someone that could be approached as a friend. Some refer to him as \"Father\", though some other theistic Satanists consider that to be confused or excessively subservient. However, in the Bible Satan is called the father of his followers in , and bad people are called \"children of the devil\" in . Satan is also portrayed as a father to his daughter, Sin, by Milton in \"Paradise Lost\".\n\nSeeking knowledge is seen by some theistic Satanists as being important to Satan, due to Satan being equated with the serpent in Genesis, which encouraged mankind to partake of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Some perceive Satan as Eliphas Levi's conception of Baphomet — a hermaphroditic bestower of knowledge (gnosis). Some Satanic groups, such as Luciferians, also seek to gain greater gnosis. Some of such Satanists, such as the former Ophite Cultus Satanas, equate Yahweh with the demiurge of Gnosticism, and Satan with the transcendent being beyond.\n\nSelf-development is important to theistic Satanists. This is due to the Satanists' idea of Satan, who is seen to encourage individuality and freedom of thought, and the quest to raise one's self up despite resistance, through means such as magic and initiative. They believe Satan wants a more equal relationship with his followers than the Abrahamic God does with his. From a theistic Satanist perspective, the Abrahamic religions (chiefly Christianity) do not define “good” or “evil” in terms of benefit or harm to humanity, but rather on the submission to or rebellion against God. Some Satanists seek to remove any means by which they are controlled or repressed by others and forced to follow the herd, and reject non-governmental authoritarianism.\n\nAs Satan in the Old Testament tests people, theistic Satanists may believe that Satan sends them tests in life in order to develop them as individuals. They value taking responsibility for oneself. Despite the emphasis on self-development, some theistic Satanists believe that there is a will of Satan for the world and for their own lives. They may promise to help bring about the will of Satan, and seek to gain insight about it through prayer, study, or magic. In the Bible, a being called 'the prince of this world' is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 4:4, which Christians typically equate with Satan. Some Satanists therefore think that Satan can help them meet their worldly needs and desires if they pray or work magic. They would also have to do what they could in everyday life to achieve their goals, however.\n\nTheistic Satanists may try not to project an image that reflects negatively on their religion as a whole and reinforces stereotypes, such as promoting Nazism, abuse, or crime. However, some groups, such as the Order of Nine Angles, criticize the emphasis on promoting a good image for Satanism; the ONA described LaVeyan Satanism as \"weak, deluded and American form of 'sham-Satanic groups, the poseurs'\", and ONA member Stephen Brown claimed that \"the Temple of Set seems intent only on creating a 'good public impression', with promoting an 'image'\". The order emphasises that its way \"is and is meant to be dangerous\" and \"[g]enuine Satanists are dangerous people to know; associating with them is a risk\". Similarly, the Temple of the Black Light has criticized the Church of Satan, and has stated that the Temple of Set is \"trying to make Setianism and the ruler of darkness, Set, into something accepted and harmless, this way attempting to become a 'big' religion, accepted and acknowledged by the rest of the Judaeo-Christian society\". The TotBL rejects Christianity, Judaism and Islam as \"the opposite of everything that strengthens the spirit and is only good for killing what little that is beautiful, noble and honorable in this filthy world\".\n\nThere is argument among Satanists over animal sacrifice, with most groups seeing it as both unnecessary and putting Satanism in a bad light, and distancing themselves from the few groups that practice it, such as the Temple of the Black Light.\n\nTheistic Satanism often involves a religious commitment, rather than being simply an occult practice based on dabbling or transient enjoyment of the rituals and magic involved. Practitioners may choose to perform a self-dedication rite, although there are arguments over whether it is best to do this at the beginning of their time as a theistic Satanist, or once they have been practicing for some time.\n\nThe worship of Satan was a frequent charge against those charged in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe and other witch-hunts such as the Salem witch trials. Worship of Satan was claimed to take place at the Witches' Sabbath. The charge of Satan worship has also been made against groups or individuals regarded with suspicion, such as the Knights Templar, or minority religions. In the case of the Knights Templar, the Templars' writings mentioned the word 'Baphomet', which was a French corruption of the name 'Mohammed' (the prophet of the people who the Templars fought against), and that 'Baphomet' was falsely portrayed as a demon by the people who accused the Templars.\n\nIt is not known to what extent accusations of groups worshiping Satan in the time of the witch trials identified people who did consider themselves Satanists, rather than being the result of religious superstition or mass hysteria, or charges made against individuals suffering from mental illness. Confessions are unreliable, particularly as they were usually obtained under torture. However, scholar Jeffrey Burton Russell, Professor Emeritus of the University of California at Santa Barbara, has made extensive arguments in his book \"Witchcraft in the Middle Ages\" that not all witch trial records can be dismissed and that there is in fact evidence linking witchcraft to gnostic heresies. Russell comes to this conclusion after having studied the source documents themselves. Individuals involved in the Affair of the Poisons were accused of Satanism and witchcraft.\nHistorically, \"Satanist\" was a pejorative term for those with opinions that differed from predominant religious or moral beliefs. Paul Tuitean believes the idea of acts of “reverse Christianity” was created by the Inquisition, but George Bataille believes that inversions of Christian rituals such as the Mass may have existed prior to the descriptions of them which were obtained through the witchcraft trials.\nIn the 18th century various kinds of popular “Satanic” literature began to be produced in France, including some well-known grimoires with instructions for making a pact with the Devil. Most notable are the \"Grimorium Verum\" and \"The Grand Grimoire\". The Marquis de Sade describes defiling crucifixes and other holy objects, and in his novel \"Justine\" he gives a fictional account of the Black Mass, although Ronald Hayman has said Sade's need for blasphemy was an emotional reaction and rebellion from which Sade\nmoved on, seeking to develop a more reasoned atheistic philosophy.\nIn the 19th century, Eliphas Levi published his French books of the occult, and in 1855 produced his well-known drawing of the Baphomet which continues to be used by some Satanists today. That Baphomet drawing is the basis of the sigil of Baphomet, which was first adopted by the non-theistic Satanist group called the Church of Satan.\n\nFinally, in 1891, Joris-Karl Huysmans published his Satanic novel, \"Là-bas\", which included a detailed description of a Black Mass which he may have known firsthand was being performed in Paris at the time, or the account may have been based on the masses carried out by Étienne Guibourg, rather than by Huysmans attending himself. Quotations from Huysmans' Black Mass are also used in some Satanic rituals to this day, since it is one of the few sources that purports to describe the words used in a Black Mass. The type of Satanism described in \"Là-bas\" suggests that prayers are said to the Devil, hosts are stolen from the Catholic Church, and sexual acts are combined with Roman Catholic altar objects and rituals, to produce a variety of Satanism which exalts the Devil and degrades the God of Christianity by inverting Roman Catholic rites. George Bataille claims that Huysman's description of the Black Mass is “indisputably authentic”. Not all theistic Satanists today routinely perform the Black Mass, possibly because the Mass is not a part of modern evangelical Christianity in Protestant countries and so not such an unintentional influence on Satanist practices in those countries.\n\nThe earliest verifiable theistic Satanist group was a small group called the Ophite Cultus Satanas, which was created in Ohio in 1948. The Ophite Cultus Satanas was inspired by the ancient Ophite sect of Gnosticism, and the Horned God of Wicca. The group was dependent upon its founder and leader, and therefore dissolved after his death in 1975.\n\nMichael Aquino published a rare 1970 text of a Church of Satan Black Mass, the \"Missa Solemnis\", in his book \"The Church of Satan\", and Anton LaVey included a different Church of Satan Black Mass, the \"Messe Noire\", in his 1972 book \"The Satanic Rituals\". LaVey's books on Satanism, which began in the 1960s, were for a long time the few available which advertised themselves as being Satanic, although others detailed the history of witchcraft and Satanism, such as \"The Black Arts\" by Richard Cavendish published in 1967 and the classic French work \"Satanism and Witchcraft\", by Jules Michelet. Anton LaVey specifically denounced \"devil worshippers\" and the idea of praying to Satan.\n\nAlthough non-theistic LaVey Satanism had been popular since the publication of \"The Satanic Bible\" in 1969, theistic Satanism did not start to gain any popularity until the emergence of the Order of Nine Angles in western England, and its publication of \"The Black Book of Satan\" in 1984. \n\nAs a moral panic in the 1980s and the 1990s, there were multiple allegations of sexual abuse and/or sacrifice of children or non-consenting adults in the context of Satanic rituals in what has come to be known as the Satanic Panic. Allegations included the existence of large networks of organized Satanists involved in illegal activities such as murder, child pornography and prostitution. In the United States, the Kern County child abuse cases, McMartin preschool trial and the West Memphis cases were widely reported. One case took place in Jordan, Minnesota, in which children made allegations of the manufacture of child pornography, ritualistic animal sacrifice, coprophagia, urophagia and infanticide, at which point the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was alerted. Twenty-four adults were arrested and charged with acts of sexual abuse, child pornography and other crimes claimed to be related to Satanic ritual abuse; three went to trial, two were acquitted and one convicted. Supreme Court Justice Scalia noted in a discussion of the case that \"[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged\", and cited the repeated, coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.\n\nThese iconic cases were launched after children were repeatedly and coercively interrogated by social workers, resulting in false allegations of child sexual abuse. No evidence was ever found to support any of the allegations of Satanism or ritual abuse, but the panic resulted in numerous wrongful prosecutions. \n\nJohn Allee, the creator of the LaVeyan website called First Church of Satan, equates some of the \"violent fringe\" of Satanism with \"Devil worshipers\" and \"reverse Christians\". He believes they possibly suffer from a form of psychosis. Between 1992 and 1996, some militant neo-pagans who were participants in the Norwegian black metal scene, such as Varg Vikernes, committed over fifty arsons of Christian churches in and around Oslo as a retaliatory action against Christianity in Norway, but such church-burnings were widely attributed to Satanists.\n\nSome studies of crimes have also looked at the theological perspective of those who commit religious or ritualized crime. Criminals who explain their crimes by claiming to be Satanists have been said by sociologists to be \"pseudo-Satanists\", and attempts to link Satanism to crime have been seen by theistic Satanists as scaremongering.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "449641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449641", "title": "Urðarbrunnr", "text": "Urðarbrunnr\n\nUrðarbrunnr (Old Norse \"Well of Urðr\"; either referring to a Germanic concept of fate—\"urðr\"—or the norn named Urðr) is a well in Norse mythology. Urðarbrunnr is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, the well lies beneath the world tree Yggdrasil, and is associated with a trio of norns (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld). In the \"Prose Edda\", Urðarbrunnr is cited as one of three wells existing beneath three roots of Yggdrasil that reach into three distant, different lands; the other two wells being Hvergelmir, located beneath a root in Niflheim, and Mímisbrunnr, located beneath a root near the home of the frost jötnar. Scholarly theory and speculation surrounds the well.\n\nUrðarbrunnr is attested in the following works:\n\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", Urðarbrunnr is mentioned in stanzas 19 and 20 of the poem \"Völuspá\", and stanza 111 of the poem \"Hávamál\". In stanza 19 of \"Völuspá\", Urðarbrunnr is described as being located beneath Yggdrasil, and that Yggdrasil, an ever-green ash-tree, is covered with white mud or loam. Stanza 20 describes that three norns (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld) \"come from\" the well, here described as a \"lake\", and that this trio of norns then \"set down laws, they chose lives, for the sons of men the fates of men.\"\n\nStanza 111 of \"Hávamál\" has been the matter of much debate and is considered unclear, having been referred to as \"mysterious\", \"obscure and much-debated\". Benjamin Thorpe translates the stanza as:\n\nIn the \"Prose Edda\", Urðarbrunnr is attested in \"Gylfaginning\" (chapters 15, 16, and the beginning of chapter 17), and twice in \"Skáldskaparmál\".\n\nIn chapter 15 of \"Gylfaginning\", a book of the \"Prose Edda\", the throned figure of Just-As-High tells Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) about Yggdrasil and its roots. Just-As-High describes three roots that support Yggdrasil that stretch a great distance. The third root is located \"among the Æsir\", \"extends to heaven\" and, beneath it, is the \"very holy\" Urðarbrunnr. Just-As-High details that, every day, the gods ride over the bridge Bifröst to hold court at the well.\n\nHigh provides more information regarding the well in chapter 16. High says that there are many beautiful places in heaven, and \"everywhere there is divine protection around it.\" There, a beautiful hall stands under the ash (Yggdrasil) near the well (Urðarbrunnr), and from this hall come \"three maidens\" whose names are Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld. The maidens shape the lives of men, and \"we call them norns\". High goes on to describe that there are other norns, and their nature.\n\nFurther into chapter 16, High states that norns that dwell by Urðarbrunnr take water from the well and mud that lies around it, and pour it over the Yggdrasil so that its branches do not decay or rot. The water is described as so holy that anything that enters the well will become \"as white as the membrane called the skin that lies round the inside of the eggshell.\" High then quotes stanza 19 of \"Völuspá\", and states that two swans feed from the well, from which all other swans descend. Chapter 17 starts off with Gangleri asking what other \"chief centres\" exist outside of Urðarbrunnr.\n\nTwo sections of the book \"Skáldskaparmál\" reference Urðarbrunnr. The first reference is in section 49, where a fragment of a work by the 10th century skald Kormákr Ögmundarson is recited in explaining how \"Odin's fire\" is a kenning for a sword. The passage reads \"A sword is Odin's fire, as Kormak said: Battle raged when the feeder of Grid's steed [wolf], he who waged war, advanced with ringing Gaut [Odin's] fire.\" and that Urðr \"rose from the well.\"\n\nUrðarbrunnr is mentioned a second time in section 52 of \"Skáldskaparmál\", this time associated with Christ. The section states that early skalds once referred to Christ in relation to Urðarbrunnr and Rome, and quotes the late 10th century skald Eilífr Goðrúnarson, who states that \"thus has the powerful king of Rome increased his realm with lands of heath-land divinities [giants; i.e. lands]\" and that Christ is said to have his throne south of Urðarbrunnr.\n\nParallels have been pointed out between the description of Urðarbrunnr at the base of the world tree Yggdrasil and Christian medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen's account of a well at the base of a sacred tree at the Temple at Uppsala, Sweden, found in his 11th century work \"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\".\n\nEilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced account of Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of \"Skáldskaparmál\") associates the well with the south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though there may be no other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan \"skald\", and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.\n\n"}
{"id": "743789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=743789", "title": "Wat Tham Krabok", "text": "Wat Tham Krabok\n\nWat Thamkrabok (, literally \"Temple of the Bamboo Cave\") is a Buddhist temple (wat) in Thailand, located in the Phra Phutthabat district of Saraburi Province, Thailand.\n\nThe temple was first established as a monastery in 1957 by the Buddhist nun Mian Parnchand (generally known as Luang Por Yai) and her two nephews, Chamroon and Charoen Parnchand, who had both ordained as monks at Wat Khlong Mao in Lopburi Province, Thailand. Luang Por Chamroon, a former Thai policeman, was the first abbot, although Wat Thamkrabok is not officially a Buddhist temple, but is a \"Samnak Song\", because it follows the teachings of Luang Por Yai, a woman. Still, the entrance claims it is a temple or Wat. The temple is majestic in its appearance, with two elephants supporting a globe marking its entrance. There are many large Buddha images on the temple grounds.\n\nFollowing the end of the Vietnam War, in the late 1970s, Wat Thamkrabok hosted Hmong refugees in a camp on its grounds as result of losing the Secret War, most of whom fled Laos alleging that they were persecuted by the communist government that has ruled Laos since 1975. Many thousands of the Laotian and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers at Wat Thamkrabok had also sought refuge at the Temple after fleeing forced repatriation efforts at other refugee camps in Thailand, because they did not want to return to the Marxist government in Laos that they fled. More Lao and Hmong refugees continued to arrive and seek sanctuary at Wat Thamkrabok until over 15,000 Hmong were eventually allowed, after a long policy battle in both the United States and Thailand, to go to the USA in 2004 and 2005 as political refugees, instead of being forced back to Laos. However, some even moved to the United States as early as in 2001.\n\nIn the late 1970s Wat Thamkrabok, and particularly its abbot, Luang Por Chamroon, supported the Hmong armed resistance against the Lao PDR government, particularly the Neo Hom led by General Vang Pao and other Laotian leaders, independent Chao Fa groups, and one sub-faction of the Chao Fa led by Pa Kao Her. The Hmong were United States war allies in the Secret War against the communist Pathet Lao, the Viet Cong and North Vietnam.\n\nWhen several Thailand-based Hmong refugee camps closed due to a lack of financial support in the early 1990s, Lao and Hmong refugees in Thailand fled to the temple to avoid repatriation to Laos. The population at the temple quickly grew to about 35,000, although it later declined significantly.\n\nStarting in 1993, the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Public Policy Analysis, or The Centre for Public Policy Analysis, (CPPA), and its Executive Director, Philip Smith, made over seven research missions to Wat Thamkrabok and Laotian and Hmong refugee camps in Thailand. Philip Smith, the CPPA, and the Lao Veterans of America, repeatedly conducted U.S. Congressional-backed research missions about the horrific plight of Laotian and Hmong refugees fleeing forced repatriation and human rights violations in communist Laos and Thailand. These joint U.S. Congressional and CPPA research missions sought to review policy developments in Thailand and Laos, and to convey humanitarian offers of support and assistance to the head Buddhist abbott, temple monks, and Hmong and Laotian refugee leaders, from Members of Congress and international human rights organizations. For over a decade, prominent Members of Congress, in bipartisan fashion, also supported U.S. Congressional-backed research missions by Philip Smith and the CPPA to Wat Thamkrabok, and the Laotian and Hmong refugee camps, along the Mekong River and Thai-Lao border. Support for these missions came from a bipartisan coalition in the U.S. Congress, including U.S. Congressman Steve Gunderson (Republican-Wisconsin), U.S. Congressman Bruce Vento (D-Minnesota), U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-Minnesota) and others. The findings of these missions were frequently discussed in news stories, and at sessions of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos held in the U.S. Congress and Library of Congress.\n\nWat Thamkrabok and its Hmong refugees drew global attention in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, as they became the subject of a major global political debate over their future, and the future of Lao and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand. The government of Thailand, with support from the United Nations and the Clinton administration, sought to repatriate the Lao-Hmong at Wat Thamkrabok back to the communist regime in Laos that the Lao-Hmong refugees fled. This effort drew opposition from several human rights groups, and some key Hmong organizations.\n\nLao and Hmong human scholar and advocate, Vang Pobzeb, of the Wisconsin and Minnesota-based Lao Human Rights Council, participated in a number of research missions with Philip Smith and The Centre for Public Policy Analysis, as well as U.S. Congressional offices, including U.S. Congressmen Bruce Vento and Steve Gunderson, to the Lao and Hmong refugee camps in Thailand and to Wat Thamkrabok during the 1980s and 1990s. U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and others in the U.S. Senate were active in raising concerns about egregious human rights violations in Laos and the plight of Lao and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers who fled Laos to refugee camps in Thailand and to Wat Thamkrabok.\n\nMichael Johns, a former Heritage Foundation foreign policy analyst and aide to former President George H. W. Bush, helped oppose the forced repatriation, labeling it a \"betrayal\", since many Hmong had aided the United States during the Secret War.\n\nWhile some Hmong were repatriated, most were resettled to the United States in 2004 and 2005, most moving to the U.S. states of Minnesota, California, and Wisconsin. There are presently only a couple of Hmong families living at Wat Thamkrabok.\n\nWat Thamkrabok has also received global attention for its heroin and opium drug rehabilitation program, which was started in 1959. Over 100,000 heroin and opium addicts have since gone through the unique Wat Thamkrabok detox program, a program consisting of Buddhist meditation, Asian herbal supplementation used for relaxation, induced vomiting, and the consumption of a secret detoxification potion composed of many different herbs. In 1975, Luang Por Chamrun Parnchand was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for the temple's drug rehabilitation work.\n\nA number of Western drug users have sought treatment for their addictions at Wat Thamkrabok, In 2002 Stuart Brindley became the first methadone addict from the UK to be treated at the monastery while other prominent westerners including British punk rock musician Pete Doherty, Irish rock music singer Christy Dignam of Aslan, American computer underground personality Patrick K. Kroupa and British singer songwriter Tim Arnold.\n\nIn 2004, Tim Arnold's success story was the subject of many news articles in the UK. After completing his programme Arnold subsequently became a permanent Tham Krabok resident and favourite 'son' of the monastery's abbot, Luang Por Charoen.\n\nBecause opium used to be commonly grown and, at times, consumed by the Hmong (largely for medicinal purposes) in the highlands of Thailand and Laos, some Hmong refugees have undergone addiction treatment at Wat Thamkrabok. Wat Thamkrabok also supports the detoxification of those addicted to alcohol and methamphetamines.\n\nWat Thamkrabok was believed to have served as a possible center of armed resistance to the Lao government with a limited number of weapons allegedly smuggled to some Hmong and Laotian insurgents and opposition groups in Laos. Responding to these concerns, the Thai military deployed hundreds of troops to surround Wat Thamkrabok in April 2003. This action was undertaken despite elements of the Thai military—many of whose officers were sympathetic to the Laotian and Hmong dissidents, insurgents and resistance fighter groups—allegedly, continuing to actively help to provide weapons and logistical support to Laotian and Hmong groups in Laos who oppose the communist government in Vientiane. The Thai military and police fenced the Hmong at Wat Thamkrabok with concertina wire in an effort to monitor and control entrance to it, before they were able to immigrate to the USA in 2004 and 2005. The area is no longer fenced.\n\nWat Thamkrabok became an official Wat (Temple) in 2012. Vichien Gitiwanno (Luang Por Vichien) has been entitled as the first abbot of Wat Thamkrabok as an official temple recognized by the Thai Government. The number of patients has reached to 110,312 by the end of 2015. \n\nWat Thamkrabok's historic role in harboring Hmong refugees in the 1990s and early 2000s, and its global reputation for unique Buddhist approaches to lifestyle management and detoxification, have made the temple a popular destination for foreign tourists and those seeking help with charitable and drug addiction treatment in Thailand. There have, however, been concerns, from some quarters, that Wat Thamkrabok may have played a role as an alleged conduit for weapons and military support to Lao and Hmong military insurgents and dissident groups, who were allegedly engaged in opposition to, and military conflict with, the communist Pathet Lao government in neighboring Laos as well as military and security forces from the allied marxist government in Hanoi, Vietnam. That alleged military support, and alleged assistance with weapons smuggling, has, however, from Thai military and other sources, apparently ended at Wat Thamkrabok and elsewhere in Thailand.\n\n"}

Sauer,\nThe pieces are written in lyrical prose, and combine COURTLY LOVE imagery of Christ as the perfect lover-knight with more earthy eroticism. Similarly, the texts combine nuptial metaphors with crucifixion imagery, blending divine marriage with shared divine pain. Jesus is at once the desired spouse and the suffering savior. In particular, the title piece outlines all the qualities that Christ has that make him the perfect spouse, and these are all defined in human terms. Christ is handsome, kind, noble, wealthy, generous, and loving. The other members of the Trinity make only rare appearances.

{"id": "601412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601412", "title": "Zafarnama (letter)", "text": "Zafarnama (letter)\n\nThe Zafarnāma (, , lit. \"Epistle of Victory\") was a spiritual victory letter sent by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1705 to the Mughal Emperor of India, Aurangzeb after the Battle of Chamkaur. The letter is written in Persian verse.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh Ji sent Bhai Daya Singh to Ahmednagar to give it to Aurangzeb. However it is said that a copy of the \"Zafarnama\", written by himself, was found with the Mahant of Patna Sahib in 1890 and one Babu Jagan Nath made a copy; this copy was somehow misplaced by him. Since Babu Jagan Nath was himself a scholar in Persian language, he could reproduce it from his memory and got it printed in Nagri Parcharni Patrika in Benaras. He is also believed to have sent a copy to Sardar Umrao Singh Shergill in Amritsar who is said to have given it to Khalsa college and which in turn reproduced in Makhz-e-Twarikh Sikhan. In Punjab newspapers, it first appeared in the Khalsa Samachar of 16 July 1942. Then in 1944, Kapur Singh ICS published it in Urdu Ajit of Lahore under the heading \"Fatehnama\". It is quite possible that in the process of translations and publications of the \"Zafarnama\" at different stages, some verses were not reproduced correctly and what we have today is not the original \"Zafarnama\" of the Guru in its entirety. The abrupt end of the \"Zafarnama\" also indicates that it is not complete and that some verses have been left out.
