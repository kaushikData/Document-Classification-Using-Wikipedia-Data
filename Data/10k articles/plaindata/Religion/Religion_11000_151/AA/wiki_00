{"id": "909286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=909286", "title": "3HO", "text": "3HO\n\n3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization), also known as Sikh Dharma of the Western Hemisphere or Sikh Dharma International, is an American sect of Sikhism that started about 1970. It was founded in the West by Harbhajan Singh Khalsa, also called \"Yogi Bhajan\". Its followers are primarily Americans. Its adherents are popularly referred to as the Sikh Dharma Brotherhood. While referred to as the 3HO movement, \"3HO\" is strictly speaking the name only of the movement's educational branch.\n\nOrthodox Sikhs, including the Sikh leadership in Amritsar, do not consider 3HO as Sikhs. 3HO consider the teachings of Yogi Bhajan as authoritative as the \"Guru Granth Sahib\", which Sikhs consider as heresy.\n\nThe 3HO movement is known for including some practices found in certain traditions of Hinduism, such as vegetarianism, meditation and Yoga, particularly Kundalini yoga. 3HO also believes openness to Yoga and spiritual ideas as a source of strength. Both men and women wear turbans and often wear white clothes.\n\nIn 1977, Gurucharan Singh Tohra, former President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), stated that Harbhajan Singh was not the leader of Sikhism in the Western World as he claimed, and denied Singh's claim that the SGPC had given him the title of Siri Singh Sahib. \n\nYogi Bhajan formed Sikh Dharma International as a California nonprofit religious corporation “organized to advance the religion of Sikh Dharma and as an association of religious organizations teaching principles of Sikh Dharma, including by ordination of ministers of divinity and operation of places of worship.” During Yogi Bhajan's lifetime, Sikh Dharma International, along with related legal entities Siri Singh Sahib Corporation and Unto Infinity LLC, were held and controlled by Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma, a California \"corporation sole\" of which Yogi Bhajan was the only shareholder. Following the Yogi's death in 2004, a dispute ensued over the governance of those entities and assets. Yogi Bhajan's wife, Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Puri, alleged that she had been appointed to the board of Unto Infinity, and that she and their three children were appointed to the Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma board of directors (and thus in a position to exert significant control over all of the Sikh Dharma legal entities); but that following Yogi Bhajan's death the other board members of those entities improperly prevented them from taking part in governance. In January 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the lawsuit was not on its face an ecclesiastical dispute. However, in April 2018, Chief Judge Michael Mosman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed the case. While it appeared that certain governance documents had been falsified after Yogi Bhajan's death to appear to have been signed before he died, Judge Mosman concluded that there was significant evidence that the 3HO corporate entities were religious in character and thus that the dispute could not be adjudicated in civil court.\n\nAt present, Sikh Dharma International is governed by the Khalsa Council appointed by the Siri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan. The Council is composed of Golden Temple CEO Kartar Singh Khalsa; his domestic partner, Peraim Kaur Khalsa, who was also a member of Yogi Bhajan’s personal staff; Sikh Dharma’s longtime comptroller, Sopurkh Kaur Khalsa; and the organization’s strategic and legal planner, Siri Karm Kaur Khalsa, a New Mexico resident. The Khalsa Council does not recognize Yogi Bhajan's family as members of the organization or its governing group. The Khalsa Coucil appoints a Board of Directors for Sikh Dharma International. the current Board of Directors comprises Siri Sikdar Sahiba, Sardarni Guru Amrit Kaur Khalsa, MA; Bhai Sahiba, Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Khalsa, PhD; MSS Guru Raj Kaur Khalsa; SS Guru Darbar Singh Khalsa; Sada Sat Simran Singh Khalsa; SS SatSundri Kaur Khalsa; SS Siri Karm Singh Khalsa; and Board chairman MSS Kirtan-Singh Khalsa. SS SatSundri Kaur Khalsa also provides oversight of the associated Sikh businesses of Yogi Tea and Akal Security.\n\nAccording to anthropology professor and Sikh diaspora researcher Nicola Mooney, 3HO Sikhs have combined \"ethic and capitalism\" to their spiritual pursuits, with Sikh Dharma International and its associated corporate entities and directors creating and controlling the Yogi Tea and Akal Security brands with a worldwide presence. \n\nGolden Temple of Oregon, a natural foods company that built the Peace Cereal and Yogi Tea brands, was owned by a corporate entity controlled by Yogi Bhajan, and was estimated to be worth around $100,000,000 at the time of his death. The company was transferred to Kartar Singh Khalsa for $100, sparking lawsuits over improper disposition of the assets. Golden Temple's cereal division was sold to Hearthside Food Solutions in May 2010 for $71 million; the executives were later ordered to return more than half of the sale price to a court-appointed receiver. Hearthside was later acquired by Post. Golden Temple was renamed East West Tea Company after that sale.\n\nAnother SDI-related company, Akal Security, initially hired 3HO members to guard shops and restaurants. It grew into a $500 million-a-year company with federal contracts to protect numerous government buildings in Washington, DC and elsewhere, including courthouses, airports, and embassies. The founders donated the company to the church in 1980.\n\nFollowing the death of Yogi Bhajan, control over Golden Temple and Akal Security was contested in a series of lawsuits in Oregon. The lawsuits ended in 2018, leaving both companies under the control of the board members of the main 3HO religious organization, Sikh Dharma International.\n\n\n"}

A Traditionalist Catholic and ally of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, he was Bishop of Campos from 1949 until his resignation in 1981.\n\nIn 1988, he incurred the automatic canonical penalty of excommunication for participating in the illicit consecration of four bishops of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). This penalty also applied to Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops that they ordained. However a subsequent public declaration of the penalty by the Holy See omitted his name, identifying only Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops whom they ordained. This was only one of several inconsistencies in the process. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the canonical penalty incurred by the four surviving bishops in the hope of facilitating full reconciliation of the SSPX.\n\nAntônio de Castro Mayer was born in Campinas, São Paulo, to Joao Mayer, a Bavarian stonemason, and his wife, Francisca de Castro, a Brazilian peasant. One of twelve children, Antônio helped his mother support their family after Joao died in 1910. At age 12, he entered São Paulo's minor seminary, then run by the Premonstratensian Fathers. After entering the major seminary in 1922, he was sent to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University (from where he obtained his doctorate in theology in 1928) in Rome. Mayer was ordained to the priesthood by Basilio Cardinal Pompili on 30 October 1927, and then taught philosophy, history of philosophy, and dogmatic theology at the seminary in São Paulo.\n\nBefore being named Vicar General of São Paulo in 1942, he became Assistant General of the city's Catholic Action in 1940 and a canon of the cathedral chapter (with the title of First Treasurer) in 1941. He was made a parish priest and the prefect of studies at the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo in 1945.\n\nOn 6 March 1948, De Castro Mayer was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Campos and Titular Bishop of \"Priene\" by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 23 May from Archbishop Carlo Chiarlo, with Bishop Ernesto de Paula and Archbishop Geraldo de Proença Sigaud, S.V.D., serving as co-consecrators. He succeeded Octaviano de Albuquerque as Bishop of Campos on January 3, 1949, and was very active in combating liberation theology and communist infiltration of the Church and of his diocese.\n\nIn 1968, the Catholic conservative group Tradition, Family and Property organized a campaign to collect signatures denouncing what were perceived as leftists in the Church. De Castro Mayer lent encouragement to the campaign. Later the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil declared that TFP was neither recognized by the hierarchy nor considered an official Catholic organization.\n\nDe Castro Mayer, a staunch traditionalist, refused to implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in his diocese. Until his resignation on 29 August 1981, the Tridentine Mass continued throughout the Campos diocese, along with all the other traditional Catholic practices and devotions. He continued this even after resigning as diocesan ordinary and being succeeded by Bishop Carlos Navarro. He was able to maintain a completely traditionalist \"diocese\" within a diocese, with around 40,000 faithful, which he organized in parallel chapels. (The diocese itself, without the followers of Bishop Castro Mayer, had some 850,000 Catholics.) This organisation was called the Priestly Society of Saint John Mary Vianney. Under the leadership of his successor, Bishop Licínio Rangel, this organization was subsequently reconciled to the Catholic Church and reconstituted as the present Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, with the same territory as the Diocese of Campos, Brazil, by Pope John Paul II in January 2002.\n\nOn his death bed, Bishop de Castro Mayer refused to sign a so-called \"formula of reconciliation\" (which would include an admission that excommunication was really incurred and that no situation of necessity, as claimed by Lefebvre and Castro Mayer, had existed in 1988) proposed by Vatican delegates at his death bed. He died of respiratory failure in Campos on 25 April 1991.\n"}
{"id": "4500841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4500841", "title": "Apostasy in Christianity", "text": "Apostasy in Christianity\n\nApostasy in Christianity is the rejection of Christianity by someone who formerly was a Christian. The term apostasy comes from the Greek word \"apostasia\" (\"\") meaning defection, departure, revolt or rebellion. It has been described as \"a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christianity. Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one who has been a Christian...\" \"Apostasy is a theological category describing those who have voluntarily and consciously abandoned their faith in the God of the covenant, who manifests himself most completely in Jesus Christ.\" \"Apostasy is the antonym of conversion; it is deconversion.\"\n\nAccording to B. J. Oropeza, the warning passages in the New Testament describe at least three dangers which could lead a Christian to commit apostasy:\n\nPersecution is highlighted in the Epistle to the Hebrews and the First Epistle of Peter. The issue of false teachers/teachings is found in the Johannine and Pauline epistles, in the Second Epistle of Peter and the Epistle of Jude. A number of sections in the writings of Paul and James focus on vices and virtues. \"These and other early texts helped to shape the trajectory of Christian response to the phenomenon of defection in the post-apostolic era. The Christians were to persevere through various types of opposition, standing firm against temptation, false doctrine, hardships and persecution.\"\n\nThe Greek noun \"apostasia\" (rebellion, abandonment, state of apostasy, defection) is found only twice in the New Testament (Acts 21:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:3). However, \"the concept of apostasy is found throughout Scripture.\" The related verb \"aphistēmi\" (go away, withdraw, depart, fall away) carries considerable theological significance in three passages (Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1; Hebrews 3:12).\n\nIn \"The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology\", Wolfgang Bauder writes:\n1 Timothy 4:1 describes \"falling away from the faith\" in the last days in terms of falling into false, heretical beliefs. Lk. 8:13 probably refers to apostasy as a result of eschatological temptation. Here are people who have come to believe, who have received the gospel \"with joy.\" But under the pressure of persecution and tribulation arising because of the faith, they break off the relationship with God into which they have entered. According to Hebrews 3:12, apostasy consists in an unbelieving and self-willed movement away from God (in contrast to Hebrews 3:14), which must be prevented at all costs. \"aphistēmi\" thus connotes in the passages just mentioned the serious situation of becoming separated from the living God after a previous turning towards him, by falling away from the faith. It is a movement of unbelief and sin, which can also be expressed by other words (cf. the par. to Luke 8:13 in Matthew 13:21; Mark 4:17; . . .). Expressions equivalent in meaning to the warning in 1 Timothy 4:1 include \"nauageō\", suffer shipwreck, 1:19; \"astocheō\" miss the mark, 1:6; 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:18; cf. also \"aperchomai\", go away, John 6:66; \"apostrephō\", turn away; \"arneomai\", deny; \"metatithēmi\", change, alter; \"mē menein\", do not abide, John 15:6; . . . [see also] the pictures of defection in Matthew 24:9–12, and Revelation 13.\"\nWolfgang Bauder goes on add that \"piptō\", fall (1 Corinthians 10:12; Hebrews 4:11), and \"ekpiptō\", fall off or from (Galatians 5:4; 2 Peter 3:17), is used figuratively in the New Testament to refer to \"the consequent loss of salvation, rather than of a mere failure from which recovery can be made. It is a catastrophic fall, which means eternal ruin. If it were not so, all the warnings against falling would lose their threatening urgency. To fall into sin and guilt, as an expression of a total attitude, is to plunge into irrevocable misfortune.\"\n\nThe following passages where the verb \"skandalizō\" (\"fall away from faith\") and the noun \"skandalon\" (\"enticement to unbelief, cause of salvation's loss, seduction\"): are theologically important as well:\n\nHeinz Giesen, in the \"Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament\", writes:\nIn the passive voice σκανδαλίζω [\"skandalizō\"] more often means . . . \"fall away from faith.\" In the interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20 par. Matt 13:18-23) those identified with the seeds sown on rocky ground, i.e., those \"with no root in themselves,\" the inconstant\nones, go astray to their own ruin when persecuted on account of the word, i.e., they fall away from faith (Mark 4:17 par. Matt 13:21). The Lukan parallel reads appropriately ἀφίστημι [\"aphistēmi\", fall away] (8:13). In Matt 24:10 Jesus predicts that in the end time many will fall away [\"skandalizō\"]. The result is that they will hate one another, wickedness will be multiplied, and love will grow cold. Yet whoever endures in love until the end will be saved (vv. 11, 13).\n. . . In the Johannine farewell address (John 16:1) σκανδαλίζω [\"skandalizō\"] does not only imply an \"endangering of faith\" . . . but rather \"falling away from faith\" entirely, from which the disciples and Christians are to be kept. . . . In the active voice σκανδαλίζω [\"skandalizō\"] means \"cause someone to fall away from (or reject) faith,\" as in the saying of Jesus about the person who \"\"causes\" one of these little ones who believe in me \"to sin [stumble]\"\" (Mark 9:42 par. Matt 18:6/Luke 17:2). The Christian is enjoined to reject anything that might be an obstacle to faith, as emphasized in Mark 9:43,45,47 in metaphorical, hyperbolic language: Hand, foot, and eye--in Jewish understanding the loci of lust or sinful desires--must be given up if they threaten to become the cause of loss of faith and thus of salvation. This . . . underscores the seriousness of conviction within which one must persevere if one wishes to enter (eternal) life or the kingdom of God. . . . Matt 5:29, 30 also issues an exhortation to decisive action [cf. Matt 18:8, 9]. . . . According to 1 Cor 8:9 a Christian's freedom regarding eating food offered to idols reaches its limit when it becomes a stumbling block to one's brother (πρόσκομμα [\"proskomma\"]). Hence Paul emphasizes that he will never again eat meat if by doing so he causes his brother to fall and thus to lose salvation (σκανδαλίζω [\"skandalizō\"], v. 13a, b), since otherwise that weaker brother is destroyed by the knowledge of the \"stronger\" (v. 11). Whoever sins against his brothers sins also against Christ (v. 12). . . . Within the context of the protection of the \"little ones\" in the Church, i.e., probably the \"weak ones\" ([Matthew] 18:6-10), Jesus utters an eschatological threat (\"woe!\") against the world (alienated from God) because of \"temptations to sin\" (v. 7a); though he allows that such \"temptations\" must come (v. 7b), he finally hurls an eschatological \"woe!\" against the person by whom the \"temptation\" comes (v. 7c). σκάνδαλον [\"skandalon\"] used here of the temptation to fall away from faith. The parallel, Luke 17:1, like Matt 18:7b, also underscores that such temptations are unavoidable; nonetheless, the person by whom they come receives the eschatological \"woe!\" that already places him under divine judgment. . . . In Rom 14:13 Paul admonishes the \"strong,\" whose position he fundamentally shares (v. 14), not to cause the \"weak\" any \"stumbling block to faith\" through eating habits . . . . In Rom 16:17 the σκάνδαλον [\"skandalon\"] are the various satanic activities of the false teachers who endanger the salvation of Church members, who are being seduced into falling away from correct teaching; such teachers also threaten both the unity and very existence of the Church. Similarly, in Rev 2:14 σκάνδαλον [\"skandalon\"] refers to a \"stumbling block\" to faith in the context of false teaching. According to 1 John 2:10 there is no cause for stumbling or sin in a believer who loves his brother . . . i.e., no cause for unbelief and thus a loss of salvation.\nPaul Barnett notes that James warns his readers of the possibility of temptation leading to apostasy. While a person is not tempted by God to sin, they can be \"lured and enticed by his own desires\" to sin (James 1:13–15). He adds, \"This letter has in mind a 'way' (\"hodos\", James 5:20) of belief and behavior, from which one may be \"led astray\" (\"planasthe\", James 1:16; i.e., by the influence of others) or 'stray from' (\"planēthē\", James 5:19; i.e., by one's own decision). Either way the one who is away from the true path is in jeopardy in regard to his or her personal salvation (James 5:20).\n\nBarnett also mentions that \"2 Peter addresses the grim situation of apostasy expressed by immorality (2 Peter 2:2–3, 14-16), under the influence of false teachers who have 'denied the master who bought them' (2 Peter 2:1, 17-22).\" Furthermore, in the book of Revelation:\nIt is clear that the churches of Asia are subject to persecution and its accompanying pressure to apostatize that arise from a Jewish quarter in Smyrna and Philadelphia (Revelation 2:9) and from the emperor cult in Pergamum (Revelation 2:13). At the same time various false teachings are touching the churches of Ephesus (Revelation 2:6), Pergamum (Revelation 2:14–15) and Thyatira (Revelation 2:20). The language of \"deception,\" that is, of being \"led astray,\" is applied to the false prophetess, Jezebel (Revelation 2:20). Satan, the source of all these persecution and false teachings, is also \"the deceiver of the whole world\" (Revelation 12:9). The metaphor, \"deception\" (\"planaō\"), implies a path of truth from which one might be \"turned aside.\" Against these Satan-inspired obstacles the reader are called upon to \"conquer,\" that is, to overcome these problems.\n\nThe Epistle to the Hebrews is the classic text on the subject of apostasy in the New Testament. New Testament scholar Scot McKnight argues that the warning passages (2:1–4; 3:7–4:13; 5:11–6:12; 10:19–39; 12:1–29) should be read and interpreted \"as an organic whole, each of which expresses four components of the author’s message.\" These four components are \"(1) the subjects or audience in danger of committing the sin, (2) the sin that leads to (3) the exhortation, which if not followed, leads to (4) the consequences of that sin.\" McKnight concluded from his study that (1) the subjects of this letter were genuine \"believers, persons who . . . had converted to Jesus Christ,” (2) The sin \"is apostasy, a deliberate and public act of deconfessing Jesus Christ, a rejection of God's Spirit, and a refusal to submit to God and His will,\" (3) the exhortation is \"to a persevering faithfulness to God and his revelation of the new covenant in Jesus Christ,\" (4) the consequences involve \"eternal damnation if a person does not persevere in the faith.\" B. J. Oropeza concludes that apostasy threatens the community in Hebrews on two fronts: mistreatment by outsiders (persecution) and malaise involving reluctance to listen to godly exhortation.\n\n\"The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery\" states that \"There are at least four distinct images in Scripture of the concept of apostasy. All connote an intentional defection from the faith.\" These images are: Rebellion; Turning Away; Falling Away; Adultery.\n\n\"In classical literature \"apostasia\" was used to denote a coup or defection. By extension, the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) always uses this word to portray a rebellion against God (; ).\"\n\n\"Apostasy is also pictured as the heart turning away from God (Jeremiah 17:5–6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20). In the OT it centers on Israel's breaking covenant relationship with God through disobedience to the law (Jeremiah 2:19), especially following other gods (Judges 2:19) and practicing their immorality (Daniel 9:9–11). . . . Following the Lord or journeying with him is one of the chief images of faithfulness in the Scriptures. . . . The . . . Hebrew root (\"swr\") is used to picture those who have turned away and ceased to follow God ('I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me,' 1 Samuel 15:11). . . . The image of turning away from the Lord, who is the rightful leader, and following behind false gods is the dominant image for apostasy in the Old Testament.\"\n\n\"The image of falling, with the sense of going to eternal destruction, is particularly evident in the New Testament. . . . In his [Christ’s] parable of the wise and foolish builder, in which the house built on sand falls with a crash in the midst of a storm (Matthew 7:24–27) . . . he painted a highly memorable image of the dangers of falling spiritually.\"\n\nOne of the most common images for apostasy in the Old Testament is adultery. \"Apostasy is symbolized as Israel the faithless spouse turning away from Yahweh her marriage partner to pursue the advances of other gods (Jeremiah 2:1–3; Ezekiel 16). . . . 'Your children have forsaken me and sworn by god that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes' (Jeremiah 5:7, NIV). Adultery is used most often to graphically name the horror of the betrayal and covenant breaking involved in idolatry. Like literal adultery it does include the idea of someone blinded by infatuation, in this case for an idol: 'How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts . . . which have lusted after their idols' (Ezekiel 6:9).\"\n\nA variety of colorful images are used to describe Israel’s apostasy: \"a rebellious ox, a prostitute, a wild vine, a stain that will not wash off, a camel in heat and a thief caught in thievery (Jeremiah 2:19-28).\" Images of peril attend apostasy, for to have forsaken God is to come under his judgment (Exodus 22:20; Deuteronomy 6:14–15; 17:2–7). \"The New Testament contains a host of images of apostasy, including a plant taking root among the rocks but withering under the hot sun of testing (Mark 4:5–6, 17 par.), or those who fall prey to the wiles of false teachers (Matthew 24:11), heretical beliefs (1 Timothy 4:1; 2 Timothy 4:3–4), worldliness and its defilement (2 Peter 2:20–22), and persecution (Matthew 24:9–10; Revelation 3:8). The Christian apostate is pictured as a branch that does not abide in the vine of Christ and thus withers and is cast into the fire (John 15:6). Animal behavior is evoked in a dog returning to its vomit or a clean pig returning to the mire (2 Peter 2:22).\"\n\nPaul Barnett says, \"Believers in the era following that of the apostles probably suffered a greater intensity to turn aside from Christ than did their predecessors. They ... were vulnerable to Jewish reprisals as well as action from the state. Details of the pressure applied to Christians to apostatize is given from both Christian and non-Christian sources ... It is understandable, therefore, that the postapostolic literature should contain many warnings not to apostatize.\" The following warnings not to apostatize come from the translation provided by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson in the \"Ante-Nicene Fathers\".\n\nClement of Rome (c. 96) writes to the Corinthian congregation whose unity has been threatened because a \"few rash and self-confident persons\" have kindled shameful and detestable seditions towards the established leaders (presbyters) in the congregation (\"1 Clement\" 1). This jealous rivalry and envy has caused righteousness and peace to depart from the community (\"1 Clement\" 3). The writer laments: \"Every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith, neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world.\" (\"1 Clement\" 3) Since history has demonstrated that many evils have flowed from envy and jealousy (\"1 Clement\" 4-6), the Corinthians are exhorted to repent (\"1 Clement\" 7-8), yield obedience to God's \"glorious will,\" and to \"forsake all fruitless labors and strife, and envy, which leads to death\" (\"1 Clement\" 9:1). Furthermore, they are to \"be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings\" (\"1 Clement\" 13), and \"to obey God rather than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the leaders of a detestable emulation [jealous rivalry]\" (\"1 Clement\" 14). He then warns, \"For we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good\" (\"1 Clement\" 14; cf. 47). Clement bids his readers to cleave \"to those who cultivate peace with godliness\" (\"1 Clement\" 15), and to follow the humility and submission that Christ and other saints practiced (\"1 Clement\" 16-19), which brings peace and harmony with others (\"1 Clement\" 19-20). Clement then gives these exhortations and warnings:\n\nThose responsible for laying the foundation of this sedition are urged to submit to the presbyters, repent, and to lay aside their pride and arrogance. For it is better that they occupy a humble place in the flock of Christ, than being highly exalted and ultimately \"cast out from the hope of His people\" (\"1 Clement\" 57).\n\nSimilar to Clement, Ignatius of Antioch (c. 107) warns believers about following a schismatic person:\n\nKeep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (\"Epistle of the Philadelphians\" 3) \nThe author of the epistle of Barnabas (c. 100) both admonishes and warns his readers about coming dangers:\n\nIn the last chapters of the epistle of Barnabas (18-21), the author sets two ways before Christians which are described in the metaphors of light and darkness (referring to abstaining from or the practicing of vices). Those who walk in the light \"will be glorified in the kingdom of heaven\" (\"Barnabas\" 21:1), and will be \"safe in the day of judgment\" (\"Barnabas\" 21:6). While those who walk in darkness will experience \"eternal death with punishment\" (\"Barnabas\" 20:1), and will be \"destroyed with their works\" (\"Barnabas\" 21:1).\n\"The Didache (c. 100) also maintains two ways: the way of life or death. The way of life is associated with loving God and one's neighbor. It involves abstaining from vices mentioned in the Ten Commandments or related to bodily lusts, sorcery, and idolatry (including meat sacrificed to idols). The way of death includes the practices of these vices (\"Didache\" 1-6).”\n\nIn Polycarp's epistle to the Philippians (2nd century) the vice of covetousness is a significant danger. Presbyters are advised to be \"keeping far off from all covetousness\" (\"Philippians\" 6). Polycarp expresses his grief over a former presbyter Valens and his wife who apparently committed some act of covetousness. He hopes that the Lord will grant them repentance. He enjoins his readers to \"abstain from covetousness,\" and \"every form of evil,\" and goes on to give this warning, \"If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen\" (\"Philippians\" 11). Polycarp says believers \"ought to walk worthy of His commandments and glory,\" and that deacons are to be blameless, not slanderers or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, \"walking according to the truth of the Lord\" (\"Philippians\" 5). He then adds:\n\nIf we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, \"we shall also reign together with Him,\" provided only we believe. In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the world, since \"every lust wars against the spirit;\" [1 Peter 2:11] and \"neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God,\" [1 Corinthians 6:9–10] nor those who do things inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and Christ. (\"Philippians\" 5)\n\nIn an ancient sermon (c. 150) the author exhorts his audience to pursue righteousness and abstain from vices:\n\nLet us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He saith, \"Not everyone that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that worketh righteousness.\" Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by our works, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but by being continent, compassionate, and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be avaricious. By such works let us confess Him, and not by those that are of an opposite kind. And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should do such [wicked] things, the Lord hath said, \"Even though ye were gathered together to me in my very bosom, yet if ye were not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity.\" (\"2 Clement\" 4)\n\nThe author further summons his readers to \"do the will of Him that called us,\" (\"2 Clement\" 5) and to consider\n\nthat the sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life everlasting. By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the path of righteousness. (\"2 Clement\" 5)\n\nThe writer goes on to say that this present world (which urges one to \"adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit\"), is an enemy to the world to come (which \"bids farewell to these things\"), and thus, we cannot \"be the friends of both\" (\"2 Clement\" 6). Therefore,\n\nB. J. Oropeza writes:\n\nIrenaeus of Lyons (c. 180) recounts how God has recorded the sins of men of old (David and Solomon)\n\nfor our instruction . . . that we might know, in the first place, that our God and theirs is one, and that sins do not please Him although committed by men of renown; and in the second place, that we should keep from wickedness. For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord’s coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing and remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who now commit sin, for death shall no more have dominion over Him. . . . We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom. And therefore it was that Paul said, \"For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not thee\" [Romans 11:21]. . . . (\"Against Heresies\", Book 4:27.2)\n\nIrenaeus proceeds to quote from 1 Corinthians 10:1–12, where Israel fell under the judgment of God for craving evil things, and then comments:\n\nAs then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent into eternal fire; and the apostle says, \"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" [1 Corinthians 6:9–10] And as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to us—lest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such thing. . . . And again does the apostle say, \"Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of mistrust. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.\" [Ephesians 5:6–7] (\"Against Heresies\", Book 4:27.4)\n\nThe \"early Christians frequently believed that apostasy came by way of deceivers at the instigation of the devil, and terrible consequences awaited such people.\" The writings of Ignatius have several warnings about being on guard against false teachers and the heresy they disseminate. In the letter to the Christians at Ephesus, Ignatius is happy to report that \"all live according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do you hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth\" (\"Epistle to the Ephesians\" 6). He mentions that there are false teachers who \"are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practice things unworthy of God, whom you must flee as you would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom you must be on your guard\" (\"Epistle to the Ephesians\" 7). The readers are further admonished to \"Let not then any one deceive you\" (\"Epistle to the Ephesians\" 8), and commended because \"you did not allow [false teachers] to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that you might not receive those things [i.e., false doctrines] which were sown by them\" (\"Epistle to the Ephesians\" 9). Ignatius then gives this solemn warning:\n\nDo not err, my brethren. Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with any one who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such a one becoming defiled [in this way], shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall every one that hearkens unto him. . . . Be not anointed with the bad odor of the doctrine of the prince of this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life which is set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of God, which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognizing the gift which the Lord has of a truth sent to us? (\"Epistle to the Ephesians\" 16-17)\nIn the letter to the Magnesians, Ignatius admonishes his readers, \"Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable\" (\"Epistle to Magnesians\" 8). Later he writes: \"I desire to guard you beforehand, that you fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope, from which may no one of you ever be turned aside\" (\"Epistle to Magnesians\" 11). In yet another letter, Ignatius entreats his readers to\n\nuse Christian nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy. For those [that are given to this] mix up Jesus Christ with their own poison, speaking things which are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he who is ignorant of does greedily take, with a fatal pleasure leading to his own death. Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons. (\"Epistle to the Trallians\" 6-7)\n\nFurthermore:\n\nStop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and ate and drank. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the true life. (\"Epistle to the Trallians\" 9)\n\n\"The final section of the Didache echoes the Synoptic tradition (Matthew 24:4–13, 15, 21–26; Mark 13:5ff; Luke 21:8ff; cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:3ff; Revelation 13:13–14) when it warns against apostasy through the deception of false prophets in the last days:\"\n\nWatch for your life's sake. Let not your lamps be quenched, nor your loins unloosed; but be ready, for you know not the hour in which our Lord comes. But often shall you come together, seeking the things which are befitting to your souls: for the whole time of your faith will not profit you, if you be not made perfect in the last time. For in the last days false prophets and corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall be turned into hate; for when lawlessness increases, they shall hate and persecute and betray one another, and then shall appear the world-deceiver as the Son of God, and shall do signs and wonders, and the earth shall be delivered into his hands, and he shall do iniquitous things which have never yet come to pass since the beginning. Then shall the creation of men come into the fire of trial, and many shall be made to stumble and shall perish; but they that endure in their faith shall be saved from under the curse itself. (\"Didache\" 16)\n\nTertullian argues that believers ought not to be surprised or alarmed at the existence of heresies since Christ and his apostles told us beforehand that they would arise and gave, \"in anticipation, warnings to avoid them\" (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 4, cf. 1). Neither should believers be surprised that heresies \"subvert the faith of some\" (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 1). Heresies are a trial to faith, giving faith the opportunity to be approved (\"Prescriptions Against Heretics\" 1). While heresies \"are produced for the weakening and the extinction of faith,\" they have \"no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful faith\" (\"Prescriptions Against Heretics\" 2). According to Tertullian, heresy is whatever contradicts the \"rule of faith\" which he defends as\n\nthe belief that there is one only God, and that He is none other than the Creator of the world, who produced all things out of nothing through His own Word, first of all sent forth; that this Word is called His Son, and, under the name of God, was seen in diverse manners by the patriarchs, heard at all times in the prophets, at last brought down by the Spirit and Power of the Father into the Virgin Mary, was made flesh in her womb, and, being born of her, went forth as Jesus Christ; thenceforth He preached the new law and the new promise of the kingdom of heaven, worked miracles; having been crucified, He rose again the third day; (then) having ascended into the heavens, He sat at the right hand of the Father; sent instead of Himself the Power of the Holy Ghost to lead such as believe; will come with glory to take the saints to the enjoyment of everlasting life and of the heavenly promises, and to condemn the wicked to everlasting fire, after the resurrection of both these classes shall have happened, together with the restoration of their flesh. This rule, as it will be proved, was taught by Christ, and raises among ourselves no other questions than those which heresies introduce, and which make men heretics. (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 13)\n\nTertullian sees heretics as ravenous wolves \"lurking within to waste the flock of Christ\" (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 4). They pervert the Scriptures by interpreting them to suit their own purposes (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 17, cf. 4, 38). Their teaching opposes the teaching \"handed down from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, and Christ from God\" (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 37). While persecution makes martyrs, \"heresy only apostates\" (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 4). In the face of heresies, which may cause a bishop or deacon to \"have fallen from the rule (of faith),\" the Christian must remain true to the faith, for \"no one is a Christian but he who perseveres even to the end\" (\"Prescription Against Heretics\" 3).\n\nChristian apologist Justin Martyr engages in a dialogue with Trypho (c. 160), who says, \"I believe, however, that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence\" (\"Dialogue with Trypho\" 35). Justin's response highlights the importance of remaining faithful to \"the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ\" in the face of false teachers:\n\nThe fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are disciples of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful and steadfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His name, these we do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, \"Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\" And, \"There shall be schisms and heresies.\" [1 Corinthians 11:19] And, \"Beware of false prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\" And, \"Many false Christ's and false apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.\" There are, therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ . . . Yet they style themselves Christians. . . .) Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion. . . . So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which He foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in order that you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by His works, by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words He taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless, and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him, may be saved in His second glorious advent, and may not be condemned to fire by Him. (\"Dialogue with Trypho\" 35)\n\nClement of Alexandria (c. 195) advises against giving into heretical men and their heresies in writing:\n\nHe who hopes for everlasting rest knows also that the entrance to it is toilsome \"and strait.\" And let him who has once received the Gospel, even in the very hour in which he has come to the knowledge of salvation, \"not turn back, like Lot's wife,\" as is said; and let him not go back either to his former life, which adheres to the things of sense, or to heresies. . . . He, who has spurned the ecclesiastical tradition, and darted off to the opinions of heretical men, has ceased to be a man of God and to remain faithful to the Lord. (\"The Stromata\", Book 7:16)\n\nCyprian (c. 251) bids his readers to \"use foresight and watching with an anxious heart, both to perceive and to beware of the wiles of the crafty foe, that we, who have put on Christ the wisdom of God the Father, may not seem to be wanting in wisdom in the matter of providing for our salvation\" (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:1). He cautions that \"it is not persecution alone that is to be feared; nor those things which advance by open attack to overwhelm and cast down the servants of God,\" for we have an enemy who is to be more feared and guarded against because he secretly creeps in to deceive us under the appearance of peace (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:1). By following the example of the Lord in recognizing and resisting the temptations of the devil, Christians will not be \"incautiously turned back into the nets of death,\" but go on to \"possess the immortality that we have received\" (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:2). Only by standing fast in learning and doing what Christ commanded does the Christian have security against the onslaughts of the world (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:2). He who does not \"must of necessity waver and wander, and, caught away by a spirit of error . . . be blown about; and he will make no advance in his walk towards salvation, because he does not keep the truth of the way of salvation.\" (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:2)\nCyprian says the devil, when he see his idols forsaken and temples deserted by new believers, devises a fraud under \"the Christian name to deceive the incautious\" (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:3):\n\nHe has invented heresies and schisms, whereby he might subvert the faith, might corrupt the truth, might divide the unity. Those whom he cannot keep in the darkness of the old way, he circumvents and deceives by the error of a new way. He snatches men from the Church itself; and while they seem to themselves to have already approached to the light, and to have escaped the night of the world, he pours over them again, in their unconsciousness, new darkness; so that, although they do not stand firm with the Gospel of Christ, and with the observation and law of Christ, they still call themselves Christians, and, walking in darkness, they think that they have the light, while the adversary is flattering and deceiving, who, according to the apostle's word, transforms himself into an angel of light, and equips his ministers as if they were the ministers of righteousness, who maintain night instead of day, death for salvation, despair under the offer of hope, perfidy under the pretext of faith, antichrist under the name of Christ; so that, while they feign things like the truth, they make void the truth by their subtlety. This happens, beloved brethren, so long as we do not return to the source of truth, as we do not seek the head nor keep the teaching of the heavenly Master. (\"The Treatises of Cyprian\" 1:3)\n\nOropeza states,\n\nIn view of Eusebius (c. 260-340), Simon Magus was the author of heresy (cf. Acts 8:9–24), and the devil is to be blamed for bringing the Samaritan magician to Rome and empowering him with deceitful arts which led many astray (Eus. \"Hist. Eccl.\" 2.13). The magician was supposedly aided by demons and venerated as a god, and Helen, his companion, was thought to be his first emanation (Just. \"Apol.\" 1.26; \"Adv. Haer.\" 1.33; cf. \"Iren Haer.\" 1.23:1–4). Simon's successor, Menander of Samaria, was considered to be another instrument of the devil; he claimed to save humans from the aeons through magical arts. After baptism, his followers believed themselves to be immortal in the present life. It is stated that those who claim such people as their saviors have fallen away from the true hope (Eus. \"Hist. Eccl.\" 3.26). Basilides of Alexandria and Saturninus of Antioch followed Menander's ways. Adherents of the former declared that eating meat sacrificed to idols or renouncing the faith in times of persecution were matters of indifference. Carpocrates is labeled as the first of the Gnostics. His followers allegedly transmitted Simon’s magic in an open manner. Eusebius asserts that the devil’s intention was to entrap many believers and bring them to the abyss of destruction by following these deceivers (\"Hist. Eccl.\" 4.7).\nOropeza writes:\n\nClement seeks to inspire perseverance in the midst of suffering with these words: \"Let us, therefore, work righteousness, that we may be saved to the end. Blessed are they who obey these commandments, even if for a brief space they suffer in this world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the resurrection. Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the present he suffer affliction, blessed is the time that awaits him there; rising up to life again with the fathers he will rejoice for ever without a grief\" (\"2 Clement\" 19).\n\nCyprian (c. 250), commands the presbyters and deacons to take care of the poor and \"especially those who have stood with unshaken faith and have not forsaken Christ's flock\" while in prison (\"The Epistles of Cyprian\" 5:2). These \"glorious confessors\" need to be instructed that\n\nthey ought to be humble and modest and peaceable, that they should maintain the honor of their name, so that those who have achieved glory by what they have testified, may achieve glory also by their characters. . . . For there remains more than what is yet seen to be accomplished, since it is written \"Praise not any man before his death;\" and again, \"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\" [Revelation 2:10] And the Lord also says, \"He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved.\" [Matthew 10:22]. Let them imitate the Lord, who at the very time of His passion was not more proud, but more humble. (\"The Epistles of Cyprian\" 5:2)\n\nIgnatius's letter to the Christians in Rome gives valuable insight into the heart of a Christian who is prepared for martyrdom. Ignatius hopes to see them when he arrives as a prisoner. He fears that the love they have for him will, in some way, save him from certain death (\"Epistle to the Romans\" 1-2). Yet, he desires to \"obtain grace to cling to my lot without hindrance unto the end\" so that he may \"attain to God\" (\"Epistle to the Romans\" 1). He requests prayer for \"both inward and outward strength\" that he might not \"merely be called a Christian, but really found to be one,\"--a Christian \"deemed faithful\" (\"Epistle to the Romans\" 3). He says:\n\nI write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for God, unless you hinder me. . . . Allow me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body. . . . Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments I may be found a sacrifice [to God]. . . . But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain. . . . And let no one, of things visible or invisible, envy me that I should attain to Jesus Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings, breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful torments of the devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ. All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth, shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die in behalf of Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the earth. \"For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?\" Him I seek, who died for us: Him I desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up for me. . . . Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. (\"Epistle to the Romans\" 4-6)\n\nTertullian believes that martyrdom is necessary at times in order for soldiers in God's army to obey the command to not worship idols.\n\nIf, therefore, it is evident that from the beginning this kind of worship [of idols] has both been forbidden—witness the commands so numerous and weighty—and that it has never been engaged in without punishment following, as examples so numerous and impressive show, and that no offense is counted by God so presumptuous as a trespass of this sort, we ought further to perceive the purport of both the divine threatenings and their fulfillments, which was even then commended not only by the not calling in question, but also by the enduring of martyrdoms, for which certainly He had given occasion by forbidding idolatry. . . . The injunction is given me not to make mention of any other god, not even by speaking—as little by the tongue as by the hand—to fashion a god, and not to worship or in any way show reverence to another than Him only who thus commands me, whom I am both bid fear that I may not be forsaken by Him, and love with my whole being, that I may die for Him. Serving as a soldier under this oath, I am challenged by the enemy. If I surrender to them, I am as they are. In maintaining this oath, I fight furiously in battle, am wounded, hewn in pieces, slain. Who wished this fatal issue to his soldier, but he who sealed him by such an oath? (\"Scorpiace\" 4)\n\nIn the following chapter Tertullian maintains that \"martyrdom is good,\" especially when the Christian faces the temptation to worship idols, which is forbidden. He goes on to write,\n\nFor martyrdom strives against and opposes idolatry. But to strive against and oppose evil cannot be ought but good. . . . For martyrdom contends with idolatry, not from some malice which they share, but from its own kindness; for it delivers from idolatry. Who will not proclaim that to be good which delivers from idolatry? What else is the opposition between idolatry and martyrdom, than that between life and death? Life will be counted to be martyrdom as much as idolatry to be death. . . . Thus martyrdoms also rage furiously, but for salvation. God also will be at liberty to heal for everlasting life by means of fires and swords, and all that is painful. (\"Scorpiace\" 5)\n\nTertullian has a long discussion on the certainty of persecutions and the reality of death for followers of Christ. Quoting extensively from the teachings of Jesus, Tertullian urges Christians towards faithful endurance in order to obtain final salvation with God.\n\nWhen setting forth His chief commands, \"Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" [Matthew 5:10] The following statement, indeed, applies first to all without restriction, then especially to the apostles themselves: \"Blessed shall you be when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, since very great is your reward in heaven; for so used their fathers to do even to the prophets.\" [Matthew 5:11–12] So that He likewise foretold their having to be themselves also slain, after the example of the prophets. . . . The rule about enduring persecution also would have had respect to us too, as to disciples by inheritance, and, (as it were,) bushes from the apostolic seed. For even thus again does He address words of guidance to the apostles: \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves;\" [Matthew 10:16] and, \"Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles,\" etc. [Matthew 10:17–18] Now when He adds, \"But the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death,\" [Matthew 10:21] He has clearly announced with reference to the others, (that they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct, which we do not find exemplified in the case of the apostles. For none of them had experience of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us have. Then He returns to the apostles: \"And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.\" How much more shall we, for whom there exists the necessity of being delivered up by parents too! Thus, by allotting this very betrayal, now to the apostles, now to all, He pours out the same destruction upon all the possessors of the name, on whom the name, along with the condition that it be an object of hatred, will rest. But he who will endure on to the end—this man will be saved. By enduring what but persecution—betrayal—death? For to endure to the end is naught else than to suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follows, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his own lord;\" [Matthew 10:24] because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself was steadfast in suffering persecution, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of His servants and disciples to bear the same, that they may not seem as if superior to Him, or to have got an immunity from the assaults of unrighteousness, since this itself should be glory enough for them, to be conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and, preparing them for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not fear such persons as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the soul, but that they must dedicate fear to Him rather who has such power that He can kill both body and soul, and destroy them in hell [Matthew 10:28]. Who, pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings aforesaid—men, I suppose? Who is the ruler of the soul also, but God only? Who is this but the threatener of fires hereafter, He without whose will not even one of two sparrows falls to the ground; that is, not even one of the two substances of man, flesh or spirit, because the number of our hairs also has been recorded before Him? Fear not, therefore. When He adds, \"You are of more value than many sparrows,\" He makes promise that we shall not in vain—that is, not without profit—fall to the ground if we choose to be killed by men rather than by God. \"Whosoever therefore will confess in me before men, in him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven; and whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny also before my Father who is in heaven.\" [Matthew 10:32–34] [What] if a Christian is to be stoned . . . burned . . . butchered . . . [or] put an end to by beasts . . . ? He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall be saved. . . . For what does He add after finishing with confession and denial? \"Think not that I have come to send peace on earth, but a sword,\"—undoubtedly on the earth. \"For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\" [Matthew 10:34–35] For so is it brought to pass, that the brother delivers up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children rise up against the parents, and cause them to die. And he who endures to the end let that man be saved. [Matthew 10:22] So that this whole course of procedure characteristic of the Lord's sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but to earth, makes confession also to be there, which by enduring to the end is to issue in the suffering of death. In the same manner, therefore, we maintain that the other announcements too refer to the condition of martyrdom. \"He,\" says Jesus, \"who will value his own life also more than me, is not worthy of me,\" [Luke 14:26] —that is, he who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing, me; and \"he who finds his life shall lose it; but he who loses it for my sake shall find it.\" [Matthew 10:39] Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks that he wins it by denying, will lose it in hell. On the other hand, he who, through confessing, is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about to find it unto everlasting life. Who, now, should know better the marrow of the Scriptures than the school of Christ itself?—the persons whom the Lord both chose for Himself as scholars, certainly to be fully instructed in all points, and appointed to us for masters to instruct us in all points. To whom would He have rather made known the veiled import of His own language, than to him to whom He disclosed the likeness of His own glory—to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards to Paul, to whom He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his martyrdom? Or do they also write differently from what they think—teachers using deceit, not truth? Addressing the Christians of Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, \"How great indeed is the glory, if you suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers! For this is a lovely feature, and even hereunto were you called, since Christ also suffered for us, leaving you Himself as an example, that you should follow His own steps.\" [1 Peter 2:20–21] And again: \"Beloved, be not alarmed by the fiery trial which is taking place among you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. For, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, do you rejoice; that, when His glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; because glory and the Spirit of God rest upon you: if only none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men's matters; yet (if any man suffer) as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.\" [1 Peter 4:12–14] John, in fact, exhorts us to lay down our lives even for our brethren, [1 John 3:16] affirming that there is no fear in love: \"For perfect love casts out fear, since fear has punishment; and he who fears is not perfect in love.\" [1 John 4:18] What fear would it be better to understand (as here meant), than that which gives rise to denial? What love does he assert to be perfect, but that which puts fear to flight, and gives courage to confess? What penalty will he appoint as the punishment of fear, but that which he who denies is about to pay, who has to be slain, body and soul, in hell? And if he teaches that we must die for the brethren, how much more for the Lord,—he being sufficiently prepared, by his own Revelation too, for giving such advice! For indeed the Spirit had sent the injunction to the angel of the church in Smyrna: \"Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life.\" [Revelation 2:10] Also to the angel of the church in Pergamus (mention was made) of Antipas, [Revelation 2:13] the very faithful martyr, who was slain where Satan dwells. Also to the angel of the church in Philadelphia [Revelation 3:10] (it was signified) that he who had not denied the name of the Lord was delivered from the last trial. Then to every conqueror the Spirit promises now the tree of life, and exemption from the second death; now the hidden manna with the stone of glistening whiteness, and the name unknown (to every man save him that receives it); now power to rule with a rod of iron, and the brightness of the morning star; now the being clothed in white raiment, and not having the name blotted out of the book of life, and being made in the temple of God a pillar with the inscription on it of the name of God and of the Lord, and of the heavenly Jerusalem; now a sitting with the Lord on His throne . . . . Who, pray, are these so blessed conquerors, but martyrs in the strict sense of the word? For indeed theirs are the victories whose also are the fights; theirs, however, are the fights whose also is the blood. But the souls of the martyrs both peacefully rest in the meantime under the altar, [Revelation 6:9] and support their patience by the assured hope of revenge; and, clothed in their robes, wear the dazzling halo of brightness, until others also may fully share in their glory. For yet again a countless throng are revealed, clothed in white and distinguished by palms of victory, celebrating their triumph doubtless over Antichrist, since one of the elders says, \"These are they who come out of that great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\" [Revelation 7:14] For the flesh is the clothing of the soul. The uncleanness, indeed, is washed away by baptism, but the stains are changed into dazzling whiteness by martyrdom. . . . When great Babylon likewise is represented as drunk with the blood of the saints, [Revelation 17:6] doubtless the supplies needful for her drunkenness are furnished by the cups of martyrdoms; and what suffering the fear of martyrdoms will entail, is in like manner shown. For among all the castaways, nay, taking precedence of them all, are the fearful. \"But the fearful,\" says John—and then come the others—\"will have their part in the lake of fire and brimstone.\" [Revelation 21:8] Thus fear, which, as stated in his epistle, love drives out, has punishment. (\"Scorpiace\" 9–12)\n\nReadings from the early church fathers such as these led patristic scholar David Bercot to conclude: \"Since the early Christians believed that our continued faith and obedience are necessary for salvation, it naturally follows that they believed that a 'saved' person could still end up being lost [through apostasy].\"\n\nThere appears to be three primary perspectives on apostasy in Protestantism: Classical or Reformed Calvinism, Moderate Calvinism, and Reformed Arminianism.\n\nAccording to John Calvin (1509–1564), once the Holy Spirit brings a person to regeneration (i.e., gives them spiritual life) this experience cannot be lost and leads to final salvation with God. In Calvin's theology, God has predestined to regenerate some (the elect) to eternal life and not to regenerate others (the non-elect) which ensures their eternal damnation (\"Calvin's Institutes\" 3.21:5; cf. 3.2:15–40, 14.6–9, 18–20, 24.6f.). The elect may fall away from God's grace temporarily, but the truly elect will eventually be restored and not plunge into final apostasy. Calvin believed that \"The Lord uses the fear of final apostasy in order to safeguard true believers against it. Only the ones who ignore the threat are in real danger of falling away.\" Calvin viewed the passages on apostasy found in Hebrews (6:4–6; 10:26–29) as applying to those in the church having a false faith—reprobates (i.e., unbelievers) who have never experienced regeneration. John Jefferson Davis writes:\n\nEven though Calvin believes that regeneration is irreversible . . . he does not conclude that the Christian has any cause for spiritual complacency. Persevering in God's grace requires, on the human side, \"severe and arduous effort.\" . . . The believer needs to continually feed his soul on the preaching of the Word and to grow in faith throughout the whole course of life. Since it is easy for the believer to fall away for a time from the grace of God, there is constant need for \"striving and vigilance, if we would persevere in the grace of God.\" Calvin thus balances his theological certitudes with pastoral warnings. . . . The believer must continually exercise faith and obedience to make \"his calling and election sure.\"\n\nOthers in the Reformed tradition followed Calvin's theology on election, regeneration, perseverance, and apostasy: Zacharias Ursinus (1534–1583); William Perkins (1558–1602); John Owen (1616–1683); John Gill (1697–1771); Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758); and George Whitefield (1714–1770). The Reformed confessions such as the \"Canons of the Synod of Dort\" (1619) and the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) also express views parallel with Calvin's theology.\n\nIn his book, \"Reign of the Servant Kings: A Study of Eternal Security and the Final Significance of Man\", Free Grace author Joseph Dillow seeks to chart a middle position between the Reformed Calvinist and Arminian position on apostasy. Dillow accepts \"the Reformed position that those who are truly born again can never lose their salvation.\" But he also accepts the Arminian position that the warning passages concerning apostasy in the New Testament (e.g., Hebrews 6) are directed to genuine Christians, not merely professing Christians who are in reality unbelievers as reformed Calvinists assert. There are real dangers in these warning passages, but contrary to the Arminian view, it \"is \"not [the] loss of salvation but severe divine discipline\" (physical death or worse) in the present time and loss of reward, and even rebuke, at the judgment seat of Christ.\" Dillow, like other Free Grace adherents, disagrees with reformed Calvinists and Arminians in holding that saving faith in Christ \"must\" continue in order for a person to obtain final salvation with God. The prominent authors for the Moderate Calvinist perspective are: R. T. Kendall; Zane C. Hodges; Charles C. Ryrie; Charles Stanley; Norman L. Geisler; and Tony Evans.\n\nReformed Arminianism derives its name from pastor and theologian James Arminius (1560–1609). Right up until his death, Arminius was undecided as to whether a believer could commit apostasy. However, he did affirm like Calvin that believers must continually exercise faith in order to obtain final salvation with God. After the death of Arminius, the Remonstrants maintained their leader's view that the believer has power through the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to be victorious over sin, Satan, and the world, and his uncertainty regarding the possibility of apostasy. This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610. Sometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the Remonstrants became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of committing apostasy. They formalized their views in \"The Opinion of the Remonstrants\" (1618). Points three and four in the fifth article read:\nTrue believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible for this to happen, but it even happens frequently. True believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds, to persevere and to die in them; and therefore finally to fall and to perish.\nReformed Arminian scholar Robert Picirilli remarks: \"Ever since that early period, then, when the issue was being examined again, Arminians have taught that those who are truly saved need to be warned against apostasy as a real and possible danger.\" Important treatments regarding apostasy have come from the following Arminians: Thomas Olivers (1725–1799); Richard Watson (1781–1833); Thomas O. Summers (1812–1882); Albert Nash (1812–1900); and William Burt Pope (1822–1903).\n\nThe following Christian denominations affirm their belief in the possibility of apostasy in either their articles or statements of faith, or by way of a position paper.\n\nAugustine believed \"that God's elect will certainly persevere to the end and attain eternal salvation.\" However, according to Reformed scholar John Jefferson Davis,\nAugustine does not believe that the Christian can in this life know with infallible certitude that he is in fact among the elect and that he will finally persevere. According to Augustine \"it is uncertain whether anyone has received this gift [of perseverance] so long as he is still alive.\" The believer's life in this world is a state of trial, and he who seems to stand must take heed lest he fall. . . . In fact one's justification and baptismal regeneration could be rejected and lost through sin and unbelief.\nAugustine's views \"set the parameters for Aquinas, for the Council of Trent, and for the Roman Catholic tradition generally down to the present day.\"\n\nLike Augustine, Thomas Aquinas holds \"that one who has been justified by grace stands continually in need of the grace of God, since the justified can turn away and be finally lost.\"\n\nLike Augustine, Martin Luther believed that salvation or \"regeneration occurred through the waters of baptism.\" \"But,\" noted the Reformer, \"all of us do not remain with our baptism. Many fall away from Christ and become false Christians.\" In his commentary on 2 Peter 2:22 he writes as follows on apostates in the Church: \"Through baptism these people threw out unbelief, had their unclean way of life washed away, and entered into a pure life of faith and love. Now they fall away into unbelief and their own works, and they soil themselves again in filth.\"\n\nLuther held that even if one has experienced the justifying grace of God through faith in Christ, they still \"can lose that justification through unbelief or false confidence in works.\" In his comments on Galatians 5:4, \"Ye are fallen from grace,\" Luther writes, \"To fall from grace means to lose the atonement, the forgiveness of sins, the righteousness, liberty, and life which Jesus has merited for us by His death and resurrection. To lose the grace of God means to gain the wrath and judgment of God, death, the bondage of the devil, and everlasting condemnation.\"\n\nMartin Luther shared with Augustine, Aquinas, and \"the Roman Catholic Church of his day the belief that the grace of baptismal regeneration and justification could be lost.\"\n\nPhilip Melancthon wrote a commentary on Romans in 1540. On this particular passage: \"Brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live\" (Rom. 8:12-13, ESV), Melanchthon calls this \"teaching about the new obedience.\" Paul gives this teaching so people \"born again by faith\" \"may understand what the obedience in the saints is like, and what is the nature of the sin on account of which they fall from grace and lose faith and the Holy Spirit.\" This new obedience \"acknowledges God, obeys him, and fights against the impulses of the flesh which carry a person along against the will of God.\" When Paul says \"'If you mortify the actions of the flesh by the Spirit,' he testifies that there are in saints some sinful actions, namely, concupiscence [i.e., strong sexual desire; lust]; various evil desires; . . . being inflamed with desire for revenge; hatred; avarice [i.e., greed]; etc.\" These sins do not lead to \"eternal death\" when the saints fight against these sins by faith through Christ their mediator. It is\nwhen those who had been sanctified indulge in and obey such desires, do not fight against them, and are without repentance. Such persons lose faith and the Holy Spirit and are condemned to eternal death unless they return to repentance. Thus when David had become an adulterer, he was without faith and the Holy Spirit, and would have been lost if he had not afterward been restored through repentance. Here belongs what is said in this passage: \"If you will live according to the flesh,\" that is, if you will obey the evil desires, \"you will die.\" The same thought is frequently repeated in Scripture. . . . 1 Cor. 6[:9]: \"Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, ... will inherit the kingdom of God.\" Gal. 5[:21]: \"Those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" Col. 3[:6]: \"On account of which the wrath of God is coming on the disobedient . . .\" \nPuritan John Goodwin demonstrated that Melanchthon fully supported the possibility of Christians committing apostasy:\n\"There are two errors . . . of fanatic men, which must briefly be confuted, who conceit that men regenerated cannot lapse” or fall, \"and that though they do fall, and this against the light of their conscience, yet they are righteous,\" or in a state of justification. \"This madness is to be condemned, and both instances and sayings from the scriptures of the apostles and prophets are opposed to it. Saul and David pleased God, were righteous, had the Holy Spirit given unto them, yet afterward fell, so that one of them perished utterly; the other returned again to God. There are many sayings\" to the same point. And having cited, upon the said account, Matthew 12:43-44; 2 Peter 2:20-21; 1 Corinthians 10:12; Revelation 2:5., he subjoins: \"These and the like sayings, being spoken of regenerate men, testify that they may fall, and that in case they fall against their consciences they please not God unless they be converted.\" Elsewhere thus: \"Whereas it hath been said that sins remain in the regenerate, it is necessary that a difference be made; for certain it is that they who rush into sinful practices against conscience do not continue in grace, nor retain faith, righteousness, or the Holy Spirit; neither can faith stand with an evil purpose of heart against conscience.\" A little after: \"But that they fall from grace, and shed faith and the Holy Spirit, and become guilty of the wrath of God and of eternal punishment, who commit sin against conscience, many sayings\" in the Scriptures \"clearly testify;\" to which purpose he cites Galatians 5:19; 1 Corinthians 6:9, etc. . . . Writing upon the those words of the apostle [Paul], 1 Corinthians 10:12, \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,\"—\"But that in some who had the beginnings of faith, and afterwards falling, return not, that faith of theirs was true before it was lost\" or shaken out, \"the sayings of Peter, 2 Peter 2:20, testifieth.\"\n\nThomas Helwys was one of the joint founders of the Baptist denomination along with John Smyth. After breaking with Smyth in 1610, Helwys wrote \"A Declaration of Faith of English People Remaining at Amsterdam in Holland in 1611.\" Helwys clearly communicates his stance regarding apostasy in point seven of the Declaration:\nMen may fall away from the grace of GOD (Hebrews 12:15) and from the truth, which they have received and acknowledged (Hebrews 10:26) after they have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the HOLY SPIRIT, and have tasted of the good word of GOD, and of the powers of the world to come (Hebrews 6:4, 5). And after they have escaped from the filthiness of the World, may be tangled again therein and overcome (2 Peter 2:20). A righteous man may forsake his righteousness and perish (Ezekiel 18:24, 26). Therefore let no man presume to think that because he has, or once had grace, therefore he shall always have grace. But let all men have assurance, that if they continue to the end, they will be saved. Let no man then presume; but let all work out their salvation with fear and trembling.\n\nSimon Episcopius was the leader of the Remonstrants and primary author of \"The Opinions of the Remonstrants 1618\" and \"The Arminian Confession of 1621.\" In the Confession the Remonstrants were \"persuaded that none is to be easily condemned, or blotted out of the register of Christians who holds fast to faith in Christ, and in hope of the good things promised by him, [and who] seek from the heart to obey his commands . . . .\" Furthermore,\nEven if it is true that those who are adept in the habit of faith and holiness can only with difficulty fall back to their former profaneness and dissoluteness of life (Hebrews 6), yet we believe that it is entirely possible, if not rarely done (Hebrews 6:4; Revelation 2 & 3; 2 Peter 2:18; Ezekiel 18:24; Hebrews 4:1–2; 10:28–29; 10:38–39; 1 Timothy 1:19–20; Romans 11:18) that they fall back little by little and until they completely lack their prior faith and charity. And having abandoned the way of righteousness, they revert to their worldly impurity which they had truly left, returning like pigs to wallowing in the mud and dogs to their vomit, and are again entangled in lusts of the flesh which they had formerly, truly fled. And thus totally and at length also they are finally torn from the grace of God unless they seriously repent in time.\nJohn Goodwin was a Puritan who \"presented the Arminian position of falling away in \"Redemption Redeemed\" (1651).\" Goodwins work was primarily dedicated to refuting the Calvinist doctrine of limited atonement, but he digresses from his main topic and spends 300 pages attempting to disprove the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional perseverance.\n\nApostasy receives allegorical treatment in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Christian and his companion Hopeful, soon after their first encounter with Ignorance, \"entered into a very dark lane, where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with seven strong cords, and were carrying him back to the door that they saw on the side of the Hill.\" Christian believes he recognizes the captive as Turn-Away, who dwells in the town of Apostacy.\n\nThomas Grantham \"was for many years the principal minister among the General Baptists,\" and he wrote \"chiefly in explanation or defense of Baptist sentiments. The largest was a folio volume, entitled \"Christianismus Primitivus\".\" In it he writes,\nThat such who are true believers, even branches of Christ the vine, and that in the account of Christ whom he exhorts to abide in him, or such who have Charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1:5, may nevertheless for want of watchfulness, swerve and turn aside from the same, and become dead branches, cast into the fire, and burned [John 15:6]. But such who add unto their Faith Virtue, and unto Virtue Knowledge, and unto Knowledge Temperance, &c. such shall never fall [2 Peter 1:5–10], for they are kept by the power of God though Faith unto Salvation [1 Peter 1:5].\n\nJohn Jefferson Davis writes,\nIn the treatise \"Predestination Calmly Considered\" Wesley observed that believers might infer from their own experience of grace that it is impossible to finally fall away. Nevertheless, whatever assurance God might give to particular souls \"I find no general promise in holy writ, that none who once believes shall finally fall.\" Scripture, and not personal experience or inferences drawn from it, states Wesley, must be decisive in the matter. In his treatise \"Serious Thoughts on the Perseverance of the Saints\" Wesley allows that the apostle Paul—and many believers today—were fully persuaded of their final perseverance. Nevertheless such an assurance does not prove that every believer will persevere or that every believer enjoys such assurance. Based on his reading of Hebrews 6:4, 6; 10:26–29; 2 Peter 2:20–21 and other NT texts, Wesley is persuaded that a true believer can make shipwreck of his faith and perish everlastingly.\nMichael Fink writes:\nApostasy is certainly a biblical concept, but the implications of the teaching have been hotly debated. The debate has centered on the issue of apostasy and salvation. Based on the concept of God's sovereign grace, some hold that, though true believers may stray, they will never totally fall away. Others affirm that any who fall away were never really saved. Though they may have \"believed\" for a while, they never experienced regeneration. Still others argue that the biblical warnings against apostasy are real and that believers maintain the freedom, at least potentially, to reject God's salvation.\nMcKnight says that \"apostasy ought not to be used as a continual threat so much as an occasional warning of the disaster that Christians may bring upon themselves if they do not examine themselves. As a warning, apostasy can function as a moral injunction that strengthens commitment to holiness as well as the need to turn in complete trust to God in Christ through his Spirit.\" Some argue that the desire for salvation shows one does not have \"an evil, unbelieving heart\" leading to apostasy. As Fink puts it, \"persons worried about apostasy should recognize that conviction of sin in itself is evidence that one has not fallen away.\"\n\n\n\n"}

United States was the first case to challenge the inclusion of \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. currency. The law it challenged was \"31 U.S.C. § 324a \"the inscription 'In God we Trust'...shall appear on all United States currency and coins\".\n\nIn 1970, Stefan Ray Aronow having been found without standing to sue by the District Court, appealed his case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging \"the use of expressions of trust in God by the United States Government on its coinage, currency, official documents and publications. Specifically, the action challenged the constitutionality as repugnant to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of two federal statutes.\"\n\nThe Appeals Court, following the precedent of \"Massachusetts v. Mellon\", agreed with the District Court that the plaintiff did not have standing as \"a taxpayer and citizen\", but set aside the question of standing to rule on the merits of the case.\n\nThe Court ruled:\nIt is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency 'In God We Trust' has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. ...It is not easy to discern any religious significance attendant the payment of a bill with coin or currency on which has been imprinted 'In God We Trust' or the study of a government publication or document bearing that slogan. In fact, such secular uses of the motto was viewed as sacrilegious and irreverent by President Theodore Roosevelt. Yet Congress has directed such uses. While 'ceremonial' and 'patriotic' may not be particularly apt words to describe the category of the national motto, it is excluded from First Amendment significance because the motto has no theological or ritualistic impact. As stated by the Congressional report, it has 'spiritual and psychological value' and 'inspirational quality.'\n\nThe Court cited \"Engel v. Vitale\" which held \nThere is of course nothing in the decision reached here [banning government led prayer in public schools] that is inconsistent with the fact that school children and others are officially encouraged to express love for our country by...Such patriotic or ceremonial occasions bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned religious exercise that the State of New York has sponsored in this instance.\n\nThe Court held the practice was constitutional using the reasoning established in \"McGowan v. Maryland\". The Court maintained that the national motto has no purpose in a coercive power to aid religion - neither on the face of the legislation nor in its operative effect (its practical impact on society).\n\nThe Court also cited the Supreme Court of the United States' decision of \"Walz v. Tax Commission\", quoting \nThe course of constitutional neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line...The general principle deducible from the First Amendment and all that has been said by the Court is this: that we will not tolerate either governmentally established religion or governmental interference with religion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference. ...Adherence to the policy of neutrality that derives from an accommodation of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses has prevented the kind of involvement that would tip the balance toward government control of churches or governmental restraint on religious practice.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the case.\n\nA similar decision was reached by the Fifth Circuit in \"Madalyn Murray O'Hair vs W. Michael Blumenthal\" in 1979, which affirmed that the \"primary purpose of the slogan was secular.\"\n"}

The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unavailing in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. Root's travels, perhaps the first Bahá'í to the region, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil then other countries before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\n\n\"His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God. … Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America ... the republics of the continent of South America—Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, the Guianas, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as Falkland Islands, the Galapagòs, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and Trinidad...\"\n\nFollowing the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America.\n\nShoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\n\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\nFollowing the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.\n\nParaguayan Maria Casati met some of these Bahá'ís in Buenos Aires, Argentina and converted to the religion in 1939. The first pioneer to arrive in Paraguay was Elizabeth Cheney in December 1940. Cheney describes that many of the people she thought to be introduced to were in jail when she arrived. However through word-of-mouth from a few she was able to gather a group of 30 of social prominence and interested in universal peace which mentioned the religion and avoid negative connotations (for example by use of the word universal vs international when describing the kind of peace Bahá'ís were interested in.) The group first met by January 1941 and a youth group was meeting by June despite social upset from the period before World War II and President Morínigo. Indeed, Cheney had rented her apartment from Sra. Leonar de Morínigo with whom she had shared Bahá'í principles to know what kind of meetings would take place - who in turn defended the religion from accusations by September from a local catholic priest. Cheney did not seek out publicity because of the social conflict going on and her experience of events in Argentina. She also emphasized sincerity, patience, and a universal quality of showing love for all people to encourage the same among the group and beware of showing any sense of superiority whether from nationalism or a self-consciousness in the role of bringing the religion to people. Come September 15 adults expressed interest in taking part in a further class on the religion. Cheney also began English language classes modeled after Lidia Zamenhof's advice as well use using stories about the religion as the medium for learning the language in addition to the meetings directly for those wanting to learn more about the religion. One member of the group attended an International Conference of Progressive Education by October in the States and through contact with the Cheney was invited to Louhelen Bahá'í School. But come November Cheney was taken ill and left Paraguay. On returning to the States she took up work in Race Amity meetings with Louis G. Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker and publishing.\n\nShoghi Effendi called for further strengthening of the community in 1943 The first to come back to Paraguay was Gertrude Eisenberg in spring 1943. The next pioneer to come was Virginia Orbison in September 1943 after helping to found an Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in Chile. When Orbison arrived in addition to Eisenberg there was another Bahá'í of the group who had already acknowledged himself as a Bahá'í in the interim and two more of the original group converted at the first meeting Orbison attended in September. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Paraguay was elected in Asunción in 1944. An All-American Convention was held in 1944, and actor , counted as the first Bahá'í of Paraguay, was a delegate, (and Cheney was able to visit the convention.) Cheney returned to Paraguay in 1945 to find a community of 26 Bahá'ís and so she moved to Nicaragua in October Eisenberg moved in November. A regional committee overseeing pioneers was appointed in 1946 - one for Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay together. The first South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in Buenos Aires in November, 1946 with representatives R. Centurion Miranda and Josephine Pla from Paraguay.\n\nRetrospectively, a stated purpose for the regional committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. By 1950 there was still an assembly in Asunción. However, by November 1950 Sheila Rice-Wray transferred her pioneering effort to Paraguay in 1950 where an emergency election was held for vacancies to assure representation to the first South American Bahá'í Convention. Rice-Way was able to \"reactivate\" members of the Asunción community. She was also joined by Esteban Canales in November. Both Rice-Way and Canales were delegates to the South American convention to elect the regional assembly. When the regional National Assembly of South America was elected in 1951 the members included Paraguayan Esteban Canales. In 1953 translations of Bahá'í literature were made into Guarani. In August 1954 Ellen Sims arrived as another pioneer in Paraguay. In November 1955 the Bahá'ís of Paraguay dedicated their permanent Bahá'í Headquarters with an hour-long program with talks in Guarani, Spanish and English, slides and pictures of Bahá'í building and Shrines around the world, and book displays.\n\nThe regional assembly was reorganized in 1957 to be made up of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay & Bolivia. Among its members was Miranda of Paraguay 1958 saw the first Bahá'í summer school. The 1958 convention gathered twenty-four delegates in Asuncion from the five countries, including black, white, and Indian races as delegates as well as European and American pioneers. The elected members of the regional national assembly were Jose Mielnik, Athas Costas, Salvador Torma, Roberto Cazcarra, Roque Centurion Miranda, Else Cazcarra, Fabienne Guillon, Mary Binda, and Ellen Sims. 1958 also saw the purchase of the land to one day host the Bahá'í Temple of Paraguay. 1960 saw the election of the local assembly of Encarnación. 1960 also saw the first visit of a Hand of the Cause, Dr. Hermann Grossmann. In 1961 each country of the regional assembly elected its own National Spiritual Assembly. Paraguay's national convention was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, Dr. Ramatu'llah Muhajir. At the convention Dr. Muhajir and the delegates drew up plans for reaching the Indian populations as well as ways to reinforce the communities that already existed. The members of Paraguay's first National Spiritual Assembly were Asadu'llah Akbari, Keihamosh Azampanah, A. Azampanah, Angelica E. deDoldcán, Rosa de Haterza, Luis Van Strate, Rezsi Sunshine, Anibal Torres, Francisco Haterza. By 1963 there were Local Spiritual Assemblies in Asunción, Concepción, and Encarnación as well as a smaller group in Pedro Juan Caballero and members of the community also included some of the Caygüa (Kadiweu?) people. The first Native American Bahá'í of Paraguay, Rosendo Segundo, joined the religion in 1964. Segundo was a member of a Guarani tribe, the Chaco\n. In 1965 actual contact with the Chaco tribe began. In 1966 a Paraguayan pioneer reached a goal location - Ushuaia. By 1968 there were 8 local assemblies and in 1969 members of the Chulupi speaking and Lengua tribes had converted to the religion and first all-Indian institute in northern Gran Chaco area, in Paraguay with members of the Guarani, Guasurango, (a Tapieté speaking) and Chulupi attending. In 1970 the first Yanaigua (another Tapieté speaking) tribe member joined the religion and that year was first time an indigenous Bahá'í was elected to the national assembly, (in 1982 there were three indigenous members of the national assembly.) And in 1977 a radio campaign began.\n\nAs recently as 1980 there have been pioneers to Paraguay. Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In 1980 the Paraguayan community established 4 training schools (1 was already functioning) in rural areas. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. In 1986 the Bahá'ís established an agricultural training program with seeds, tools and training. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Some more recent events Bahá'ís in Paraguay have undertaken include participating in international surveys from 1983 inquiring about activities organized during the United Nations Decade for Women to achieve equality of rights, privileges, and responsibilities for both sexes, as well as to report on obstacles that these communities had faced - responses from Paraguay noted women participated \"without restriction in consultation and decision-making\" in the local and national administrative functions of the Bahá'í community where \"women both vote and are elected.\" Then the community hosted the first International Women's Conference of Paraguay in July 1988 with over 100 in attendance. During this period, Bahá'ís also had children's classes underway. In 1999 Jose Luis Gadea became a member of the International Environment Forum. A series of large youth gatherings were undertaken in 2000 throughout the Americas, beginning in Paraguay in January with a focus to galvanize the youth to address protracted social conflicts such as race and class prejudice, corruption, violence, poverty, and social injustice afflicting their countries. In 2002 former member of the Universal House of Justice David Hofman visited the Paraguayan Bahá'ís and noted a possible role for the Bahá'í Training Institutes. Eighty five Bahá'ís from Paraguay including Marcos Galeano of Asuncion and Romina P.C. Torres were among those attending the regional conference called for by the Universal House of Justice in 2008 held in São Paulo.\n\nThough various agencies report the size of the community numbers in the thousands, the state census does not count it. The community was noticed on US. Department of State records. The 2001 Association of Religion Data Archives review showed some 10,600 Bahá'ís. Operation World estimated some 5,500 and also suggest a rate of growth second only to Islam, and having numbers about twice those of Islam.\n\n\n"}

Buddhism is now the third largest religion in Bangladesh with about 0.7% of population adhering to Theravada Buddhism. Over 65% of the Buddhist population is concentrated in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region, where Buddhism the predominant faith of the Chakma, Marma, Tanchangya, other Jumma people and the Barua, while the remaining 35% of the population are from the Bengali Buddhist community. Buddhist communities are present in the urban centers of Bangladesh, particularly Chittagong and Dhaka.\n\nAs of 2014, followers of Buddhism are mainly people of Baruas living in Chittagong city, the business city of Bangladesh and indigenous Arakanese descent living in the sub-tropical Chittagong Hill Tracts. People who follow Buddhism in Bangladesh belong to the Barua people in majority with the percentage of 65% among the 0.07% population of Bangladesh, Chakma, Chak, Marma, Tanchangya and the Khyang, who had been since time immemorial have practiced Buddhism. Other tribes, notably those who practice Animism, have come under some Buddhist influence, and this is true in the case of the Khumi and the Mru, and to a lesser extent on the other tribes.\n\nLegend said that Gautama Buddha came to the region to spread Buddhism, and it was speculated that one or two individuals became monks to follow in his footsteps. However, Buddhism did not gain much support until the reign of Asoka when Buddhism gained a toehold. The Pala Empire that controlled the Indian subcontinent spread many Buddhist ideologies in modern Bangladesh and built many monasteries such as the Mahasthangarh and the Somapura Mahavihara. During the Pala Dynasty, a famous teacher named Atisha was born in the city of Bikrampur and spread Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nChandra Dynasty's Puranchandra and Subarnachandra adopted Buddhism, as did their successors Trailokyachandra and Srichandra who ruled Harikel and Chandradwip (Barisal). The Khadga Dynasty was a Buddhist dynasty of kings that carried the surname Bhatt. They made several temples and monasteries. King Rajabhata was for example a very committed Mahayanist Buddhist. \n\nBuddhism in various forms appears to have been prevalent at the time of the Turkish conquest in 1202. The invading armies apparently found numerous monasteries, which they destroyed. With the destruction of centers of Buddhist learning, such as Nalanda University, Buddhism rapidly disintegrated. In subsequent centuries and up through the 1980s nearly all the remaining Buddhists lived in the region around Chittagong, which had not been entirely conquered until the time of the British Raj (1858–1947). During the 19th century, a revival movement developed that led to the development of two orders of Theravada monks, the Sangharaj Nikaya and the Mahasthabir Nikaya.\n\nIn the Chittagong Hills, Buddhist tribes formed the majority of the population, and their religion appeared to be a mixture of tribal beliefs and Buddhist doctrines. According to the 1981 census, there were approximately 538,000 Buddhists in Bangladesh, representing less than 1 percent of the population.\n\n\nThere are several monasteries in the Chittagong, and in most Buddhist villages there is a school (kyong) where boys live and learn to read Bengali (national language) and some Pali (an ancient Buddhist scriptural language). It is common for men who have finished their schooling to return at regular intervals for periods of residence in the school. The local Buddhist shrine is often an important center of village life.\n\nBuddhism outside the monastic retreats has absorbed and adapted indigenous popular creeds and beliefs of the regions to which it has spread. In most areas religious ritual focuses on the image of the Buddha, and the major festivals observed by Buddhists in Bangladesh commemorate the important events of his life. Although doctrinal Buddhism rejects the worship of gods and preserves the memory of the Buddha as an enlightened man, popular Buddhism contains a pantheon of gods and lesser deities headed by the Buddha.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs provides assistance for the maintenance of Buddhist places of worship and relics. The ancient monasteries at Paharpur (in Rajshahi Region) and Mainamati (in Comilla Region), dating from the seventh to ninth century A.D., are considered unique for their size and setting and are maintained as state-protected monuments.\n\n\n\nDeputy secretary and above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12181656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12181656", "title": "Buddhist influences on Christianity", "text": "Buddhist influences on Christianity\n\nSome scholars believe that there exist significant Buddhist influences on Christianity reaching back to Christianity's earliest days. Buddhism was known in the pre-Christian Greek world, and hence the later Roman Empire, through the campaigns of Alexander the Great (see Greco-Buddhism and Greco-Buddhist monasticism). Several prominent early Christian fathers (Clement of Alexandria and St. Jerome) were certainly aware of the Buddha, even mentioning him in their works. The notion of Buddhist influence in early Christian history, however, remains controversial.\n\nSome historians such as Jerry H. Bentley and Elaine Pagels suggest that there is a possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity\". There have also been suggestions of an indirect path in which Indian Buddhism may have influenced Gnosticism and then Christianity. Some scholars hold that the suggested similarities are coincidental since parallel traditions may emerge in different cultures.\n\nIn the East, the syncretism between Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism was deep and widespread along the Silk Road, and was especially pronounced in the medieval Church of the East in China. There are also historical documents showing the syncretic nature of Christianity and Buddhism in Asia such as the Jesus Sutras and Nestorian Stele.\n\nDespite suggestions of surface level analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have inherent and fundamental differences at the deepest levels, such as monotheism's place at the core of Christianity and Buddhism's orientation towards non-theism. The majority of modern scholars who have studied both Buddhism and Christianity hold that there is no direct historical evidence of any influence by Buddhism on early Christianity. Scholars generally consider any such influence implausible given that first century Jews are highly unlikely to have been open to far eastern concepts that appeared opposed to some of their basic beliefs.\n\nWill Durant, noting that the Emperor Ashoka sent missionaries, not only to elsewhere in India and to Sri Lanka, but to Syria, Egypt and Greece, first speculated in the 1930s that they may have helped prepare the ground for Christian teaching. Buddhism was prominent in the eastern Greek world (Greco-Buddhism) and became the official religion of the eastern Greek successor kingdoms to Alexander the Great's empire (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) and Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE)). Several prominent Greek Buddhist missionaries are known (Mahadharmaraksita and Dharmaraksita) and the Indo-Greek king Menander I converted to Buddhism, and is regarded as one of the great patrons of Buddhism. (See Milinda Panha.) Some modern historians have suggested that the pre-Christian monastic order in Egypt of the Therapeutae is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word \"Theravāda,\" a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have \"almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism\". They may even have been descendants of Asoka's emissaries to the West. It is true that Buddhist gravestones from the Ptolemaic period have also been found in Alexandria in Egypt, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel, showing the Buddhists were living in Hellenistic Egypt at the time Christianity began. The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria has led one author to note: \"It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established\".\nThe early church father Clement of Alexandria (died 215 AD) was also aware of Buddha, writing in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): \"The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called \"Hylobii\" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of Buddha (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours.\"\n\nNicolaus of Damascus, and other ancient writers, relate that in AD 13, at the time of Augustus (died AD 14), he met in Antioch (near present day Antakya in Turkey just over 300 miles from Jerusalem) an embassy with a letter written in Greek from the Southern India Pandya Empire was delivered while Caesar was in the Island of Samos. This embassy was accompanied by a sage who later, naked, anointed and contented, burnt himself to death at Athens. The details of his tomb inscription specified he was a Shramana, \"his name was Zarmanochegas\", he was an Indian native of Bargosa, and \"immortalized himself according to the custom of his country.\" Cassius Dio and Plutarch cite the same story. Historian Jerry H. Bentley (1993) notes \"the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity\" and that scholars \"have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus\".\n\nIn 1894, the book \"The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ\" by Nicolas Notovitch introduced the idea that an adult Jesus traveled to India and was influenced by Buddhism before starting his ministry in Galilee. The book was widely disseminated and became the basis of other theories. Notovitch's theory was controversial from the beginning and was widely criticized. Once his story had been re-examined by historians, Notovitch confessed to having fabricated the evidence.\n\nMost scholars believe there is no historical evidence of any influence by Buddhism on Christianity, Paula Fredriksen stating that no serious scholarly work has placed the origins of Christianity outside the backdrop of 1st century Palestinian Judaism. Leslie Houlden states that although modern parallels between the teachings of Jesus and Buddha have been drawn, these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century and there is no historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus.\n\nOther scholars such as Eddy and Boyd state that there is no evidence of a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century monotheistic Galilean Jews would not have been open to what they would have seen as pagan stories. The Macmillan \"Encyclopedia of Buddhism\" states that theories of influences of Buddhism on early Christianity are without historical foundation.\n\nModern scholarship has roundly rejected any historical basis for the travels of Jesus to India or Tibet or influences between the teachings of Christianity and Buddhism, and has seen the attempts at parallel symbolism as cases of parallelomania which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances.\n\nThere are inherent and fundamental differences between Buddhism and Christianity, one significant element being that while Christianity is at its core monotheistic and relies on a god as a creator, while Buddhism is generally non-theistic and rejects the notion of a Creator God which provides divine values for the world.\n\nThe central iconic imagery of the two traditions underscore the difference in their belief structure, when the peaceful death of Gautama Buddha at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the crucifixion of Jesus as a willing sacrifice for the atonement for the sins of humanity. Buddhist scholars such as Masao Abe see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the two belief systems.\n\nClement of Alexandria referred to Buddhists and wrote:\n\nEarly 3rd–4th century Christian writers such as Hippolytus and Epiphanius write of one Scythianus who visited India around 50 CE, whence he brought the \"doctrine of the Two Principles\". Scythianus' pupil Terebinthus supposedly presented himself as a \"Buddha\" (\"he called himself Buddas\" Cyril of Jerusalem) and became well known in Judaea and was said to have conversed with the apostles and to have brought books back from his trade with India. The same author says his books and knowledge were taken over by Mani, and became the foundation of the Manichean doctrine.\n\nSaint Jerome (4th century CE) mentions that the Buddhist belief of Buddha's birth from a virgin as their \"opinion [...] authoritatively handed down that Budda, the founder of their religion, had his birth through the side of a virgin,\" (the Buddha was, according to Buddhist tradition, born from the hip of his mother). It has been suggested that this virgin birth legend of Buddhism influenced Christianity.\n\nGnosticism comprised a number of small Christian sects which existed in the 2nd-5th centuries, and were rejected by mainstream Christians as heretics. There were some contacts between Gnostics and Indians, e.g. Syrian gnostic theologian Bar Daisan describes in the 3rd century his exchanges with missions of holy men from India (Greek: Σαρμαναίοι, Sramanas), passing through Syria on their way to Elagabalus or another Severan dynasty Roman Emperor. His accounts are quoted by Porphyry (De abstin., iv, 17 ) and Stobaeus (Eccles., iii, 56, 141).\n\nThis has given rise to suggestions by Zacharias P. Thundy that Buddhist tradition may have influenced Gnosticism and hence Christianity. Thundy has also considered possible influences through the Jewish sect Therapeutae, which he suggests could have been Buddhists in the first century.\n\nHowever, Gnosticism was harshly rejected by Christians and c. 180 Irenaeus wrote against them at length in his \"On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis\", generally called \"Against Heresies\". By the third century non-Christian Indians were also considered heretics by the Christians who condemned their practices.\n\nElaine Pagels has encouraged research into the impact of Buddhism on Gnosticism, but she holds that although intriguing, the evidence of any influence is inconclusive. She further concludes that these parallels might be coincidental since parallel traditions may emerge in different cultures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9528461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9528461", "title": "Cité catholique", "text": "Cité catholique\n\nThe Cité Catholique is a Traditionalist Catholic organisation created in 1946 by Jean Ousset, originally a follower of Charles Maurras (founder of the monarchist \"Action Française\" in 1899) and Jean Masson (1910–1965), not to be confused (as F. Venner did) with Jacques Desoubrie, who also used the pseudonym Jean Masson. Despite the presence of Roman Catholic clergy in some of its meetings, the \"Cité catholique\" is not officially recognised by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIt first took the name of \"Oeuvres de la Cité Catholique\" (Works of the Catholic City) and then of \"Office international des Oeuvres de formation civique et d'action culturelle selon le droit naturel et chrétien\" (ICTUS, International Office of Works of Civic Formation and Cultural Action According to Natural Christian Law) before being known under the name \"Cité Catholique\". It is now presided by Jacques Trémollet de Villers, a former associate of the far-right politician Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour and former defence attorney for accused war criminal Paul Touvier. The Cité catholique also helped found in 1971 the pro-life NGO \"Laissez-les-vivre\". Jean-Paul Bolufer, a former alumni of the ENA and who was the chief of staff of Christine Boutin, Minister of Housing and the City, before being forced to resign, and close to the Opus Dei, was trained by \"Cité catholique\".\n\nAn advance party of the Cité catholique arrived in Argentina in 1958, in the middle of the Algerian War (1954–62) and after the military deposed Juan Perón in 1955. The Cité Catholique brought to Argentina a doctrine of counter-revolutionary warfare and repression against terrorism, justified as part of Thomist dogmatism. They would thus provide the ideological support of the future \"Dirty War\" carried out by the Argentine military in the 1970s.\n\nMany members of the group had taken part in the pro-\"French Algeria\" OAS terrorist group created in Madrid, which attempted to block the implementation of the March 1962 Évian Accords and also tried several times to assassinate General Charles de Gaulle, whom the French far-right felt had deceived them. Following the dismantlement of the OAS and execution of some of its members, the OAS chaplain, Fr. Georges Grasset, organised the flight of OAS members, from a route going from Paris to Franquist Spain and finally to Argentina. Grasset arrived in 1962 in Buenos Aires to take charge of the Argentine branch of the Cité Catholique.\n\nCharles Lacheroy, a member of this group, was the first person to reflect on the reasons behind the 1954 French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, which all but put an end to the Indochina War (1946–54). Roger Trinquier, who theorised the systemic use of torture in counter-insurgency in \"Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency\" (1961), was also a member of this organisation. \n\nAlong with Colonel Jean Gardes, chief French expert in psychological warfare, Jean Ousset developed the concept of \"subversion\". According to Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky, \"this conceived a protean, quintessential enemy who, rather than being defined by his actions, was seen as a force trying to subvert Christian order, natural law or the Creator's plan.\" According to Ousset, \"the revolutionary apparatus is ideological before it is political, and political before it is military.\"\n\nIn \"Le Marxisme-Léninisme\", Jean Ousset wrote that Marxists could only be combatted by \"a profound faith, an unlimited obedience to the Holy Father, and a thorough knowledge of the Church's doctrines.\" The first translated version of this book was in Spanish, published in Argentina in 1961 and for which Antonio Caggiano, Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1965, wrote a prologue, where he thanked the \"men of \"La Ciudad Católica\" of Argentina.\" In this prologue, Caggiano explained that Marxism was born of \"the negation of Christ and his Church put into practice by the Revolution\" and spoke of a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to \"prepare for the decisive battle,\" although the enemy had not yet \"taken up arms.\" The Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky commented this: \"As often happens in a continent that imports ideas, the doctrine of annihilation preceded that of the revolutionary uprising.\" Caggiano compared this vigilance to the one that preceded the 1571 Battle of Lepanto \"to save Europe from domination by the Turks.\" Ousset's book also included a list of the papal bulls condemning communism.\n\nColonel Jean Gardes arrived in Argentina in 1963. Her daughter showed in 2003 to French journalist Marie-Monique Robin notes from her father, which show that in March 1963, a naval lieutenant commander, Federico Lucas Roussillon, offered Gardes Argentine government protection if he would deliver counter-insurgency courses at the ESMA, the Navy Mechanic Schools. In 1955, then Lieutenant Roussillon took part in the \"Revolución Libertadora\", the Catholic nationalist movement led by Eduardo Lonardi which overthrew Juan Domingo Perón. Major Juan Francisco Guevara, one of Lonardi's general staff, proposed that the conspirational password be \"God is Just.\" Roussillon became in 1963 a member of the Naval intelligence service, and retired in 1979 with the rank of Captain. Soon after Gardes met Roussillon, the Cadets at the ESMA were shown the film \"The Battle of Algiers\", which described one of the first counter-insurgency battles, during which General Marcel Bigeard and Jacques Massu made a systemic use of torture, the block warden system, and death flights (dubbed \"Crevettes Bigeard\", or \"Bigeard's Shrimps\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40573990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40573990", "title": "Criticism of Sikhism", "text": "Criticism of Sikhism\n\nSikhism has been criticized in one way or another by proponents of other theories. These critics include both Sikhs and non-Sikhs under different motives. These criticisms extend across a large portion of the beliefs and practices of Sikhism and even question the authenticity of the origin of the faith. As a result, Sikhs continue to face discrimination due to their presence and past activities.\n\nScholar William Hewat McLeod cited the tension between the doctrine of God's transcendence in Sikhism and a supposed ability of God to communicate with people. McLeod says Sikh thinkers have been unable to give a convincing account of how God can communicate with people at all if this being is indeed transcendent. Although, this is what makes Sikh teachings different from other schools of thought i.e., that God is transcendental, formless and infinite but still can communicate to people as if a physical being.\n\nHindu leader Dayanand Saraswati, in his book \"Satyarth Prakash\", criticized Sikhism, describing Guru Nanak as a \"rogue\", the hymns of the Guru Granth Sahib as falsehood, and Sikhism as a snare to rob and cheat simple folk of their wealth and property. A Sikh wrote a response, to which Dayanand Saraswati answered that his opinion had undergone a change when he visited Punjab, and the remarks about Sikhism would be deleted in the subsequent edition of his work. However, these remarks were never removed after the untimely death of Dayanand Saraswati, and later editions of \"Satyarth Prakash\" were even more critical of Sikhism.\n\nErnest Trumpp had concluded that Adi Granth was not worth translating in full--\"the same few ideas, he thought, being endlessly repeated,\" and referring to the heterogeneous language (mostly Sadhukkadi or Saint's tongue, a mixture of Indian dialects, used by saints to preach in North India) that consisted of various dialects, he described the text as \"incoherent and shallow in the extreme, and couched at the same time in dark and perplexing language, in order to cover these defects. It is for us Occidentals a most painful and almost stupefying task, to read only a single Rag.\" Even for Sikhs the language of the Guru Granth Sahib is considered archaic and hard to understand without an interpreter. Trumpp viewed Adi Granth to be lacking theological transcendence and lacking systematic unity. He also stated that the injunctions of the Rehit-nama, authored by Prahlad Singh (a close associate of Guru Gobind Singh), regarding Sikh relations with Muslims, showed \"a narrow-minded bigotry and a deep fanatical hatred.\"\n\nRegarding the Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhs written by the 10th Guru Gobind Singh, there is much controversy among Sikh scholars regarding its authorship. There are also references in the text to multiple gods such as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Govind and Chandi, included in such compositions as the Chandi di Var of the 5th chapter of the text. This has led to the text being described as having \"fluid boundaries between polytheism and monotheism.\" Some Sikhs also believe the text promotes sexual promiscuity (including multiple references to group sex), degrades women and also encourages use of intoxicants.\n\nSikhism defines the concept of one God as Ek Onkar. While the concept of monotheism was already taught in the Vedas, other later scriptures such as Bhagavad Gita, Torah, Quran, that came about long before the religion of Sikhism. However, it has been suggested that Sikhism's monotheism differs from other religions. According to Ernest Trumpp, the Sikh theology of God is \"far closer in conception to the pantheistic traditions of Hinduism than the monotheistic perspective of Christianity.\"\n\nGuru Nanak opposed polytheistic practices. According to a legend, Nanak during his trip to Mecca had debate with mullahs of Mecca, in his debate, Nanak had asserted that the Kaaba was only a black stone, which is Lingam, of Lord Shiva. However it has been alleged that later gurus of Sikhism added the practices that can be linked with polytheism, most notably waving fans over Guru Granth Sahib during worship. Sikhism also permits the veneration and Intercession of saints (such as to the Sikh martyr Bhai Maharaj Singh) and views its Gurus as the \"embodiment of Divine Light\" and \"Divine in Spirit\", which are seen by some religious groups as forms of polytheism.\n\nOne view of Sikhism is that it is a syncretism of Hinduism (particularly the Bhakti movement) and Islam (particularly Sufism), having evolved from Hinduism in the context of a multiplicity of syncretic movements in Medieval India, while taking the idea of monotheism from Islam, as well as the incorporation of selected hymns from Hindu and Muslim saints (such as Kabir, Fariduddin Ganjshakar and other Bhagat) into the Guru Granth Sahib. This view was commonly believed, but is outdated within scholarship. \n\nAccording to Harjot Oberoi, until the 19th century the Sikhs had shown \"little collective interest in distinguishing themselves from the Hindus\" and \"Sikh notions of time, space, corporality, holiness, kinship, social distinctions, purity and pollution and commensality were hardly different from those of the Hindus.\" The Sikh belief in Reincarnation is also often used as proof of the syncretic influence of Hinduism on Sikhism, although that belief in reincarnation also existed in other Indian religions, including Buddhism and Jainism before the conception of Sikhism.\n\nThe cutting or removal of hair from any body part (including nose hair, ear hair, facial hair and pubic hair) is strictly forbidden for Sikhs. This growing of ones hair is known as Kesh. However, the practice is a common source of criticism and questioning of Sikhism, including the belief that not cutting ones hair will cause it to grow to unacceptably long lengths. Non-amritdhari young women, especially, often express criticism of the forbiddance to cut hair as being too demanding and restrictive.\n\nSikhism has been criticised for the perception that it is an ethnoreligious group, which has seemingly very limited appeal and following beyond those claiming ancestry from the Indian subcontinent — especially the Punjab region and its surrounds, such as among the Jat Sikh and Sikh Khatris. South Asia alone accounts for up to 90% of the total Sikh population and approximately 75% of all Sikhs live in Punjab, India. Sikhism does not actively proselytize, and discourages it, perhaps explaining the homogeneous nature of the religion.\n\nSimilar to other religions, Sikhism (and its adherents) has been accused of violence, or the glorification thereof, through its history (such as the militarisation of the Khalsa), symbols (such as the Khanda), art and legend. However this has been rejected by David C. Rapoport: \"It would be convenient to say that the prestige of violent symbols in the Sikh religion has increased Sikhs' propensity for violent action, or that the Sikh religion is violent because Sikhs as a people are violent, but i do not think either of these arguments can be made very convincingly.\" Sikhs believe that violence is acceptable as a last resort and that weapons are sacred as they are seen as means to fight so called evil forces or tyrants.\n\nThe tenth Guru was an avid hunter, noting in his autobiography his success in killing antelope, elk, bears, and lions. He is often portrayed with his hunting hawk and hunting dogs, and regarded as a huntsman. Louis E. French conjectures that Guru Gobind Singh may have hunted, as was common among Mughal rulers, \"to demonstrate his own physical and tactical prowess, to familiarize himself with the lay of the land, and to gather intelligence through networks of his own equivalent of the famous harkāre\"\n\nSikh groups have put pressure on universities, and there has been a movement among some Sikhs to stifle academic criticism of Sikhism in North America.\n\nThere is a history of tension between Sikhism and Islam. This goes back to the persecution of Sikhs by the Mughal emperors in India, but has manifested in more recent distrust between the communities in the UK, including hostility to inter-community romantic relationships.\n\nPrior to the 1947 Partition of India promises of a Sikh majority state were outlined, however following the divide of India and the creation of Pakistan, renegation on such promises was the approach taken by the Indian government of the time. Following this, the actions occurring in Operation Blue Star which were seen as atrocities by Sikhs, led to worldwide protests and renewed demands for a separate nation as was previously promised, they called it \"Khalistan movement\", during this movement, some Sikhs had been involved in retaliatory-terrorism, the most well-known incident being Air India Flight 182, in which 268 Canadian citizens died. Many of the Sikh groups were banned from the numerous countries, who had been convicted with terrorist activities. Due to such negative impact, the support for Khalistan Movement has been commonly regarded as act of terrorism, many have been arrested for affirming support for the movement.\n\nThe present situation in Punjab is usually regarded as a cautionary tension with elements of peace; and the militant movement (Khalistan) has been weakened.\n\nIn 2004, France had passed the law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools, which banned many religious signs in schools. This ban most notably included turbans, a religious garment and central characteristic of Sikh religious code and practice. Since the number of Sikhs in France is a small minority, the French education minister claimed ignorance of the consequences such an act would have for the Sikh population residing in France. This law led to Sikhs protesting against the law across Europe, India, as well as other regions. This issue is heatedly debated as exploitation of secularism appears to infringe on the universal right and principal - freedom of expression. European Court of Human Rights dismissed the petition. Although UN's human right body supported the petition in January 2012, citing that turbans do not pose a threat to ground security.\n\nIn Canada, a 2013 poll concluded that 39% of Canadians had a negative view of Sikhism, second after Islam, which was negatively viewed by 54%.\n\n"}

It is commonly known as the \"Snoa\" (short for esnoga, an old Portuguese and Ladino word for synagogue) and is a major tourist attraction in Curaçao, with one notable group of visitors including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and her family, in 1992.\n\nThe community (congregation \"Mikvé Israel\") dates from the 1650s, and consisted of Spanish and Portuguese Jews from the Netherlands and Brazil. In the nineteenth century there was a breakaway Reform community (Emanu El); the two merged to form the present community in 1964. The community is now affiliated with Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nThe first synagogue building was purchased in 1674; the current building dates from 1730. One visitor to the synagogue observed, upon entering through a quiet courtyard, viewing the azure stained glass windows and walking across a sand covered floor toward the carved mahogany Holy Ark that the sand floors remind congregants \"of how its Jewish ancestors on the Iberian peninsula covered the floors of their makeshift prayer houses so that their footsteps would be muffled and the suspicion of potential denouncers would not be aroused.\" With its three high vaulted ceilings, the Holy Ark and the pulpit, the galleries, the benches and the chandeliers, the interior of the synagogue bears a marked resemblance to the Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam. Attached to the synagogue is the Jewish Historical Cultural Museum, whose collection includes replicas of artistic tombstones from the Beit Chaim Bleinheim in Curaçao, the oldest Jewish cemetery still in use in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe other Dutch island in the Caribbean with a historical synagogue is Sint Eustatius, where the ruins of the Honen Dalim synagogue of 1739 still stand impressively on the 'Synagoge Pad'. An even older synagogue existed at Jodensavanne, Suriname, \"Beracha ve Shalom\" (\"Blessings and Peace\"), built between 1665 and 1671. Unlike the Curaçao synagogue, however, these other synagogues are no longer in use.\n"}

The other highway was the Uttarapatha or the great northern road that ran from Taxila in Afganisthan, through the modern Punjab up to the western coast of Yamuna. Following the course of Yamuna it went southwards up to Mathura, from there it passed on to Ujjain in Malwa and to Broach on western coast. According to \"Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography\" by Sanjeev Sanyal, the trajectory of the northern road has remained roughly the same from pre-Mauryan times and is now NH2. However, the southern road appears to have drifted. Rama's route into exile in the epic may have been an early version of the road, but by the time of Buddha it started at Varanasi and ran through Vidisha in central India, to Pratishthana (Paithan). It probably extended all the way to Chola, Chera and Pandya kingdoms of the extreme south. By the Mauryan period there would have been a branch from Ujjain to the ports of Gujarat. This made Ujjain a major city by Gupta times. Today Dakshinapatha is known as NH7, which runs much further east of the old road but still meets NH2 at Varanasi.\n\n\n"}

He contributed three books on eschatology: \"Paradise Restored\" (1985), \"The Days of Vengeance\" (1987), and \"The Great Tribulation\" (1987).\n\nHis book \"Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider\" (1981) was a response to Ronald J. Sider's best-selling book, \"Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger: A Biblical Study\" (1977), which promoted various programs of wealth redistribution by the government. Chilton argued that the Bible either does not authorize such programs or explicitly teaches against them.\n\nHis book \"Power in the Blood: A Christian Response to AIDS\" (1987) was primarily dealing with the Church's relationship with the world.\n\nDavid Chilton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1951. At the age of one, he moved with his Christian missionary parents to the Philippines. At the age of 8, the family returned to the United States where his father became a pastor in Southern California. Growing up in California in the 1970s youth movement and hippie culture, he experienced a conversion to Christianity while listening to a missionary speak at his father's church. He began reading the Bible and teaching Bible studies. The young Chilton consequently became deeply involved in the nascent Jesus People movement, and started a singing group with his sister Jayn and some friends called The Children of Light. He frequently spoke, performed music, and taught Bible studies at Christian coffeehouses in Los Angeles, California region. He was ordained in the Jesus People Movement by Pat Boone.\n\nChilton came to prominence as a writer for the Chalcedon Report edited by R.J. Rushdoony after a Christian friend recommended one of Rushdoony's books. At the same time, Chilton discovered the writings of the Puritans, and was exposed for the first time to Reformed theology as a result of reading these books, and to the doctrines of predestination, election, and perseverance of the saints. After meeting Rushdoony, Chilton was asked to write a monthly column for Chalcedon Report while alternating speaking for Dr. Rushdoony at his church in Hollywood (which was affiliated with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) while pastoring a church in Anaheim, California. At this time Chilton was also influenced by fellow Christian Reconstructionists Greg Bahnsen and James B. Jordan. He married his wife, Darlene, and had 3 children, Nathan, Jacob, and Abigail.\n\nIn 1981, after several years of pastoring in Anaheim, Chilton wrote his first book, \"Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider\" over the course of a month with a pencil and paper at a coffeehouse. Not long after the completion of the book, he moved to Placerville, CA to pastor a church for a year, during which he wrote a newsletter for Christian teachers and homeschoolers called The Biblical Educator. Chilton also used his influence to help launch World Magazine with Joel Belz and wrote a monthly column for the publication for years, which was very popular.\n\nAlthough Chilton loved the people of Placerville and did not want to leave, he accepted a job offer from prominent Reconstructionist (and Rushdoony son-in-law) Gary North as a research assistant at The Institute for Christian Economics in Tyler, Texas. It was during his three-year stay in Texas that North commissioned Chilton to write his two books for North's imprint Dominion Press: Paradise Restored and Days of Vengeance.\n\nIn 1986 Chilton accepted an offer to return to Placerville to pastor the church there. He continued to work in pastoral ministry, speak at conferences, write a weekly column for The Sacramento Union newspaper, was counsel for The Fieldstead Co. at an economic conference in Switzerland and wrote his last two books, The Great Tribulation and Power in the Blood.\n\nWhitefield Theological Seminary awarded him with 2 degrees: The Master of Divinity in the field of Pastoral Theology in 1990 and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the field of Christian Thought in 1992, primarily for his work on Days of Vengeance.\n\nIn 1994, Chilton suffered a massive heart attack and went into a six-week coma. He slowly began to recover, though he had difficulty speaking. During this time, he wrote a monthly column on the family for Ligonier Ministries. He took his second speaking trip to Australia for a month of engagements and also spoke at a church in The Bahamas.\n\nIn 1997, Chilton suffered his second heart attack and died at the age of 45 years.\n\n"}

It sits at a height of above sea level and its surface area covers hectares. The registered population of the village is around 500, predominantly Druze. Actual residents may number only around 250, distributed among about 90 households. The village has a municipal council made up of nine members, and a town mayor. Residents rely on farming as a main source of income, especially grapes, fruit and wheat. Residents also raise and herd sheep and cows, which have been a good source of milk. Farmers in the village have had difficulty selling their products in modern times.\n\nDeir El Aachayer has a number of local springs, including \"Ain Halalweh\", \"Ain Shayeb\", \"Ain Rouk\", \"Ain Dibb\". The village was once known by the name \"Deir Mar Sema’an\", owing to the Monastery of Saint Simon, known locally as \"Al Borj\", said to have been built by the Romans for preaching, religious ceremonies and practices by disciples of Saint Simon the Baptist. The monastery having been a stronghold for the students, enabling them to expand their teaching in Syria.\n\nThe village is near toa the remains of a substantial Greco-Roman style temple dedicated to unknown deities, with long foundations and columns re-used in local construction. A Greek inscription was found noting that a bench was installed \"in the year 242, under Beeliabos, also called Diototos, son of Abedanos, high priest of the gods of Kiboreia\". Julien Alquot argued that the bench had liturgical uses as a mobile throne. The era of the gods of Kiboreia is not certain, as is their location which is not conclusively to be identified with Deir El Aachayer, but was possibly the Roman sanctuary or the name of a settlement in the area. It has been suggested that the name Kiboreia was formed from the Aramaic word \"kbr\", meaning a \"place of great abundance\".\n\n"}

To translate the word \"varëa\" as a letter is erroneous, because a letter is defined as a written or printed symbol employed to represent a speech-sound. The phonemes, having arisen from Näräyaëa, are eternal whereas the letters used to represent them may vary. For example, before the introduction of printing into India in the eighteenth century, the script in which Sanskrit was written and taught varied from place to place and was the same, or almost the same as that used in writing the local vernacular language. The dissemination of printed Sanskrit texts, however, encouraged the predominance of one form of writing, the Devanägaré script of central India in which the modern languages Hindé and Maräöhé are also written. Today most Sanskrit publications are printed in this [null script][BE1] .\n\nExplanation of \"varëa-krama:\"\n\nAccording to MW, \"varëa-krama\" means “order or series of letters, alphabetical arrangement, alphabet.”\n\n\"Amåta\" explains \"varëa-krama\" as \"varëänäà kramaù kramaço nirgamanam\" (“the issuing forth sequentially by the \"varëas\"[1][MA2] ”).\n\n\"Bäla\" offers the following explanation: \"varëäni udbhütäni tat-kramaç ca udbhüta ity arthaù\" (“Both the \"varëas\" and their order appeared from Näräyaëa”).\n----[1] \"Amåta\" further explains that the word \"krama\" is formed by applying the \"kåt pratyaya\" \"[gh]a[ë]\" after the \"dhätu\" \"kram[u]\" \"päda-vikñepe\" (1P or 4P, “to step, walk”) in \"bhäve prayoga.\" Thus the word \"varëänäm\" is not \"sambandha-ñañöhé\" here, rather it is the \"anukta-kartä\" taking \"ñañöhé\" by \"kartå-karmaëoù ñañöhé kåd-yoge\" (). All of this will become clear in the \"Käraka-prakaraëa.\"\n----[BE1]This samsodhini has one more sentence in course: \" The sounds (\"varëas\") of the Sanskrit alphabet are enumerated below in both Devanägaré script and roman transliteration.\"\n\n[MA2]reference the \"sütra\" in the footnote\n\nThe sounds (\"varëas\") of the Sanskrit alphabet are enumerated below by showing the letters used to represent them in Devanägaré and roman transliteration.[MA1]\n\nVåtti[1]—The \"varëa-krama\" is as follows:\n\n----[1] The \"våttis\" (“fundamental explanations of the \"sütras\"”) were also written by Jéva Gosvämé. In the \"våttis,\" Jéva Gosvämé clarifies the \"sütra,\" gives examples, supplies extra information, and mentions the opinions of other grammarians. The \"Dhätu-saìgraha\" (“list of \"dhätus\"”) was also composed by Jéva Gosvämé\".\" The \"Avyaya-çabda-saìgraha\" (“list of \"avyayas\"”), however, is an anonymous appendix, probably composed by Purédäsa, found only in some of the printed editions of the \"Hari-nämämåta,\" and the \"Gaëa-päöha\" (“list of \"gaëas\"”) belongs to Päëini. \n----[MA1]Put a sentence like refer to the BBT pronunciation guide ..\n\nSaàçodhiné—It will be explained in \"sütra\" 17 that all the \"varëas\" from \"ka\" to \"ha,\" the consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet, are dependent on the vowels for their pronunciation. That is to say, it is impossible to pronounce a consonant without the aid of a vowel. For this reason all the \"varëas\" from \"ka\" to \"ha\" are listed with an inherent \"a.\" But actually these \"varëas\" refer to the consonants themselves, regardless of the adjacent vowel. Thus the \"varëa\" \"ka\" refers to \"k,\" the \"varëa kha\" to \"kh,\" and so on. One should not be confused by the various labels such as “the \"varëa ka,\"” \"ka-räma, ka-kära,\" and \"k;\" they all refer to the same consonant \"k,\" never to \"k+a.\" This is the case for all the \"varëas\" from \"ka\" to \"ha.\" One should also be careful not to mistake \"kh, gh, ch,\" and so on, to be a combination of \"k+h, g+h, c+h,\" and so on, because in roman transliteration the \"h\" in \"kh\" and so on is employed merely to indicate that the \"varëa\" is an aspirated consonant. It is impossible for \"kh\" and so on to be conjunct consonants since in Sanskrit there are no conjunct consonants that have \"h\" as their second member.\n\nThe \"varëas\" from \"a\" to \"au,\" the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet, are written differently when they come after a consonant. \"A,\" however, has no post-consonantal symbol and is assumed to come after every consonant unless there is another vowel or a \"viräma\" in its place. The post consonantal forms of the vowels are shown below with the consonant \"k\" to indicate their proper placement.\n\nk( \"ka,\" k(A \"kä,\" ik( \"ki,\" k(L \"ké,\" ku( \"ku,\" kU( \"kü,\" k{( \"kå,\" k|( \"kè,\" k}( \"kÿ,\" k}{ \"k ÿ‾,\" ke( \"ke,\" kE( \"kai,\" k(Ae \"ko,\" k(AE \"kau.\"\n\nThe \"viräma\" ( ,) is a small oblique stroke, placed at the foot of a consonant, that is used to signal the deletion of its inherent \"a\". Thus \"ak\" would be written in Devanägaré as @k,(. The symbol called \"avagraha\" (') and the various conjunct consonants will be explained in \"Saàçodhiné\" 67 and \"Saàçodhiné\" 82 respectively. Extra symbols are also employed in the Devanägaré script for the purpose of basic punctuation. For example, the sign / is used at the end of a half-verse or sentence, and the sign // at the end of a verse or paragraph. The numbers of the Devanägaré script are as follows:\n----[MAD1]maybe use a different font which more accurately represents the character\n\nPratyähära-sütras\n\nGenerally the alternate monosyllabic names found in the \"våttis\" of the \"Saàjïä-sandhi-prakaraëa,\" like the name \"al\" here, should be assumed to be \"pratyähäras\" from Päëini's \"Añöädhyäyé.\" Where this is not the case, we will list the source of the name separately. \"Pratyähära\" literally means “withdrawal.” In grammar, however, the term \"pratyähära\" refers to the abbreviation of a series of \"varëas\" into one syllable by combining the first member with the indicatory letter of the last member. It is said that Lord Çiva revealed the following 14 \"pratyähära-sütras\" (often called the \"Maheçvara-sütras\" or \"Çiva-sütras\") unto the sage Päëini, author of the famous \"Añöädhyäyé\" (literally, “a collection of eight chapters”), by sounding his \"òamaru\" drum. All the \"pratyähäras\" like \"al\" are formed by means of these \"sütras:\"\n\n1. \"a i u[ë];\" 2. \"å ÿ[k];\" 3. \"e o[ì];\" 4. \"ai au[c];\" 5. \"ha ya va ra[ö];\" 6. \"la[ë];\" 7. \"ïa ma ìa ëa na[m];\" 8. \"jha bha[ï];\" 9. \"gha òha dha[ñ];\" 10. \"ja ba ga òa da[ç];\" 11. \"kha pha cha öha tha ca öa ta[v];\" 12. \"ka pa[y];\" 13. \"ça ña sa[r];\" 14. \"ha[l].\"\n\nIn these \"pratyähära-sütras\" the letters in brackets are indicatory letters, not to be counted among the group of \"varëas\" indicated by the \"pratyähära\". And \"a, i , u, å,\" and \"ÿ\" in the first two \"sütras\" stand for both the long and short forms of those vowels--\"a\" and \"ä, i\" and \"é, u\" and \"ü, å\" and \"è,\" and \"ÿ\" and \"ÿ‾\" respectively. The \"pratyähära\" \"al\" therefore indicates the group of \"varëas\" beginning from \"a\" in the first \"pratyähära-sütra\" and ending with \"ha,\" which has the indicatory letter \"l,\" in the fourteenth \"pratyähära-sütra.\" Thus the \"pratyähära\" \"al\" indicates the whole alphabet. Similarly The \"pratyähära\" \"ac\" indicates the group of \"varëas\" beginning from \"a\" in the first \"pratyähära-sütra\" and ending with \"au,\" which has the indicatory letter \"c,\" in the fourth \"pratyähära-sütra.\" Thus the \"pratyähära\" \"ac\" indicates all the vowels\".\" Other \"pratyähäras\" are made in the same way. In these \"sütras\" both \"ha\" and the indicatory letter \"ë\" appears twice. Although this may seem to cause problems, they are resolved as follows: The \"pratyähära aë\" is conventionally understood to be formed with the indicatory \"ë\" in the first \"sütra,\" while the \"pratyähära ië\" is conventionally understood to be formed with the indicatory letter \"ë\" in the sixth \"sütra.\" It was necessary to repeat \"ha\" twice in these \"sütras\" so that it could be included in such \"pratyähäras\" as \"haç\" and \"ië,\" and at the same time be included in \"pratyähäras\" like \"val, jhal,\" and \"çal.\" In \"pratyähäras\" like \"al\" and \"hal\" where \"ha\" appears twice it should not be taken as two separate \"varëas.\"[1]\n\nAlternate readings of the \"varëa-krama:\"\n\nIn the Haridäsa, Purédäsa, and Caitanya Maöha editions, which are all based on \"Bäla,\" \"kña\" is included as the final member of the alphabet. But in the Kåñëadäsa edition, which is based on \"Amåta,\" \"kña\" is not to be found. Indeed, its absence is confirmed by the following excerpts from the \"Amåta\" commentary on this \"sütra:\" \"a-rämädi-ha-rämänto varëa-kramaù\" (“the alphabet beginning with \"a\" and ending with \"ha\"”) and \"varëänäm ekona-païcäçat-prakäratvaà darçitaà\" (“the alphabet is shown as being 49- fold”). Furthermore, \"kña\" is generally not included in the alphabets listed in other Sanskrit Grammars [null also][BE1] .\n\nÇréla Prabhupäda also gives an interesting explanation of the name Adhokñaja which supports the inclusion of \"kña\": “And in Sanskrit, as in English it is A to Z, similarly in Sanskrit, \"a, ä, i, u,\" and the end is \"kña.\" So \"a\" and \"kña,\" that is called \"akña. Akña-ja.\" And \"ja\" means generated. So we also compose words, those who are Sanskrit scholars, they compose words from \"a\" to \"kña,\" just like English they compose words from A to Z. So our mental speculation and advancement of education is limited between this \"a\" and \"kña, akña. Akña-ja.\" But Kåñëa is \"adhokñaja.\" \"Adhokñaja\" means where these kinds of speculation, beginning from \"a\" to \"kña,\" will not act. Therefore His name is Adhokñaja. \"Adhaù kåta,\" cut down.” (Lecture on \"Çrémad-Bhägavatam\" 1.8.19—Mäyäpura, September 29, 1974).\n\nAmåta—Someone may wonder, “It was stated that the \"varëas\" and their order appeared from Näräyaëa[MA3] [2], but from where did each \"varëa\" appear?” To answer this, Jéva Gosvämé specifies each \"varëa’s\" place of appearance:\n\nVåtti—The place of appearance of these \"varëas\" is as below and so on[3].\n\nThe place of appearance of \"a, ä, ka-varga\" (\"ka, kha, ga, gha, ìa\"), \"ha,\" and \"visarga\" (\"ù\") is the throat of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"i, é, ca-varga\" (\"ca, cha, ja, jha, ïa\"), \"ya,\" and \"ça\" is the palate of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"u, ü,\" and \"pa-varga\" (\"pa, pha, ba, bha, ma\") is the lips of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"å, è, öa-varga\" (\"öa, öha, òa, òha, ëa\"), \"ra,\" and \"ña\" is the top of the palate of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"ÿ, ÿ‾, ta-varga\" (\"ta, tha, da, dha, na\"), \"la,\" and \"sa\" is the teeth of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"e\" and \"ai\" is the throat and the palate of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"o\" and \"au\" is the throat and the lips of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"v\" is the teeth and the lips of Näräyaëa.\n\nThe place of appearance of \"anusvära\" (\"à\") is either the head or nose of Näräyaëa.\n\nSaàçodhiné—Because the \"varëas\" appeared from Näräyaëa in these specific places, these are the proper places to pronounce the \"varëas.\" The \"varëas\" \"a, ä, ka-varga\" (\"ka, kha, ga, gha, ìa\"), \"ha,\" and \"visarga\" (\"ù\") are called \"kaëöhya\" because their place of pronunciation is the throat (\"kaëöha\"). The \"varëas\" \"i, é, ca-varga\" (\"ca, cha, ja, jha, ïa\")\", ya,\" and \"ça\" are called \"tälavya\" because their place of pronunciation is the palate (\"tälu\"). Other names, also made according to the place of pronunciation, are shown below along with their English equivalents.\n\n\"Amåta—\"Explanation of Näräyaëa:\n----[1] The \"pratyähäras\" have been dealt with only briefly in this book; for more details consult \"Añöädhyäyé\" or \"Siddhänta-kaumudé.\"\n\n[2] In this \"sütra\" Näräyaëa is the \"apädäna\" (“origin”) by \"prabhave tat-sthänam\" (982), because the eternal \"varëas,\" already existing within the Lord, are manifest from Him. The word \"näräyaëa\" then becomes \"näräyaëät\" as an \"apädäna\" takes \"païcamé\" (“the fifth case ending”) by \"apädäne païcamé\" (981)\".\" Here \"Bäla\" says Näräyaëa is an \"apädäna\" by \"janane prakåtiù\" (983), but that is incorrect as the \"varëas\" are eternal sounds and thus are not produced at any time. In this regard, Jéva Gosvämé defines the difference between \"prabhava\" and \"janana\" in \"våtti\" by saying \"prabhavaù prathama-darçanam, jananam utpattir iti bhedaù\" (“\"Prabhava\" is the first sight of something that already exists, while \"janana\" is the appearance of something that didn’t exist previously”).\n\n[3] The meaning of the word \"ity-ädéni,\" “these and so on”, at the end of this \"våtti\" will be seen in \"sütras\" 15, 25, 131, and 132 where further \"varëas\" and their places of pronunciation are mentioned.\n----[BE1]\"Either\" would be better than \"also\" here.\n\n[MAD2]check with an editor how to use the elypsis\n\n[MA3]reference the \"sütra\"s in the footnote\n\n[BE4]This is not the right aksara.\n\nHere the word \"nara\" (“human”) means a Vraja-väsé (“resident of Våndävana”), and the whole community of Vraja-väsés is called \"nära.\" The \"vigraha\" (“separation of the constituent words”) of the compound word \"näräyaëa\" is: \"näram ayanam yasya saù näräyaëaù\" (“Näräyaëa is He whose shelter is the Vraja-väsés”) Thus the word \"näräyaëa\" here means Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appears in a human-like form.\n\nThis understanding is backed up by the \"Bhägavatam\" (10.25.18): \"tasmän mac-charaëaà goñöhaà / man-näthaà mat-parigraham,\" where Kåñëa Himself states that the Vraja-väsés are His shelter, His protectors, and His family. In this verse the word \"goñöham\" implies the \"goñöha-väsés\", and \"goñöha-väsés\" means \"vraja-väsés\" because the word \"goñöha\" is a synonym of the word \"vraja\"[1]. Kåñëa says that the Vraja-väsés are His shelter because He, being controlled by their love, is unable to even bathe, drink, eat, sleep, or enjoy without them. Thus in the \"Ädi Puräëa\" Kåñëa tells Arjuna:\n\n\"sahäyä guravaù çiñyä\"\n\n\"bhujiñyä bändhaväù striyaù\"\n\n“The \"gopés\" are My assistants, My gurus, My disciples, My maidservants, My relatives, and My consorts. O son of Påthä, I tell you the truth. What aren’t the \"gopés\" for Me?”\n\nEven though the word \"näräyaëa\" can be used to express any \"viñëu-tattva,\" it primarily refers to Kåñëa, because He is the original Näräyaëa and because the \"avatäras\" headed by Matsya and Vämana, and even the three Puruñas are His parts (\"aìgas\"). This is corroborated by Lord Brahmä's statement in \"Bhägavatam\" (10.14.14):\n\n\"näräyaëas tvaà na hi sarva-dehinäm\"\n\n\"näräyaëo ’ìgaà nara-bhü-jaläyanät\"\n\n“Are You not the original Näräyaëa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Näräyaëa is Your expansion, and He is called Näräyaëa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Mäyä.”[MA1]\n\nIn his commentary on this verse, Çrédhara Svämé gives the following definitions of the name Näräyaëa: \"näro jéva-samüho ’yanam äçrayo yasya saù\" (“He whose abode is the aggregate of \"jévas\"”), and \"närasyäyanaà pravåttir yasmät saù\" (“He from whom the aggregate of \"jévas\" arises”). In explaining the phrase \"näräyaëo ’ìgam\" in this verse, Çrédhara Svämé gives an alternate etymology of the word \"näräyaëa\" for when it is used to refer to the well-known Näräyaëa who is a plenary portion of Kåñëa: \"naräd udbhütä ye ’rthäç catur-viàçati-tattväni tathä naräj jätaà yaj jalaà tad-ayanäd yo näräyaëa\" \"prasiddhaù so ’pi tavaiväìgaà mürtiù\" (“That Näräyaëa who is well-known because of His entering the twenty-four elements that appeared from Nara and the water that was produced from Nara, is also Your plenary portion[2]”).\n\nIn his \"Bhägavatam\" commentary named \"Krama-sandarbha,\" Jéva Gosvämé defines Näräyaëa in the following way: \"naräëäà dvitéya-tåtéya-puruña-bhedänäà samüho näraà tat-samañöi-rüpaù prathama-puruña eva; tasyäpy ayanaà pravåttir yasmät sa näräyaëaù\" (“Nära means the first Puruña, Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu, the aggregate form of the Naras who are the second and third Puruñas, Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu and Kñérodaka-çäyé Viñëu. Näräyaëa is He from whom even Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu arises”).\n\nSaàçodhiné—It is well known that Lord Caitanya often called Advaita Äcärya, the celebrated incarnation of Mahä Viñëu (Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu), by the name Näòä. This is recorded both in the \"Caintanya-bhägavata\" and in the \"Caitanya-caritämåta.\" For example, in \"Caitanya-bhägavata\" (Madhya 2.264), Lord Caitanya says “By your loud chanting and Näòä's roaring I left Vaikuëöha and came here with My associates.” In his \"Gauòéya-bhäñya\" commentary to this verse, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarvasvaté Öhäkura explains the word \"näòä\" as follows:\n\n“The editor of \"Çré Sajjana-toñaëé,\" Çrémad Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura, has written in Volume 7, Part 11, as follows: “Çréman Mahäprabhu often addressed Çréla Advaita Prabhu as Näòä. I have heard a number of meanings of the word \"näòä.\" Some Vaiñëava scholar has said that the word \"närä\" refers to Mahä-Viñëu because \"nära,\" the total aggregate of all living entities, is situated within Him. Is the word \"näòä\" a corruption of the word \"närä\"? The people of Räòha-deça often use \"òa\" in place of \"ra.\" Is this the reason that the word \"närä\" has been written as \"näòä\"? This meaning is often applicable.” The word \"nära\" or \"närä\" (\"näòä\") is explained by Çrédhara Svämipäda in his \"Bhävärtha-dépikä\" commentary on \"Çrémad-Bhägavatam\" (10.14.14) as follows: “The word \"nära\" refers to the aggregate of living entities, and the word \"ayana\" refers to the shelter. You are Näräyaëa Himself because You are the supreme shelter of all embodied souls. You are Näräyaëa because all the propensities (\"ayana\") of the living entities (\"nära\") emanate from You. You are the supreme Näräyaëa because You know (\"ayana\") all living entities (\"nära\"). You are renowned as Näräyaëa because You are the supreme shelter (\"ayana\") of the water that emanates from Nara.” In the \"småtis\" it is stated: “All the truths born from Nara are known as \"närän\" by the learned scholars. Since the Supreme Lord is the shelter of this \"närän\", learned scholars glorify Him as Näräyaëa.” In the \"Manu-saàhitä\" (1.10) it is stated: “The waters are called \"nära,\" for they emanate from the Supersoul, Nara. As they are His original resting place (\"ayana\"), He is named Näräyaëa.””\n----[1] See the last \"sütra\" of \"Kådanta-prakaraëa.\"\n\n[2] The Näräyaëa referred to here is Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu. Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu is also called Nara. When Nara entered the universe, He saw that within the universe there was only darkness and space, without a resting place. Thus He filled half of the universe with water from His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. Because this water in the form of perspiration was produced from Nara, it is called Nära, and because Nara lies down on this water he is called Näräyaëa (“One whose resting place is the water called Nära”).\n----[MA1]we can use the CC translation of this if it is more suitable\n\n\n\n"}

Kimball. Though he was never baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he identified himself as a \"believing Mormon\",\n\nHe is the son of polygamist Carl Jentzsch and Carl's third wife Pauline; Heber has 42 siblings. In 1955 Carl was arrested, and excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nHeber Jentzsch was educated at Weber College in Ogden, Utah and the University of Utah, where he graduated in 1959 with a degree in communications. He also studied Eastern religions.\n\nBefore 1967, Jentzsch worked as a journalist for the \"Los Angeles Free Press\" and an actor, having a bit part in the movie \"Paint Your Wagon\". He played a small part in an episode of the 1960s television series \"Combat!\", and an uncredited role in the movie \"1776\".\n\nJentzsch joined the Church of Scientology in 1967 after allegedly being cured by the Scientology Purification Rundown of radiation burns he had suffered since he was 15.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Jentzsch became the public relations director of the later-notorious Guardian's Office, serving as the Church of Scientology's chief press spokesman. He has continued in this role since his promotion to the post of President of the Church of Scientology International in 1982. In January 1986, Jentzsch faced the press on behalf of the Church to announce the death of L. Ron Hubbard. He has often appeared in newspaper interviews, aggressively defending the church on several occasions. Despite his media prominence, Jentzsch has been called a titular president. He is sometimes described as \"the leading spokesperson for the Church of Scientology International\" in Church publications.\n\nIn 1988 Heber Jentzsch was arrested in Spain along with 69 other members of Scientology. Jentzsch was incarcerated in a Spanish jail for about three weeks. He was released and fled to the United States after Scientology paid a bail bond of approximately $1 million. Sixteen people, including Jentzsch, were charged with \"illegal association\" and various other crimes including tax fraud and endangering public health. The trial of the indictees began in February 2001, but Jentzsch himself did not appear; the prosecution called for him to be given a 56-year prison sentence. However, the Madrid Provincial Court dismissed all but the conspiracy charge and eventually ruled (in absentia) that the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence to prove this charge as well, and in April 2002, the last charge was formally dropped. The court ordered the bail bond be returned to Scientology with interest, nearly doubling the original 1988 bond amount.\n\nHeber Jentzsch was married to Australian Scientologist Yvonne Gillham (née Harding-Wilson) from 1972 until her death in 1978. In 1978-1988 he married then-Scientologist Karen de la Carriere (b. 1944); in September 2010 she left the church and began a crusade against it, claiming that Jentzsch had not been seen publicly since 2004. As of 2018, Jentzsch’s whereabouts are still unknown to the public.\n\n"}

Its capital was Dascylium, and for most of its existence it was ruled by the hereditary Persian Pharnacid dynasty. Together with Greater Phrygia, it made up the administrative provinces of the Phrygia region.\n\nThe satrapy was created in the beginning of the fifth century BC, during the time of administrative reorganisations of the territories in western Asia Minor, which were amongst the most important Achaemenid territories. It was ruled by a hereditary Iranian dynasty, that of the Pharnacids, who were directly related to the Achaemenid dynasty itself.\n\nAs Alexander the Great was conquering and incorporating the Achaemenid Empire, he appointed Calas, a Macedonian General to govern Hellespontine Phrygia in 334 BC, after he had sent Parmenio to secure Dascylium, the provincial capital. Calas, being the very first non-Achaemenid ruler of the province, was awarded the Persian title of \"satrap\", rather than a Macedonian title, and Alexander instructed him to collect the same tribute from his subjects that had been paid to Darius III. After Alexander's death in 323, the satrapy was awarded to Leonnatus, who was killed in action in the Lamian War.

According to a global survey conducted in 2011, 16% of the population has no religion (13% of non-religious, 2% atheists convinced and 1% didn't know answer).\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, about 15.5% of the population of Belize is not religious. This is an increase from 9.4% reported in the 2000 census, and is the second largest category in the country, with the first being Roman Catholicism. \n\nApproximately 9% of the Costa Rican population is not religious (6% non-religious and 3% atheists).\n\nEstimates of the Cuban people without religion varies from 30% to 40%, the number of atheists also varies from 10% to 20%. Due to the influence of communism in the country, atheism has grown and is promoted in the population. Religious organizations are prohibited from promoting their faith to the population (at least not publicly).\n\nReligiously unaffiliated people account for 18% of the public in the Dominican Republic.\n\nEl Salvador is the least religious country in Central America and the Caribbean. This percentage is sizable: 24%. Of these, 13% are atheist and 11% are people without religion.\n\nAccording to a series of public opinion surveys (mainly CBN and CID Gallup Poll), Guatemala has had a progressive advance of irreligion, from 11.1% in 1990 to 14.2% in 2001 and 18.3% in 2008. The percentage of atheists round by 10% and 8.3% is considered simply non-religious.\n\nIn Haiti, 1% of the population are not religious.\n\nIn Honduras 14% is considered without religion (10% non-religious and 4% atheists)\n\nAccording to a 2010 census by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the percentage of non-religious is 8% (4.7% of atheists convinced) more than five million of non-religious people. A survey question in 2006 by CID-Gallup 'Is religion important to you?' 20.5% said no, and almost 5% did not answer or said sometimes.\n\nNicaragua has also experienced a decline in religious affiliation, according to the 1995 census, about 8.5% of Nicaraguans had no religion, although the 2005 census shows an increase to 15.7%, of which 9% is non-religious and 6.7% atheists.\n\nAbout 5% of Panamanians are irreligious (3% non-religious and 2% atheists).\n\nIrreligion in Puerto Rico is a new phenomenon, and has grown in recent years; about 11.1% of Puerto Ricans today have no religion (6% non-religious and 5.1% atheists).\n\nA survey conducted in August 2008 (CEIL / CONICET) reports that 11.3% of Argentines are non-religious.

Among men aged 18–29, those with better education and those from the most progressive, \"modern\" areas tend towards a lack of belief in God (83% and 89%). A CID-Gallup poll affirms that in Argentina 16% of the population claims to be irreligious (8% non-religious and 8% atheists)\n\nIn Bolivia a large majority of the population is fanatically religious, of which only 3% of the population is atheist, agnostic or non-religious.

There are atheists and secular organizations in the capital (Quito).\n\nAccording to the 2012 Pew Global Religious Landscape study, 1.1% of Paraguayans are religiously unaffiliated. \n\nThe non-religious population has been doubling between 1993 and 2007, according to the National Institute of Statistics Informaticas (INEI), in 1993 1.9% declared no religion (0.4% of atheists convinced), then in the 2007 this percentage increased to 2.7% (1.3% of atheists convinced). Although a survey by Phil Zuckerman showed that the percentage was 5.5%, also he see a reduction of 96% religious in 1993 to 86% in 2007.\n\nUruguay is the most secularized nation in the Americas with the highest percentage of atheists and agnostics. 17.2% atheist or agnostic according to Uruguayan census. While according to the most recent official survey approximately 58.1% of Uruguayans define themselves as Christian, Many Uruguayans nominally describe themselves as Roman Catholics but lifestyle is not affected by the religion.\n\nAccording to Kaufmann, E. (2010), between 29% to 53% (Endorsed by 47%) of Uruguayans are not religious, more than half are atheists and the other part is distributed between agnostics and non-religious, according to a national census conducted in 2007, 40% of Uruguayans are not religious, 20% believe in God but do not belong to any religion, 17% are atheists or agnostics, and 3% didn't know answer.\n\nIrreligion in Uruguay is not a new phenomenon, although is growing considerably. Uruguay in religious and irreligious terms is similar to Europe, where modernization, economic growth, have brought atheism, since 1990, Uruguayans referred Easter Week as \"Tourism Week\". Uruguay is also the most democratic country in the region observed for its civic culture.\n\nIn Venezuela secularization has been influencing the country, this is due to the increasing modernization of the country and improvement of education, during the 20th century Venezuela was one of the most religious countries with a dominant Catholicism, although in the early twenty-first century Protestants, atheists, agnostics, among other religions have grown in the country, the most professional people (scientists, doctors, writers, etc.) are often less believers. According to a study by the University of Cambridge, 11.7% of Venezuelans are without religion (atheists 6% and 5.7% of non-religious), also a national study estimated that 6% of Venezuelans are agnostics and 2% atheists (in total of 8% of the population).\n\n"}

It is typically depicted as a stiff corpse dressed in official garments from the Qing Dynasty, and it moves around by hopping, with its arms outstretched. It kills living creatures to absorb their \"qi\", or \"life force\", usually at night, while in the day, it rests in a coffin or hides in dark places such as caves. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty scholar Ji Xiaolan mentioned in his book \"Yuewei Caotang Biji\" (閱微草堂筆記) that the causes of a corpse being reanimated can be classified in either of two categories: a recently deceased person returning to life, or a corpse that has been buried for a long time but does not decompose. Some causes are described below:\n\n\nGenerally, a Jiangshi's appearance can range from unremarkable (as in the case of a recently deceased person) to horrifying (rotting flesh, \"rigor mortis\", as with corpses that have been in a state of decay over a period of time). The Chinese character for \"jiang\" (僵) in \"Jiangshi\" literally means \"hard\" or \"stiff\". It is believed that the Jiangshi is so stiff that it cannot bend its limbs and body, so it has to move around by hopping while keeping its arms stretched out for mobility. Jiangshi are depicted in popular culture to have a paper talisman (with a sealing spell) attached onto and hanging off the forehead in portrait orientation, and wear a uniform coat-like robe and round-top tall rimmed hat characteristic of a mandarin (Chinese official from during the Qing dynasty). A peculiar feature is its greenish-white skin; one theory is that this is derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. It is said to have long white hair all over its head and may behave like animals. The influence of western vampire stories brought the blood-sucking aspect to the Chinese myth in more modern times in combination with the concept of the hungry ghost, though traditionally they feed solely on the qi of a living individual for sustenance and in order to grow more powerful.\n\n\nA supposed source of the jiangshi stories came from the folk practice of \"transporting a corpse over a thousand \"li\"\" (). The relatives of a person who died far away from home could not afford vehicles to have the deceased person's body transported home for burial, so they would hire a Taoist priest to conduct a ritual to reanimate the dead person and teach him/her to \"hop\" their way home. The priests would transport the corpses only at night and would ring bells to notify others in the vicinity of their presence because it was considered bad luck for a living person to set eyes upon a jiangshi. This practice, also called \"Xiangxi ganshi\" (), was popular in Xiangxi, where many people left their hometown to work elsewhere. After they died, their bodies were transported back to their hometown because it was believed that their souls would feel homesick if they were buried somewhere unfamiliar to them. The corpses would be arranged upright in single file and be tied to long bamboo rods on the sides, while two men (one at the front and one at the back) would carry the ends of the rods on their shoulders and walk. When the bamboo flexed up and down, the corpses appeared to be \"hopping\" in unison when viewed from a distance away.\n\nTwo oral accounts of transporting corpses are included in Liao Yiwu's \"The Corpse Walker\". One account describes how corpses would be transported by a two-man team. One would carry the corpse on his back with a large robe covering both of them and a mourning mask on top. The other man would walk ahead with a lantern and warn his companion about obstacles ahead of him. The lantern was used as a visual guide for the corpse carrier to follow since they could not see with the robe covering them. It is speculated in the accounts in the book that corpses would be carried at night to avoid contact with people and the cooler air would be more suitable to transporting bodies.\n\nSome speculate that the stories about jiangshi were originally made up by smugglers who disguised their illegal activities as corpse transportation and wanted to scare off law enforcement officers.\n\nTheir modern visual depiction as horrific Qing officials may have been derived by the anti-Manchu or anti-Qing sentiments of the Han Chinese population during the Qing Dynasty, as the officials were viewed as bloodthirsty creatures with little regard for humanity.\n\nIt is also the conventional wisdom of feng shui in Chinese architecture that a threshold (), a piece of wood approximately 15 cm (6 in) high, be installed along the width of the door at the bottom to prevent a jiangshi from entering the household.\n"}

The tradition holds that there may be multiple Kukaraja's which are conflated (a view also propounded by modern scholarship) or the different Kukkaraja according to Nyingma tradition may be understood as a lineage of mindstream emanations.\n\nAccording to Nyingma tradition, King Ja taught himself intuitively from \"the Book\" of the Tantric Way of Secret Mantra (that is Mantrayana) that magically fell from the sky along with other sacred objects and relics \"upon the roof of King Ja\" according to Dudjom (1904–1987),\" et al.\" (1991: p. 613 History) took place on the Tibetan calendar year of the Earth Monkey, which Dudjom \" et al.\" identify as 853 BC[E]. Kukuraja received instruction drawn from \"the Book\" on what may be understood as the Outer Tantras from King Ja, then King Ja received instruction on what may be understood as the Inner Tantras from Kukuraja (Kukkuraja taught King Ja after Kukkuraja received a direct revelation of Vajrasattva wherein Vajrasattva prophesied the imminent esoteric transmission of Vajrapani, the Lord of Secrets, to Kukuraja which was only made possible through the quickening of Kukuraja by King Ja with his intuitive knowledge drawn from \"the Book\") as Dudjom (1904–1987),\" et al.\" (1991: p. 460) of the principally Nyingma view relates:\n\"Then King Ja taught the book to master Uparaja, who was renowned as a great scholar throughout the land of Sahor, but he could not understand their symbolic conventions and meaning. The king then taught them to the master Kukkuraja. He intuitively understood the chapter on the \"Vision of Vajrasattva\", from the \"Tantra of the Magical Net of Vajrasattva\" [Wylie: rdo rje sems dpa' sgyu 'phrul drva ba (also known as the Guhyagarbha Tantra)], and practiced it, whereupon Vajrasattva revealed himself and predicted that the Lord of Secrets would reveal the meanings of this tantra thereafter. When he had practised more, the Lord of Secrets actually appeared and granted him [Kukkuraja] the complete empowerment of the authentic teaching and of all vehicles. Then he told him to request the verbal teaching from the Licchavi Vimalakirti. It is said that, following the transmitted precepts of the Lord of Secrets, master Kukkuraja divided [the Mahayoga tantras] into the Eighteen Great Tantrapitaka (tantra chen-po sde bco-brgyad) and taught them to King Ja.\"\nKukuraja interpreted Tantras for King Indrabhuti. Indrabhuti is held in some sources to be the father of Padmasambhava.\n\nKukuraja, Kukkuraja, Kukuradza, Kukkuradza and many other permutations.\n\nThere is a Dancing Ganesha at Candi Sukuh that holds a small dog, a marked Buddhadharma motif of the Hindu deity which holds iconic salience with the narrative and motifs of the \"Dog King\", Kukuraja. This is important for identifying the date of the tantric lineage(s) that disseminated to the Indonesian archipelago, refer: Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia.\n\nCandi Sukuh is a fifteenth-century Javanese-Hindu-Buddhist temple (candi) that demonstrates strong tantric influence. Candi Sukuh is located on the western slope of Mount Lawu (elev. 910 m or above sea level) on the border between Central and East Java provinces. The monument was built around 1437, as written as a chronogram date on the western gate, meaning that the area was under the rule of the Majapahit Kingdom during its end (1293–1500). The distinctive Dancing Ganesha relief in Candi Sukuh has a similarity with the Tantric ritual found in the history of Buddhism in Tibet written by Taranatha. The Tantric ritual is associated with several figures, one of whom is described as the \"King of Dogs\" (Sanskrit: Kukuraja), the mahasiddha who taught his disciples by day, and by night performed \"Ganacakra\" in a burial ground or charnel ground. Importantly, Ganesha also appears in Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god , but also portrayed as a Hindu demon form also called . Ganesha's image may be found on Buddhist sculptures of the late Gupta period. As the Buddhist god , Ganesha is often shown dancing, a form called Nṛtta Ganapati that was popular in North India and adopted in Nepal and then into Tibet. It is this Dancing Ganesha form which is evident in Candi Sukuh. For more information on different permutations of Ganesha beyond 'Hinduism' proper, refer Ganesha in world religions.\n\n\n"}

She was described by Pausanias as a daughter of Pelasgus, son of Triopas, king of Argos. Hellanicus states that the sons of Poseidon and Larissa were Achaios, Phthios, and Pelasgus. These sons left Argos and arrived in Haemonia (Thessaly) where they drove out the barbarian inhabitants and divided the country into three parts, calling them, after the their names, Phthiotis, Achaia and Pelasgiotis.\n\nThe arx of Argos and two towns (Larissa in Thessaly and one in the Peneus) are believed to have derived their name (meaning \"citadel\") from her.She was represented on the obverse of common drachms produced by the city of Larissa between 400 BCE and at least 340 BCE, as a three-quarters face with outward flowing hair. This style was copied from the head of Arethusa by Cimon, depicted on Syracusan tetradrachms. According to hoard evidence from Thessaly, this coinage was produced down to c. 320 BCE. Other coins depict Larissa seated, holding a hydria and with a spring nearby, confirming her status as a nymph.\n\nA moon of Neptune was discovered by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on May 24, 1981 and later given the name Larissa. Larissa is also designated as \"Neptune VII\", S/1981 N 1 and \"S/1989 N 2\".\n\nLarissa was the daughter of the Pelasgian prince, Piasus and wife of Cyzicus, king of the Dolionians, the people of northwestern Asia Minor visited by the Argonauts. Strabo reported that \"before her marriage, her father Piasus fell in love with her and, having violated her, paid the penalty for the outrage; on that account Larisa, observing him leaning over a cask of wine, seized him by the legs, raised him, and plunged him into the cask, drowning him.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5501310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5501310", "title": "Lozi mythology", "text": "Lozi mythology\n\nThe main function of Lozi mythology is to show that the original Lozi people (the Luyi or Luyana) were dwellers on the Barotse Floodplain of the upper Zambezi River and that they are, therefore, entitled to claim unchallenged title to that homeland. Secondly, Lozi mythology gives legitimacy to the Lozi kingdom's foundations, by linking the monarchy and the people to a creator god, whom the Lozi call Nyambe.\n\nNyambe's wife was Nasilele (which means \"she who is associated with long things\") and his mother was Ngula (which means \"she who is pregnant\"). Nyambe is said to have created both his wife and his mother. He is also said to have created everything else that exists, including the heaven, the Earth and all the plants and animals.\n\nThe Lozi founding myth is not cast in stone, there are several versions of it, depending on who is telling the story. Like any other oral tradition, it has changed with the passage of time, but there are some elements that do not change, such as the name of the creator god, the name of the first man, and the name of the first sovereign.\n\nThe three versions of the Lozi founding myth given below are not the only ones.\n\nOne of Nyambe's creations was Kamunu, the first human being. Nyambe gave Kamunu the task of naming all the other creations and told the human being that all the animals were his siblings. As such he should look after them.\n\nKamunu, being the most intelligent of all Nyambe's creations, rapidly learned and copied Nyambe's various skills: the mastery over fire; the forging of metal; the art of moulding pottery; the carving of spoons, plates and canoes; the sowing of crops; and the domestication of animals. Although Nyambe was at first impressed, he soon became tired of Kamunu's mimicry, especially when the man started killing the animals and cooking their meat for food. Nyambe told Kamunu not to kill the other creatures but Kamunu would not stop. To punish this misbehaviour, Nyambe begun taking away Kamunu's possessions: first his pot broke, then his dog died and eventually his son died. This, according to the Lozi, was the way that death came to the human race.\n\nIn frustration, Nyambe moved away from Kamunu on several occasions but, wherever Nyambe moved to on the Zambezi floodplains, Kamunu would follow. Eventually Nyambe decided to cross the Zambezi River, but Kamunu carved a canoe and followed. Nyambe built a mountain and lived on its summit, but Kamunu climbed the mountain and found Nyambe. Finally, Nyambe decided to move away from Earth into heaven (called Litooma in Lozi mythology). To accomplish this, and to prevent Kamunu from following, Nyambe instructed a spider to weave a web. Once Nyambe had used the spider's web to climb into Litooma, he blinded the spider so that it would not tell Kamunu how to get to heaven.\n\nThat is how Kamunu remained on Earth, condemned to live and die here after Nyambe refused to provide medicine to prevent disease and death. Hence death is Kamunu's divine punishment for his disobedient behaviour.\n\nIn this version, Nyambe is shown to be the founder of the Lozi nation. Nyambe and his wife Nasilele had a daughter Mwambwa (which means \"one who is being talked about\"). In a variation on this theme, Nyambe is said to have created many wives for himself and had children by all of them. (This story also legitimises polygyny in the Lozi nation.) When Mwambwa had grown up, Nyambe fell in love with her and had incestuous sexual intercourse with her. When Nasilele found out what had happened between her husband and her daughter, she quarrelled with her husband and beat her daughter. Nyambe was so upset by his wife's behaviour that he called his servant, Sasisho, and announced his decision to return to heaven. Nyambe ordered a spider to spin a web, so that he and his servant could climb to heaven leaving Nasilele on Earth. Due to her remorse, Nasilele died a few weeks later.\n\nMwambwa, the daughter of Nyambe and Nasilele, later became the first Luyi sovereign and, therefore, founder of the nation. Her eldest daughter, whose name was Mbuyu and who was presumably conceived from the incest with Nyambe, took over the sovereignty from her mother.\n\nIn this version of the founding myth, Nyambe was not the creator god but was the first human being. All Luyi peoples were said to have originated from him. In this account, the identity of the Creator is not stated explicitly. Instead, the people in the myth are simply stated to have been living on the Zambezi floodplains. Nyambe's village was called Litooma-mundi-wa-Nyambe (which means \"heaven, the home of Nyambe\" in Luyana) and his first wife was called Mwambwa. She later became the first female chief of the Luyi people. Through this myth, the Lozi royalty was said to originate from Mwambwa. She was, therefore, given the title Njemakati (which means \"a woman from whom the kingdom originates\"). She is also said to have given birth to nine other children, including a daughter named Mbuyu, who took over the sovereignty from her mother.\n\n"}

The most common litany used nowadays, the Litany of Loreto, uses the invocation \"Mater admirabilis\", which means \"Mother admirable\".\n\nOn April 4, 1604, the Colloquium Marianum of the Jesuit Sodality at Ingolstadt was praying the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As they came to the prayer, \"“Mother most admirable, pray for us”\" Father Rem asked for a repeat and again for a repeat of the prayer. Since that time, the Colloquium Marianum and the sodalities used the triple prayer. \"Mater ter admirablilis\" continues to be used as a part of the sodality prayers worldwide.\n\nSince 1915, Mater ter admirablilis is a part of the Marian prayers of the Schönstatt movement.

There was some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) received some attention in the media.\n\nMatrixism, also referred to as \"The path of the One,\" was primarily introduced in 2004. A website on Yahoo GeoCities created by an anonymous source provided the basis for the religion. Matrixism is inspired by the Matrix trilogy and its associated stories (including the Animatrix). However, these stories are not the sole foundation. The ideals of Matrixism can be traced back to the early 20th century to The Promulgation of Universal Peace, the record of talks by `Abdu'l-Bahá during his `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West in the United States. Nor is this the first time a book of his inspired a religious community to form.\n\nMatrixism carried with it four main beliefs that are described as \"The Four Tenets of Matrixism\". Briefly these were: belief in a messianic prophecy, use of psychedelic drugs as sacrament, a perception of reality as multi-layered and semi-subjective, and adherence to the principles of at least one of the world's major religions. The Matrixism website singles out April 19 as a holiday - otherwise known as Bicycle Day, April 19 marks the anniversary of Albert Hofmann's 1943 experiment with LSD.\n\nThe adopted symbol for Matrixism was the Japanese \"kanji\" symbol for \"red\". This symbol was used in the video game \"Enter the Matrix\". The color is a reference to the red pill, which represented an acceptance of and ability to see truth, as established early in the first Matrix film.\n\n"}

In addition to offering pastoral care to individuals, and supporting their religious rights and needs, military chaplains may also advise the executive on issues of religion, and ethics, morale and morals as affected by religion. They may also liaise with local religious leaders in an effort to understand the role of religion as a factor both in hostility and war and in reconciliation and peace.\n\nMilitary chaplains normally represent a religion or faith group but work with military personnel of all faiths and none. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, also employ \"humanist\" chaplains who offer a non-religious approach to chaplain support.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence employs chaplains, but their authority comes from their sending church.

Some clergy, like rabbis, can apply without permission from any individual or organization within their faith group; others, in faith groups that have a hierarchy established to make decisions on the postings or positions of their members, must be granted permission from the appropriate official, such as the appropriate Bishop. As the application process proceeds, and the military determines whether the applicant will meet standards in areas such as health, physical fitness, age, education, citizenship, past criminal history, and \"suitability\" for service, which includes supporting the \"free exercise of religion\" for men and women of all faiths, an \"endorsement\" from an \"endorsing agency\" that is recognized by the Department of Defense, representing one or more faith groups in the United States, will be required, in part to ensure that the separation of church and state is honored. Neither the government as a whole nor the military in particular will be put into the position of determining whether an individual is a \"bona fide\" priest, minister, rabbi, imam, etc. (The requirement for such an endorsement has been in force since 1901, and today many of the various religious endorsing agencies work together under such non-governmental voluntary umbrella groups as the National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces.) Although ordination is usually required for chaplain service, some \"equivalent\" status is accepted for individuals from religious groups which do not have ordination, such as the Church of Christ. Additionally, in cases where an endorsing agency is not yet established for an individual's religion, it is possible for him or her to be endorsed by the endorsing agency of another group, a process which was followed for the first Muslim chaplains in the military. In any event, this endorsement is recognized as \"necessary, but not sufficient\" for acceptance as a chaplain: in other words, the military will not accept an individual for service as a chaplain, nor allow him or her to continue to serve, without such an endorsement remaining in force; however, the decision as to whether to accept that individual remains with the military service, and the individual can be rejected for a number of reasons, including the needs of the military, even with the endorsement of an endorsing agency.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions are silent on whether chaplains may bear arms. However, the Conventions do state (Protocol I, 8 June 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are non-combatants: they do not have the right to participate directly in hostilities.\n\nIt is generally assumed that during World War II, chaplains were unarmed. Crosby describes an incident where a US chaplain became a trained tank gunner and was removed from the military for this \"entirely illegal, not to mention imprudent\" action. At least some British chaplains serving in the Far East, however, were armed: George MacDonald Fraser recalls \"the tall figure of the battalion chaplain, swinging along good style with his .38 on his hip\" immediately behind the lead platoon during a battalion attack. Fraser asks, \"if the padre shot [an enemy], what would the harvest be ... apart from three ringing cheers from the whole battalion?\"\nThe Reverend Leslie Hardman, the British Second Army's senior Jewish chaplain, who became well known for his work amongst the liberated prisoners after the capture of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, was another who insisted on being armed while on active service.\n\nIn recent years, both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed in combat, although the US does not prohibit chaplains from earning marksmanship awards or participating in marksmanship competitions. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and also Australia, make it an issue of individual conscience. There are anecdotal accounts that even US and UK chaplains have at least occasionally unofficially borne weapons: Chaplain (then Captain) James D. Johnson, of the 9th Infantry Division, Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam describes (\"Combat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle\") carrying the M-16 rifle while embedded with a combat patrol. Since 1909 US chaplains on operations have been accompanied by an armed chaplain assistant. However, perhaps on this occasion it was felt that an unarmed uniformed man would draw unwelcome attention.\n\nCaptured chaplains are not considered prisoners of war and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.\n\nInevitably, serving chaplains have died in action. The US Army and Marines lost 100 chaplains killed in action during World War II: the third highest casualty rate behind the infantry and the Army Air Forces. Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have been awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross, and nine have received the Medal of Honor). The Chaplain's Medal for Heroism is a special US military decoration given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous Four Chaplains, all of whom died in the sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others.\n\nIn 2006, training materials obtained by US intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units. Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting US troops, there read: \"Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare.\"\n\nMilitary chaplains are often supervised by a chaplain general or chief of chaplains, on the staff of the leader of the nation's military forces. In some countries, like Israel, Canada, and South Africa, one chief of chaplains/chaplain general serves in that position for all chaplains of all religions, in all branches of the military. In many other countries, such as France, there is a separate chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each faith group represented by chaplains. In other countries, like the United States, there is one chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each branch of the military. So, for example, in the United States, there is an Army, Navy, and Air Force chief of chaplains. They meet on as representatives to the Armed Forces Chaplains Board, to discuss issues that cross service lines, but each reports as a staff officer of his or her service, to the Chief of Staff of the Army or Air Force, or the Chief of Naval Operations of the Navy. (In the United States, Navy chaplains serve Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard personnel. Navy chaplains also assigned to the Merchant Marine Academy, for Merchant Marine personnel.)\n\nThe International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference grew out of a conference NATO chiefs of chaplains organized by the United States European Command (USEUCOM) in 1990. It welcomes any chief of chaplains (or \"chaplain general\", an equivalent term used by many nations).\n\nRoman Catholic chaplains are generally organized into military ordinariates, such as the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA. Potential Roman Catholic chaplains must seek permission from their diocesan bishop or religious superior to serve as a military chaplain. While serving as a chaplain, the priest or deacon remains incardinated in his home diocese, but is temporarily under the direction of the prelate of the ordinariate for the duration of his service.\n\nEach of the various Protestant Christian denominations may set its own requirements for certification as a minister.\n\nBesides the Military Rabbinate of Israel, today, military rabbis serve throughout several countries of the world, most notably in the US military forces, and various European armies.\nSince the rise of the Christian religion in Europe and worldwide, as a matter of course Christians fought against Christians over and over again. During World War I, for the first time a substantial number of Jews served on all sides of the war, and so did military rabbis. As a result of 18th and 19th centuries` emancipation, \"military field rabbis\" served on all fronts and in all combating nations.\n\nBadges and insignia vary widely across nations and services; though generally include some form of symbol specific to the individual chaplain's religion.\n\nIn addition to badges and insignias for individual chaplains, certain nations, including the United States, fly a Church or Worship Pennant during the time a chaplain leads a religious worship service, especially on ships at sea. On United States Navy ships it is the only pennant that flies above the United States flag.\n\nRoman Catholic military chaplains served in the Argentine armed forces since the early nineteenth century, and wore officers´ uniforms and ranks.\nHowever, the use of these was discontinued in the 1970s in the Army and the Air Force, and in the 2000s in the Navy, due to allegations of some chaplains supposedly abusing their military position and thus discouraging their subordinates to approach them when in need. Nevertheless, chaplains continue to wear combat uniform (but no rank insignia) when accompanying the troops in field operations or exercises, and are still considered as a part of the officers corps.\nNo specific provisions exist for the spiritual support to non-Catholics.\n\nChaplains in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have almost the same status as chaplains in the British armed services. Chaplains in the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) are commissioned officers and wear the uniform of officers of their particular branch of the services as well as the rank to which they are qualified. Chaplains in the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force begin their commission as a Captain (Army) or Flight Lieutenant (RAAF) respectively. There are five levels or \"divisions\" for the seniority of chaplains in the Australian Army and Air Force with each division corresponding to a worn rank. The highest \"division\" is Division 5 who are \"principal chaplains,\" of which there are three per service representing the three major Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican and Protestant. The principal chaplains of the Army wear the rank of brigadier and in the RAAF, air commodore. Australian Army chaplains, whatever their rank, are mostly referred to as \"Padre\" by officers and soldiers alike. The title is also widely used in the RAAF for their chaplains.\n\nLike chaplains in the Australian Army and RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN) chaplains are commissioned officers and wear the uniform of an RAN officer, but like chaplains in the British Royal Navy (RN) they do not wear a rank. Rather they wear the same cross and anchor emblem worn by RN chaplains on their shoulder rank slides and do not have gold braided rings or executive loops on their winter sleeve coat or summer shoulder boards. Like other chaplains in the ADF, Navy chaplains have five divisions of seniority. Whilst Australian Navy chaplains do not wear rank, they are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status as Commander (Lieutenant Colonel equivalent in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status of Captain (equiv. of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy chaplains are \"principal chaplains,\" and these three chaplains, representing the three major Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican and Protestant, are accorded the rank and status of commodore. The title \"Padre\" for chaplains is less common and not officially encouraged in the Royal Australian Navy, although it is known to be used by some sailors and Navy chaplains in preference to the more formal title of \"chaplain\" or form of address towards an officer such as \"sir.\" Like British Royal Navy chaplains, Royal Australian Navy chaplains wear a slightly different peaked cap to other Navy officers which apparently was designed by Winston Churchill.\n\nIn the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the heads of military chaplaincy for those Christian denominations and of the Jewish faith that have an official association with the ADF, are also members of the ADF's \"Religious Advisory Committee\" (RAC). With respect to the Catholic and Anglican churches, their Bishops are members of RAC and they and the other members of RAC have the status of a two star General (US) or Major General (Australian Army), or Rear Admiral (RAN) or Air Vice-Marshal (RAAF).\n\nThe Anglican and Roman Catholic strands of Australian Defence Force Chaplaincy have websites that explain their church's mission within the Australian Defence Force. While the Protestant strand does not have a website, one of their chaplains has a representative blog site.\n\nBelgium has chaplains for its army, and is mainly a Catholic chaplaincy.\n\nThe Canadian Armed Forces Chaplaincy has approximately 192 Regular Force chaplains and 145 Reserve Force chaplains representing the Protestant, Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish faiths. The mission of this Branch is to \"support and enhance the effectiveness of the CF as a whole – its leadership, the individual men and women who serve and their families – through the provision of comprehensive religious and spiritual support, advice, and care.\" The vision of the Chaplaincy is to \"be an operationally relevant Chaplaincy that supports and cares for all CF personnel and their families, wherever they live and serve, empowering them spiritually and morally to meet the demands of military service.\"\n\nTheir role is to:\nWhen offering prayers during parades and ceremonies, it is customary that the order to remove headdress be given to those on parade. In November 2004, Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada ruled that this order was \"not lawful\" since it unjustifiably required all attendees to show participation in a prayer that that may not believe. Following this ruling, non-believers are now permitted to retain their headdress just like Jews and Sikhs do in accordance with their faith.\n\nThere are 95 Church of Denmark military chaplains associated the Danish armed forces; serving all personnel regardless of their faith position. The chaplains are outside the ranking system, and are therefore equal to all soldiers. They are allowed to wear uniforms and a sidearm for self-defense.\n\nDuring the Second World War or to Finland the Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War Finland was unique among German allied Axis powers in including Jewish soldiers in its military as well as having field chaplaincy services available for them.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the cloak of Saint Martin of Tours, (\"cappa Sancti Martini\"), one of the most sacred relics of the Frankish kings, would be carried everywhere the king went, even into battle, as a holy relic upon which oaths were sworn. The clergyman who served as custodian for the cloak in its reliquary was called a \"capellānus\", and, by extension, all clergymen who officiated in reliquaries, sanctuaries, or chapels were eventually called \"cappellāni\". This eventually gave \"chapelain\" in Old French and was borrowed into English.\n\nSaint Louis was the king who gave legal status to the military chaplains, since chaplains serving under their lord in the Crusades were the first to be militarized. In 1531, during the Battle of Kappel, the Swiss reformist Huldrych Zwingli became the very first Protestant military chaplain to be killed on the battlefield.\n\nThe modern French \"Aumônerie militaire\" (military chaplaincy) was created and instituted by a July 8, 1880 Act of Parliament, which sets forth how the chaplaincy functions with regard to the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths. The Secularism Act (1905), which establishes a strict separation of church and state in the French government, does not however apply to the military. The defense minister appoints three command-level military chaplains—one per faith—in charge of all chaplains. The chaplains, serving in the army, are assigned by one of these three military chaplains. The first Muslim chaplain-general, Abdelkader Arbi, was commissioned in 2006.\n\nFrench military chaplains wear a uniform since World War II, but have no rank or rank insignia. The modern military chaplaincy is rooted in that war, where military chaplains were incorporated in almost every Free French Forces fighting unit and made up of personnel from England, France, or any of its imperial domains. After the war, military chaplains were sent to occupation zones in Germany and Austria.\n\nIn the 1950s, military chaplains where sent in the French Union's territories, including Indochina and Algeria. In 1954, pastor Tissot was one of the last paratrooper volunteers to jump over the besieged Dien Bien Phu fortified camp in northern Vietnam. On May 7, he was made prisoner of the Viet Minh and sent to a re-education camp, deep in the jungle.\n\nSince 1984, French military chaplains are involved in every military operation—including the Gulf War—from Rapid Reaction Force (\"Force d'Action Rapide\") units to navy ships.\n\nIn France, the existence of military chaplains has come under debate because of the separation of Church and State; however, their position has been maintained .\n\nInitially only Christian chaplains worked in German armies. Only after the French Revolution did Jews become citizens with equal rights in Germany for the first time. An integration of Jewish soldiers within the army gave the German Reich the opportunity to recognize the Jewish urge to fight for the German “Fatherland”. The times of common Christian suppression and supremachy status changed and more and more German Jews served in the liberal French Armies of the German territories under French influence, e.g. in the Bavarian army.\n\nIn Prussia, king Frederick the Great also showed religious tolerance, but in case of the Jews he exerted intolerance. The Jews were divided into six classes, and only the privileged first class had \"de facto\" equal rights as citizens. Very few Jewish soldiers in the Prussian army of the 18th century left historical traces, e.g. Konstantin Nathanel of Salomon, who was promoted to general in 1760. Although the Jewish presence in Germany is older than Christianity, the first \"field rabbinat\" was introduced during World War I. The German Kaiserreich appointed c. 30 military rabbis. Field rabbi Dr. Leo Baeck wrote the “Israelite Field Prayer Book”.\n\nGermany had a tradition of appointing Catholic and Evangelical military chaplains and Jewish military field rabbis. This was continued in the Army and Navy of the Wehrmacht, for the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations only. A total of 95% of all Germans being Christian, German soldiers during Nazi times continued to belong to the churches and had the words \"Gott mit uns\" (\"God with us\") on the belt buckles of every Army and Navy enlisted men and non-commissioned officers. Despite this proportion of Christians, the totalitarian national socialistic government of the German Reich tried to weaken the authority and influence of the churches over their German adherents. Besides the international \"Jewish question\", the international character of the Catholic church was another challenge. A few Catholics who devoutly resisted the Nazis, suffered imprisonment and hardship. The case was solved by the Reichskonkordat (1933) between the Holy See and Nazi Germany. The government of the German Reich early established an pastoral ministry for the German Army and the Reichskonkordat settled the appointment of an Army bishop. Therefore, the military chaplains could more freely operate out of the Catholic hierarchy. Franz Justus Rarkowski, S.M., became ordained the Catholic military Field Bishop (\"Feldbischof\") of Nazi Germany in 1938 until 1945.\n\nGerman military chaplains who served the Wehrmacht were part of the German mainstream and lent the Nazi war effort legitimacy. The Christian military chaplains served between strange poles. While the Nazi ideology was at its core pagan (the elite SS units never allowed chaplains), 95% of Germans were baptized Christians. German soldiers during the Nazi era continued to belong to the churches and had the words \"Gott mit uns\" (\"God with us\") on their belt buckles. “Being a chaplain in the German army had always been a prestigious position and the Nazis wanted people who represented that old military tradition (..) and not sow discord or division. They wanted people who were not troublemakers.2 The German military chaplains mostly wanted to bring the word of the Christian God to men in the field and to deliver the sacraments, make their families proud and serve their country. “The motives of the chaplains were not unusual, (..) their noble, personal and professional motives turned them into a legitimating force in a war of annihilation.” Military chaplains in Nazi Germany were rigorously screened. First, names were put on the desks of the local civilian bishops, and then the names had to be approved by the according ministry for church affairs. Eventually the names were cleared by the military’s chaplaincy office and the Gestapo (\"Secret State Police\").\n\nThroughout the Third Reich period, only the Army and Navy had military chaplains. When needed, other branches of the armed forces acquired chaplains from the Army or Navy or from nearby parish. In the Heer (Army), military chaplains were organized into Group 3b (Pastoral Group) of the General Army Office under the Army High Command. In mid 1935, four groups of military chaplains were introduced. In 1936, similar groups were introduced for the Kriegsmarine although the evolution over time was different. The groups are as follow.\n\nGerman military chaplains did not get into the ordinary military rank system, but received privileges like any other regular officers. Army chaplains had four different types of clothing:\n\nNo weapon was permitted to be carried by chaplains, but one photographic evidence shows a chaplain with a pistol holster on his left waist.\n\nFor the headdresses of the Army chaplains, the most common were:\n\nAll the buttons, national eagles, cockades, Gothic crosses, and cap chinstraps were silver for military chaplains and gold for Field Bishops.\nThe collar patches had violet underlay and violet piping for Catholic chaplains, and field grey underlay and violet piping for Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains.\n\nFor the Kriegsmarine, the uniform was identical to naval jacket of regular officers, but without sleeve laces and with chaplain collar patches. The collar patches were different to those of the Army. Two-prong officer's belt or brocade belt could be worn.\n\nAlthough the official regulation states that military chaplains had to wear golden pectoral cross, there were two standard-issue crosses that were worn:\n\nPhotographic evidences show numerous variety of pectoral crosses worn by German military chaplains during World War II.\n\nOftentimes, German military chaplains were issued an armband with a red cross sign and violet stripe to show their neutrality on the battlefield. This was called \"Armbinde mit Neutralitätsabzeichen \" (Armband with Neutrality Sign).\n\nAmong other things, military chaplains also wore standard liturgical vestments such as chasuble, cope, and stole.\n\nGerman religious constitutional law and its state-church law is involved in the democratic national identity of modern Germany, especially in various articles of the German Constitution. Initially, a \"military-chaplaincy\" contract was only signed between the state and the Protestant Church, but was extended to all other religious communities for reasons of parity. Furthermore, the 1930s Reichskonkordat between the Holy See and Germany is still in force. In Germany, military chaplains of the Bundeswehr have no rank but have a special civilian status as part of the armed forces.\n\nThe Military Rabbinate is a unit in the Israel Defense Forces that provides religious services for military personnel, Jewish and non-Jewish, and makes decisions on issues of religion and military affairs. The Military Rabbinate is headed by the Chief Military Rabbi, who carries the rank of a Brigadier General.\n\nThe Military Rabbinate constitutes the body responsible for religious institutions in the military. In every unit or military base there are Military Rabbinate military personnel assigned responsibility for conducting or coordinating religious services, overseeing the kosher operation of the kitchen, and the maintenance of the synagogue and religious supplies. Actively serving military personnel can request Military Rabbinate representatives to perform marriage ceremonies and \"brit mila\", circumcision ceremonies, for babies. The unit also oversees the legal and religious certification of marriages and divorces of individuals during their military service.\n\nThe Military Rabbinate is responsible for treating the bodies of soldiers in accordance with religious law, including the identifications and post-mortem treatment of bodies, and conducting military funerals. The Military Rabbinate also coordinates the burial of enemy soldiers and the exhuming of bodies in conjunction with prisoner exchanges.\n\nThe Military Rabbinate was founded in 1948 by Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who headed it until 1968.\n\nThe Netherlands has chaplains of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and humanist faiths, provided by the De Diensten Geestelijke Verzorging (DGV) or the Spiritual Care Services. Chaplains are trained in Vormingscentrum Landgoed Beukbergen.\n\n The chaplain service in Norway is called the Feltprestkorpset, or the Field Priest Corps, and is a joint Norwegian Armed Forces service. \n\nPrior to 1968, chaplains wore badges of rank as commissioned officers.\n\nSince 1968, however, all chaplains have been senior officers and accorded the protocol status of colonel / captain (navy). They carry the military rank of chaplain and the rank insignia, which is unique to the Chaplains Service, comprises a Chi Rho monogramme surrounded by a triangle. The monogramme represents the first two letters of Christ in Greek. It originates from the days of Constantine, the first Emperor of Rome to grant religious freedom to Christians. His own conversion to the Christian faith was initiated by a dream in which the Chi-Rho monogramme appeared to him. The triangle surrounding the monogramme is the symbolic representation of the Holy Trinity.\n\nDuring the vision of the monogramme, Constantine heard the Latin words \"in hoc signo vinces\". The English translation of these Latin words is: \"In this sign, you will conquer\". This is the motto of the Chaplains Service and forms part of the Corps Badge.\n\nIn 1998, after working as chaplain general in exile for the ANC, the African National Congress, during the fight against apartheid, Fumanekile Gqiba was appointed as the first black chaplain general for SANDF, the South African National Defense Force. In 2004, Major General Gqiba left the military to accept his appointment as South African Ambassador to Israel.\n\nIn the SANDF Chaplain Service, the Hindu faith is represented by a Regular Force chaplain. The rank is Cpln (Vipra) and the mode of address Vipra. The rank insignia is a deepa (lamp) with flame. This is the symbolic representation of enlightenment, the life objective of all Hindus.\n\nThe Muslims do not have Regular Force chaplains in the SANDF because they are small in number. They are however served by part-time workers through the Chaplains Service of the SANDF and are addressed according to their religious customs as imams.\n\nChristian chaplains are generally referred to and addressed as Padre. They may however, be addressed according to the practice of their religious bodies e.g., Father, Pastor, Umfundisi (Zulu and Xhosa), Moruti (Sotho), Dominee (Afrikaans) etc. The official written form of address is \"Cpln\" (for chaplain) followed by the appropriate ecclesiastical title of the respective chaplain e.g., Cpln (Rev), Cpln (Fr), Cpln (Pastor), Cpln, etc.\n\nAlong with chaplains from many other nations in the southern region of the continent of Africa, South African chaplains participate in SARMCA, the \"South Africa Regional Military Chaplains Association\", which is a component organization of SADC, the \"Southern African Development Community\".\n\nThe first English military-oriented chaplains were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the eighth century AD. Land based chaplains appeared during the reign of King Edward I, although their duties included jobs that today would come under the jurisdiction of military engineers and medical officers. A priest attached to a feudal noble household would follow his liege lord into battle. In 1796 the Parliament of Great Britain passed a Royal Warrant that established the Army Chaplains' Department in the British Army. The Department was awarded its \"Royal\" prefix in 1919 in recognition of their chaplains' service during World War I.\n\nThe current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the First World War. A chaplain provides spiritual and pastoral support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea or in the field. In the Royal Navy chaplains are traditionally addressed by their Christian name, or with one of many nicknames (Bish; Sin-Bosun; Devil Dodger; Sky-Pilot etc.). In the British Army and Royal Air Force, chaplains are traditionally referred to (and addressed) as \"padre\" or as Sir/Ma'am (although not the latter in the RAF).\n\nIn the Royal Navy chaplains have no rank other than \"chaplain\" while in the British Army they hold commissioned relative rank but are universally referred to as Padre. On the foundation of the Royal Air Force Chaplains' Branch an attempt was made to amalgamate these differing systems creating \"Relative Rank\", where rank is worn but without executive authority. In practice chaplains of all three services work in similar ways using what influence and authority they have on behalf of those who consult them or seek their advice.\n\nDuring World War II the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an (Anglican) chaplain-general, (a major-general), who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. An assistant chaplain-general was a chaplain 1st class (full colonel) and a senior chaplain was a chaplain 2nd class (lieutenant colonel).\n\nAll chaplains are commissioned officers and wear uniform. British Army and Royal Air Force chaplains bear ranks and wear rank insignia, but Royal Navy chaplains do not, wearing a cross and a special version of the officers' cap badge as their only insignia.\n\nChaplains in the armed forces were previously all Christian or Jewish. The first Jewish chaplain was appointed in 1892 and some 20 to 30 were commissioned during World War II. Until recent times, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has employed only Christian chaplains, with the Jewish community providing an honorary chaplain under long-standing arrangements, although Jewish chaplains have served in the Territorial Army. In October 2005 the Ministry of Defence appointed four chaplains to the military; one each from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities. The Museum of Army Chaplaincy holds information and archive material relating to the history of the Army Chaplains' Department.\n\nIn the era before call signs the radio \"appointment title\" for the Padre was \"Sky pilot\".\n\nIn the United States, military chaplains have an officer's rank based on their years of service and promotion selection from among their peers. Chaplains serving in the US Armed Forces wear the uniform of their respective branch of service, and normally wear clerical attire only during the performance of a religious service. The position of rank and chaplain faith group insignia varies in each military department and may vary significantly from one type of uniform to another within a military department. The US Army, Air Force, and Navy \"(as a component of the Department of the Navy the Marine Corps is supplied by USN chaplains)\" require an 'ecclesiastical endorsement' from the candidate's faith group (which in the case of the Navy must be one registered with the DoD).\n\nThe Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer Auxiliary of the USAF, also has chaplains, who must meet the same standards for appointment as active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard chaplains. They wear the same insignia as USAF chaplains and can be called upon to assist Air Force chaplains.\n\nUS military chaplains, both individuals and in groups, have been involved in a number of controversies. Complaints have been made against chaplains for mandatory prayers, coercion, and using government money to promote Evangelical Christianity. Groups representing atheists have pushed for the appointment of someone representing their viewpoint to the chaplaincy. Individual cases include that of Air Force Lt. Col. Garland Robertson, discharged in 1993 after expressing political opinions in a letter to the \"Abilene Reporter-News\" and Navy Chaplain Lt. Gordon Klingenschmitt who, against direct orders to him personally, as well as military law and tradition, protested openly and publicly \"while in uniform\" against military policies which he believed restricted the free exercise of his religion.\n\nThe constitutionality of the US chaplaincy has been the subject of legal challenges and scholarly dispute. One appellate case, \"Katcoff v. Marsh\" (1985) upheld the system as a permissible attempt to support service members in the \"free exercise\" of their religious beliefs, though others have described the details of the chaplaincy system as violations of the legal principles that the federal government maintain neutrality and avoid becoming entangled in religious affairs.\n\nMore than 400 chaplains have died while serving in the US military.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46924742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46924742", "title": "Murder of Jeannette DePalma", "text": "Murder of Jeannette DePalma\n\nThe murder of Jeannette DePalma (August 3, 1956 – c. August 7, 1972) is believed to have occurred sometime on or around August 7, 1972 in Springfield Township, New Jersey.\n\nThe case, currently unsolved, has become a matter of significant controversy due, in part, to coverage in \"Weird NJ\" magazine.\n\nOn the afternoon of Monday, August 7, 1972, 16-year-old Jeannette DePalma left her home on Clearview Road in Springfield Township, New Jersey, telling her mother that she was going to take a train to a friend's house.\n\nWhen she did not arrive at her friend's home or return later that evening, her parents filed a missing person report with the Springfield Police Department.\n\nSix weeks later, on September 19 her remains were found atop a cliff inside of Springfield's Houdaille Quarry. This occurred after a local dog brought her decomposing right forearm and hand back to its owner.\n\nAccording to several witnesses at the scene, Jeannette's skeletal remains were surrounded by a series of strange and possibly occult objects. Descriptions vary, but the most commonly agreed upon account states that the remains were found inside a coffin-shaped perimeter of fallen branches and logs, and inside this perimeter were several small makeshift wooden crosses.\n\nLater, some Springfield residents claimed that DePalma's remains were actually found lying on a pentagram, surrounded by mutilated animal remains. Law enforcement authorities have denied that this was true. Further controversy was aroused when it was discovered that the body had been found on a cliff known to locals for several decades as \"The Devil's Teeth\".\n\nThe Springfield Police Department began an investigation of Jeannette DePalma's death after an autopsy did not reveal a cause of death.\n\nHer remains and clothing showed no evidence of bone fractures, bullet wounds, or knife strikes. No drug paraphernalia was found on or around the body. For undisclosed reasons, the coroner suspected that strangulation was the cause of death, leading the Union County Prosecutor's Office to treat the case as an unsolved homicide. The coroner also discovered an unusually high amount of lead in the remains, but no explanation was found for this occurrence either.\n\nEarly in the investigation, the Springfield Police Department received a tip regarding a homeless man living in the woods near the place where the body was found. This man was known to locals simply as \"Red\", and it was alleged that he fled his campsite in the woods shortly after DePalma went missing. While this lead initially looked promising, the Union County Prosecutor's Office ultimately decided that \"Red\" had nothing to do with Jeannette's death.\n\nInvestigators continued to attempt to find leads, but due to the DePalma family's private nature, along with inconsistent stories told by her friends and peers, the case eventually went cold.\n\nAround two weeks after the discovery of DePalma's remains, several newspapers, including the \"Star-Ledger\" and the \"New York Daily News\", began reporting that she may have been the victim of an occult sacrifice carried out either by Satanists or by a local coven of witches who operated inside nearby Watchung Reservation.\n\nThis coverage was spurred by reports that the body had been found surrounded by strange objects, and by the theories of the DePalma family's Evangelical pastor, James Tate of the Assemblies of God Evangel Church. Rumors about the case set off a panic in several Union County communities, which were still recovering from the shock of the John List murders, which had occurred only 10 months earlier.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, \"Weird NJ\" magazine began to report on the decades-old cold case after receiving several anonymous letters regarding Jeannette's death.\n\nEditor and co-founder Mark Moran began investigating the case and wrote about many purportedly suspicious details, including the allegation that the Springfield Police Department had lost or destroyed the case file.\n\nThe Springfield Police Department maintains that the file was lost due to flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Others allege that a copy of it is still on file.\n\nMoran eventually teamed up with \"Weird NJ\" correspondent Jesse P. Pollack to write the book \"Death on the Devil's Teeth: The Strange Murder That Shocked Suburban New Jersey\". Throughout the course of their research, Pollack and Moran discovered several instances of a possible cover-up, connections to other unsolved murders, and previously unknown suspects.\n\n"}

The naga morsarang is created out of the horn of the water buffalo. \n\nNaga morsarang is one of several types of container in which the \"datu\" (Batak people's ritual specialist) kept a supernaturally powerful potion. The naga morsarang is made of horn of a water buffalo. A large naga morsarang vessel measures long and wide. As a container of a powerful potion, the naga morsarang is extensively decorated with complex patterns. The outer surface is incised thoroughly with complex designs. The pointed end of the horn is carved into the shape of a seated figure of a man, or sometimes more. The opening of the horn is plugged with a wooden stopper. This wooden stopper is always shaped into a figure of the singa, a Naga-like underground figures. Many additional figures are sometimes carved as mounting the singa e.g. the lizard Boraspati ni Tano, a human figure, or several human figures. These human figures may represent the \"datu\", owner of the naga morsarang, and the former \"datu\"s, former owners of the naga morsarang. Others think that these figures represent characters from Batak mythology.\n\nA figure of a lizard, which represents the earth deity Boraspati ni Tano, is sometimes carved inside the hollow of the horn.\n\nToba people believed that the spirits of the dead were able to influence the fate of the living. To gain favor from the spirits, the Toba performed elaborate rituals or sacrifices with the help of the datu, a male ritual specialist who acted as intermediaries between the human and supernatural world. The datu created magic books known as the pustaha which was used by him and by his disciples as a reference for his magic rituals. Among the contents of the pustaha are methods to create different kind of potions used for both white magic and black magic in a kind of complex magic ritual. Naga morsarang are used as container for these potions. \n\nOne example of a white magic potion is the \"pagar\", a potion used as a kind of amulet to protect from evil. The creation of \"pagar\" is very difficult, and can only be done on certain auspicious days. Most of the ingredients of a \"pagar\" are derived from plants, although sometimes chicken head, its entrails, and its feathers are included in the mixture. The ingredients for a \"pagar\" can only be gathered on certain sacred sites known as the \"sombaon\". Creation of a pagar took days or weeks. All the ingredients are then cooked and finely crushed into a kind of paste which is then stored in the naga morsarang.\n\nThe Karo version of the vessel known as \"perminaken/parminaken\" or \"guri-guri\". Instead of strictly a bull's horn, the \"perminaken\" may use other types of material for the vessel e.g. a bamboo, a gourd, or even a Ming period jar imported from China. The \"perminaken\" similarly use a wooden stopper with carvings of a figure of the singa, a person, or a person riding the singa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "66440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66440", "title": "Our Lady of Guadalupe", "text": "Our Lady of Guadalupe\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe (), also known as the Virgin of Guadalupe (), is a Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary associated with a venerated image enshrined within the Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. The basilica is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage site in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site. Pope Leo XIII granted the venerated image a Canonical Coronation on 12 October 1895.\nOfficial Catholic accounts state that the Virgin Mary appeared four times before Juan Diego and once more before Juan Diego's uncle. According to these accounts the first apparition occurred on the morning of December 9, 1531, when it is said that a native Mexican peasant named Juan Diego experienced a vision of a young woman at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which would become part of Villa de Guadalupe, a suburb of Mexico City. Speaking to Juan Diego in his native Nahuatl language (the language of the Aztec empire), the woman identified herself as the Virgin Mary, \"mother of the very true deity\" and asked for a church to be built at that site in her honor.\nBased on her words, Juan Diego then sought out the archbishop of Mexico City, Fray Juan de Zumárraga, to tell him what had happened. Not unexpected the bishop did not believe Diego, on the same day, Juan Diego saw the Virgin Mary for a second time (the second apparition); she asked him to keep insisting.\n\nOn Sunday, December 10, Juan Diego talked to the archbishop for a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac Hill, and ask the lady for a miraculous sign to prove her identity. That same day, the third apparition occurred when Diego returned to Tepeyac and encountering the Virgin Mary, reported the bishop's request for a sign; she consented to provide one on the following day (December 11).\n\nBy Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego's uncle Juan Bernardino had fallen sick and Juan Diego was obliged to attend to him. In the very early hours of Tuesday, December 12, Juan Bernardino's condition having deteriorated overnight, Juan Diego set out to Tlatelolco to fetch a priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and minister to him on his death-bed.\nIn order to avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's \"tilma\", or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.\n\nThe next day, on December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too had seen her, at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.\n\nThe bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected chapel. In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.\n\nJuan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular support. In the 19th century it became the rallying call of American-born Spaniards in New Spain, who saw the story of the apparition as legitimizing their own Mexican origin and infusing it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity – thus also legitimizing their armed rebellion against Spain.\n\nHistorically the devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe did not lack significant clerical opposition within Mexico and elsewhere, especially in the early years, and in more recent times some Catholic scholars, and even a former abbot of the basilica, Monsignor Guillermo Schulenburg, have openly doubted the historical existence of Juan Diego, referring to the devotion as merely symbolic, propagated by a sensational cult looking to bolster Catholic devotion from amongst the indigenous. Nonetheless, Juan Diego was canonized in 2002, under the name Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin.\n\nWhile the image garners much religious devotion and fervent Mexican patriotism, scholarly criticism on the image is also notable, considering the artistic disproportion of the image, the similarity of the image to Spanish pre-colonial artwork closely related to the Aztec colony at the time, the alleged relationship of Marcos Cipac de Aquino in either inventing or amending the tilma cloak, and the public declaration of the abbot of the Guadalupe shrine pertaining to the false existence of the Marian apparitions.\n\nFollowing the Conquest in 1519–21, the Spanish destroyed a temple of the mother goddess Tonantzin at Tepeyac outside Mexico City, and built a chapel dedicated to the Virgin on the site. Tonantzin (the beloved mother of the gods) was celebrated each winter solstice which occurred on different dates, the winter solstice of 1531 occurred on December 12, 1531 according to the UNAM. Newly converted natives continued to come from afar to worship there, often addressing the Virgin Mary as Tonantzin.\n\nWhat is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment (the \"Codex Escalada\") which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century. This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun that was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble.\n\nScholarly doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the document, however.\n\nA more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the \"Nican mopohua\", which was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880, and has been reliably dated in 1556. This document, written in Nahuatl, but in Latin script, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, called Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.\n\nIn spite of these documents, there are no written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by Catholic clergymen of the 16th century, as there ought to have been if the event had the importance it is claimed to have had. In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the story.\n\nThe written record that does exist suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the cult springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the cult, while the Dominicans supported it.\n\nThe main promoter of the cult was the Dominican Alonso de Montúfar, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zumárraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Montúfar commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\" referring to a painting on cloth (a tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the cult. He expressed concern that the Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an image:\n\n\"The devotion at the chapel...to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not.\"\n\nThe next day Archbishop Montúfar opened an inquiry into the matter. At the inquiry, the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's claim that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\". This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time. But \"if he did, he did so without making a preliminary sketch – in itself a near-miraculous procedure.[...] Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet\", claims Prof. Jody Brant Smith (referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979).\n\nUltimately Archbishop Montúfar (himself a Dominican) decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine. From then on the shrine was served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop. Moreover, Archbishop Montúfar authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was mounted and displayed.\n\nThe report of this 1556 inquiry is the most extensive documentation concerning the Virgin of Guadalupe from the 16th century, and significantly, it makes no mention of Juan Diego, the miraculous apparition, or any other element from the legend.\n\nIn the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahagún denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name \"Tonantzin\" to call Our Lady in a personal digression in his \"General History of the Things of New Spain\", in the version known as the Florentine Codex.\n\nAt this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess...And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also call her Tonantzin, being motivated by the preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. It is not known for certain where the beginning of this Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word means that ancient Tonantzin. And it is something that should be remedied, for the correct [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, is not Tonantzin, but \"Dios inantzin\". It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin.\n\nSahagún's criticism of the cult seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name \"Tonantzin\" to the Virgin Mary. However, Sahagún often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.\n\nIn the 16th century and probably continuing into the early 17th century, the image was modified by adding the mandorla-shaped sunburst around the Virgin, the stars on her cloak, the moon under her feet, and the angel with folded cloth supporting her—as was determined by an infrared and ocular study of the tilma in 1979.\n\nOne of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in \"Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe\", published in 1648 by Miguel Sánchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.\n\nAnother account is the Codex Escalada, dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the glyph of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. It also contains the following glosses: \"1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily\"\n\nThe next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, \"Huei tlamahuiçoltica\" (\"The Great Event\"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the \"Nican mopohua\" (\"Here it is recounted\"), which we have already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the \"Huei tlamahuiçoltica\" is assigned by a majority of scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647–1657.\nNevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the \"Nican Mopohua\", appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (ca. 1531–1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahagún.\nA manuscript version of the \"Nican Mopohua\", now held by the New York Public Library, \nappears to be datable to the mid-1500s, and may have been the original work by Valeriano that was used by Laso in composing the \"Huei tlamahuiçoltica\". Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship.\n\nOn the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name \"Origen milagroso del santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe,\" which was republished in Spain in 1675 as \"Felicidad de Mexico en la admirable aparición de la virgen María de Guadalupe y origen de su milagrosa Imagen, que se venera extramuros de aquella ciudad.\" In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published \"La Estrella del Norte de México\" with the history of the same apparitions.\n\nTwo separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century, and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but also note that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.\n\nWith the help of the \"Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666\", a feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).\n\nIn 1666, the Church in México began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support veneration. Because of the \"Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666\" in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true value of the apparitions and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.\n\nThese published accounts of the origin of the image venerated in Tepeyac increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, the original recipient of the vision. A new Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.\n\nThe image had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887–88. The change was first noticed on 23 February 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church. Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, “the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere… What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.\" it is unclear why the frame was lowered, which makes the covering of the crown not easily noticeable.\nA different crown was installed to the image. On 8 February 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on 12 October 1895. Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed \"Queen of Mexico\", \"Patroness of the Americas\", \"Empress of Latin America\", and \"Protectress of Unborn Children\" (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999). Under this title, she was also proclaimed \"Heavenly Patroness of the Philippines\" on 16 July 1935 by Pope Pius XI both witnessed and signed by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, a designation he later rescinded on 12 September 1942 upon becoming Pope Pius XII.\n\nOn 25 March 1966, Pope Paul VI presented a Golden Rose to the sacred image. Finally, under Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on 6 May 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him “protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples,\" with December 9 established as his feast day.\n\nAt that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zumárraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine \"Ixthus,\" in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the “recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.” In 1883 Joaquín García Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zumárraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.\n\nIn 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as \"Codex Escalada\"), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahagún, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997. Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\"\n\nIn the earliest account of the apparition, the \"Nican Mopohua\", the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name \"the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe.\"\n\nScholars do not agree as to how the name \"Guadalupe\" was ascribed to the image. Some believe that the Spanish transcribed or transliterated a Nahuatl name, as the site had long been an important sacred spot. Others hold that the Spanish name \"Guadalupe\" is the original name, and refers to the Spanish Our Lady of Guadalupe, Extremadura, whose cult had been important in Spain in the 16th century and had been brought to the New World with the Spanish conquest.\n\nThe first theory to promote a Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco. In his 1675 work \"Felicidad de Mexico\", Becerra Tanco claimed that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \"d\" and \"g\" sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.\n\nHe proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to \"Guadalupe\", \"Tecuatlanopeuh\" , which he translates as \"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\", and \"Tecuantlaxopeuh\" , \"she who banishes those who devoured us.\"\n\nOndina and Justo Gonzalez suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, \"Coātlaxopeuh\" , which they interpret as meaning “the one who crushes the serpent,” and that it may be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.\n\nAccording to another theory the juxtaposition of Guadalupe and a snake may indicate a nexus with the Aztec goddess of love and fertility, Tonantzin (in Nahuatl, \"Our Revered Mother\"), who was also known by the name Coatlícue (\"The Serpent Skirt\"). This appears to be borne out by the fact that this goddess had had a temple dedicated to her on the very Tepeyac Hill where Juan Diego had his vision, temple which had recently been destroyed at the behest of the new Catholic authorities. In the 16th century the Franciscans were suspicious that the cult of Guadalupe showed, or was susceptible to, elements of syncretism, i.e. the importation of an object of reverence in one belief system into another (see above).\n\nThe theory promoting the Spanish language origin of the name claims that:\n\n\n\nThe portrait was executed on a fabric support of natural material constituted by two pieces (originally three) joined together. The join is clearly visible as a seam passing from top to bottom, with the Virgin's face and hands and the head of the angel on the left piece. It passes through the left wrist of the Virgin. The fabric is mounted on a large metal sheet to which it has been glued for some time. The image, currently set in a massive frame protected behind bullet-proof glass, hangs inclined at a slight angle on the wall of the basilica behind the altar. At this point, there is a wide gap between the wall and the sanctuary facilitating closer viewing from moving walkways set on the floor beneath the main level of the basilica, carrying people a short distance in either direction. Viewed from the main body of the basilica, the image is located above and to the right of the altar and is retracted at night into a small vault (accessible by steps) set into the wall. An intricate metal crown designed by the painter Salomé Pina according to plans devised by Rómulo Escudero and Pérez Gallardo, and executed by the Parisian goldsmith, Edgar Morgan, is fixed above the image by a rod, and a massive Mexican flag is draped around and below the frame.\n\nThe nature of the fabric is discussed below. Its measurements were taken by José Ignacio Bartolache on December 29, 1786 in the presence of Joseph Bernardo de Nava, a public notary: height , width . The original height (before it was first shielded behind glass in the late 18th century, at which time the unpainted portion beyond the Virgin's head must have been cut down) was .\n\nNeither the fabric (\"the support\") nor the image (together, \"the tilma\") has been analyzed using the full range of resources now available to museum conservationists. Four technical studies have been conducted so far. Of these, the findings of at least three have been published. Each study required the permission of the custodians of the tilma in the Basilica. However, Callahan's study was taken at the initiative of a third party: the custodians did not know in advance what his research would reveal.\n\nSummary conclusions (\"contra\" indicates a contrary finding)\n\n\nReligious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage. In addition, due to the growth of Hispanic communities in the United States, religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches.\n\nThe iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic: Miguel Sanchez, the author of the 1648 tract \"Imagen de la Virgen María\", described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament's Revelation 12:1, \"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nVirgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity. Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl; her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called \"nahui-ollin,\" is inscribed beneath the image's sash. She was called \"mother of maguey,\" the source of the sacred beverage pulque. Pulque was also known as \"the milk of the Virgin.\" The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.\n\n\"Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe\" became the recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel Sánchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as \"Revelation's\" Woman of the Apocalypse, and said:\"...this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary ... [who had] prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.\"\n\nThroughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824–29) changed his name from José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the \"Patroness of the Americas\", the \"Empress of Latin America\", and the \"Protectress of Unborn Children\".\n\nIn 1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his \"Grito de Dolores,\" with the cry \"Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed \"the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors\" and \"they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.\" After Hidalgo's death leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named José María Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories:New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.\n\nSimón Bolívar noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: \"the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags ... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.\"\n\nIn 1912, Emiliano Zapata's peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform – \"tierra y libertad\" ('land and liberty') was the slogan of the uprising – when his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City they carried Guadalupan banners. More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their \"mobile city\" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.\n\nHarringon argues that:\n\nHernán Cortés, the Conquistador who overthrew the Aztec empire in 1521, was a native of Extremadura, home to Our Lady of Guadalupe. By the 16th century the Extremadura Guadalupe, a statue of the Virgin said to be carved by Saint Luke the Evangelist, was already a national icon. It was found at the beginning of the 14th century when the Virgin appeared to a humble shepherd and ordered him to dig at the site of the apparition. The recovered Virgin then miraculously helped to expel the Moors from Spain, and her small shrine evolved into the great Guadalupe monastery.\n\nAccording to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.\n\nGuadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously, \"the first mestiza\", or \"the first Mexican\". \"bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.\" As Jacques Lafaye wrote in \"Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe\", \"as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.\" The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a \"common denominator\" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences – linguistic, ethnic, and class-based – King says \"The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.\"\nThe Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes once said that \"you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.\" Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that \"the Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery\".\n\nOne notable reference in literature to La Virgen of Guadalupe and her predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzín, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises,\" from her collection \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\" (1991). Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124–29) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" De Leon, who at first didn't allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzín, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzín. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe, Juan Diego, and the tilma have been investigated through film several times in recent history. One of the most notable and thorough filmic investigations was done by director Tim Watkins in the 2013 film The Blood & The Rose. Documentarians have been portraying the message of Our Lady of Guadalupe since the 1990s in an attempt to bring the message of the apparition to the North American audience.\n\nSeveral Pontiffs have honored the image, specifically:\n\nRoman Catholic sources claim that the original image has many miraculous and supernatural properties, including that the tilma has maintained its structural integrity for approximately 500 years despite exposure to soot, candle wax, incense, constant manual veneration by devotees, the historical fact that the image was displayed without any protective glass for its first 115 years, while replicas normally endure for only circa 15 years before degrading, and that it repaired itself with no external assistance after a 1791 accident in which nitric acid was spilled on its top right, causing considerable damage but leaving the aureola of the Virgin intact.\n\nFurthermore, on 14 November 1921 a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic secularist exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine's museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.\n\nIn 1929 and 1951 photographers claimed to have found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the Purkinje effect, commonly found in human eyes. An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the tilma was first revealed before Zumárraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, in the center of the Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all.\n\nNumerous Catholic websites repeat the claim that in 1936 biochemist Richard Kuhn analyzed a sample of the fabric and announced that the pigments used were from no known source, whether animal, mineral, or vegetable.. According to \"The Wonder of Guadalupe\" by Francis Johnston, this was requested by Professor Hahn and Professor Marcelino Junco, retired professor of organic chemistry at the National University of Mexico. \n\nDr. Philip Serna Callahan, who photographed the icon under infrared light, declared from his photographs that portions of the face, hands, robe, and mantle had been painted in one step, with no sketches or corrections and no visible brush strokes.\n\nThe shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.\n\nThe Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas. Replicas of the tilma can be found in thousands of churches throughout the world, and numerous parishes bear her name.\n\nDue to a claim that her black girdle indicates pregnancy on the image, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as \"Patroness of the Unborn\" and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Pauline privilege is drawn from the apostle Paul's instructions in the First Epistle to the Corinthians.\n\nThe Pauline privilege is the allowance by the Church of the dissolution of marriage of two persons not baptized at the time the marriage occurred.\n\n1 Corinthians 7:10–15 states:\nThe first section, \"not I but the Lord\", roughly matches Jesus' teaching on divorce, found in an antithesis () with parallels in Matthew 19:9, Luke 16:18, and Mark 10:11. The second section, \"I say, not the Lord\", gives Paul's own teaching on divorce, and was initiated to address a serious pastoral problem in the Church in Corinth where problems apparently developed in marriages between believers and unbelievers. Therefore, in instances where the unbaptized spouse left the newly baptized spouse, Paul allowed the latter to enter into a new marriage. \n\nIn the Catholic Church and in some Protestant denominations this is interpreted as allowing the dissolution of a marriage between two non-baptized persons in the case that one (but not both) of the partners seeks baptism and converts to Christianity and the other partner leaves the marriage. Assuming it is established that both spouses were un-baptized at the time of their marriage, and subsequently obtained a civil divorce, should the now baptized party wish to enter into a sacramental marriage, the Pauline Privilege (\"in favor of the faith\") takes place \"ipso facto\" at the time of that marriage. \n\nIn the Latin Church, the subject is covered in canons 1143–1147 and can be handled on the diocesan level. For the Eastern Catholic Churches the applicable canons are found in the \"Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches\", canons 854–858.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Church's canon law, the Pauline privilege does not apply when either of the partners was a Christian at the time of marriage. It differs from annulment because it dissolves a valid natural (but not sacramental) marriage whereas an annulment declares that a marriage was invalid from the beginning.\n\nThe related Petrine privilege, which also allows remarriage after divorce, may be invoked if only one of the partners was baptized at the time of the first marriage.\n\n\n"}

Its ruins are located on the outskirts of the modern city of Charsadda, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Its ruins are located on the banks of Swat River, near its junction with Kabul River. Pushkalavati was the capital of the ancient Gandhara kingdom before the 6th century BCE, when it became an Achaemenid regional capital, and it remained an important city until the 2nd century CE.\n\nThe region around ancient Pushkulavati was recorded in the Zoroastrian \"Zend Avesta\" as \"Vaēkərəta\", or the seventh most beautiful place on earth created by Ahura Mazda. It was known as the \"crown jewel\" of Bactria, and held sway over nearby ancient Taxila'.\n\nPushkalavati (Sanskrit: पुष्कलावती, ) means \"Lotus City\" in Sanskrit. According to the \"Ramayana\", it was named Pushkalavati because it was founded by Pushkala, the son of Bharat (and hence nephew of Hindu deity Rama).\n\nThe ruins of Pushkalavati consist of many stupas and the sites of two ancient cities.\n\nBala Hisar site in this area was first occupied in the 2nd millennium BCE.\n\nIn later 6th century BCE, Pushkalavati became the capital of the Achaemenid Gandhara satrapy. The location was first excavated in 1902 by the archaeologist John Marshall. Sir Mortimer Wheeler conducted some excavations there in 1962, and identified various Achaemenid remains.\n\nLater in the regions historical chronology, King Ashoka built a stupa there which was described by Xuanzang when he visited in 630 CE, which to this day remains unidentified and undiscovered.\n\nThe Bactrian Greeks built a new city (Peucela or Peucelaitis) at this site which lies one kilometre from Bala Hissar on the other side of the branch of River Jinde. This city was occupied by Parthian, Sakas and Kushans and subsequently became known as Shaikhan Dheri (AKA Shaikhn Dher, etc.). In the 2nd century CE, river changed its course and city was flooded. The town moved to the site of the modern village of Rajjar.\n\nThe former city's ruins were partly excavated by Ahmad Hasan Dani in 1960s. There are still many mounds at Mir Ziarat, at Rajar and Shahr-i-Napursan which are still unexcavated.\n\nThe city of Pushkalavati was situated at the confluence of Swat and Kabul rivers. Three different branches of Kabul river meet there. That specific place is still called Prang and considered sacred. A grand graveyard is situated to the north of Prang where the local people bring their dead for burial. This graveyard is considered to be among the largest graveyards in the world.\n\nIn the concluding portion of the (Ramayana) Uttarakhanda or Supplemental Book (chaps. 101, 113-41, 200), the descendants of Rama and his brothers are described as the founders of the great cities and kingdoms which flourished in Western India.\n\nBharata the brother of Rama had two sons, Taksha and Pushkala. The former founded Taksha-sila or Taxila, to the east of the Indus, and known to Alexander and the Greeks as Taxila. The latter founded Pushkala-vati or Pushkalavati, to the west of the Indus, and known to Alexander and the Greeks as Peukelaotis. Thus the sons of Bharat are said to have founded kingdoms which flourished on either side of the Indus river.\n\n"}

In spite of the famous saying \"below 40 degrees south there is no law; below 50 degrees south there is no God\" the exploration of the continent was in fact closely connected to religious activities with contributions from many adherents (e.g. Jesuit geophysicists). Some of the early religious buildings are now protected as important historical monuments.\nChristian buildings are the only religious buildings on the continent.\n\nA cross on Wind Vane Hill, Cape Evans, was erected by the Ross Sea Party, led by Captain Aeneas Mackintosh, of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917, in memory of three members of the party who died in the vicinity in 1916. The cross has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 17), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.\n\nThe first complete religious service in Antarctica was performed in 1947 by William Menster (1913–2007), Lieutenant Commander of the United States Navy during Operation Highjump. During a Catholic service held in a tent set up on land, he consecrated Antarctica. Ministering to approximately 2,000 men from a variety of Christian denominations gave him experience in leading ecumenical services.\n\nAlthough they are used mostly for Christian worship, the Chapel of the Snows has also been used for Buddhist and Bahai ceremonies. Some of the buildings are among historically important sites and under protection, such as the Chilean Captain Arturo Prat Base's wooden cross and a Statue of Our Lady of the Carmel. \nWhile the Pakistan program at Jinnah Antarctic Station brought Muslims to Antarctica in 1991, there are currently no mosques on the continent or on any of the outlying islands, as the most optimal ways of observing Islamic religious customs there are still being determined.\n\nAround 1900, whaling stations and expedition camps were erected in the larger area. After World War II, some military expeditions explored the region. The International Geophysical Year (1957–1958) marked the end of a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between East and West had been seriously interrupted and has since contributed to civil scientific exploration. Since the 1950s, most stations in Antarctica have been constructed exclusively for scientific research. Extended stays in the region can be an extremely stressful experience for the researchers who often have been separated from their families for months at a time. Jesuits, which have had a long tradition of geophysical research in Antarctica, contributed as well to the early Antarctic missions. Notable Jesuit seismicity scholars like Edward A. Bradley (compare Bradley Nunatak), Henry F. Birkenhauer (compare Birkenhauer Island) and J. Joseph Lynch and Daniel J. Linehan have been among those.\n\nThe first churches south of the Antarctic Convergence and north of 60° S latitude (and thus not part of the Antarctic Treaty System) are Notre-Dame des Vents at Port-aux-Français on the main island of Kerguelen and the Norwegian Lutheran Church (Grytviken, South Georgia), a Lutheran chapel in Grytviken, South Georgia (since 1913). After years of abandonment and weathering the harsh elements of the region (roof damaged in 1994), the Grytviken church was renovated by the keepers of South Georgia Museum and volunteers in 1996–1998 and now serves for occasional church services and marriage ceremonies.\n\nSome churches north of the Antarctic Convergence serve Antarctic territories, such as the Christ Church Cathedral in Stanley, which is the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world. It serves as the parish church not only for the Falkland Islands, but also South Georgia and the British Antarctic Territory. Punta Arenas in the southern tip of the South American mainland (just north of Tierra del Fuego) also has a Roman Catholic cathedral, which serves the Chilean Antarctic Territory.\n\nChristians have increasingly turned toward Internet communications for fellowship in the 21st century.\n\nOut of nearly 90 stations in Antarctica, half are only used in summer months. Most research stations have a small meeting room dual-purposed for religious assemblies. Larger stations and communities use a separate room, often a makeshift steel container for religious purposes.\n\nThe Chapel of the Snows was erected in 1956 as a Christian chapel used by several denominations, at McMurdo Station, Ross Island. The Chapel offers various Protestant and Catholic services, but also allows for meetings of other religions, such as Latter Day Saints, Bahai and Buddhists and is used as well for secular groups (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous). The chapel had been rebuilt after a fire in 1978 and was reconsecrated in 1989. \n\nThe majority of Catholic Antarctic sites exist due to the Argentine and Chilean presence on the Continent. The Worldwide Antarctic Program proposes building a Catholic chapel at Mario Zucchelli Station, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica; while the first Catholic chapel (named after Saint Francis of Assisi) was built in 1976 at the Argentine Esperanza Base. The southernmost Christian chapel (in fact, the southernmost place of worship of any religion) lies at the Argentine Belgrano II Base at Coats Land. It is a permanent Catholic chapel made entirely of ice.\n\nFurther dedicated religious buildings are the Chapel of Santisima Virgen de Lujan, Antarctica, a Catholic chapel at Marambio Base, Seymour Island, San Francisco de Asis Chapel, a Catholic chapel at Esperanza Base, Antarctic Peninsula and Santa Maria Reina de la Paz Church, a Catholic church at the Villa Las Estrellas, South Shetland Islands. Santa María Reina de la Paz is a repurposed container allowing for 36 persons to convene.\n\nThere is a small Catholic shrine near McMurdo Station called \"Our Lady of the Snows.\" Popularly known as \"Roll Cage Mary,\" the shrine was dedicated to a United States Navy Seabee who was killed during the construction of the station. It has been maintained by Carmelite nuns in New Zealand.\n\nReligious activities were halted during the Soviet Antarctic Expedition. However, this changed with the fall of the Soviet Union and the Communism within Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe St. Ivan Rilski Chapel, a Bulgarian Orthodox chapel at St. Kliment Ohridski Base, South Shetland Islands was built in 2003 and is the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica, and was the southernmost Eastern Orthodox building of worship in the world till 2011 when St Volodymyr (Vladimir the Great) Chapel at Ukrainian Vernadsky Research Base was erected. \n\nThe Buromsky Island cemetery belongs among the most important monuments in the region. A Russian orthodox cross has been erected in the meanwhile to mark the site. The island holds a cemetery for about 60 citizens of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and Switzerland who died in the performance of their duties while serving as members of Soviet and Russian Antarctic expeditions. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 9) following a proposal by Russia to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.\n\nIn 2002 Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow asked for a \"Temple for Antarctica\" (Храм Антарктиде) and initiated the Trinity Church, Antarctica, a Russian Orthodox church at Bellingshausen Station, South Shetland Islands. The Church is being positioned as a widely visible landmark and is maintained by the Moscow Patriarch. It was first maintained by a single priest. In the meanwhile two priests maintain the services, which are being exchanged annually. They both contribute to the maintenance of the overall station. January 29, 2007 saw the first church wedding on Antarctica, between a Chilean and Russian. The first baptism (for adults) also took place there.\n"}

Sāmagāna is purpose of creation of Samaveda.\n\nSāma is singing of hymns from Rigveda alone and not from other Veda-s. \"richi adhyoodham sama\" ऋचि अध्यूढ्रम साम (Chhandog Upnishad 1.6.1). Hence Sāma is composition of words in Rigvedic hymns into notes. The richā-s or hymns of Rigveda are called yoni or ādhāra as they form the base of Sāmagān. In musicological parlance Sāma Veda has taken mātu (words) from Rigveda and provided dhātu (notes) to these words. (Bharatiya Sangeet Ka Itihaas. Dr. Thakur Jaidev Singh.

In 'Sāmatarpana' there are a maximum of 13 Āchārya-s but today there are only three branches.\n1. Rān#aneeya राणानीय\n2. Kouthumeeya कौथ्हुमीय\n3.

Shri Satvalekar in preface to Sāmaveda Samhita has given the following table of songs.\n\nFox Strangways in Music of Hindustan says, \"Vocal scales are conceived downwards. They are so conceived, because the telling notes of the voice in its upper register, and this presents itself, therefore as the starting point for a vocal scale.\" The Sāyana#-bhāshya (critique) on Sāma-vidhāna Brāhmana establishes that note of Sāma were of nidhana prakriti (diminishing nature) and followed a descending order.\n\nIn Naradiya Shiksha the seven notes of Sāma are First, Second, Third, Fourth, Mandra, Krushta and Atiswāra. This indicates that initially only three or four notes were used for Sāmagāna.\nĀrchika songs were sung on the basis of just one note, e.g. Sa Sa Sa, or Ni Ni Ni. This kind of chanting was well suited to Havana, Mantra-pātha and Japa\nGāthik songs were hymns in praise of deities and used two notes, e.g. Ni Ni Ni Ni, Sa Sa Sa Sa.\nSāmic songs for the first time used three notes. The word Sāmic is taken to mean three notes. The songs were like Ga Ga Re Re Sa Sa Sa.\n\nApart from these three basic notes, the singers came across a fourth which they called Swarāntara. When they discovered a note lower than the lowest known note they called it Mandra. When a still lower note than Mandra was found they called it Atiswāra. A higher note determined was called Krushta after Sanskrit root Krush (to scream, speak loudly). So the complete Sāmic Saptaka in descending order contains:\n\nTo preserve the Sāmik notes, Raga Sāmeshwari was created. Dr. Lalmani Misra first translated the notes M G R S D N P into Shadja gram—S N D P G M R—and then created a Raga which is performed in the evening.\n\nShruti-jāti is defined as the way in which a particular note could be applied to make the song appealing. There are five with individual signs for three shruti-jāti-s.\n\nA Rishi in Rig Veda is an author of a \"Rik\", a hymn mantra, derived from oral tradition and direct insight, not from reasoning or intellect. The term Rishi is defined as \"rishati jnānena samsāra-pāram” meaning one who goes beyond the mundane world by means of knowledge. Further, some scholars think the root 'drish' (sight) might have given rise to root 'rish' meaning 'to see'.\n\nSri Aurobindo described Shruthi as \"divine recordings of cosmic sounds of truth\" heard by the Rishis. The Vedas are thus Shruthis, revealed scriptures.\n\nThe Rig Veda contains 10,552 hymns; grouped into 1,028 Sukthas each of roughly ten mantras, spread over ten Mandalas (Books). The Mandalas are of differing sizes. These mantra songs are authored by some 400 Rishis of whom about 30 were women.\n\nCertain texts called Anukramani (also called Anukramanika) serve as Index to the Rig Veda and provide information about each hymn of the Rig Veda. The most well-known of the Aukramani is Katyayana’s sarvanukramani and is dated around the 2nd century.\n\n\n\n"}

In the context of the oracle bones of ancient China, which chiefly utilized both scapulae and the plastrons of turtle, \"scapulimancy\" is sometimes used in a very broad sense to jointly refer to both scapulimancy and plastromancy (similar divination using plastrons). However, the term \"osteomancy\" might be more appropriate, referring to divination using bones. Many archaeological sites along the south coast and offlying islands of the Korean peninsula show that deer and pig scapulae were used in divination during the Korean Protohistoric Period, c. 300 BC - AD 300/400.\n\nHistorically, scapulimancy has taken two major forms. In the first, \"apyromantic\", the scapula of an animal was simply examined after its slaughter. This form was widespread in Europe, Northern Africa and the Near East. However, the second form, \"pyromantic\" scapulimancy, involving the heating or burning of the bone and interpretation of the results, was practiced in East Asia and North America.\n\nScapulimancy was also mentioned in Chapter 5 of the Kojiki, the Japanese Record of Ancient Matters, in which the heavenly deities used this process of divination during a consultation by lesser gods.\n\nIt is also a method of divination among Greek and Serb farmers, even today. It is probably of extremely ancient origin. More recently, references are found in the memoirs of several warriors who fought during the Greek War of Independence. Whenever they had a feast, they used to roast lambs or kids, and after the meal, anyone who knew how to \"read\" the scapula would clean it of any remaining flesh and, lifting it up to the light, would interpret the various shadowy bits showing on the transparent part of the bone. A clear scapula was a good omen. Shadowy bits had their interpretation and by this they used to predict the outcome of a battle on the morrow, death or survival.\n\nIn Renaissance magic, scapulimancy (known as \"spatulamancy\") was classified as one of the seven \"forbidden arts,\" along with necromancy, geomancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and hydromancy.\n\n\n"}

Following the usual practice of the High Court, it has been interpreted far more narrowly than the equivalent US sections and no law has ever been struck down for contravening the section. Today, the Commonwealth Government provides broad-based funding to religious schools and also funds school chaplains for public and private schools. All Australian parliaments are opened with a Christian prayer, and the preamble to the Australian Constitution refers to a \"humbl[e] rel[iance] on the blessing of Almighty God.\"\n\nAlthough the Australian monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, also British monarch and Governor of the Church of England, her Australian title is unrelated to her religious office and she has no role in the Anglican Church of Australia. The prohibition against religious tests has allowed former Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Peter Hollingworth to be appointed Governor-General of Australia, the highest domestic constitutional officer; however, this was criticised.\n\nDespite inclusion in the \"States\" chapter, Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions.

There have been two referenda to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed. In each case the changes were grouped with other changes and voters did not have the opportunity to expressly accept only one change. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the NSW act allowing same-sex couples to adopt permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them.\n\nThe current situation, described as a \"principle of state neutrality\" rather than \"separation of church and state\", has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups. On the one hand, secularists have argued that government neutrality to religions leads to a \"flawed democrac[y]\" or even a \"pluralistic theocracy\" as the government cannot be neutral towards the religion of people who do not have one. On the other hand, religious groups and others have been concerned that state governments are restricting them from exercising their religion by preventing them from criticising other groups and preventing them from refraining to do acts that they may deem unconscionable to their faith.\n\n"}

He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008, The Rome Prize in 2001 and a Visual Artist Fellowship from Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advance Study in 2007. His work spans a variety of media, including photography, site-specific installation, multiple channel immersive video installation, performance, and new media. Much of Attie's practice explores how a wide range of contemporary media may be used to re-imagine new relationships between space, time, place, and identity. Much, though not all, of Attie's work in the 90s dealt with the history of the second world war. He first garnered significant international attention by slide projecting images of past Jewish life onto contemporary locations in Berlin. More recent projects have involved using a range of media to engage local communities to find new ways of representing their history, memory and potential futures. Attie's artworks and interventions are site-specific and immersive in nature, and tend to engage subject matter that is both social, political and psychological. In 2013, Five monographs have been published on Attie's work, which has also been the subject of a number of films, which have aired on PBS, BBC, and ARD. Since receiving his MFA Degree in 1991, Attie has realized approximately 25 major projects in ten countries around the world. Most recently, in 2013-14, Shimon Attie was awarded the Lee Krasner Lifetime Achievement Award in Art.\n\nHe was born in 1957 and received an MFA in 1991. In 1991 he moved to Germany from his previous home in Northern California, and began to make work initially about Jewish identity and the history of the second world war. His work later evolved to engage broader issues of memory, place and identity more generally. Shimon Attie\nmoved to New York City in 1997.\n\nShimon Attie's work has been extensively reviewed by a wide variety of publications, including features and/or reviews in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Art in America, Art News, Art Forum, The Village Voice, The Boston Globe, and many others.\n\nSamples include:\n\nYasaman Alipour, writing in \"The Brooklyn Rail: Critical Perspectives on Arts, Politics, and Culture\", on Shimon Attie's solo exhibition \"Facts on the Ground\" at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York City:\n\n\"Celebrated for his approach, which blurs the line between installation and photography, Attie has spent his career moving from one city to the next to explore the trauma and history of the marginalized and to reflect on social memory and the construction of Identity. Seductive, daring, and clever, Facts on the Ground dives into the inherently charged and polarized politics of its subject matter.

{"id": "840978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840978", "title": "Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera", "text": "Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera\n\nTomás Cipriano Ignacio María de Mosquera-Figueroa y Arboleda-Salazar (September 26, 1798 – October 7, 1878) was a Colombian general and political figure. He was president of Colombia four times. The first time was as president of Republic of New Granada from 1845 to 1849. During the Colombian Civil War of 1860–1862 he led liberal forces in a civil war against conservative factions. After the liberals won, a new, federalist constitution was implemented, which established a two-year presidency, and the nation renamed the United States of Colombia. Mosquera served twice as president of the new government. From 1861 to 1862 he served in a non-elected, interim manner, while the constitution was written. From 1862 to 1864 he served in an elected manner. He had a fourth term from 1866 to 1867. Due to the liberal reforms carried out under his leadership, he is considered one of the most important persons in Colombian history of the 19th century.\n\nDue to large facial wounds received during a battle in 1824, he required the use of a metal prosthesis in his jaw. This affected his ability to speak, which was marked by blowing and whistling sounds. As a result, Mosquera was derisively nicknamed \"Mascachochas\" (Gaga-chew) by some of his contemporary critics.\n\nMosquera was born in Popayán, on September 26, 1798. His parents were wealthy farm-owner José María de Mosquera-Figueroa y Arboleda and María Manuela de Arboleda y Arrachea, both from prestigious families. His brother Joaquín was President of Gran Colombia, his brother Manuel José was Archbishop of Bogotá, and his brother Manuel María was a diplomat.\n\nGeneral Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera married twice. As was the custom among bourgeoisie at the time, both times he married maternal relatives. His first marriage was to Mariana Benvenuta Arboleda Arroyo, but it has been characterized as unhappy as a result of the frequent cheating of Mosquera, who had a number of children outside of marriage. When Mariana died, he contracted marriage on 1872 to María Ignacia Arboleda Arboleda. Mosquera was 78 at the time, and reportedly when he proposed to her he said, 'Would you like to be the widow of General Mosquera?' In total he had eight children (with: Mariana Arboleda -Anibal Mosquera and Amalia Mosquera-; María Ignacia Arboleda -José Bolívar Mosquera-; Paula Luque -Clelia Mosquera, Teodulia Mosquera, Isabel Mosquera-; María Lorza -María Engracia Mosquera-; Candelaria Cervantes -Tomás Cervantes Mosquera-).\n\nMosquera was a self-taught mathematician, historian, and writer, well-versed in Latin, English, French and Italian and wrote different books about philosophy and politics that have academical recognition.\n\nAlready by 1814 he was involved in the independence movement and he was under command of General Simón Bolívar. By 1824 he had already been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and in that year he battled the royalist Spanish Army under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Agustín Agualongo, in Barbacoas, (Nariño). It was in this battle that he received the shot that broke his lower jaw and impaired his speech, and that made him the object of the infamous nickname of \"Mascachochas.\" His prowess in battle was awarded by a promotion to colonel, and he became governor of a number of provinces in the southwest of the country (Buenaventura, Guayaquil, Cauca), at the same time raising among the ranks, and being promoted to general in 1829.\n\nMosquera was a diplomat in Perú between 1829 and 1830, and subsequently he was a diplomat in various countries in Europe and in the United States (1830–1833). At his return he became a congressman (1834–1837), and later Secretary of War for the conservative government of José Ignacio de Márquez. As secretary of war, Mosquera commanded and was victorious in the War of the Supremes in 1840. He was later sent as ambassador to Perú, Chile and Bolivia, between 1842 and 1845.\n\nIn 1845, the so-called ministerial sector (who later would form the Conservative Party) supported Mosquera as a candidate for Presidency, and he was victorious. During his administration he emphasized economic opening up. In 1846 his administration signed the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty with the United States. He also was influential in the suppression of remnant colonial taxes, and reinvigorated the tobacco industry. It was also during his term that the International System of Units was implemented. Mosquera also started political measures to separate the State and Catholic Church. He also hired Thomas Reed to direct the building of Capitolio Nacional. His administration was also first one in the history of the Country to conduct a census. Finally, he promoted steam navigation over the Magdalena River, when he authorized in 1849 that exports could pass by the port of Barranquilla.\n\nHis political measures were frowned upon by the sectors that had previously supported him in his presidential election, and he was much closer to liberals. By the end of his term he moved to New York city to devote in his family business, and he created an international trade house in there which went bankrupt. While in New York, he wrote his 'Memoria sobre geografía física y política de Nueva Granada', one of his many treatises in Colombian geography. He was member of a number of scientific societies in Latin America and Europe. He went back to Colombia some years later to fight the so-called artisans' revolution, and to defeat the dictatorship of José María Melo in 1854. By then he had fully converted to the liberal party, and as such he was a representative and senator in the Congress, as well as a candidate to presidential reelection in 1857, which he lost to conservative Mariano Ospina Rodríguez. With the creation of Granadine Confederation, Mosquera was elected president of the Cauca State, a position from which he made opposition to president Ospina, to whom he accused of disrespecting the states' autonomy.\n\nIn 1860 Mosquera declared the secession of the Cauca State and declared war to the Granadine Confederation. He soon received support from the states of Santander and Tolima, which proclaimed him governor. After heavy battles Colombian Civil War, Mosquera was able to seize the power in 1861, after which he promoted the creation of the United States of Colombia.\n\nDuring his second term as president (1861–1863), Mosquera enacted a number of decrees aimed to control the power of Catholic Church, selling a lot of its properties -to impulse the economy giving them to the poor Colombian people-, and banning Jesuits from the country for their open support for the Conservative faction. Despite some dissent, a federal and liberal constitution was proclaimed that guaranteed rights to citizens and was supported by all the signers. It was decided that Mosquera should complete the first two-year term as President of the United States of Colombia, until April 1864.\n\nThis third term included a war to Ecuador in 1863, and he commanded personally the Colombian army to victory. This would be the only international conflict to date between the two countries. At the end of his term he travelled to Paris as ambassador.\n\nIn 1866 Mosquera went back to Colombia, to be elected President for the fourth time, despite the opposition of radical liberals. Nevertheless, tensions with the Catholic Church led to strong intervention by Pope Pius IX, and his use of dictatorial measures (such as the closing of the ordinary sessions of Congress in 1867) led the opposition to orchestrate a coup d'état on May 23, 1867. His enemies were besides aware that Mosquera was ready to sue corrupted politicians that had taken advantage of the properties that belonged to the Catholic Church and were assigned to the poor ones. He was exiled for the three next years, during which he lived in Lima, where he wrote his book 'Cosmogonía. Estudio sobre los diversos sistemas de la creación del universo' (Cosmogony. A study of the diverse systems of the creation of the universe). Back in Colombia by 1871, he ran for president again but failed, although he was elected to the presidency of Cauca State until 1873. He was a senator again in 1876.\n\nHe died October 7, 1878 in his farm Coconuco, in Puracé, close to Popayán. He was buried in the Panteón de los Próceres cemetery in Popayán.\n\n\n"}
