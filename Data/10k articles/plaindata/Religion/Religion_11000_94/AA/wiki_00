{"id": "597248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=597248", "title": "Anusim", "text": "Anusim\n\nAnusim (, ; singular male, anús, ; singular female, anusáh, , meaning \"coerced\") is a legal category of Jews in \"halakha\" (Jewish law) who were forced to abandon Judaism against their will, typically while forcibly converted to another religion. The term \"anusim\" is most properly translated as the \"coerced [ones]\" or the \"forced [ones]\".\n\nThe term \"anusim\" derives from the Talmudic phrase \"averah b’ones\" (), meaning \"a forced transgression.\" The Hebrew \"ones\" (pronounced \"oh'nes\") derives from the triconsonantal root א-נ-ס (Aleph-Nun-Samekh), and originally referred to any case where a person has been forced into any act against his or her will. In Modern Hebrew, the word \"ones\" is mainly used to mean rape, thus \"anusim\" (or female \"anusot\") nowadays means rape victims - the older meaning used only in the historical context.\n\nThe term \"anús\" is used in contradistinction to \"meshumad\" (), which means a person who has voluntarily abandoned the practice of Jewish law in whole or part. The forced converts were also known as \"cristianos nuevos\" (Spanish) or \"cristãos-novos\" (Portuguese); \"converso\" or \"marrano\", which had and still has today a pejorative connotation in Spanish.\n\nBesides the term \"anusim\", halakha has various classifications for those Jews who have abandoned, or are no longer committed to, the rabbinic Jewish tradition, whether or not they have converted to another religion. \n\nThe two most common descriptions are:\n\n\nThe main difference between a \"min\", a \"meshumad\", and the \"anusim\" is that the act of abandonment of Judaism is voluntary for a \"min\" and a \"meshumad\", while for the \"anusim\" it is not.\n\nIn more recent times, the term Anusim has also been used to describe Reverse Marranos, that is, Haredi Jews who are religious on the outside, but are not necessarily practicing in private.\n\nThe term \"anusim\" became more frequently used after the forced conversion to Christianity of Ashkenazi Jews in Germany at the end of the 11th century. In his religious legal opinions, Rashi, a French rabbi who lived during this period, commented about the issue of anusim.\n\nSeveral centuries later, following the mass forced conversion of Sephardi Jews (those Jews with extended histories in Spain and Portugal, known jointly as Iberia, or \"Sepharad\" in Hebrew) of the 15th and 16th centuries, the term \"anusim\" became widely used by Spanish rabbis and their successors for the following 600 years, henceforth becoming associated with Sephardic history.\n\nThe term may be properly applied to any Jew of any ethnic division. Since that time, it has also been applied to other forced or coerced converted Jews, such as the Mashadi Jews of Persia (modern Iran), who converted to Islam in the public eye, but secretly practised Judaism at home. They lived dual-religious lives, being fully practising Muslims in public life, and fully practising Jews at home.\n\nIn non-rabbinic literature, the more widely known Sephardic anusim are also referred to as:\n\nThe subject of anusim has a special place in rabbinic literature. In normal circumstances, a person who abandons Jewish observance, or part of it, is classified as a \"meshumad\". Such a person is still counted as a Jew for purposes of lineage, but is under a disability to claim any privilege pertaining to Jewish status: for example, he should not be counted in a minyan, that is, a quorum for religious services.\n\n\"Anusim\", by contrast, not only remain Jews by lineage but continue to count as fully qualified Jews for all purposes. Since the act of the original abandonment of the religion was done against the Jew’s will, the Jew under force may remain a kosher Jew, as long as the \"anús\" keeps practising Jewish law to the best of his/her abilities under the coerced condition. In this sense, \"kosher\" is the rabbinic legal term applied to a Jew who adheres to rabbinic tradition and is accordingly not subject to any disqualification.\n\nSe‘adyá ben Maimón ibn Danan in the 15th century stated:\nBen-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of the State of Israel, stated in the mid-20th century:\nIt follows that Uziel considered \"anusím\" as Jews, because only Jews can give or receive a \"get\", a Jewish divorce. Maimonides stated in the Mishneh Torah Sefer Shofetím, Hilekhót Mumarím 3:3:\n\nThere is much controversy regarding the status of conversions today. While the chief rabbis are wary of converting large groups, there are some rabbis such as Haim Amsalem and Chuck Davidson who have done mass conversions of Bnei Anusim against the will of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. In the United States Reform rabbi Jacques Cukierkorn is one of the leaders of the outreach to the descendants of those Crypto-Jews who wish to renew their ties with the Jewish people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5204766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5204766", "title": "Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education", "text": "Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education\n\nThe Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education (BIHE), is a unique open university in Iran, which has been portrayed as an underground university, established by the Bahá'í community of Iran in 1987 to meet the educational needs of young people who have been systematically denied access to higher education by the Iranian government. Currently, through a main faculty in Iran and an Affiliated Global Faculty from universities around the world, BIHE offers a total of 38 undergraduate and graduate programs in Sciences, Engineering, Business and Management, Humanities, and Social Sciences. More than 80 universities in North America, Europe, and Australia have thus far accepted the BIHE's graduates directly into programs of graduate study at the masters and doctoral levels. BIHE has a decentralized and fluid structure and uses a hybrid approach of offline and online delivery methods which has enabled it to grow under unusual sociopolitical circumstances. Despite numerous arrests, periodic raids, several imprisonments, mass confiscation of school equipment and general harassment, BIHE has continued and even expanded its operation. BIHE has received praise for offering a non-violent, creative, and constructive response to ongoing oppression.\n\nSince its birth in the 19th century, the Bahá'í community of Iran has faced different forms of persecution including hostile propaganda and censorship, social exclusion, denial of education and employment, confiscation and destruction of property, arson, unjustified arrests and imprisonment, physical and psychological torture, death threats, arbitrary executions and disappearances. The Islamic Revolution of 1979 intensified the persecutions and made Bahá'ís - the largest religious minority of the country - the target of a systematic state-sponsored campaign of repression. Within this ongoing campaign, over two hundred Bahá'ís have been executed; thousands more have been imprisoned, have lost their jobs, been denied their pensions, been expelled from schools and universities, been denied health care, had their personal property plundered, and had their grave sites defiled. The modern persecution of Iranian Bahá’ís now continues in its fourth decade. In the 2016 annual report to the UN General Assembly, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, refers to the Bahá'í community of Iran as “the most severely persecuted religious minority” of the country.\n\nThe denial of the right to higher education is a tool wielded by the Iranian government on many whose ideology contradicts or threatens the authority of the ruling clerics; however, the Bahá'ís are the only group to face pervasive class denial of this right. The efforts of the Iranian government to deny Bahá'ís the right to education is seen by Bahá'ís as part of its coordinated efforts to eradicate the Bahá’í community as a viable group within Iranian society.\n\nShortly after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, large numbers of Bahá'í students, ranging across the entire education system from primary through secondary and university level, were expelled from schools and blocked from continuing their education. Similarly, Bahá'í professors and faculty members were dismissed from all universities and academic institutions of the country. In the 1980s, partly in response to international pressure, primary and secondary school children were allowed to re-enroll. However, up to today the government has maintained the ban on the entry of Bahá’í youth into public and private colleges and universities.\n\nThe official decree barring Bahá’í students from admission to public university was issued in 1981. That year universities established a new admission system where only individuals who identified themselves with one of the four religions recognized by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran– i.e. Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism – were given admission. The systematic expulsion of students and faculty had become clear to Bahá'ís by 1983.\n\nIn 1991, the government reiterated that policy, in a private memorandum prepared by the Iranian Revolutionary Council and approved by Ayatollah Khamenei which states that “The Government’s dealings with [the Bahá’ís] must be in such a way that their progress and development are blocked. ... They can be enrolled in schools provided they have not identified themselves as Bahá’ís. ... Preferably they should be enrolled in schools which have a strong and imposing religious ideology. ... They must be expelled from universities, either in the admission process or during the course of their studies, once it becomes known that they are Bahá’ís.\"\n\nOver the years, various ploys at different stages of university admission process including application, entrance examination and enrollment have been used to exclude Bahá'ís from public and private colleges and universities. From a small number of Bahá'í students who have been able to register and start their studies at universities, the majority have been expelled at some point before graduation.\n\nAfter failed attempts to persuade the government of Iran to admit qualified Bahá'í students to universities, the Bahá'í community of Iran rallied its limited resources to make higher education available to its youth and young adults. In a collective effort, a small core of professors, lecturers and researchers who had been discharged from their jobs because of membership in the religion worked on developing an informal network of higher education. These efforts culminated in the establishment of the BIHE- initially known as the “scientific program” in 1987.\n\nGradually, the program expanded and took on a more formal character. By the mid-1990s, it had turned into an extensive institute which became to be known as the \"open university\" or Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education (BIHE). With the advent of the internet and increasing assistance from collaborators abroad, BIHE’s curricular standards were bolstered and a wider range of majors and concentrations was introduced.\n\nDespite tremendous logistical constraints and the Iranian authorities’ attempts to shut BIHE down through raids, arrests and imprisonment of key faculty and staff, the university has been producing impressive results, with many of its students continuing to Master and Doctoral programs in universities in other countries. Today, through the work of approximately 955 faculty and administrative staff, BIHE offers 18 undergraduate, 15 graduate and 5 associate degree programs in sciences, engineering, business and management, humanities, and social sciences.\n\nIn its early days, BIHE functioned like a correspondence school with faculty and students exchanging lessons and assignments via the state-run postal system. Since professors could not deliver lectures openly, they prepared lecture notes and compiled textbooks for distribution to the students. Upon noticing that the government had been examining and intercepting the mail packages to disrupt the university’s work, the BIHE devised its own courier service through volunteer messengers, who collected assignments from all the students in a locality by motorbike, sorted them and then delivered them to the professors.\n\nOver time, with the expansion of its operation, the university started to organize small-group classes in private homes. These were complemented with specialized classrooms and laboratories organized in privately owned commercial buildings near and in Tehran. The BIHE system also featured a network of special depository libraries in the private homes of Bahá'ís around the country. Numbering more than 45, these libraries enabled students in each district to obtain the necessary textbooks and course literature and material.\n\nSince 2005, the BIHE has undertaken a modernization and expansion program, which includes the full incorporation of the internet into its activities. As a result, currently BIHE operates on a model of hybrid learning which includes both traditional offline methods as well as increasing online components. Traditional classroom and seminar presentations provide important learning spaces for BIHE students. In addition, many courses have evolved from exclusively offline events into hybrid ones. The incorporation of online components into BIHE’s delivery method has allowed the university to expand its courses and programs by using international faculty.\n\nThe university does not have a physical campus. It operates using a hybrid model including both traditional face-to-face and online classes. There is no specific location for in-person classes. They are rotating and held at the homes of students and other members of the Bahá’í community. Occasionally some classes are held at rented isolated locations. The hosts voluntarily offer their homes for in-person classes despite the threats and risks involved. Specific locations in Tehran and its vicinity, such as a floor of a residential home or a private commercial entity are prepared to be used as laboratories. Many security measures are taken to avoid attracting attention. These laboratories have been raided numerous times by the government and sealed. Each time they have been reinstated at a different location after some time has passed.\n\nThe establishment of the BIHE has been regarded as a creative and non-violent response to the ongoing campaign of the Iranian government to deprive Iranian Bahá'í youth of access to higher education. Rather than losing their agency in the face of oppression, Iranian Bahá'ís have been actively constructing their own institution and empowering their youth through education. It has provided a constructive alternative to organizing politically against the authorities or feeling victimized.\n\nBIHE has been praised for the model it offers to minority groups in self-preservation, coping, survival and thriving under discriminatory sociopolitical circumstances.\n\nThe Institute is decentralized and its functions reach the entire country through a combination of in-person and online classes with the former being held at the homes of students, faculty and other volunteer members of the community. In each province or region, local administrative assistants perform certain logistics and managerial tasks. Parts of the application and admission process as well as student advisory services and conducting examinations are also carried out throughout the same network on the local level. Lecturers construct their courses free from the prescriptions of a single organizational body and a networks of teaching assistants collaborate in the actual delivery of education. Independence of lecturers from administrators, teaching assistants from lecturers, and students from all – creates adaptability in the BIHE, and this facet of its character has been preserved and complemented by the ongoing process of modernization and the shift toward online learning.\n\nThe BIHE relies to a great extent on the volunteerism and spirit of service. Bahá'í faculty members give their time as a form of community service and are not being paid. In addition to the academic staff, a network of community volunteers provide logistical support such as transportation, accommodation, and hosting of classes, exams and other academic events. Over time, volunteering structures have evolved organically. A study shows that the staff and the community members find volunteering in the BIHE a meaningful path of community service and are motivated by their feelings of love and care for the youth. Many of the BIHE students who finish their graduate studies abroad choose to return to Iran to volunteer at BIHE despite knowing that they will face many difficulties.\n\nThe BIHE is a participatory community-owned initiative through which a community has been able to draw from its own resources and talents to take charge of the development of its youth. Broad grassroots input of everyone, and not just the elite, is welcomed and all members of the community are invited and motivated to contribute to a shared goal. BIHE activities have also united and strengthened Bahá'í community cohesion despite the pressures of sociopolitical marginalization.\n\nThe BIHE is a resilient organization, surviving approaching 3 decades. It came into existence against the backdrop of intense persecution. It has flourished despite formidable restraints and has survived and continued its work in the face of government’s campaigns to disrupt its work. In each crisis, the BIHE has proven itself adaptable and determined to continue working despite sustained opposition. Some see the BIHE’s ability to adapt to ever-changing circumstances as a key factor in its continued success. One study claims the synergy between marginalized but dedicated students working with marginalized but dedicated staff to be the source of the BIHE's resilience in the face of hostilities.\n\nIt is believed that BIHE responds to various social and emotional needs of discriminated students by providing them access to higher education and enabling them to remain socially and academically engaged. A large number of BIHE staff are Iranian Bahá'ís who have been expelled from their jobs in academia as a result of their allegiance to the Bahá'í Faith. The opportunity to facilitate higher education services in BIHE has been a gratifying experience for them and helped them to cope with the pain of their own educational exclusion.\n\nAs of 2016, BIHE offers a total of 38 university-level programs across five faculties in Sciences, Engineering, Business and Management, Humanities, and Social Sciences.\n\nUndergraduate programs:\n\n\nGraduate programs:\n\n\nAssociate programs:\n\n\nAs of 2016, the BIHE operates through the services of approximately 700 faculty, who are academic and professionals residing in Iran, and a network of affiliated global faculty that support the university through online courses, curriculum development and other services. A significant number of faculty are BIHE graduates.\n\nAt the outset, the administrators and faculty of BIHE were mainly Bahá'í professors dismissed from Iranian universities after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Other faculty members included doctors, dentists, lawyers and engineers many of whom were fired from their jobs by the Iranian authorities following the Islamic revolution. The university also drew on the expertise of a small and anonymous group of Bahá'í academics in North America, Europe and Australia, who sent the latest textbooks and research papers, occasionally made visits to Iran as guest lecturers, and otherwise provided instructional and technical support.\n\nWith the expansion of the online capabilities of the BIHE over the past decade or so, the university has also been assisted by a large and growing number of volunteer professors from around the world who form its Affiliated Global Faculty (AGF).\n\nAlthough catering to the Bahá'í community of Iran, the BIHE is hardly an exclusively Bahá'í institution. Non-Bahá'í Iranians both inside the country and as part of the university’s AGF network have worked with the BIHE and contributed to its success.\n\nAlmost all of the professors and administrative staff of BIHE are volunteers who serve without receiving payment.\n\nIn Iran, the BIHE graduates have attracted the praise of their employers in private corporations. Some of them have achieved high rank in the organizations, and some have contributed greatly to the social and economic enhancement of their community and Iranian society. Outside of Iran, certain BIHE graduates are currently working as professors and researchers in the academic and professional fields.\n\nThe vast majority of the graduates of the BIHE who have continued their education at Master's and PhD levels in other countries, have chosen to return to Iran to teach at BIHE or support it other ways. Some of them have later faced persecution such as imprisonment for their affiliation with the BIHE.\n\nBIHE students and graduates also have published papers in distance learning technologies, materials science, biology, and computer science and civil engineering.\n\nFariba Kamalabadi and Vahid Tizfahm, two members of the arrested leadership in Iran, among the Bahá'ís are graduates of BIHE.\n\n\"The New York Times\" calls the BIHE \"an elaborate act of communal self-preservation.\" The BIHE has received praise as one of the few examples of community-sponsored higher education service in a closed society, a non-violent, adaptive and constructive form of resistance against oppression and an example of empowerment through education. It is believed that the BIHE can offer many lessons to organizations and activists tackling similar types of exclusion in closed societies across the world. The effectiveness of BIHE to deliver curricula has been studied, finding it to be a \"social space\" that enables Bahá'í students and staff to remain academically and socially engaged; to bond and share with peers and colleagues equally suffering from religious persecution; and to live up to principles such as learning, community service, and resistance in times of socio-political marginalization as well surviving because of international support, community sacrifices, and individual resiliency.\n\nAlthough BIHE degrees are not certified by the Iranian regime, since 1998 more than 80 universities in the North America, Europe, Australia and Asia have accepted BIHE qualifications and have admitted its graduates directly into programs of study at the masters and doctoral levels.\n\nThe BIHE was the first Iranian member of the Open Courseware Consortium and BIHE developed and implemented a project through them out of MIT.\n\nIranian authorities have continuously sought to disrupt the BIHE’s operation by raiding hundreds of Bahá'í homes and offices associated with it, by confiscating university materials and property and by arresting and imprisoning faculty members and administration staff.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2005 the Iranian authorities closed down the university several times as part of the pattern of suppressing the Bahá'í community.\n\nBetween September 30 and October 3, 1998, immediately after the first batch of BIHE graduates got admitted into Master's level studies in a Canadian University, members of the Iranian Government's intelligence agency, the Ministry of Information, started a large-scale crackdown, when officials raided over 500 Bahá'í homes, confiscated teaching materials and arrested more than 36 faculty members. Those who had been arrested were asked, while in custody, to sign a document declaring that the BIHE had ceased to exist and that they would no longer cooperate with it. They refused to sign any such declaration. Most of those who were arrested were released soon afterwards, but four were given prison sentence ranging from three to 10 years. The faculty, administrators and the students were all determined to continue the pursuit of knowledge against all odds.\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, three classrooms used by community members were seized, and an instructor was summoned to the intelligence agency. Authorities also disrupted—in July 2002—BIHE qualification examinations in eight different locations simultaneously, videotaping proceedings, interviewing students, and confiscating examination papers and Bahá’í books, thus demonstrating that the government pursues an established policy of intimidation.\n\nAnother centrally orchestrated series of raids was carried out on the homes of some of the faculty members and administrators during 22–24 May 2011. Officials from the Ministry of Intelligence entered the homes of at least 30 of the academic staff of the BIHE, seizing books, computers and personal effects. The buildings used as laboratories and for academic purposes in Tehran have also been closed. The searches or arrests took place in Tehran, Zahedan, Sari, Isfahan and Shiraz. A total of 16 educators were arrested. A second wave of arrests on September 2014 targeted few other professors. Some of those arrested were released within a couple of weeks. The rest were put on trial, accused of \"conspiracy against national security\" and \"conspiracy against the Islamic Republic of Iran\", and sentenced to four to five years of imprisonment. Today, a number of them have been released after finishing the terms of their sentences, while others remain in jail.\n\nThe \"Iran Daily\", an official government newspaper, reported that \"The BIHE university was a cover for the propagation of the Baha'i faith and was used to trap citizens in the Baha'i spy network and to gather information from within the county\". It stated that \"\"Authorities have discovered Baha'i propaganda, CDs and books in the possession of those who have been arrested.\" Spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations said the raids on BIHE were because it \"systematically controlled activities of cult members, and ... interfered in their private, social and economic lives.\" He also said the organization had the aim of \"entrapping\" non-Baha'is, in order to eventually create \"an extremist cult movement.\" See Political accusations against the Baha'i Faith.\n\nTeachers and staff of the BIHE have vowed to continue the BIHE's activities.\n\nThe attempts of the Iranian government to exclude Baha’is from higher education and the raids on the BIHE have drawn considerable international attention to the government of Iran’s oppressive policies against Baha’is. International Human rights organizations such as entities at the United Nations have called for an end to religious discrimination against Baha’i students and various governments have pressed Iran to allow Baha’is back into university.\n\nFollowing the 1990s raids the Canadian Association of University Teachers condemned them.\n\nSince the raids in 2011, there has been further and more diverse objections to the attempts of the Iranian government to exclude Bahá'ís from high education. Nobel Peace Prize laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu and East Timor president José Ramos-Horta signed an open letter calling on Iran to unconditionally drop the charges against the Baha'i educators. Christian Solidarity Worldwide and the Union of Jewish Students urged Iran to end its discriminatory educational policies of Bahá'ís. Senator Remeo Dallaire of Canada warned of the “genocidal intent of the Iranian state.” Lloyd Axworthy, president of the University of Winnipeg, and Allan Rock, president of the University of Ottawa, published an editorial calling attention to Iran’s recent actions. An international set of 43 academic theologians and philosophers – of Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim backgrounds – signed an open letter, published in The Daily Telegraph (UK), and reported in the Folha de S.Paulo (Brazil) condemning the attacks in 2011. A petition in India has garnered support from members of Judicial, Executive and Legislative branches of government, academics, religious leaders, NGOs and business leaders. Another in the States garnered support from 48 Deans and Senior Vice-Presidents of American medical schools. The chief signatory – Dr. Philip Pizzo, Dean of Stanford University School of Medicine – helped collect the signatures at the annual meeting of the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Council of Medical School Deans. In March 2012, the American Physical Society Committee on International Freedom of Scientists reiterated its 2010 support for Bahá'í students not being denied education in requesting the arrested lectures be released.\n\n\"Education is Not a Crime\" was a worldwide campaign launched in November 2014 by Maziar Bahari, an Iranian filmmaker and journalist to draw attention to the Iranian government's systematic denial of university education to young Baha'is. The campaign was inspired by Bahari’s documentary film “To Light a Candle” which was premiered in London in September 2014. Through personal stories, interviews and rare footage, the film unveils decades of social injustice and religious intolerance against the Baha'i community of Iran.\n\nGrassroots screenings of the film and panel discussions have been part of \"Education Is Not a Crime\" campaign and its website featured voices of support from people around the world. The campaign had a global day of action on 27 February 2015 in which a major event titled \"Education is not a crime Live 2015\" was organized in Los Angeles along with hundreds of other screenings around the world.\n\nNobel Peace laureates such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Shirin Ebadi, Tawakkol Karman, Jody Williams, and Mairead Maguire have endorsed the campaign. It has also received support from a number of artists and intellectuals including Nazanin Boniadi, Abbas Milani, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Azar Nafisi, Omid Djalili, Eva LaRue, and Mohammad Maleki, former president of the University of Tehran.\n\nFollowing developments reported on October 13, 2011, by the UN Secretary General with a report on \"The situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran\", specifically citing the raids, Nobel Laureates Desmond Tutu and José Ramos-Horta wrote an open letter calling for the immediate release of the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education professors and other initiatives which is part of a program of action that is called \"Education Under Fire\" (EUF).\n\nSingle Arrow Productions produced a 30-minute documentary by the same title, \"Education Under Fire\". This documentary traces the Islamic Republic of Iran's three-decade-long policy of denying the members of its Bahá´í community basic human rights including the right to attend any institution of higher education. It is endorsed by Amnesty International. The documentary and laureates’ letter together form part of university and community activities to address the situation. The campaign’s premiere event showing the documentary was co-hosted by faculty from Columbia University, Duke University, and Eastern Kentucky University, as well as Amnesty International and the director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, on October 28, 2011. A \"successful\" Kickstarter campaign associated with the documentary was completed and Iran Human Rights held a podcast on the initiative in November 2011.\n\nThe documentary was shown at the mid-February 2012 12th Annual Bellingham Human Rights Film Festival and the 10th Annual University of San Francisco Film Festival in late March.\n\nThe campaign's stated goals are: \n\nHead administrators of Wheelock, Wheaton Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst as well as faculty from various Canadian and Australian colleges and universities have signed letters in support of the cause of the campaign which have been released to the public. Screenings of the documentary often with discussions and action agenda items for the campaign have been held or are scheduled for 2012 at a wide number of universities and colleges in the United States, Canada, and Italy. The documentary was also shown at a public library in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, and City Hall at Stratford, Ontario and the Ohio Commission on Hispanic / Latino Affairs hosted an event in Columbus Ohio. The American Friends Service Committee supported two screenings – one at the DePaul University Art Museum, and the other at Northeastern Illinois University's Student Union. David Docherty, President of Mount Royal University recommended the documentary. A Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention contributor spoke at a screening and discussion in Toronto on the campaign and situation in Iran. The \"Human Rights, Social Justice and Canadian Complicity with Torture – Criminology and Human Rights Symposium\" of St. Thomas University in March 2012 hosted a screening and discussion.\n\nThe campaign has also received televised local news coverage in New York (WNBC), Miami (WTVJ) as well as Houston community radio (KPFT).\n\nAnother response to the situation was using QR codes for the website \"Can you solve this?\" (can-you-solve-this.org) It is an online email campaign system to send letters about the situation to various leaders in several countries was started in August 2011. A related website claims it has sent over 1,700 letters with coverage from the Mashable website. Promoted on the website bahairights.org, the Muslim Network for Baha'i Rights, it is a project by Mideast Youth.\n\nBIHE has been a source of inspiration and subject of a few films. \"Education Under Fire\" is a documentary produced by Single Arrow Productions and co-sponsored by Amnesty International, which profiles the growth, struggle, and spirit of the BIHE. \"To Light a Candle\" is another documentary film by journalist Maziar Bahari, premiered in 2014, which focuses on the stories of the individuals associated with the attempted shutdown of BIHE. \"CopyRight\" is a fiction 16mm short film based on the story of volunteers at the BIHE.\n\nThere are also references to BIHE in other documentary films. For instance, Iranian Taboo, a 2011 documentary film by Dutch film-maker Reza Allamehzadeh, which focuses on the persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran, has some references to BIHE.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6135709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6135709", "title": "Bundahishn", "text": "Bundahishn\n\nBundahishn Avestan: 𐬠𐬎𐬥 𐬛𐬀𐬵𐬌𐬱𐬥𐬍𐬵 Bun-dahišnīh , meaning \"Primal Creation\", is the name traditionally given to an encyclopediaic collection of Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology written in Book Pahlavi. The original name of the work is not known.\n\nAlthough the Bundahishn draws on the Avesta and develops ideas alluded to in those texts, it is not itself scripture. The content reflects Zoroastrian scripture, which, in turn, reflects both ancient Zoroastrian and pre-Zoroastrian beliefs. In some cases, the text alludes to contingencies of post-7th century Islam in Iran, and in yet other cases, such as the idea that the Moon is farther than the stars, it reiterates scripture even though science had, by then, determined otherwise.\n\nThe traditionally given name seems to be an adoption of the sixth word from the first sentence of the younger of the two recensions. The older of the two recensions has a different first line, and the first translation of that version adopted the name \"Zand-Ākāsīh\", meaning \"Zand-knowing\", from the first two words of its first sentence.\n\nMost of the chapters of the compendium date to the 8th and 9th centuries, roughly contemporary with the oldest portions of the \"Denkard\", which is another significant text of the \"Pahlavi\" (i.e. Zoroastrian Middle Persian) collection. The later chapters are several centuries younger than the oldest ones. The oldest existing copy dates to the mid-16th century.\n\nThe \"Bundahishn\" survives in two recensions. A shorter was found in India, and is thus known as the \"Lesser Bundahishn\", or \"Indian Bundahishn\". A copy of this version was brought to Europe by Abraham Anquetil-Duperron in 1762. A longer version was brought to India from Iran by T.D. Anklesaria around 1870, and is thus known as the \"Greater Bundahishn\" or \"Iranian Bundahishn\" or just \"Bundahishn\". The greater recension (the name of which is abbreviated \"GBd\" or just \"Bd\") is about twice as long as the lesser (abbreviated \"IBd\").\n\nThe two recensions derive from different manuscript traditions, and in the portions available in both sources, vary (slightly) in content. The greater recension is also the older of the two, and was dated by West to around 1540. The lesser recension dates from about 1734.\n\nTraditionally, chapter-verse pointers are in Arabic numerals for the lesser recension, and Roman numerals for the greater recension. The two series' are not synchronous since the lesser recension was analyzed (by Duperrron in 1771) before the extent of the greater recension was known. The chapter order is also different.\n\nThe \"Bundahishn\" is the concise view of the Zoroastrianism's creation myth, and of the first battles of the forces of Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu for the hegemony of the world. According to the text, in the first 3,000 years of the cosmic year, Ahura Mazda created the Fravashis and conceived the idea of his would-be creation. He used the insensible and motionless Void as a weapon against Angra Mainyu, and at the end of that period, Angra Mainyu was forced to submission and fell into a stupor for the next 3,000 years. Taking advantage of Angra Mainyu's absence, Ahura Mazda created the Amesha Spentas (Bounteous Immortals), representing the primordial elements of the material world, and permeated his kingdom with \"Ard\" (Asha), \"Truth\" in order to prevent Angra Mainyu from destroying it. The Bundahishn finally recounts the creation of the primordial bovine, Ewagdad (Avestan Gavaevodata), and Gayomard (Avestan Gayomaretan), the primordial human.\n\nFollowing MacKenzie, the following chapter names in quotation marks reflect the original titles. Those without quotation marks are summaries of chapters that have no title. The chapter/section numbering scheme is based on that of B.T. Anklesaria for the greater recension, and that of West for the lesser recension. The chapter numbers for the greater recension are in the first column and in Roman numerals, and the chapter numbers for the lesser recension are in the second column, and are noted in Arabic numerals and in parenthesis.\n\nExcerpt from Chapter 2:- On the formation of the luminaries.\n\n1. Ohrmazd produced illumination between the sky and the earth, the constellation stars and those also not of the constellations, then the moon, and afterwards the sun, as I shall relate.\n\n2. First he produced the celestial sphere, and the constellation stars are assigned to it by him; especially these twelve whose names are Varak (the Lamb), Tora (the Bull), Do-patkar (the Two-figures or Gemini), Kalachang (the Crab), Sher (the Lion), Khushak (Virgo), Tarazhuk (the Balance), Gazdum (the Scorpion), Nimasp (the Centaur or Sagittarius), Vahik (Capricorn), Dul (the Water-pot), and Mahik (the Fish);\n\n3. which, from their original creation, were divided into the twenty-eight subdivisions of the astronomers, of which the names are Padevar, Pesh-Parviz, Parviz, Paha, Avesar, Beshn, Rakhvad, Taraha, Avra, Nahn, Miyan, Avdem, Mashaha, Spur, Husru, Srob, Nur, Gel, Garafsha Varant, Gau, Goi, Muru, Bunda, Kahtsar, Vaht, Miyan, Kaht.\n\n4. And all his original creations, residing in the world, are committed to them; so that when the destroyer arrives they overcome the adversary and their own persecution, and the creatures are saved from those adversities.\n\n5. As a specimen of a warlike army, which is destined for battle, they have ordained every single constellation of those 6480 thousand small stars as assistance; and among those constellations four chieftains, appointed on the four sides, are leaders.\n\n6. On the recommendation of those chieftains the many unnumbered stars are specially assigned to the various quarters and various places, as the united strength and appointed power of those constellations.\n\n7. As it is said that Tishtar is the chieftain of the east, Sataves the chieftain of the west, Vanand the chieftain of the south, and Haptoring the chieftain of the north.\n\n\n"}

They publish the magazine \"Witchcraft & Wicca\".\n\nThe Children of Artemis (CoA) first started out as a ritual group. The CoA continued as a small group until 1995, when it was transformed into a public membership organisation. Initially it grew slowly until around 1999–2000, and then with the established of CoA's website, magazine and events, CoA quickly became market leaders.\n\nCoA is staffed almost entirely by volunteers, who are given responsibility for their areas of expertise, which includes Witchfests, the magazine, the website, and all other areas of the organisation. It has no hierarchy, no titles, and as there are no political positions, it holds no elections. It is a religious organisation dedicated to Wicca and Witchcraft.\n\nThe core Children of Artemis team helped the Pagan Federation organise their conferences in 1997 and 1998. This period lasted two years, during which CoA did not develop as its resources were being fully utilised helping the other organisation. The PF president took personal control of the conference in 1999, this allowed CoA to focus back onto its own development. The first Witchfest event came three years later in November 2002.\n\nThe Coven finding service was ceased in 2003, as there were not enough Covens accepting trainees. To attempt to address this lack of opportunity, CoA has run \"\"Wicca Introduced\" courses twice a year, and now funds a few Open Rituals.\n\nChildren of Artemis was one of the founding members of the Pagan Symposium, a group of Pagan and Heathen Organisations that actively co-operate on a variety of issues and projects.

It is argued that this has a detrimental effect of the public perception of Paganism, detracting from its status as an accepted religion, and promoting it as a lifestyle choice.\n\n"}

Norway has historically been called a \"Christian country\". A majority of the population are members of the Church of Norway with 71.5% of the population officially belonging to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway in 2016. At numerous times in history, Norway sent more missionaries per capita than any other country. This changed considerably from the 1960s. In 2004, only 12% of the population attended church services each month. Citizens born in Norway to one or two Norwegian parents are automatically added to the list of Protestant Christians in Norway, and are required to \"sign out\" of the church. There are two categories kept in the church's books, \"medlemmer\" (members) and \"tilhørige\" (belonging to [the State church]). Members technically have to be baptised, whereas \"tilhørige\" are to be taken out of the books if not baptised by the age of 18. Norwegian citizens' tax funds are given to the Protestant Church until one registers as a member of another religious group, or as a member of the Humanist association.\n\nIn 1993, there were 4,981 churches and chapels in Norway.\n\nThe conversion of Norway to Christianity began in 1000 AD. The raids on Ireland, Britain and the Frankish kingdoms had brought the Vikings in touch with Christianity. Haakon the Good of Norway who had grown up in England tried to introduce Christianity in the tenth century, but had met resistance from pagan leaders and soon abandoned the idea.\n\nAnglo-Saxon missionaries from England and Germany engaged in converting Norwegians to Christianity, but with limited success. However, they succeeded in converting Olaf I of Norway to Christianity. Olaf II of Norway (later Saint Olaf) had more success in his efforts to convert the population, and he is credited with Christianising Norway.\n\nThe Christians in Norway often established churches or other holy sites at places that had previously been sacred under the Norse religion. The spread of conversion can be measured by burial sites as Pagans were buried with grave goods while Christians weren't. Christianity had become well established in Norway by the middle of the 11th century and had become dominant by the middle of the 12th century. Stave churches were built of wood without the use of nails in the 13th century.\n\nThe above numbers reflect the percentage of the population that are members of a church, typically from being baptized as infants. Less than half of these define themselves as Christian. \n\nEarly 21st century, Norway had one of the lowest church attendance rates in the world. Below is a table that compares Norway with other governmental divisions in regular church attendance for the early 21st century (2004-2006). In contrast to 250,000 regular churchgoers in the whole of Norway in 2004, 43,500 attend Lakewood Church in the United States each week, and 23,000 attend Hillsong Church in Australia each week.\n\nThe U.S. state of Alabama has a population roughly equal to that of Norway, but church attendance in Alabama is as much as 11 times higher than in Norway.\n\nBelow is a table that compares Norway with other countries in importance of religion.\n\nThe Church of Norway (\"Den norske kirke\" in Bokmål or \"Den norske kyrkja\" in Nynorsk) is the state church of Norway. The church confesses the Lutheran Christian faith. It has as its foundation the Christian Bible, the Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, Luther's Small Catechism and the Augsburg Confession. The Church is a member of the Porvoo Communion with 12 other churches, among them the Anglican Churches of Europe. It has also signed some other ecumenical texts, including the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe constitutional head of the Church is the King of Norway, who is obliged to profess the Lutheran faith. The Church of Norway is subject to legislation, including its budgets, passed by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, and its central administrative functions are carried out by the Royal Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs.\n\nThe Church has a congregational and episcopal structure, with 1,284 parishes, 106 deaneries and 11 dioceses, namely:\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Norway (\"Den Evangelisk Lutherske frikyrkja i Noreg\" in Norwegian) or the Free Church as it is commonly known, is a nationwide Lutheran church in Norway consisting of 81 congregations with 19,262 members in 2009. It was founded in 1877 in Moss. It should not be confused with the Church of Norway, though both churches are members of the Lutheran World Federation. The Free Church is economically independent.\n\nThe following numbers is from :\n\n15,574 members in 2009, up from 7,267 in 2005.\n\n8,497 members in 2009, down from 8,505 in 2005.\n\n6,779 members in 2009, up from 6,054 in 2005.\n\n4,237 members in 2009, up from 3,504 in 2005.\n\n3,434 members in 2009, down from 3,653 in 2005.\n\n3,290 members in 2009, up from 3,264 in 2005.\n\n3,232 members in 2009, down from 3,410 in 2005.\n\n2,735 members in 2009, down from 3,395 in 2005.\n\n2,474 members in 2009, up from 2,472 in 2006.\n\nBrunstad Christian Church is the largest international Christian movement founded in Norway.\n\nThe Methodist Church of Norway had 10,974 members in 2009, down from 11,981 in 2005.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Norway is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope and the Curia in Rome. Per 15 October 2012 the church had 115, 234 registered members. The number has increased from 59, 350 in 2008 due to high immigration. There may be approximately 170,000–200,000 people of Catholic background in the country, most of them immigrants.\n\nThe country is divided into three Church districts – the Diocese of Oslo and the prelatures of Trondheim and Tromsø and 32 parishes. The Bishop of Oslo participates in the Scandinavian Bishops Conference. The Catholic Church in Norway is as old as the kingdom itself, dating from approximately 900 A.D., with the first Christian monarchs, Haakon I from 934.\n\nAt first, the bulk of Catholic immigrants came from Germany, The Netherlands, and France. Immigration from Chile, the Philippines, and from a wide range of other countries began in the 1970s. This development has further increased in the last few years with economic immigrants from Poland and Lithuania. Ethnic Norwegian Catholics are now greatly outnumbered by the immigrants, although the former tend to be far more observant and conservative, being a self-selected group largely of ex-Lutheran converts.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses is the largest nontrinitarian religious organization in Norway, with a membership of 14,976 in 2009. A branch office is located in Ytre Enebakk. Jehovah's Witnesses receive public grants in the same manner as other registered religious communities in Norway.\n\n\n"}

The Pharaonist movement, or Pharaonism, looks to Egypt's pre-Islamic past and argued that Egypt was part of a larger Mediterranean civilization. Many Coptic intellectuals hold to \"Pharaonism,\" which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. Most scholars today see Pharaonism as a late development shaped primarily by western Orientalism, and doubt its validity.\n\nCoptic identity as it stands now saw its roots in the 1950s with the rise of pan-Arabism under Nasser. Up to that point, Egyptian nationalism was the major form of expression for Egyptian identity, Copts viewed themselves as only Copts without any Arab sentiment. The struggle to ascertain this Egyptian identity began as Nasser and his regime tried to impose an Arab identity on the country, and attempted to erase all references to Egypt as a separate and unique entity.\n\nA Coptic flag was created in 2005 by a Coptic activist group called \"The Free Copts\" as an ethnic flag representing Copts, Coptic identity and as a sign of opposition to Islamic authority in Egypt. It is not recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church or the Coptic Catholic Church but has been adopted by the New Zealand Coptic Association in defiance of directives from their own religious leaders condemning its use.\n\nThe Coptic Flag consists of two main components: a blue cross and a colorful coat of arms.\nThe black background behind the ornaments is a symbol of Kimi or Kemet, the Egyptian name of Egypt, which means the Black Land. \nBeneath these ornaments is a green line in the middle of the coat of arms, which represents the Nile Valley. Around it are two yellow lines that symbolize the Eastern and Western Deserts of Egypt. These two lines are in turn flanked by two blue lines that represent the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea that enclose Egypt. Finally, these lines are separated by red lines symbolizing Coptic blood, which has been shed all over Egypt since Egyptians adopted Christianity and until today.\n\n\n"}

After a complicated process, with much back and forth between the Islamic Society and town officials, the necessary permit was issued over a year later.\n\nAt the initial hearings, some residents made it clear that they did not want this cemetery in their town with concerns that included noise, traffic and well water contamination issues. The comments of some of the small town's residents raised concerns of religious bigotry. At the meeting, all the speakers in support of the Islamic Society were booed, and members of the public variously denounced the need to bury Muslim dead locally compared to the deaths of American soldiers fighting radical Islamic terrorist groups overseas, called the existing cemetery a \"pigsty\", and called the Society's attempt to build a cemetery a \"crusade\" (both offensive given Islam's consideration of pigs as ritually unclean, and the history of Christian Crusades conquering parts of the Middle East). Though Muslim tradition is to bury without a coffin, in response to concerns about water quality the Islamic Society promised to use vaults.\n\nA series of test pits dug by the applicant, with the Dudley Board of Health Inspector present, showed that the average water table was 24\" below the grade of the ground, with many spots having ground water only 18\" from the surface. The public hearing of the Zoning Board of Appeals reviewed the status of the land as an agricultural protected parcel protected under MGL Chapter 61A. At a town meeting held on May 23, 2016, action was postponed authorizing the Board of Selectman to exercise the Town's first right of refusal in order to proceed to purchase the agricultural piece of land. When the Zoning Board of Appeals met on June 2, 2016 they asked the Islamic Society of Worcester if they were presenting a revised 5 Acre cemetery plan which they had read about in the newspapers the week before. The Islamic Society of Worcester stated there was no revised plan and they expected the Zoning Board of Appeals to vote on their original proposal for 12,000+ grave sites. The Zoning Board of Appeals then scheduled a full vote for June 9, 2016, at which it denied the permit on the grounds the land was under Chapter 61A conservation protection and the town of Dudley thus had the right of first refusal to purchase the land. The board claimed that this meant the Islamic Society of Worcester lacked the proper legal standing to submit the cemetery plan until after the town's right of refusal had been extinguished. The Society complained that it could not complete the purchase of the land and gain the standing the board required of it until the zoning approval had been granted, because its purchase agreement was contingent upon that action, putting the Society in a Catch-22 situation.<ref name=\"telegram/20160609\"></ref>\n\nThe denial prompted a federal investigation by the U.S Attorney into potential religious discrimination, and a warning letter from the Massachusetts Attorney General. The Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU filed a lawsuit in state land court, claiming the denial violated freedom of religion provisions in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the Federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, and the state Dover Amendment (which exempts certain religious organizations from zoning regulations). It also claimed the Chapter 61A protection was not applicable to conversion to cemetery use. The town Attorney argued that the Muslim cemetery, unlike Christian cemeteries, was not a religious land use due to differences between where Muslim and Christian burial rituals are held.\n\nBoth sides came to an agreement in December 2016 with the zoning board granting the permit for the cemetery on March 3, 2017. Burials will be restricted to for the first 10-years. The permit requires a buffer zones of vegetation between the burials and the neighboring property in accordance with the agreement.<ref name=\"BG 2017/03/03\"></ref> After winning this approval (though not final Board of Health approval) and affirming its rights, the Islamic Society dropped its plans to build a cemetery in Dudley, and instead moved forward with plans to bury Muslim dead in a city-owned cemetery in Worcester, partly due to lower cost and parly because the city was more welcoming. The U.S. Attorney announced on April 12, 2017 that it was closing the investigation whether town officials had violated federal civil rights law that prohibits religious discrimination.\n"}

Trichocereus pachanoi) — known as San Pedro cactus — is a fast-growing columnar cactus native to the Andes Mountains at in altitude. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru, and it is cultivated in other parts of the world. Uses for it include traditional medicine and traditional veterinary medicine, and it is widely grown as an ornamental cactus. It has been used for healing and religious divination in the Andes Mountains region for over 3,000 years. It is sometimes confused with its close relative \"Echinopsis peruviana\" (Peruvian torch cactus).\n\nEchinopsis pachanoi is known by many names throughout South America such as \"achuma,\" \"huachuma,\" \"wachuma,\" \"aguacolla,\" \"hahuacollay,\" or \"giganton\".\n\n\"Echinopsis pachanoi\" is native to Ecuador and Peru. Its stems are light to dark green, sometimes glaucous, with a diameter of and usually 6–8 ribs. The whitish areoles may produce up to seven yellow to brown spines, each up to long; the plant is sometimes spineless. The areoles are spaced evenly along the ribs, approximately apart. \"Echinopsis pachanoi\" is normally tall and has multiple branches, usually extending from the base. The tallest recorded specimen was tall. White flowers are produced at the end of the stems; they open at night. The flowers are large, around long with a diameter of up to . There are black hairs along the length of the tube leading to the flower. Oblong dark green fruits are produced after fertilization, about across and long.\n\n\"Echinopsis pachanoi\" has a long history of being used in Andean traditional medicine. Archeological studies have found evidence of use going back two thousand years, to Moche culture. Although Roman Catholic church authorities after the Spanish conquest attempted to suppress its use, this failed, as shown by the Christian element in the common name \"San Pedro cactus\" – Saint Peter cactus. The name is attributed to the belief that just as St Peter holds the keys to heaven, the effects of the cactus allow users \"to reach heaven while still on earth.\"\n\nThe San Pedro cactus contains a number of alkaloids, including the well-studied chemical mescaline (0.21–1.8%), and also 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine, 3-Methoxytyramine, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamine, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, anhalonidine, anhalinine, hordenine, and tyramine.\n\nMescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) is a psychedelic drug and entheogen, which is also found in some other species of genus \"Echinopsis\" (i.e. \"Echinopsis lageniformis\", \"Echinopsis peruviana\", and \"Echinopsis scopulicola\") and the species \"Lophophora williamsii\" (peyote).\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that the highest concentration of active substances is found in the layer of green photosynthetic tissue just beneath the skin.\n\nThere are various mescaline extraction techniques, simple (simmering in water 5 to 7 hours) and complex (such as an acid-base extraction), the latter technique yielding a material with a significantly higher concentration of mescaline.\n\nThe San Pedro cactus grows in USDA hardiness zones 8b to 10.\n\nThe San Pedro cactus is very easy to grow in most areas. Because it grows naturally in the Peruvian Andes Mountains at high altitude and with high rainfall, it can withstand temperatures far below that of many other cacti. It requires fertile, free-draining soil. They average half a meter per year of new growth. They are susceptible to fungal diseases if over-watered, but are not nearly as sensitive as many other cacti, especially in warm weather. They can be sunburned and display a yellowing chlorotic reaction to overexposure to sunlight.\n\nIn winter, plants will etiolate, or become thin, due to lower levels of light. This may be problematic if the etiolated zone is not sufficiently strong to support future growth as the cactus may break in strong winds.\nLike many other plants, \"Echinopsis pachanoi\" can be propagated from cuttings. The result is a genetic clone of the parent plant. A long cactus column can be also laid on its side on the ground (like a log), and eventually roots will sprout from it and grow into the ground. After time, sprouts will form and cactus columns will grow upward out of it along its length.\n\nLike a lot of its relatives \"Trichocereus pachanoi\" as a species is easily grown from seed, often by means of a so-called \"Takeaway Tek\". This term refers to the practice of the sowing of \"Trichocereus\" (and sometimes other types of cactus) seed into plastic containers such as those many food takeaways are delivered in. This creates a semi-controlled humidity environment chamber for 6 months to a year, in which the seed may germinate and then grow relatively unbothered by environmental contamination. \n\nIn most countries it is legal to cultivate the San Pedro cactus, but in countries where possession of mescaline and related compounds is illegal and highly penalized, cultivation for the purposes of consumption is most likely illegal and also highly penalized. This is the case in the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, and Norway, where it is currently legal to cultivate the San Pedro cactus for gardening and ornamental purposes, but not for consumption.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1702067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1702067", "title": "Essays and Reviews", "text": "Essays and Reviews\n\nEssays and Reviews, edited by John William Parker, published in March 1860, is a broad-church volume of seven essays on Christianity. The topics covered the biblical research of the German critics, the evidence for Christianity, religious thought in England, and the cosmology of Genesis.\n\n\"Essays and Reviews\" was a popular book title in the 19th century and there are many similar books available, but none made the same impact.\n\nEach essay was authored independently by one of six Church of England churchmen and one layman. There was no overall editorial policy and each contributor chose his own theme. The six church essayists were: Frederick Temple, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury; Rowland Williams, then tutor at Cambridge and later Professor and Vice-Principal of St David's University College, Lampeter; Baden Powell, clergyman and Professor of Geometry at Oxford; Henry Bristow Wilson, fellow of St John's College, Oxford; Mark Pattison, tutor at Lincoln College, Oxford; and Benjamin Jowett, Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford (later Master) and Regius Professor of Greek, Oxford University. The layman was Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, former fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, Egyptologist, barrister and, later, Assistant Judge of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan.\n\nThe book was important because of its date and its authors. Appearing four months after Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", it summed up a three-quarter-century-long challenge to biblical history by the higher critics and to biblical prehistory by scientists working in the new fields of geology and biology. Baden Powell restated his argument that God is a lawgiver, miracles break the lawful edicts issued at the creation, therefore belief in miracles is atheistic, and wrote of \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume\" that the \"Origin of Species\" \"must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature.\"\n\n\"Outwardly, the conflict ended inconclusively, with the acquittal of Williams and Wilson by the courts and the condemnation of\nthe volume by the clergy in Convocation. At a deeper level, it marked the exhaustion both of the Broad Church and of Anglican orthodoxy and the commencement of an era of religious doubt.\"\n\n\nThe essay \"On the interpretation of scripture\" was contributed by Benjamin Jowett. When asked to contribute, Jowett saw the opportunity to challenge traditionalists. He was a rationalist and insisted that the bible ought to be treated as scholars treated classical texts. Jowett was a proponent of progressive revelation. The books of the Bible written later were seen to be closer to the ultimate revelation of God as seen in Jesus Christ as revealed in the Gospels. The epistles and other New Testament writings were seen to look back.\n\nThe implication of Jowett's essay (and his other writings) — that revelation was ongoing and that scripture was always subject to reinterpretation as each generation encountered them — was the target of his traditionalist foes. Jowett felt he was being slandered for his honesty concerning his beliefs but he suffered no actual penalty other than an infamously low salary at Christ Church, Oxford. However, in 1863 Jowett was brought before the vice-chancellor's court for teaching contrary to the doctrines of the Church of England; the case was eventually dropped.\nHardly known outside academic theological circles today, \"Essays\" sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than \"Origin\" sold in its first twenty years. It sparked five years of increasingly polarized debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.\n\nA review by Frederic Harrison published in the Westminster Review in October 1860 had the probably undesired effect of stimulating the attack on the book. Harrison saw the essays as neither religious nor rational which was a double blow to the seven who saw the essays as promoting rational religion.\n\nIn January 1861, an anonymous review was published in the Quarterly Review. The author was later revealed as Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford. The \"Quarterly\" review was followed up by a letter to The Times co-signed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and 25 bishops which threatened the theologians with the ecclesiastical courts. Darwin quoted a proverb: \"A bench of bishops is the devil's flower garden\", and joined others including the eminent geologist Charles Lyell, and the mathematician and Queen's printer William Spottiswoode, in signing a counter-letter supporting \"Essays and Reviews\" for trying to \"establish religious teachings on a firmer and broader foundation\".\n\nOn the subject Lewis Carroll wrote, \"Let E = Essays, and R = Reviews: then the locus of (E + R), referred to multilinear coordinates, will be found to be a superficies (i.e., a locus possessing length and breadth, but no depth).\"\n\nDespite this alignment of pro-evolution scientists and Unitarians with liberal churchmen, Williams and Wilson were charged with heresy in the Court of Arches. They were found guilty on some of the counts by the Dean of Arches, Stephen Lushington, but appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Judicial Committee comprised secular judges sitting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London. In 1864 it overturned the convictions, with the Archbishops of Canterbury and York dissenting in part (though the Bishop of London concurred in the decision). It was said that the Privy Council had \"dismissed hell with costs\". One hundred and thirty-seven thousand laity signed a letter of thanks to the Archbishops of Canterbury and York for voting against the Committee, and a declaration in favour of biblical inspiration and eternal torments was drawn up at Oxford and circulated to the 24,800 clergy, being signed by eleven thousand of them. Wilberforce went to the Convocation of Canterbury and in June obtained \"synodical condemnation\" of \"Essays and Reviews\".\n\nToday the essay topics and conclusions may seem innocuous, but at the time, the essays were described by their opponents as heretical, and the essayists were called \"The Seven Against Christ.\"...\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1546787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1546787", "title": "Flamen Dialis", "text": "Flamen Dialis\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the Flamen Dialis was the high priest of Jupiter. The term \"Dialis\" derives from \"Diespiter\", the Italic equivalent to \"Jupiter\". There were 15 \"flamines\", of which three were \"flamines maiores\", serving the three gods of the Archaic Triad. According to tradition the \"flamines\" were forbidden to touch metal, ride a horse, or see a corpse.\n\nThe office of Flamen Dialis, and the offices of the other \"flamines maiores\", were traditionally said to have been created by Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, although Numa himself performed many of the rites of the Flamen Dialis.\n\nThe Flamen Dialis enjoyed many peculiar honours. When a vacancy occurred, three persons of patrician descent, whose parents had been married according to the ceremonies of confarreatio (the strictest form of Roman marriage), were nominated by the Comitia, one of whom was selected (\"captus\"), and consecrated (\"inaugurabatur\") by the Pontifex Maximus. From that time forward he was emancipated from the control of his father, and became \"sui juris\". He alone of all priests wore the apex, he had a right to a lictor, to the \"toga praetexta\", the \"Sella Curulis\", and to a seat in the Roman senate \"ex officio\". This last privilege, after having been suffered to fall into disuse for a long period, was asserted by C. Valerius Flaccus (209 BC), the claim allowed however, says Livy, more in deference to his high personal character than from a conviction of the justice of the demand. The Rex Sacrificulus or Rex Sacrorum alone was entitled to recline above him at a banquet; if one in bonds took refuge in his house, the chains were immediately struck off and conveyed through the \"impluvium\" to the roof, and thence cast down into the street: if a criminal on his way to punishment met him, and fell suppliant at his feet, he was respited for that day, similar to the right of sanctuary attached to the persons and dwellings of the papal cardinals.\n\nTo counterbalance these high honours, the Dialis was subjected to many restrictions and privations, a long catalogue of which was compiled by Aulus Gellius from the works of Fabius Pictor and Masurius Sabinus, while Plutarch, in his \"Roman Questions\", endeavours to explain their import. Among these were the following:\n\n\nThe object of these rules was clearly to make him literally \"Jovi adsiduum sacerdotem\" (the constant priest of Jove (Jupiter)), to compel constant attention to the duties of the priesthood, and to leave him effectively without any temptation to neglect them. The origins of the following superstitions are not so clear, but there is speculation in Plutarch, Festus, and Pliny the Elder.\n\n\nIn the view of Dumézil, these prohibitions mark the Flamen Dialis as serving a heavenly god, with his attributes of absolute purity and freedom, but also wielder of lightning and kingship. Within his scope of action there are the domains of political power and right, but not battle, which belongs to Mars. His solidarity with the king is reflected in that of his earthly counterpart, the \"rex\", with the \"Flamen Dialis\". Such a partnership has parallels in other Indo-European cultures, such as that of the Vedic \"rajan\" and his \"purohita\" and the ancient Irish \"rig\" and the chief druid.\n\nThe Flaminica Dialis was the wife of the \"Flamen Dialis\". She was required to be a virgin at the time of their wedding, which had to be conducted according to the ceremonies of \"confarreatio\", the traditional form of marriage for patricians. (This regulation also applied to the marriages of the two other \"flamines maiores\".) The couple were not permitted to divorce, and if the \"flaminica\" died the \"Dialis\" was obliged to resign.\n\nThe assistance of the \"flaminica\" was essential in the performance of certain rituals. On each of the \"nundinae\", she sacrificed a ram to Jupiter in the Regia.\n\nThe \"flaminica\" was assigned a special ritual attire. Her hair was plaited up with a purple band in a conical form (\"tutulus\"), but when she went to participate in the ritual of the Argei, she neither combed nor arranged her hair. The \"flaminica\" and the \"regina sacrorum\" were the only ones who might wear the hairdressing named \"(in)arculata\".\n\nThe \"flaminica\" wore a dyed robe (\"venenato operitur\") and a small square cloth with a border (\"rica\"), to which was attached a slip cut from a \"felix arbor\", a tree under the protection of the heavenly gods. The \"rica\" may have been a short cloak, or less likely a sort of scarf or veil thrown over the head.\n\nThe restrictions imposed upon the \"flaminica\" were similar to those placed on her husband. She was prohibited from mounting a staircase consisting of more than three steps, perhaps to prevent her ankles from being seen.\n\nThe flamen Lucius Cornelius Merula was chosen \"consul suffectus\" on the expulsion of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, and, upon the restoration of the Marian faction, shed his own blood in the sanctuary (87 BC), calling down curses on his enemies with his dying breath. After his death the priesthood remained vacant until the consecration of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis under Augustus, then Pontifex Maximus.\n\nThe exact date that Maluginensis became Flamen Dialis is disputed. Dio 54.36 says it was about 11 BC, a date accepted by many modern scholars. But Tacitus \"Annales\" 3.58 indicates that the date was 72 years after the suicide of Cornelius Merula (87 BC). Some modern translators (including Penguin's Rex Warner, but not Wood) change Tacitus to match Dio instead of vice versa, even though Tacitus is the more reliable historian. Gaius Stern asserts that Tacitus is probably correct, meaning that Maluginensis became Flamen Dialis while Lepidus was Pontifex Maximus (16/15 BC), so that Lepidus had to supervise his inauguration at Augustus' direction, possibly unwillingly.\n\nJulius Caesar was nominated to be Flamen Dialis in 84 BC. Many scholars think he was not installed, although it seems unlikely that the Romans would allow a nominee to wait years without inauguration. When Sulla returned to Italy in 82, he proscribed Caesar and stripped him of his priesthood (which implies that he had indeed been inaugurated). No successor was selected. During the vacancy that followed (c. 82 to c. 16 or later), the duties of the office were discharged by others.\n\n\"This article is based on a portion of the article \"Flamen\" in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, in the public domain.\"\n\n"}

According to Ryuho Okawa, its aim is \"to bring happiness to humanity by spreading the Truth\". Before its foundation, Ryuho Okawa published various books of \"spiritual messages\" that claim to channel the words spoken by religious and historical figures such as Jesus Christ, Confucius and Nichiren. In 1987, \"The Laws of the Sun\", \"The Golden Laws\", and \"The Laws of Eternity\" were published, forming the core textbooks of Happy Science, along with the fundamental sutra \"The Dharma of the Right Mind\". In 1986, he resigned from a position at a trading corporation to found his own religion.\n\nThe basic teachings of Happy Science are \"Exploration of the Right Mind\" and \"The Fourfold Path\" and El Cantare belief. According to Okawa, in order to obtain happiness one must practice the Principles of Happiness known as \"The Fourfold Path\", Love that gives, Wisdom, Self-Reflection and Progress. The only requirement to join Happy Science is that applicants must have \"the aspiration and discipline to seek the truth and actively contribute to the realization of love, peace and happiness on earth\". Among other teachings, they believe in reincarnation and aliens.\n\nAt the same time, the organization's political wing, the Happiness Realization Party, promotes political views that include support for Japanese military expansion, support for the use of nuclear deterrence , and denial of historical events such as the Nanjing Massacre in China and the comfort women issue in South Korea—see the Japanese-language version of the organization's online news bulletin, \"The Liberty\". Some other views include infrastructure spending, natural disaster prevention, urban development, and dam construction. They also advocate fiscal conservatism, strengthening the US-Japan alliance, and a virtue-based leadership. As of the spring of 2018, the Happiness Realization Party has 21 local councilors.\n\nHappy Science worships a deity named \"El Cantare\" who they believe is the \"Highest God of Earth, the Lord of all gods\" which is synonymous with Allah, the Father of Jesus, and was first born on Earth as Alpha 330 million years ago where Africa would be today, Elohim, Odin, Thoth, Ophealis(Osiris) Hermes and then Shakyamuni Buddha, and is said to be the core consciousness of Okawa himself. The movement accepts both monotheism and polytheism. They explain that there is a hierarchy in the heavenly spirit world and believing in the existence of many gods, Tathagatas, Bodhisattvas, and other high spirits.\n\nGeneral headquarters, worship facilities, and missionary sites are located in Japan and other countries. Worship facilities are called \"Shoja\" (精舎 or \"vihara\" in Sanskrit) or \"Shoshinkan\" (正心館). On January 1, 1994, as the first overseas branch, \"Happiness Science USA\" was established in New York. The organization has branches in several countries including South Korea, Brazil, Uganda, the UK, Australia and India.\n\nHappy Science is one of many Japanese new religions (\"shinshūkyō\"), which are looked upon as \"controversial\" by the mainstream press and public. According to \"The Japan Times\", \"for many, the Happies smell suspiciously like a cult\". Not only the domestic Japanese press, but also international media in the United States, Uganda, Indonesia, and Australia have applied the term \"cult\" to Happy Science.\n\nHappy Science has released promotional videos that claim North Korea and the People's Republic of China are plotting to invade and colonize Japan after first subduing it through nuclear warfare.\n\nIn February 2017, actress Fumika Shimizu abruptly retired from her former entertainment production agency while in the middle of multiple filming projects in order to pursue a full-time role in Happy Science, declaring she had been a member of the group since childhood under the influence of her parents, both of whom have been devout believers in Happy Science for a long time.\n\n"}

Eventually, Sephardim from other countries also arrived. In the 19th century Jews from Curaçao settled in Hispaniola, although they did not form a strong community. Most of them hid their Jewish identities or were unaffiliated with Jewish tradition by that time. Among their descendants were Dominican President Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal and his issue Pedro Henríquez Ureña, Max Henríquez Ureña, and Camila Henríquez Ureña.\n\nThe Dominican Republic was one of the very few countries willing to accept mass Jewish immigration during World War II. At the Évian Conference, it offered to accept up to 100,000 Jewish refugees. It is estimated that 5,000 visas were actually issued, and the vast majority of the recipients did not reach the country because of how hard it was to get out of occupied Europe. The DORSA (Dominican Republic Settlement Association) was formed with the assistance of the JDC, and helped settle Jews in Sosúa, on the northern coast. About 700 European Jews of Ashkenazi Jewish descent reached the settlement where each family received of land, 10 cows (plus 2 additional cows per child), a mule and a horse, and a US$10,000 loan (about dollars at prices) at 1% interest. Other refugees settled in the capital, Santo Domingo. In 1943 the number of known Jews in the Dominican Republic peaked at 1000. Sosúa’s Jewish community experienced a deep decline in the 1980s due to emigration during the touristic boom of Sosúa when most Jews sold their land to developers at exorbitant prices. The oldest Jewish grave is dated to 1826.\n\nThe Sephardic Jews that were exiled from Spain and the Mediterranean area in 1492 and 1497, coupled with other migrations dating from the 1700s and during World War II contributed to Dominican ancestry. Some of the Sephardic Jews still presently reside in Sosúa while others are dispersed throughout the country. The number of known Jews (or those with genetic proof of Jewish ancestry and/or practiced Jewish customs/religion throughout generations) are close to 3,000; the exact number of Dominicans with Jewish lineages aren't known, however, because of intermarriage between the Jews and Dominicans over a period of more than five centuries.\n\nThe current population of known Jews in the Dominican Republic is close to 3,000, with the majority living in the capital, Santo Domingo, and others residing in Sosúa. Since Jews mixed with those already living in the Dominican Republic, the exact number of Dominicans with Jewish ancestry isn't known. In spite of the Jews intermarriage with the Dominican people already living there, some spouses have formalized their Judaism through conversions and participate in Jewish communal life while other Sephardic Jews converted to Catholicism, still maintaining their Sephardic culture. Some Dominican Jews have also made aliyah to Israel. There are three synagogues and one Sephardic Jewish Educational Center. One is the Centro Israelita de República Dominicana in Santo Domingo, another is a Chabad outreach center also in Santo Domingo, and another is in the country's first established community in Sosúa. Beth Midrash Eleazar , the Sephardic Educational Center, caters to those Jews who are descendents of the Sephardic Jews that migrated to Hispaniola in colonial times and later. In addition, they also provide kosher meat in the Beth Yoseph style, and supervise a small-scale kosher bakery. An \"afterschool\" at the Centro Israelita is active on a weekly basis and a chapter of the International Council of Jewish Women is also active. The Chabad outreach center focuses on assisting the local Jewish population reconnect with their Jewish roots and (because Chabad is of the Chassidic Jewish tradition) it is a source for traditional Judaism in the Dominican Republic. In Sosua, there is a small Jewish Museum next to the synagogue. On the High Holidays, the Sosua community hires a cantor from abroad who comes to lead services.\n\nA great deal of research on the subject of Dominican Jewry was done by Rabbi Henry Zvi Ucko who had been a writer and teacher in Germany until political conditions and growing anti-Semitism forced him to emigrate. His travels eventually took him to the Dominican Republic, where he organized a congregation in Santo Domingo (Ciudad Trujillo) and began researching the history of Jews in the country. His research covered much of the history of the Sephardic Jews there and documented the assimilation that the population went through (and was going through) during his time. Included in his research is correspondence with Haim Horacio López Penha, a Dominican Jewish writer, who encouraged Ucko to write a history of the Jews in the Dominican Republic. President Rafael L. Trujillo Molina, pledged the interest and cooperation of the government in support of Ucko's research. More recently, the publication of the book \"Once Jews\" has made easily available information on many early Jewish settlers in the Dominican Republic.\n\n"}

Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil?\" It was first published in 2006. Looking at the evidence from history, philosophy, sociology and psychology, Ward focuses on the main question at issue: does religion do more harm than good? He begins by examining the key area of religion and violence and goes on to assess the allegations of irrationality and immorality, before exploring the good religion has done over the centuries. He suggests that without religion the human race would be considerably worse off and there would be little hope for the future.\n\nIn the Introduction: What is religion?, Ward begins, \"Is religion dangerous? Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil, even 'the root of all evil'?\"—the title of a short British television series presented by Richard Dawkins. Ward states his view that the assertion that religion does more harm than good ignores \"the available evidence from history, from psychology and sociology, and from philosophy\" and suggests that proponents of this view \"refuse to investigate the question in a properly rigorous way, and substitute rhetoric for analysis\". He suggests that it is impossible to give a satisfactory universal definition of religion, and that early opponents of religion such as Edward Taylor, James Frazer and Émile Durkheim were indulging in \"scholarly fantazising\" about forms of primitive religion which were refuted by more rigorous studies such as \"Theories of Primitive Religion\" by Evans-Pritchard. \"Unfortunately some writers have not yet realised this\", such as Daniel Dennett in \"Breaking the Spell\", who \"does not seem to realise that the spell was broken as long ago as 1884 when E. B. Tylor was appointed to a Readership in Anthropology at Oxford University.\"\n\nIn Chapters 1 through 3, which deal with the origins and nature of violence, Ward suggests that \"It is not religion that causes intolerance. It is intolerance that uses religion\", that \"The leaders of such movements [are] using moral and religious language as a cloak for evil and irreligious ends\", and that \"religions are not the causes of evil, but they do naturally share in the general moral state of the societies in which they exist\". Ward suggests that any organised human activity can be corrupted, and that the corruptions of religion, although highly regrettable, are less harmful that the corruptions of secular ideologies (Nazism, Leninism and Maoism all claimed the support of science). In addition the great religions have within themselves a powerful critique of corruption. Ward, alluding to Islamic terrorism, alleges that \"it is not religion that causes Islamic terrorism. It is a version of Islam that has been corrupted by ...Marxist-Leninism\" and that al-Qaeda is based on a demonstrably incorrect interpretation of Islam. He further suggests that wars fought in the name of some interpretations of Christianity have also been based on distortions.\n\nWard examines the interplay of reason, morality, and philosophy in Chapters 4 through 8. He claims that the statement \"the only reasonable beliefs are those that can be confirmed by the methods of science, by public observation, measurement and experiment\" is self-refuting. He contrasts four worldviews—Common Sense, Materialism, Idealism and Christian Theism—and suggests that there are serious problems with Common Sense (science shows that things are often not in fact as they seem at all) and Materialism (\"quantum physics seems to dissolve matter entirely\", and \"consciousness and the contents of consciousness resist translation into purely physical terms... and if ... truth, beauty and goodness ... are things that really exist ... then Materialism will not match our experience at all\"). He suggests that \"many attacks on religion are based on the belief that idealism is false. There is no spiritual dimension to reality... to make matters worse, thinkers like Richard Dawkins hold that...religious views are based on 'blind faith'\". But, he asks, \"Has Dawkins never read any philosophy?... Does he really think that Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza, Kant and Hegel were all unthinking simpletons?\" \"Looking around my philosopher colleagues in Britain, virtually all of whom I know at least from their published work, I would say that very few of them are materialists... the point is that religious views are underpinned by highly sophisticated philosophical arguments\". He discusses the defensibility of worldviews and suggests some criteria that make a worldview reasonable:\n\n\nWard asserts that it is rational, and not harmful, to believe in life after death. He advises that \"even for the most conservative Christian, moral rules found in the Bible should not be taken out of context\" and that \"far from being considered dangerous, religious morality is widely considered to be a valuable resource for moral thinking in the modern world\". He explains how his own journey from atheism, when he was a philosopher teaching at Glasgow University, was strongly influenced by the need to have a philosophically coherent justification for morality. Ward avers that the history of Europe from the 16th to the 20th Centuries was not one of \"beneficial liberation from fear and superstition\" but \"an age of increasingly aggressive nationalism culminating in two world wars ... barbarism did not decrease. In the twentieth century it reached heights never previously imagined\" and that religiously inspired individuals took a leading role in many beneficial developments. He suggests that \"it was religion, and not secular thought, that propounded the view that nature is founded on a deep rationality\", and defends liberalism and pluralism in religious thought, which he attributes to the rise of Protestantism and contrasts with what he considers the illiberal attitudes of Richard Dawkins and Enlightenment thinkers like David Hume, who sought to make reason the slave of passions.\n\nIn Chapters 9 and 10, Ward attempts to demonstrate the benefits of religion. Ward quotes data from David Myers citing surveys by Gallup, the National Opinion Research Centre, and the Pew Organisation which conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being \"very happy\" than the least religiously committed people. He reports an analysis of over 200 social studies that \"high religiousness predicts a rather lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with life and a sense of well-being\", and a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that \"concluded that a large majority of these studies showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem, and lower levels of hypertension, depression and clinical delinquency, and similar results from the \"Handbook of Religion and Mental Health\". He cites surveys suggesting a strong link between faith and altruism. He cites extensive studies to show that there is little or no evidence that religion ever causes mental disorders, and that overall religion is a positive contributor to mental health.\n\nHe specifically addresses and rebuts the claim that religious belief is a delusion. He quotes the definition in the \"Oxford Companion to Mind\" as \"a fixed, idiosyncratic belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs\" suggesting that \"most great philosophers have believed in God\", and that the many religious people who exhibit a high degree of rational ability \"... and who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs\" refute the idea that belief in God is a delusion—whether or not it may be mistaken. He also analyses and rejects the idea that faith is a brain malfunction, quoting Gerald Edelman: \"The evolutionary assumption [that consciousness conferred fitness]... implies that consciousness is efficacious - that is, it is not an epiphenomenon\", and suggests that, if consciousness can apprehend truth and cause action, so can faith. Ward suggests that, although harm has been done in the name of religion, the same is true of politics and science, that religion can \"be used to inspire heroic love and commitment. The world would be much poorer without Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Mother Teresa... Bach ... St Francis, Siddartha Gautama, Jesus\". He cites many positive contributions made by Judaism, Christianity (he cites in particular founding hospitals, hospices, schools and universities, great works of art, the investigation into the world as the creation of one wise and rational God that gave birth to modern science, the Truth and reconciliation commission, and the Red Cross) and Islam, and suggests that \"there is plenty of room for common social action in mercy and hospitality between Christians and Muslims, and it is imperative that such commonalities are promoted\". He concludes by stating that Religion \"is the compassionate heart of what might otherwise seem to be a cold and heartless world\".\n\n\n"}

Indeed, Edgar Cayce, a devout Christian, professed that the position of the planets at birth records the time spent by the souls on other planets (or perhaps their spiritual counterparts) in between incarnations. Some karmic astrologers have professed they can read the person's karma in a Natal chart by studying \"in particular\" Lunar nodes and retrograde planets. Other astrologers, such as Dane Rudhyar's protégé Alexander Ruperti, have lectured that \"everything\" in the Natal Chart is karmic.\n\nNO DEEDS GO UNNOTICED – means all your karma and action is noticed and you will get results accordingly\n\nKarmic Astrology: \n\nThe word Karma/Karmic is literally known as action. Karma embraces the idea that what you have done or what has been done by you in the past life. \n\nBoth benevolent acts and selfishly motivated acts eventually come back to us as good and bad karma respectively. This could be in the same lifetime, or perhaps several hundred years down the line. \n\nKarmic astrology is the science of discerning as accurately as possible, through the positions of planets in your birth/divisional chart, the reasons why you are the way you are and why you act the way you do. \n\nKarmic astrology also provides you guidance to resolve past life situations so as to wipe your slate clean and make room for more positive karma in your current lifetime.\n\nThe Karmic planetary positions are divided into five parts:-\n\nThe Sun: \n\nThe Planet Sun tells about your life’s purpose since it is a soul planet, so it will indicate about your weaknesses, fears, rational thinking etc..\n\nYour Karmic life purpose weaknesses, fears\n\nThe Moon:\n\nThe Planet Moon symbolizes the memory of our Karmic Past, detailed analysis of the Moon will clear all your unresolved past issues.\nMemories of your Karmic past - unresolved past life issues that have been re-simulated.\n\nSaturn: \n\nIn general context the planet Saturn is famous for creating troubles and issues but the Karmic substances says that the planet Saturn judges your Karma and provides fruits accordingly. \n\nBut at times it will stand as a stumbling block as well.\n\nYour Karmic Stumbling blocks\n\nRahu: \n\nDo you know that planet Rahu is the root cause of Karma and without Rahu one cannot perform Karma internally or externally?\n\nYour Karmic roots\n\nKetu: \n\nYou may be aware of the importance of planet Ketu which is called a spiritual planet, it is the planet which guides us about our Karmic Path and makes us follow positive path that leads you towards a beautiful and comfortable life.\n\nYour Karmic Path\n\nApart from all this, actually Vedic Folks will analyze your birth chart, about your Karma or action and Karmic factors also, along with the 5th & 9th houses and their lords would also be analyzed for getting exact and transparent results."}

However, according to the Ecuadorian theologian C. René Padilla, CLADE I was \"made in the USA\" and had very little Latin American contribution.\n\nThe following year, in 1970, Peter Savage, C. René Padilla, Samuel Escobar, and a number of others met just outside Cochabamba, Bolivia to discuss the formation of the new group: the Fraternidad Teológica Latinoamericana. The meeting was not without its controversies, including Padilla challenging whether the \"North American\" preoccupation with Biblical inerrancy was correct or needed for the establishment of the Latin American group. It was ultimately omitted from the founding \"declaration\" of this group.\n\nIt was through the FTL that the notion of \"misión integral\" (often translated as holistic or integral mission) was spread, first throughout Latin American evangelicalism, then later through global evangelicalism by way of Lausanne 1974. It was a notion that was developed by René Padilla in the 1950s, which emphasized the gospel as needing to uphold both evangelism and social responsibility, and is seen as an evangelical form of Latin American liberation theology.\n\nThe FTL has groups throughout most countries of Latin America, known as \"núcleos,\" which promote its understanding of theology and mission.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1262175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1262175", "title": "Nadi (yoga)", "text": "Nadi (yoga)\n\nNadi is an important concept in Hindu philosophy, mentioned and described in the sources some of which have about 3,000 years of history. The amount of nadis of the human body are claimed to be up to hundred-of-thousands and even millions. In regard to Kundalini yoga, there are three important nadis: ida, pingala, and sushumna (for the alternate names, see the section below). \"Ida\" (इडा, iḍā \"comfort\") lies to the left of the spine, whereas \"pingala\" (पिङ्गल, piṅgala \"tawny (brown)\", \"golden\", \"solar\") is to the right side of the spine, mirroring the ida. \"Sushumna\" (सुषुम्णा, suṣumṇā \"very gracious\", \"kind\") runs along the spinal cord in the center, through the seven chakras. Under the correct conditions the energy of kundalini is said to uncoil and enter \"sushumna\" through the \"brahma dwara\" or gate of Brahma at the base of the spine.\n\nThe Shiva Samhita treatise on yoga states, for example, that out of 350,000 nadis 14 are particularly important, and among them, the three just mentioned are the three most vital.\n\nSeveral of the ancient Upanishads use the concept of nadis (channels). Nadi system is mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad (8~6 cc. BCE), verse 8.6.6. and in verses 3.6-3.7 of the Prasna Upanishad (second half of the 1 millennium BC). As stated in the last,\n\nThe Varaha Upanishad (13-16 cc. CE) further describes it as follows:\n\nIn the yoga theory, nadis are said to carry life force energies known as \"prana\". \nIn the physical body, the nadis are channels carrying air, water, nutrients, blood and other bodily fluids around and are similar to the arteries, veins, capillaries, bronchioles, nerves, lymph canals and so on. In yoga theory, the physical body is often referred to as \"the gross body\" (Sanskrit \"Sthula sarira\").\n\nIn the subtle and the causal body, the nadis are channels for so called cosmic, vital, seminal, mental, intellectual, etc. energies (collectively described as \"prana\") and are important for sensations, consciousness and the spiritual aura.\n\nYoga texts disagree on the number of nadis in the human body. Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Goraksha Samhita quote 72,000 nadis, each branching off into another 72,000 nadis, whereas Shiva Samhita states 350,000 nadis arise from the navel center.\n\nAll nadis are said to originate from one of two centres; the heart and the \"kanda\", the last being an egg-shaped bulb in the pelvic area, just below the navel.\n\nWhen awakened, kundalini travels upward within Sushumna. The Ida and Pingala nadis are often seen as referring to the two hemispheres of the brain. Pingala is the extroverted (Active), solar nadi, and corresponds to the right hand side of the body and the left hand side of the brain. Ida is the introverted, lunar nadi, and corresponds to the left hand side of the body and the right hand side of the brain (there is a contralateralization). These nadis are also said to have an extrasensory function, playing a part in empathic and instinctive responses. The two nadis are believed to be stimulated through different Pranayama practices, including nadi shodhana, which involves alternately breathing through the left and right nostrils, which would theoretically stimulate the left and right sides of the brain respectively. The word \"nadi\" comes from the Sanskrit root \"nad\" meaning \"channel\", \"stream\", or \"flow\". Special breathing techniques are supposed to influence the flow of prana within these nadis. According to this interpretation, these techniques will purify and develop these two energetic currents and may lead to the awakening of kundalini.\n\n\nThe Ida and Pingala nadis are often seen as referring to the two hemispheres of the brain. Pingala is the extroverted, solar nadi, and corresponds to left hemisphere . Ida is the introverted, lunar nadi, and refers to the right hemisphere of the brain.\nIda nadi controls all the mental processes while Pingala nadi controls all the vital processes.\n\n\nThe medieval \"Sat-Cakra-Nirupana\" (1520s), one of the later and more fully developed classical texts on nadis and chakras, refers to these three main nadis by the names Sasi, Mihira, and Susumna.\n\nOther cultures also work with concepts similar to nadis and prana.\n\nSystems based on Traditional Chinese Medicine work with an energy concept called \"qi\". Qi travels through meridians similar in description to the nadis. The microcosmic orbit practice has many similarities to certain Indian nadi shuddha (channel clearing) exercises and the practice of Kriya Yoga.\n\nTibetan medicine borrows many concepts from Yoga through the influence of Tantric Buddhism. One of the Six Yogas of Naropa is a cleansing of the central channel called phowa, preparing the soul to leave the body through the sagittal suture. The Vajrayana practice of Trul Khor is another practice used to direct and control the flow of energy within the body's energetic meridians through breath control and physical postures.\n\nSometimes the three main nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna) are related to the Caduceus of Hermes: \"the two snakes of which symbolize the kundalini or serpent-fire which is presently to be set in motion along those channels, while the wings typify the power of conscious flight through higher planes which the development of that fire confers\".\n\n\n"}

She is the recipient of multiple awards, including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actress, and a Cannes Film Festival special award.\n\nKidman began her acting career in Australia with the 1983 film \"Bush Christmas\". In the same year, she starred in \"BMX Bandits,\" also filmed in Australia. Her breakthrough came in 1989 with the thriller \"Dead Calm\" and the television miniseries \"Bangkok Hilton\". In 1990, she made her Hollywood debut in the racing film \"Days of Thunder\", opposite Tom Cruise. She went on to achieve wide recognition with leading roles in the romantic drama \"Far and Away\" (1992), the superhero film \"Batman Forever\" (1995), the crime comedy-drama \"To Die For\" (1995), for which she won a Golden Globe Award, and the erotic thriller \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (1999). She received two consecutive Academy Award for Best Actress nominations for playing a courtesan in the musical \"Moulin Rouge!\" (2001) and the writer Virginia Woolf in the drama film \"The Hours\" (2002); she won the award for the latter, and received Golden Globes for both films.\n\nKidman continued to star in commercially successful films, including the horror-thriller \"The Others\" (2001) and the epic war drama film \"Cold Mountain\" (2003), as she achieved critical acclaim for roles in independent films, including the dramas \"Dogville\" (2003), \"Birth\" (2004), and \"Rabbit Hole\" (2010), for which she received a third Best Actress Oscar nomination, and the thriller \"The Paperboy\" (2012). Kidman earned a fourth Oscar nomination for playing a troubled mother in the biopic \"Lion\" (2016). She returned to television in 2017 with an acclaimed performance as a victim of domestic abuse in the HBO series \"Big Little Lies\", for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress. In 2018 she received praise for her performances in the drama films \"Destroyer\" and \"Boy Erased\".\n\nKidman has been a Goodwill ambassador for UNICEF since 1994 and for UNIFEM since 2006. In 2006, Kidman was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia and was the highest-paid actress in the motion picture industry for that year. As a result of being born to Australian parents in Hawaii, Kidman has dual citizenship of Australia and the United States. Kidman founded and owns the production company Blossom Films. Following her divorce from actor Tom Cruise, Kidman has been married to singer Keith Urban since 2006.\n\nKidman was born 20 June 1967 in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her mother, Janelle Ann (née Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband's books and was a member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. Her father was Antony Kidman (1938–2014), a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author, who died of a heart attack in Singapore aged 75. Kidman's ancestry includes Irish, Scottish and English heritage.\n\nBeing born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name \"Hōkūlani\". The inspiration for the name came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo, but the name is also a commonly used Hawaiian name for girls, Hokulani meaning \"Heavenly Star\".\n\nAt the time of Kidman's birth, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman's parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C. The family returned to Australia when Kidman was four and her mother now lives on Sydney's North Shore. Kidman has a younger sister, Antonia Kidman, a journalist and TV presenter.\n\nKidman attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls' High School. She was enrolled in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years. She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in \"The Wizard of Oz\". Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, \"I am very shy – really shy – I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don't like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don't like going to a party by myself.\"\n\nShe initially studied at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. At Philip Street, Kidman studied alongside Naomi Watts who had attended the same high school. She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People. Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge. Owing to her fair skin and naturally red hair, the Australian sun forced the young Kidman to rehearse in halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she received both encouragement and praise to pursue acting full-time.\n\nIn 1983, aged 16, Kidman made her film debut in a remake of the Australian holiday season favourite \"Bush Christmas\". By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series \"Five Mile Creek\". In 1984, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting work temporarily while she studied massage so she could help her mother with physical therapy. She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including \"BMX Bandits\" (1983), \"Watch the Shadows Dance\" (1987 aka \"Nightmaster\"), and the romantic comedy \"Windrider\" (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes. Also during the decade, she appeared in several Australian productions, including the soap opera \"A Country Practice\" and the 1987 miniseries \"Vietnam\". She also made guest appearances on Australian television programs and TV movies.\n\nIn 1988, Kidman appeared in \"Emerald City\", based on the play of the same name. The Australian film earned her an Australian Film Institute award for Best Supporting Actress. Kidman next starred with Sam Neill in \"Dead Calm\" (1989) as Rae Ingram, playing the wife of a naval officer. The thriller brought Kidman to international recognition; \"Variety\" commented: \"Throughout the film, Kidman is excellent. She gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy.\" Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert noted the excellent chemistry between the leads, stating, \"Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.\" She followed that up with the Australian miniseries \"Bangkok Hilton\". She next moved on to star alongside her then-boyfriend and future husband, Tom Cruise, in the 1990 auto racing film \"Days of Thunder\", as a young doctor who falls in love with a NASCAR driver.

Of Kidman's Golden Globe award-winning performance, Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said \"[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up – as she does throughout the film – Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same.\" Kidman next appeared in \"The Portrait of a Lady\" (1996), based on the novel of the same name, alongside Barbara Hershey, John Malkovich, and Mary-Louise Parker. The following year, she starred in the action-thriller \"The Peacemaker\" (1997) as White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly, opposite George Clooney. The film grossed $110,000,000 worldwide.

In 2001, Kidman played the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine in Baz Luhrmann's musical \"Moulin Rouge!\", opposite Ewan McGregor. Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of \"CNN.com\" called it her best work since \"To Die For\", and wrote \"[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film [...] Kidman seems to specialize in \"ice queen\" characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit.\" Subsequently, Kidman received her second Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as many other acting awards and nominations. She also received her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Actress.\n\nAlso in 2001, she had a starring role in Alejandro Amenábar's horror film \"The Others\" as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over $210,947,037 worldwide, the film also earned several Goya Awards award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Kidman. She received her second BAFTA and fifth Golden Globe nominations. Roger Ebert commented that \"Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric.\" Kidman was named the World's Most Beautiful Person by People magazine\n\nIn 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's \"The Hours\", which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore.

The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. \"The New York Times\" wrote that, \"Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain\".

As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech about the importance of art, even during times of war, saying, \"Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil?

{"id": "48847127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48847127", "title": "Nirmala (sect)", "text": "Nirmala (sect)\n\nNirmala (Punjabi: ਨਿਰਮਲੇ) is an Indian religious sect of ascetics who interpret the Sikh philosophy in Vedantic terms. They variously claim to have originated during the period of Guru Nanak (15th-16th century) or Guru Gobind Singh (17th century).\n\nThe origin of the Nirmalas is uncertain: the sect is first mentioned in the Sikh literature towards the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, some Nirmala scholars traced their origin to the period of the first Sikh Guru, Nanak, but some others traced their origin to the period of the last Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh.\n\nA popular account of the sect's origin appears in \"Nirmal Panth Pardipika\" (1891) by the Nirmala scholar Giani Gian Singh: In 1686, Guru Gobind Singh met a Sanskrit scholar named Pandit Raghunath, and asked him to open a Sanskrit school for Sikhs. However, Raghunath refused to do so, because the Sikhs included people of low-caste origin. Therefore, the Guru sent five Sikhs (Bir Singh, Ganda Singh, Karam Singh, Ram Singh and Saina Singh) to Varanasi to learn Sanskrit. These Sikhs were first members of the group that later came to be known as the Nirmala sect. After mastering Sanskrit in Kashi, they returned to Anandpur, where they were honoured by the title Nirmala (Sanskrit for \"pure\" or \"unsullied\"). They then taught and translated the texts they learned into Punjabi. They also then took the Amrit initiation into the Khalsa panth.\n\nThe historicity of this account is doubtful, as there are very few mentions of Nirmalas before the 19th century. Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech hypothesize that the Nirmalas originated much later or are descended from the Udasis, who are similar to them in ascetic lifestyle, celibacy and Vedantic interpretation of Sikh philosophy.\n\nPatronage from Sikh nobles, especially the rulers of the Phulkian states, helped the Nirmalas become a prominent religious order. Sardar Dhyan Singh of Shahbad willed his estate to Karam Singh Nirmala. In 1766, Sadda Singh of Bahirwala offered seven villages to Bhagat Singh Nirmala, although the latter declined the offer. Sardar Jai Singh's daughter-in-law granted two villages to the Nirmal dera at Kankhal.\n\nSardar Ganda Singh of Bhangi Misl offered 13 villages to Jai Singh Nirmala. In 1796, Maharaja Ranjit Singh also granted a sanad for land to Nihal Singh Nirmala. On both occasions, the Nirmalas passed on the properties to the Udasi akhara of Santokh Das.\n\nLike the Udasis, the Nirmalas interpret the teachings of the Sikh Gurus in context of Vedanta. They view the first Sikh Guru, Nanak, as an Advaita Vedantist, a follower of Shankara, and a defender of the \"Sanatana dharma\".\n\nHowever, compared to the Udasis, the Nirmalas have shared a closer relationship the mainstream Khalsa Sikhs. Many prominent Nirmala sants preached mainstream Sikhism in Punjab, and Nirmala akharas have played an important role in training Sikhs. But after the Akali movement, the Khalsa attempts to create a Sikh identity completely distinct from Hindus made the Khalsa-Nirmala relationship fragile.\n\nThe Nirmala Panchaati akhara at Kankhal, established with grants from the rulers of Phulkian states, has the highest status among all Nirmala chapters. Other major Nirmala centres are located at Haridwar, Allahabad, Ujjain, Trimbak, Kurukshetra and Patna.\n\n\n"}

It is a common term in Turkish and Mongol mythologies. After death, all shamans become shamanic souls, ongod. Idols can be consecrated to them within three years of the shaman's death and can be placed in the home (\"home ongon\") or in another locale, such as a shelter out in the open (\"field ongon\"). The ongon is also the physical representation of that spirit, made by a shaman, which plays a central part in the ritual that invokes the protection of the spirit. One well-known such spirit is Dayan Deerh.\n\nThe ongon is particularly important in black shamanism: the main function of the \"khar talynkh\" or black shaman is to bring people into contact with the ongon, whose spirit they call up \"while drumming in a trance\". In late-nineteenth century Mongolia, according to Otgony Purev, yellow shamanism revered ongon as well, and every three years yellow shamans gathered in Dayan Deerh monastery in Khövsgöl Province to \"renew\" these ancestral spirits.\n\nOngod are represented in the physical world in various ways. In the case of the Tuvan shamaness Yamaan, an ancestor spirit is represented in the handle of a drum, a carved figure with a pink head and chest, a black crown, and red eyes and forehead. A wire serves as arms, and on another wire \"holbogo\" are suspended to indicate the spirit's earring. Some ongon live on in the place inhabited by the shaman: Agaaryn Khairhan, a mountain in Khövsgöl Province, takes its name from one of the most powerful shamanesses of the Darkhad clan, Agaaryn Khairhan or Bagdan Udgan, who lived on the mountain in the eighteenth century. In present-day Northern Mongolia, specifically the Darkhad Valley, clusters of ongod are found in transitional or liminal locations, such as the mouths of rivers or the borders between taiga and steppe: In Darkhad Valley, the taiga and surrounding mountains are the traditional areas dominated by shamanism, where the steppe is dominated by Buddhism.\n\nMany Darkhad households own talismans, \"lineage talismans\" (\"yazguur ongod\") or \"household talismans\" (\"geriin ongod\"), that both contain and attract spirits.\n\n"}

The first \"turumba\" in the icon's honour was held on September 14, 1788.\n\nThe icon of Our Lady is a oil painting on canvas. The face of Mary is contorted by pain from the dagger plunged into her heart, which Simeon has prophesied. \n\nThe icon is presently enshrined at the St. Peter of Alcantara Parish Church in Pakil. The second image of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Sorrows is an in-the-round replica of the image of Nuestra Señora de las Angustias from Spain.\n\nThe image, according to tradition, belonged to some missionaries who crossed Laguna de Bay in a launch. When the launch was shipwrecked, some of its relics were washed ashore including the icon of the Virgin. \n\nOne Friday morning, some fishermen found the icon in their nets. Believing it to be a religious image, they decided to bring it to a parish church. When the men carried the small painting, they found it too heavy. They tried sailing in directions with three icon until they brought it to the shore near Pakil Church. When they headed that way, the wind and current aided their course. Upon landing, they left the heavy image on a rock so they could continue their fishing duties.\n\nA group of women found the icon the following Sunday morning. Although it had rained during the night, the canvas was miraculously dry. When they tried to take the icon away, they could not move it; even the strongest among them, Mariangga, could not lift it. They quickly told the parish priest, who in turn called the sacristans, choristers, and churchgoers at Mass to fetch the image. As they lifted the image, it gave way. The townsfolk around begun to sing and dance, giving birth to the \"turumba\". \n\nBy order of Pope Pius XII, and in recognition of the miracles credited to it, the Nuestra Señora de las Antiguas was episcopally crowned by Alejandro Olalia, the Bishop of Lipa, on 23-24 May 1953.\n\nThe Seven days of Sorrows are known to the Philippines as Lupi fiestas:\n\nThe image is also taken on a procession on October 19, The Town Fiesta of Pakil. On the Sunday nearest September 15, The Catholic Church celebrates the national feast of the discovery of the image.\n\nHomage to the Virgin of Sorrows is done by the way of song and dance, drumbeat and shill cries of its devotees that the people regard as co-sharing with Mary's grief during the Passion of Christ. The turumba episodes are called \"lupi\" (meaning to fold) it is so because at the closing of every festivities, the novena booklet is folded to mark the pause in preparation for the next Lupi.\n\nDresses of the Virgin are shredded and given to pilgrims as tokens. It was said that when the piece of cloth from the Virgin is kept close to one person, miraculous powers and against personal injury, accidents, fire and calamities happen. \n\nThe statue is enshrined at the retablo in the main altar, The image is dressed in violet as a sign of sorrow for her son's passion (the color of Lent) And the original image is enshrined in a separate \"retablo\" around bas reliefs of her Seven Sorrows at a chapel in the church. St Peter of Alcantara Parish is located in Pakil, Laguna; over facing Laguna de Bay\n\n"}

Ramasamy\n\nErode Venkatappa Ramasamy (17 September 1879 – 24 December 1973), commonly known as Periyar, also referred to as Thanthai Periyar, was an Indian social activist, and politician who started the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam.He is known as the 'Father of modern Tamilnadu'. He has done exemplary works against Brahminical dominance, caste prevalence and women oppression in Tamilnadu. \n\nE.V. Ramasamy joined the Indian National Congress in 1919, but resigned in 1925 when he felt that the party was only serving the interests of Brahmins. He questioned the subjugation of non-Brahmin Dravidians as Brahmins enjoyed gifts and donations from non-Brahmins but opposed and discriminated non-Brahmins in cultural and religious matters. In 1924, E.V. Ramasamy participated in a non-violent agitation (satyagraha) in Vaikom, Kerala. From 1929 to 1932 Ramasamy made a tour of British Malaya, Europe, and Russia which influenced him. In 1939, E.V. Ramasamy became the head of the Justice Party, and in 1944, he changed its name to \"Dravidar Kazhagam\". The party later split with one group led by C. N. Annadurai forming the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida Nadu (\"land of the Dravidians)\".\n\nE.V. Ramasamy promoted the principles of rationalism, self-respect, women’s rights and eradication of caste. He opposed the exploitation and marginalisation of the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and the imposition of what he considered Indo-Aryan India.\n\nErode Venkata Ramasamy was born on 17 September 1879 in Erode, then a part of the Coimbatore district of the Madras Presidency. E.V. Ramasamy's father, Kannada speaking a rich Balija businessman, was Venkatappa Naicker (or Venkata), and his mother was Chinnathyee, Muthammal. He had one elder brother named Krishnaswamy and two sisters named Kannamma and Ponnuthoy. He later came to be known as \"Periyar\" meaning 'respected one' or 'elder' in Tamil. \n\nE.V. Ramasamy married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933. E.V. Ramasamy married for a second time in July 1948. His second wife, Maniammai, continued E.V. Ramasamy's social work after his death in 1973, but his thoughts and ideas then were advocated by Dravidar Kazhagam.\n\nIn 1929, E.V. Ramasamy announced the deletion of his caste title \"Naicker\" from his name at the First Provincial Self-Respect Conference of Chengalpattu. He could speak three Dravidian languages: Kannada, Telugu and Tamil.\n\nE.V. Ramasamy's father arranged for his wedding when he was nineteen. The bride, Nagammai, was only thirteen. Despite having an arranged marriage, Periyar and Nagammai were already in love with each other. Nagammai actively supported her husband in his later public activities and agitations. Two years after their marriage, a daughter was born to them. However, their daughter died when she was five months old. The couple had no more children.\n\nIn 1904, E.V. Ramasamy went on a pilgrimage to Kasi to visit the revered Shiva temple of Kashi Vishwanath. Though regarded as one of the holiest sites of Hinduism, he witnessed immoral activities such as begging, and floating dead bodies. His frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in general when he experienced what he called Brahmanic exploitation.\n\nHowever, one particular incident in Kasi had a profound impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu \"shastras\" to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.\n\nAs his hunger became intolerable, Periyar was forced to feed on leftovers from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasamy was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.\n\nE.V. Ramasamy joined the Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his business and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.\n\nAccording to the prevalent caste system in Kerala and the rest of India, low-caste Hindus were denied entry into temples.\nIn Kerala, they were denied permission to walk on the roads that led to the temples also. (Kerala state was formed in 1956; earlier it was broadly divided into Malabar (North Kerala), Cochin and Travancore kingdoms).\n\nIn the Kakinada meet of the Congress Party in 1923, T K Madhavan presented a report citing the discrimination faced by the depressed castes in Kerala. That session decided to promote movements against untouchability.\n\nIn Kerala, a committee was formed comprising people of different castes to fight untouchability in the region. The committee was chaired by K Kelappan; the rest of the members were T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, Kurur Neelakantan Namboodiripad and T R Krishnaswami Iyer.\nThe movement started on 30th March 1924.\nThere was a board outside the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple which prohibited entry of avarnas (lower castes).\nThe Satyagrahis moved to enter the temple in batches of three. They were resisted and arrested by the police.\nGandhiji, Chatampi Swamikal and Sree Narayana Guru lend their support to the movement.\nThe movement gained all-India prominence and support came from far and wide.\nThe Akalis of Punjab lend their support by setting up kitchens to provide food to the Satyagrahis.\nEven Christian and Muslim leaders came forward for support. This was shunned by Gandhiji who wanted the movement to be an intra-Hindu affair.\nOn advice from Gandhiji, the movement was withdrawn temporarily in April 1924.\nAfter the talks with caste-Hindus failed, the leaders resumed the movement. Leaders T K Madhavan and K P Kesava Menon were arrested.\nE V Ramaswamy (Periyar) came from Tamil Nadu to give his support. He was arrested.\nOn 1st October 1924, a group of savarnas (forward castes) marched in a procession and submitted a petition to the Regent Maharani Sethulakshmi Bai of Travancore with about 25000 signatures for temple entry to everyone.\nGandhiji also met with the Regent Maharani. This procession of savarnas was led by Mannath Padmanabhan Nair. Starting with about 500 people at Vaikom, the number increased to about 5000 when the procession reached Thiruvananthapuram in November 1924.\n\nIn February 1924, they decided to launch a ‘Keralaparyatanam’ to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed. |url=https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/vaikom-satyagraha |\nIn Vaikom, a small town in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of untouchability in and around the temple area. \"Dalits\", also known as Harijans were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised \"Satyagraha.\" Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On 14th April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title \"Vaikom Veeran\", given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.\n\nThe way in which the \"Vaikom Satyagraha\" events have been recorded provides a clue to the image of the respective organisers. In an article entitle \"Gandhi and Ambedkar, A Study in Leadership\", Eleanor Zelliot relates the 'Vaikom Satyagraha', including Gandhi's negotiations with the temple authorities in relation to the event. Furthermore, the editor of E.V. Ramasamy's \"Thoughts\" states that Brahmins purposely suppressed news about E.V. Ramasamy's participation. A leading Congress magazine, \"Young India\", in its extensive reports on Vaikom never mentions E.V. Ramasamy.\nAccording to the prevalent caste system in Kerala and the rest of India, low-caste Hindus were denied entry into temples.\nIn Kerala, they were denied permission to walk on the roads that led to the temples also. (Kerala state was formed in 1956; earlier it was broadly divided into Malabar (North Kerala), Cochin and Travancore kingdoms).\nIn the Kakinada meet of the Congress Party in 1923, T K Madhavan presented a report citing the discrimination faced by the depressed castes in Kerala. That session decided to promote movements against untouchability.\nIn Kerala, a committee was formed comprising people of different castes to fight untouchability in the region. The committee chaired by K Kelappan, composed of T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, Kurur Neelakantan Namboodiripad and T R Krishnaswami Iyer.\nIn February 1924, they decided to launch a ‘Keralaparyatanam’ to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed.\n\nPeriyar and his followers campaigned constantly to influence and pressure the government to take measures to remove social inequality,(abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc) even while other nationalist forerunners focused on the struggle for political independence. The Self-Respect Movement was described from the beginning as \"dedicated to the goal of giving non-Brahmins a sense of pride based on their Dravidian past\".\n\nIn 1952, the Periyar \"Self-Respect Movement Institution\" was registered with a list of objectives of the institution from which may be quoted as for the diffusion of useful knowledge of political education; to allow people to live a life of freedom from slavery to anything against reason and self respect; to do away with needless customs, meaningless ceremonies, and blind superstitious beliefs in society; to put an end to the present social system in which caste, religion, community and traditional occupations based on the accident of birth, have chained the mass of the people and created \"superior\" and \"inferior\" classes... and to give people equal rights; to completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based on brother/sisterhood; to give equal rights to women; to prevent child marriages and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to conduct and encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious marriages and to have the marriages registered under the Civil Law; and to establish and maintain homes for orphans and widows and to run educational institutions. Propagation of the philosophy of \"self respect\" became the full-time activity of Periyar since 1925. A Tamil weekly \"Kudi Arasu\" started in 1925, while the English journal \"Revolt\" started in 1928 carried on the propaganda among the English educated people. The \"Self-Respect Movement\" began to grow fast and received the sympathy of the heads of the Justice Party from the beginning. In May 1929, a conference of Self-Respect Volunteers was held at Pattukkotai under the presidency of S. Guruswami. K.V. Alagiriswami took charge as the head of the volunteer band. Conferences followed in succession throughout the Tamil districts of the former Madras Presidency. A training school in Self-Respect was opened at Erode, the home town of Periyar. The object was not just to introduce social reform but to bring about a social revolution to foster a new spirit and build a new society.\n\nBetween 1929 and 1935, under the strain of World Depression, political thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came under the influence of the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the \"Self-Respect Movement\" as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.\n\nE.V. Ramasamy toured Malaya for a month, from December 1929 to January 1930, to propagate the \"self-respect\" philosophy. Embarking on his journey from Nagapattinam with his wife Nagammal and his followers, E.V. Ramasamy was received by 50,000 Tamil Malaysians in Penang. During the same month, he inaugurated the Tamils Conference, convened by the Tamils Reformatory Sangam in Ipoh, and then went to Singapore. In December 1931 he undertook a tour of Europe, accompanied by S. Ramanathan and Erode Ramu, to personally acquaint himself with their political systems, social movements, way of life, economic and social progress and administration of public bodies. He visited Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Germany, England, Spain, France and Portugal, staying in Russia for three months. On his return journey he halted at Ceylon and returned to India in November 1932.\n\nThe tour shaped the political ideology of E.V. Ramasamy to achieve the social concept of Self-Respect. The communist system obtained in Russia appealed to him as appropriately suited to deal with the social ills of the country. Thus, on socio-economic issues Periyar was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership. Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial stage of development in the \"Self-Respect Movement\" which got politicised and found its compatibility in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn 1937, when Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency, he introduced Hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools, thereby igniting a series of anti-Hindi agitations. Tamil nationalists, the Justice Party under Sir A. T. Panneerselvam, and E.V. Ramasamy organised anti-Hindi protests in 1938 which ended with numerous arrests by the Rajaji government.\n\nDuring the same year, the slogan \"Tamil Nadu for Tamilians\" was first raised by E.V. Ramasamy in protest against the introduction of Hindi in schools. He explained that the introduction of Hindi was a dangerous mechanism used by the Aryans to infiltrate Dravidian culture. He reasoned that the adoption of Hindi would make Tamils subordinate to the Hindi speaking North Indians. E.V. Ramasamy explained that Hindi would not only halt the progress of Tamil people, but would also completely destroy their culture and nullify the progressive ideas that had been successfully inculcated through Tamil in the recent decades.\n\nCutting across party lines, South Indian politicians rallied together in their opposition to Hindi. There were recurrent anti-Hindi agitations in 1948, 1952 and 1965.\n\nA political party known as the \"South Indian Libertarian Federation\" (commonly referred to as \"Justice Party\") was founded in 1916, principally to oppose the economic and political power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin \"caste\" groups.\n\nIn 1937, when the government required that Hindi be taught in the school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the \"Justice Party\". After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played a big role in the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the \"Justice Party\" weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.\n\nAt a rally in 1944, Periyar, in his capacity as the leader of the Justice Party, declared that the party would henceforth be known as the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\", or \"Dravidian Association\". However, a few who disagreed with Periyar started a splinter group, claiming to be the original Justice Party. This party was led by veteran Justice Party leader P. T. Rajan and survived until 1957.\n\nThe \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" came to be well known among the urban communities and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the \"Dalits\". It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.\n\nIn 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, established a separate association called the \"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\" (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This was due to differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, at the same time claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\", stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\", the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.\n\nIn 1956, despite warnings from P. Kakkan, the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, Periyar organised a procession to the Marina to burn pictures of the Hindu God Rama. Periyar was subsequently arrested and confined to prison.\n\nThe activities of Periyar continued when he went to Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All India Official Language Conference. There he stressed the need to retain English as the Union Official Language instead of Hindi. Five years later, Periyar travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the caste system. Nearing Periyar's last years, an award was given to him by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and it was presented to him by the Union Education Minister, Triguna Sen in Madras (Chennai), on 27 June 1970. In his last meeting at Thiagaraya Nagar, Chennai on 19 December 1973, Periyar declared a call for action to gain social equality and a dignified way of life. On 24 December 1973, Periyar died at the age of 94.\n\nPeriyar spent over fifty years giving speeches, propagating the realisation that everyone is an equal citizen and the differences on the basis of caste and creed were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane masses, scores of educated people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning with respect to subjects of social interest in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were considered by many to be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.\n\nThe bedrock of E.V. Ramasamy’s principles and the movements that he started was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority and trying to keep it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.\n\nLikewise, E.V. Ramasamy explained that wisdom lies in thinking and that the spear-head of thinking is rationalism. On caste, he stated that no other living being harms or degrades its own class. But man, said to be a rational living being, does these evils. The differences, hatred, enmity, degradation, poverty, and wickedness, now prevalent in the society are due to lack of wisdom and rationalism and not due to God or the cruelty of time. E.V. Ramasamy had written in his books and magazines dozens of times of various occasions that the British rule is better than self-rule\n\nE.V. Ramasamy also blamed the capitalists for their control of machineries, creating difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, which has to lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge. An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.\n\nIn a message to the Brahmin community, Periyar stated, \"in the name of god, religion, and sastras you have duped us. We were the ruling people. Stop this life of cheating us from this year. Give room for rationalism and humanism\". He added that \"any opposition not based on rationalism, science, or experience will one day or another, reveal the fraud, selfishness, lies and conspiracies\".\n\nPeriyar's philosophy of self-respect was based on his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions should be based on rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the philosophy of self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under all circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.\n\nPeriyar's foremost appeal to people was to develop self-respect. He preached that the Brahmins had monopolised and cheated other communities for decades and deprived them of self-respect. He stated that most Brahmins claimed to belong to a \"superior\" community with the reserved privilege of being in charge of temples and performing archanas. He felt that they were trying to reassert their control over religion by using their superior caste status to claim the exclusive privilege to touch idols or enter the sanctum sanctorum.\n\nAs a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar advocated forcefully throughout his life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men and that they should be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.\n\nPeriyar fought against the orthodox traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed that it would be a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.\n\nWomen in India also did not have rights to their families' or husbands' property. Periyar fought fiercely for this and also advocated for women to have the right to separate or divorce their husbands under reasonable circumstances. While birth control remained taboo in society of Periyar's time, he advocated for it not only for the health of women and population control, but for the liberation of women.\n\nHe criticised the hypocrisy of chastity for women and argued that it should either apply also to men, or not at all for both genders. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated getting rid of the Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women, attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. Further, for the liberation of women, Periyar pushed for their right to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.\n\nAccording to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Periyar and his movement achieved a better status for women in Tamil society. Periyar held that, in matters of education and employment, there should be no difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Periyar's influence in the State departments and even the Center made it possible for women to join police departments and the army. Periyar also spoke out against child marriage.\n\nPeriyar wanted thinking people to see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued that the government was not for the people, but, in a \"topsy-turvy\" manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage of a small group of people.\n\nOne of the areas of Periyar's focus was on the upliftment of rural communities. In a booklet called \"Village Uplift\", Periyar pleaded for rural reform. At that time rural India still formed the largest part of the Indian subcontinent, in spite of the ongoing process of urbanisation. Thus, the distinction between rural and urban had meant an economic and social degradation for rural inhabitants. Periyar wanted to eradicate the concept of \"village\" as a discrimination word among places, just as the concept of \"outcast\" among social groups. Periyar advocated for a location where neither the name nor the situation or its conditions imply differences among people. He further advocated for the modernisation of villages by providing public facilities such as schools, libraries, radio stations, roads, bus transport, and police stations.\n\nPeriyar felt that a small number of cunning people created caste distinctions to dominate over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that the caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive to get rid of this menace.\n\nPeriyar stated that the caste system in South India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked with the arrival of Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a different stratification of society in four or five regions (\"Tinai\"), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.\n\nThe Samathuvapuram (Equality Village) social equality system introduced by the Government of Tamil Nadu in the late 1990s is named after Ramasamy.\n\nPeriyar claimed that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada came from the same mother language of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contradicts such claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). \n\nWith relation to writing, Periyar stated that using the Tamil script about the arts, which are useful to the people in their life and foster knowledge, talent and courage, and propagating them among the masses, will enlighten the people. Further, he explained that it will enrich the language, and thus it can be regarded as a zeal for Tamil. Periyar also stated that if words of North Indian origin (Sanskrit) are removed from Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, only Tamil will be left. On the Brahmin usage of Tamil, he stated that the Tamil spoken by the Andhras and the Malayali people was far better than the Tamil spoken by the Brahmins. Periyar believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the banner of Tamil culture, and that it will make the Kannadigas, Andhras and the Malayalees be vigilant. With regards to a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Periyar stated that \"a time will come for unity. This will go on until there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us\".\n\nAt the same time, Periyar was also known to have made controversial remarks on the Tamil language and people from time to time. On one occasion, he referred to the Tamil people as \"barbarians\" and the Tamil language as the \"language of barbarians\". However, Anita Diehl explains that Periyar made these remarks on Tamil because it had no respective feminine verbal forms.\n\nPeriyar's ideas on Tamil alphabet reforms included those such as the reasons for the vowel 'ஈ' (i) having a cursive and looped representation of the short form 'இ' (I). In stone inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago, many Tamil letters are found in other shapes. As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology, Periyar thought that it was sensible to change a few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. He further explained that the older and more divine a language and its letters were said to be, the more they needed reform. Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' கா ', ' கே ' (kA:, kE:), Periyar questioned why other compound characters like ' கி ', ' கீ ', 'கு ', ' கூ ' (kI, ki:, kU, ku:) (indicated integrally as of now), shouldn't also have separate signs. Further, changing the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are redundant, were quite essential according to Periyar. Thus, the glory and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else\"\n\nPeriyar hailed the \"Thirukkural\" as a valuable scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for modern society.\n\nOn caste, he believed that the Kural illustrates how Vedic laws of Manu were against the Sudras and other communities of the Dravidian race. On the other hand, Periyar opined that the ethics from the Kural was comparable to the Christian Bible. The Dravidar Kazhagam adopted the Thirukkural and advocated that Thiruvalluvar's Kural alone was enough to educate the people of the country.\nOne of Periyar's quotes on the Thirukkural from Veeramani's \"Collected Works of Periyar\" was \"when Dravida Nadu (Dravidistan) was a victim to Indo-Aryan deceit, Thirukkural was written by a great Dravidian Thiruvalluvar to free the Dravidians\".\n\nPeriyar also asserted that due to the secular nature of Thirukkural, it has the capacity to be the common book of faith for all humanity and can be kept on par or above the holy books of all religions. This was rejected by Muslim scholars of the day.\n\nThe Dravidian-Aryan conflict was believed to be a continuous historical phenomenon that started when the Aryans first set their foot in the Dravidian lands. Even a decade before the idea of separation appeared, Periyar stated that, \"as long as Aryan religion, Indo-Aryan domination, propagation of Aryan Vedas and Aryan \"Varnashrama\" existed, there was need for a \"Dravidian Progressive Movement\" and a \"Self-Respect Movement\". Periyar became very concerned about the growing North Indian domination over the south which appeared to him no different from foreign domination. He wanted to secure the fruits of labour of the Dravidians to the Dravidians, and lamented that fields such as political, economic, industrial, social, art, and spiritual were dominated by the north for the benefit of the North Indians. Thus, with the approach of independence from Britain, this fear that North India would take the place of Britain to dominate South India became more and more intense.\n\nPeriyar was clear about the concept of a separate nation, comprising Tamil areas, that is part of the then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of minorities, including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed \"Dravida Nadu\", but failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Periyar received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress.\n\nThe concept of \"Dravida Nadu\" was later modified down to Tamil Nadu. This led to a proposal for a union of the Tamil people of not only South India but including those of Ceylon as well. In 1953, Periyar helped to preserve Madras as the capital of Tamil Nadu, which later was the name he substituted for the more general Dravida Nadu. In 1955 Periyar threatened to burn the national flag, but on Chief Minister Kamaraj's pledge that Hindi should not be made compulsory, he postponed the action. In his speech of 1957 called \"Suthantara Tamil Nadu En?\" (Why an independent Tamil Nadu?), he criticised the Central Government of India, inducing thousands of Tamilians to burn the constitution of India. The reason for this action was that Periyar held the Government responsible for maintaining the caste system. After stating reasons for separation and turning down opinions against it, he closed his speech with a \"war cry\" to join and burn the map of India on 5 June. Periyar was sentenced to six months imprisonment for burning the Indian constitution.\n\nAdvocacy of such a nation became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a \"Dravida Nadu Separation Day\" was observed on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a \"Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization\" and that it was necessary to work towards it.\n\nPeriyar was a radical advocate of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.\n\nIn 1920, when the Justice Party came to power, Brahmins occupied about 70 percent of the high level posts in the government. After reservation was introduced by the Justice Party, it reversed this trend, allowing non-Brahmins to rise in the government of the Madras Presidency. Periyar, through the Justice Party, advocated against the imbalance of the domination of Brahmins who constituted only 3 percent of the population, over government jobs, judiciary and the Madras University. His Self-Respect Movement espoused rationalism and atheism and the movement had currents of anti-Brahminism. Furthermore, Periyar stated that:\n\n\"Our Dravidian movement does not exist against the Brahmins or the Banias (a North Indian merchant caste). If anyone thinks so, I would only pity him. But we will not tolerate the ways in which Brahminism and the Bandiaism is degrading Dravidanadu. Whatever support they may have from the government, neither myself nor my movement will be of cowardice\".\n\nPeriyar also criticised Subramanya Bharathi in the journal \"Ticutar\" for portraying Mother Tamil as a sister of Sanskrit in his poems:\n\n\"They say Bharati is an immortal poet.…Even if a rat dies in an akrakāram, they would declare it to be immortal. … of Tamilnadu praises him. Why should this be so? Supposedly because he sang fulsome praises of Tamil and Tamilnadu. What else could he sing? His own mother tongue, Sanskrit, has been dead for years. What other language did he know? He cannot sing in Sanskrit. … He says Tamilnadu is the land of Aryas.\"\nIn the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924, Periyar and Gandhi ji both cooperated and confronted each other in socio-political action. Periyar and his followers emphasised the difference in point of view between Gandhi and himself on the social issues, such as fighting the Untouchability Laws and eradication of the caste system.\n\nAccording to the booklet \"Gandhi and Periyar\", Periyar wrote in his paper \"Kudi Arasu\" in 1925, reporting on the fact that Gandhi was ousted from the Mahasabha because he opposed resolutions for the maintaining of caste and Untouchability Laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. From this, Gandhi learned the need for pleasing the Brahmins if anything was to be achieved.\n\nPeiryar in his references to Gandhi used opportunities to present Gandhi as, on principle, serving the interests of the Brahmins. In 1927, Periyar and Gandhi met at Bangalore to discuss this matter. The main difference between them came out when Periyar stood for the total eradication of Hinduism to which Gandhi objected saying that Hinduism is not fixed in doctrines but can be changed. In the \"Kudi Arasu\", Periyar explained that:\n\n\"With all his good qualities, Gandhi did not bring the people forward from foolish and evil ways. His murderer was an educated man. Therefore nobody can say this is a time of high culture. If you eat poison, you will die. If electricity hits the body, you will die. If you oppose the Brahmin, you will die. Gandhi did not advocate the eradication of Varnasrama \"Dharma\" structure, but sees in it a task for the humanisation of society and social change possible within its structure. The consequence of this would be continued high-caste leadership. Gandhi adapted Brahmins to social change without depriving them of their leadership\".\n\nGandhi accepted \"karma\" in the sense that \"the \"Untouchables\" reap the reward of their \"karma\", but was against discrimination against them using the revaluing term \"Harijans\". As shown in the negotiations at Vaikom his methods for abolishing discrimination were: to stress on the orthodox, inhumane treatment of \"Untouchables\"; to secure voluntary lifting of the ban by changing the hearts of caste Hindus; and to work within a Hindu framework of ideas.\n\nOn the Temple Entry issue, Gandhi never advocated the opening of \"Garbha Griha\" to \"Harijans\" in consequence of his Hindu belief. These sources which can be labelled \"pro-Periyar\" with the exception of M. Mahar and D.S. Sharma, clearly show that Periyar and his followers emphasised that Periyar was the real fighter for the removal of Untouchability and the true upliftment of Hairjans, whereas Gandhi was not. This did not prevent Periyar from having faith in Gandhi on certain matters.\n\nPeriyar was generally regarded as a pragmatic propagandist who attacked the evils of religious influence on society, mainly what he regarded as Brahmin domination. At a young age, he felt that some people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and considered it as his life's mission to warn people against superstitions and priests. Anita Diehl explains that Periyar cannot be called an atheist philosopher. Periyar, however, qualified for the definition of what the term 'atheist' implies in his address on philosophy. He repudiated the term as without real sense: \"…the talk of the atheist should be considered thoughtless and erroneous. The thing I call god... that makes all people equal and free, the god that does not stop free thinking and research, the god that does not ask for money, flattery and temples can certainly be an object of worship. For saying this much I have been called an atheist, a term that has no meaning\". EVR Periyar, a born Hindu, was vehemently opposed to Hinduism and Christianity. He did not criticize Islam.\n\nAnita Diehl explains that Periyar was against incompatibility of faith with social equality and not religion itself. In a book on revolution published in 1961, Periyar stated, \"be of help to people. Do not use treachery or deceit. Speak the truth and do not cheat. That indeed is service to God\".\n\nOn Hinduism, Periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book (bhagawad gita) or origins, but an imaginary faith preaching the \"superiority\" of the Brahmins, the inferiority of the Shudras, and the untouchability of the Dalits (Panchamas). Maria Misra, a lecturer at Oxford University, compares him to the philosophes, by stating, \"his contemptuous attitude to the baleful influence of Hinduism in Indian public life is strikingly akin to the anti-Catholic diatribes of the enlightenment philosophes\". In 1955, Periyar was arrested for his public agitation of burning the pictures of Rama at public places, as a symbolic protest against the Indo-Aryan domination and degradation of the Dravidian leadership according to the Ramayana epic. Periyar also shoed the images of Krishna and Rama, stating that they were Aryan gods that considered the Dravidian Shudras to be \"sons of prostitutes\".\n\nPeriyar openly suggested to those who were marginalised within the Hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as Islam, Christianity, or Buddhism. On Islam, he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.\n\nAt the rally in Tiruchi, Periyar said:\n\n\"Muslims are following the ancient philosophies of the Dravidians. The Arabic word for Dravidian religion is Islam. When Brahmanism was imposed in this country, it was Mohammad Nabi who opposed it, by instilling the Dravidian religion's policies as Islam in the minds of the people\"\n\nPeriyar viewed Christianity similar to the monotheistic faith of Islam. He explained that their faith says that there can be only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's \"The Precepts of Jesus\" has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.\n\nApart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar also found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement, \"Temple Entry Acts\" of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.\n\nWhen B. Munuswamy Naidu became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency in 1930, he endorsed the inclusion of Brahmins in the Justice Party, saying:\n\nSo long as we exclude one community, we cannot as a political speak on behalf of, or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces as a result of the reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.\n\nThough certain members supported the resolution, a faction in the Justice Party known as the \"Ginger Group\" opposed the resolution and eventually voted it down. Periyar, who was then an observer in the Justice Party, criticised Munuswamy Naidu, saying:\nAt a time when non-Brahmins in other parties were gradually coming over to the Justice Party, being fed up with the Brahmin's methods and ways of dealing with political questions, it was nothing short of folly to think of admitting him into the ranks of the Justice Party.\n\nThis factionism continued until 1932 when Munuswamy Naidu stepped down as the Chief Minister of Madras and the Raja of Bobbili became the chief minister.\n\nAfter the death of Periyar in 1973, conferences were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, the new head of the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\", set fire to the effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the \"Ramaleela\" celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread the ideals of the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" in rural areas.\n\nOn Periyar's birthday on 17 September 1974, Periyar's \"Rationalist Library\" and \"Research Library\" and \"Research Institute\" was opened by the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. This library contained Periyar's rationalist works, the manuscripts of Periyar and his recorded speeches. Also during the same year Periyar's ancestral home in Erode, was dedicated as a commemoration building. On 20 February 1977, the opening function of \"Periyar Building\" in Madras was held. At the meeting which the Managing Committee of the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" held, there on that day, it was decided to support the candidates belonging to the \"Janata Party\", the \"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\" (DMK), and the \"Marxist Party\" during the General Elections.\n\nOn 16 March 1978, Maniyammai died. The \"Managing Committee of the Dravidar Kazhagam\" elected K. Veeramani as General Secretary of the \"Dravidar Kazhagam\" on 17 March 1978. From then on, the \"Periyar-Maniyammai Educational and Charitable Society\" started the \"Periyar Centenary Women's Polytechnic\" at Thanjavur on 21 September 1980. On 8 May 1982, the \"College for Correspondence Education\" was started under the auspices of the \"Periyar Rationalist Propaganda Organization\".\n\nOver the years, Periyar influenced Tamil Nadu's political party heads such as C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi of the \"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\"' (DMK), V. Gopalswamy founder of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), S. Ramadoss founder of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Thol. Thirumavalavan, founder of the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), and \"Dravidar Kazhagam's\" K. Veeramani. Nationally, Periyar is main ideological icon for India's third largest voted party, Bahujan Samaj Party and its founder Kanshi Ram. Other political figures influenced by Periyar were former Congress minister K. Kamaraj, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati. Periyar's life and teachings have also influenced writers and poets such as Kavignar Inkulab, and Bharathidasan including actors such as Kamal Hassan and Sathyaraj. Noted Tamil Comedian N. S. Krishnan was a close friend and follower of Periyar.W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar was a close confidant of Periyar and encouraged Nadars to be a part of the Self-Respect Movement. An OBC community writer from Uttar Pradesh, Lalai Singh Yadav translated Periyar's notable works into Hindi.\n\nSathyaraj and Khushboo Sundar starred in a government-sponsored film \"Periyar\" released in 2007. Directed by Gnana Rajasekaran, the film was screened in Malaysia on 1 May 2007 and was screened at the Goa International Film Festival in November that year. Sathyaraj reprised his role as Periyar in the film \"Kalavadiya Pozhudugal\" directed by Thangar Bachan which released in late 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "152196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152196", "title": "Phanes", "text": "Phanes\n\nPhanes (, genitive Φάνητος) or Protogonus (Greek: Πρωτογόνος, \"first-born\") was the mystic primeval deity of procreation and the generation of new life, who was introduced into Greek mythology by the Orphic tradition; other names for this Classical Greek Orphic concept included Ericapaeus ( \"power\") and Metis (\"thought\").\n\nIn these myths Phanes is often equated with Eros and Mithras and has been depicted as a deity emerging from a cosmic egg, entwined with a serpent. He had a helmet and had broad, golden wings. The Orphic cosmogony is bizarre, and quite unlike the creation sagas offered by Homer and Hesiod. Scholars have suggested that Orphism is \"un-Greek\" even \"Asiatic\" in conception, because of its inherent dualism.\n\nChronos (Time) created the silver egg of the universe; out of this egg burst the first-born, Phanes. Phanes was a uroboric male-female deity of light and goodness, whose name means \"to bring light\" or \"to shine\"; a first-born god of light who emerges from a void or a watery abyss and gives birth to the universe.\n\nMany threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. Phanes was believed to have been hatched from the World-Egg of Chronos (Time) and Ananke (Necessity or Fate) or Nyx in the black bird form and wind. His older wife Nyx (Night) called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the sceptre to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son Uranos before it passed to Cronus and then to Zeus, who retained it.\n\nAccording to Aristophanes, whence he is called Eros, he was born from an egg created by Nyx and placed in the boundless lap of Erebus, after which he mates with Chaos and creates the birds. This passage seeks to demonstrate that the birds are considered older than all other living creatures, even older than the other gods.\n\nThe \"Protogonos Theogony\" is known through the commentary in the Derveni papyrus and references in Empedocles and Pindar.\n\nAccording to Damascius, Phanes was the first god \"expressible and acceptable to human ears\" (πρώτης ητόν τι ἐχούσης καὶ σύμμετρον πρὸς ἀνθρώπων ἀκοάς).\n\nAnother orphic hymn states: \"You scattered the dark mist that lay before your eyes and, flapping your wings, you whirled about, and throughout this world you brought pure light. For this I call you Phanes.\" (\"ὄσσων ὃς σκοτόεσσαν ἀπημαύρωσας ὁμίχλην πάντη δινηθεὶς πτερύγων ῥιπαῖς κατὰ κόσμον λαμπρὸν ἄγων φάος ἁγνόν , ἀφ ' οὗ σε Φάνητα κικλήσκω.\")\n\nThe Derveni Papyrus refers to Phanes: \"Of the First-born king, the neverend one; and upon him all the immortals grew, blessed gods and goddesses and rivers and lovely springs and everything else that had then been born; and he himself became the sole one\". (\"Πρωτογόνου βασιλέως αἰδοίου∙ τῶι δ’ ἄρα πάντες ἀθάνατοι προσέφυν μάκαρες θεοὶ ἠδ̣ὲ θέαιναι καὶ ποταμοὶ καὶ κρῆναι ἐπήρατιο ἄλλα τε πάντα , ἅ̣σσα τότ’ ἦγγεγαῶτ ’ , αὐτὸς δ’ ἄρα μοῦνος ἔγεντο.”)\n\nDionysus of the Orphic tradition is intimately connected to Protogonos. In the Orphic Hymn 30, he is given a list of epithets that also allude to Protogonos: \"πρωτόγονον, διφυῆ, τρίγονον, Βακχεῖον ἄνακτα,ἄγριον, ἄρρητον, κρύφιον, δικέρωτα, δίμορφον\" – \"Primeval, two-natured, thrice-born, Bacchic lord, savage, ineffable, secretive, two-horned, and two-shaped\".\n\nIn the Orphic tradition, Dionysus-Protogonos-Phanes is a dying and rising god. Eusebius tells us the story of his death and recreation. The Titans boil the dismembered limbs of Dionysus in a kettle, they roast him on a spit and eat the roasted \"sacrificial meat\", then Athena rescues the still-beating heart from which (according to Olympiodorus) Zeus is able to recreate the god and bring him back to life. Kessler has argued that this cult of death and resurrection of Dionysus developed the 4th century CE; and together with Mithraism and other sects this cult formed, were in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late Antiquity.\n\n"}
{"id": "1823700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823700", "title": "Popé", "text": "Popé\n\nPopé or Po'pay (; c. 1630 – c. 1688) was a Tewa religious leader from Ohkay Owingeh (renamed San Juan Pueblo by the Spanish during the colonial period), who led the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 against Spanish colonial rule. In the first successful revolt against the Spanish, the Pueblo expelled the colonists and kept them out of the territory for twelve years.\n\nSpanish rule of the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico began in 1598. Although they numbered 40,000 to 80,000 people at that time, the many independent towns, often speaking different languages and hostile to each other, were unable to unite in opposition to the Spanish. Revolts against Spanish rule were frequent, but the Spanish ruthlessly repressed dissent. The Pueblo suffered abuses from Spanish overlords, soldiers, priests, and their Mexican Indian allies, many from Tlaxcala, Mexico. In particular, the Spanish suppressed the religious ceremonies of the Pueblo. The effects of violence, forced labor, and European diseases (against which they had no immunity) reduced the Pueblo population to about 15,000 by the latter years of the 17th century.\n\nPo'pay appears in history in 1675 as one of 47 religious leaders of the northern Pueblo arrested by the Juan Francisco Trevino's government for \"witchcraft.\" Three were executed and one committed suicide. The others were whipped, imprisoned in Santa Fe, and sentenced to be sold into slavery. Seventy Pueblo warriors showed up at the governor's office and demanded, politely but persistently, that Po'pay and the others be released. The governor complied, probably in part because the colony was being seriously targeted by Apaches and Navajo warring parties and he could not afford to risk a Pueblo revolt. Po'pay was described as a \"fierce and dynamic individual…who inspired respect bordering on fear in those who dealt with him.\n\nAfter his release, Po'pay retired to the remote Taos Pueblo and began planning a rebellion. Po'pay's message was simple: destroy the Spanish and their influence and go back to the old ways of life that had given the Pueblos relative peace, prosperity, and independence. The Pueblo revolt displayed \"all the classic characteristics of a revitalization movement...the emergence of a charismatic leader, the development of a core group of followers who spread the prophet's message to the wider public; and, ultimately the successful transformation of Pueblo cultures and communities.\"\n\nPo'pay began secret negotiations with leaders from all other pueblos. They agreed to begin the revolt on August 13, 1680 and runners were sent out to each Pueblo with knotted cords, the number of knots corresponding to the days left before the revolt was to begin. The revolt actually began before that. The measure of the Pueblo's hatred of the Spanish is indicated by the fact that he was able to keep the plans secret, even though they involved many different leaders and towns. Po'pay murdered his own son-in-law, Nicolás Búa, because he feared he might betray the plot to the Spanish. Only the Tiguex area, close to the seat of Spanish power in Santa Fe and perhaps the most acculturated of the Pueblos, declined to join in the revolt. The Southern Piros were apparently not invited to join the revolt.\n\nThe last few years had been relatively quiet and free from internal dissent, and the Spanish in the capital city of Santa Fe were astonished as a report came to the governor early in the morning of August 10 that a Spanish priest had been killed at a Pueblo only nine miles from Santa Fe. By August 15, 1,000 Spaniards had taken refuge in the Governor's palace in Santa Fe, and they were besieged by an Indian army led by Pope they estimated (or overestimated) to number 2,500. Other Spanish survivors had taken refuge in the friendly Pueblo of Isleta, from where they fled south toward Mexico.\n\nOn August 21 the Spanish broke out of the Palace and began a long trek south, leaving New Mexico behind and not stopping until they reached El Paso, Texas. The Pueblos did not molest the departing colonists. The survivors numbered nearly 2,000 persons. The revolt cost 400 Spanish lives, including 21 of the 33 priests in New Mexico.\n\nPo'pay had succeeded in expelling the Spanish from New Mexico and according to later accounts, possibly prejudiced, set himself up as the sole ruler of all the Pueblos. He attempted to destroy every trace of the Spanish presence in New Mexico. \"The God of the Christians is dead,\" he proclaimed. \"He was made of rotten wood.\"\n\nA Spanish force of 300 men attempted to regain a foothold in New Mexico in 1681, but was repelled by Po'pay's army. Another Spanish effort in 1687 also failed. But the expulsion of the Spanish had not brought peace and prosperity to the Pueblos. A return to the traditional religion did not bring rain to ease a drought that destroyed crops. The Apaches and Navajo stepped up their raids on the Pueblos and the Indians recalled that the Spaniards had provided some protection from the raiders. Traditional rivalries divided the Pueblo villages. Po'pay's efforts to rule over all the Pueblos were resented and he was considered a tyrant by many Pueblos. Moreover, among the Pueblos were sincere Christians with ties of family and friendship with the Spanish. Opposition to Spanish rule had given the Pueblos the incentive to unite, but not the means to remain united once their common enemy was vanquished.\n\nPo'pay died, probably in 1688, with the united Pueblo state he envisioned divided and weak. In 1692, Governor Diego de Vargas, with an army of 150 Spanish soldiers and pro-Spanish Pueblo warriors, attempted reconquest. Vargas wisely promised pardon rather than punishment and most of the Pueblos gradually acceded to Spanish rule although violent opposition to Spanish rule continued for several years. Only the distant Hopi, living in what is today Arizona, retained their independence although many Pueblos also took up residence among the Navajo and Apaches.\n\nAs stated by Matthew Martinez of Po'pay's home Pueblo, Ohkay Owingeh, \"it took a unique individual to orchestrate the revolt across two dozen communities who spoke six different languages and were sprawled over a distance of nearly 400 miles.\" What little we know of Po'pay the man is distorted through the lenses of the Spanish chroniclers and their Indian informants, most of whom were opposed to Po'Pay.\n\nBoth the Spanish and the Pueblos were decimated by the revolt and its aftermath. However, what can be said with certainty is that the relations between Spanish and the Pueblos was far different after the revolt than before. The dreaded encomienda system (forced labor) was prohibited in New Mexico. Franciscan priests did not interfere with Pueblo religious ceremonies provided that the Pueblos observed the outward forms of Catholicism. Pueblo warrior and Spanish soldier became allies in the fight against their common enemies, the Apaches, Navajo, Utes, and a new and even greater threat to the survival of New Mexico, the Comanche. Thus, New Mexico became a blend of Spanish and Pueblo culture.\n\nOn September 22, 2005, the Po'pay statue for the National Statuary Hall in the rotunda of the U.S. Congress building was unveiled. The artist, Cliff Fragua, was the first American Indian artist to have a statue placed in the Statuary Hall. The statue, slightly larger than life size, shows Po'Pay holding a knotted cord in his left hand, the signal for the initiation of the revolt. In his right hand is a bear fetish and behind him a pot, both symbolizing the Pueblo world and religion. On his back are the scars from the whipping he received as a consequence of his observing Pueblo religious ceremonies. Herman Agoyo of Ohkay Owingeh said: \"To the Pueblo people here, Po'pay is our hero. Tribes were on the verge of losing their cultural identity when the Pueblo revolt brought everything back on track for our people.\" It is one of two statues presented by New Mexico to the National Statuary Hall Collection. It is currently displayed in the Capitol Visitors' Center.\n\nPo'pay is mentioned by the controversial Taos priest Father Martinez in Willa Cather's \" Death Comes for the Archbishop,\" as leader of the Indian revolt which \"so added to Spanish martyrology.\"\n"}

Khema then gave it to King Brahmadatte for veneration. It became a royal possession in Brahmadatte's country and was kept in the city of Dantapuri (modern Puri, Odisha).\n\nA belief grew that whoever possessed the tooth relic had a divine right to rule that land. The \"Dāṭhāvaṃsa\" recounts the tale of a war fought over the relic 800 years later between Guhasiva of the republic of Kalinga and a king named Pandu.\n\nLegend states the Abhayagiri vihāra was first appointed custodianship of the relic when it was brought to the island after the conflict in Kalinga. As time went on, the land was threatened with foreign invasions; at one time, the king of Bago, Burma offered the Portuguese £50,000 as a ransom of the tooth; and the seat of the kingdom was moved from Anuradhapura to Polonnaruwa, then to Dambadeniya and other cities. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was built to enshrine the relic. Finally, it was brought to Kandy where it is at present, in the Temple of the Tooth.\n\nThe relic came to be regarded as a symbolic representation of the living Buddha and it is on this basis that there grew up a series of offerings, rituals, and ceremonies. These are conducted under the supervision of the two Mahanayakas of Malwatte, Asgiriya chapters, and Diyawadana Nilame of the Maligawa. These have a hierarchy of officials and temple functionaries to perform the services and rituals.\n\nAside from the relic in Sri Lanka, several relics in other countries are also reputed to be a tooth-relic of the Buddha.\n"}
{"id": "99774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99774", "title": "Rishi", "text": "Rishi\n\nRishi (Sanskrit: ऋषि IAST: ṛṣi) is a Vedic term for an inspired poet of hymns from the Vedas. Post-Vedic tradition of Hinduism regards the rishis as \"seers\", \"great sadhus\" or \"sages\" who after intense meditation (tapas) realized the supreme truth and eternal knowledge, which they composed into hymns.\n\nThe word \"Rishi\" (Yogi, Phra Ruesi, , ) may be derived from two different meanings of the root 'rsh'. Sanskrit grammarians derive this word from the second meaning: \"to go, to move\". V. S. Apte gives this particular meaning and derivation, and Monier-Williams also gives the same, with some qualification.\n\nAnother form of this root means \"to flow, to move near by flowing\". (All the meanings and derivations cited above are based upon \"Sanskrit English Dictionary\" of Monier-Williams). Monier-Williams also quotes Tārānātha who compiled the great (Sanskrit-to-Sanskrit) dictionary named \"ṛṣati jñānena saṃsāra-pāram\" (i.e., \"one who reaches beyond this mundane world by means of spiritual knowledge\").\n\nMore than a century ago, Monier-Williams tentatively suggested a derivation from \"\" \"to see\". Monier-Williams also quotes the Hibernian (Irish) form \"arsan\" (a sage, a man old in wisdom) and \"arrach\" (old, ancient, aged) as related to \"rishi\". Monier-Williams also conjectures that the root \"drish\" (to see) might have given rise to an obsolete root \"rish\" meaning \"to see\".\n\nHowever, the root has a close Avestan cognate \"ərəšiš\" \"an ecstatic\" (see also Yurodivy, Vates). Yet the Indo-European dictionary of Julius Pokorny connects the word to a PIE root \"\" meaning \"rise, protrude\", in the sense of \"excellent\" and thus cognate with Ṛta and right and Asha. In Sanskrit, forms of the root \"rish\" become \"arsh-\" in many words, (e.g., \"arsh\")\n\nModern etymological explanations such as by Manfred Mayrhofer in his \"Etymological Dictionary\" leave the case open, and do not prefer a connection to ' \"pour, flow\" (PIE '), rather one with German \"rasen\" \"to be ecstatic, be in a different state of mind\" (and perhaps Lithuanian \"aršus\").\n\nSome of the earliest lists of \"Rishi\" are found in Jaiminiya Brahmana verse 2.218 and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad verse 2.2.6.\n\nIn the Vedas, the word denotes an inspired poet of Vedic hymns. In particular, Ṛṣi refers to the authors of the hymns of the Rigveda. \n\nPost-Vedic tradition regards the Rishis as \"sages\" or saints, constituting a peculiar class of divine human beings in the early mythical system, as distinct from Asuras, Devas and mortal men. Swami Vivekananda described \"Rishi\"s as \"Mantra-drashtas\" or \"the seers of thought\". He told— \"The truth came to the Rishis of India — the Mantra-drashtâs, the seers of thought — and will come to all Rishis in the future, not to talkers, not to book-swallowers, not to scholars, not to philologists, but to seers of thought.\"\n\nThe notable female rishikas who contributed to the composition of the Vedic scriptures are:\nThe Rig Veda mentions Romasha, Lopamudra, Apala, Kadru, Visvavara, Ghosha, Juhu, Vagambhrini, Paulomi, Yami, Indrani, Savitri, and Devayani.\nThe Sama Veda adds Nodha, Akrishtabhasha, Sikatanivavari and Gaupayana.\n\nIn Mahabharata 12, on the other hand, there is the post-Vedic list of Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya and Vashista. The Mahābhārata list explicitly refers to the saptarshis of the first manvantara and not to those of the present manvantara. Each manvantara had a unique set of saptarshi. In Harivamsha 417ff, the names of the Rishis of each manvantara are enumerated.\n\nIn addition to the Sapta, there are other classifications of sages. In descending order of precedence, they are Brahmarshi, Maharshi, Rajarshi. Deva, Param, Shruta and Kānda are added in Manusmriti iv-94 and xi-236 and in two dramas of Kālidasa.\n\nThe Chaturvarga-Chintāmani of Hemādri puts \" at the seventh place in the eightfold division of Brāhmanas. Amarakosha (the famous Sanskrit synonym lexicon compiled by Amarasimha) mentions seven types of s : Shrutarshi, Kāndarshi, Paramarshi, Maharshi, Rājarshi, Brahmarshi and Devarshi. Amarakosha strictly distinguishes Rishi from other types of sages, such as sanyāsi, , parivrājaka, tapasvi, muni, brahmachāri, yati, etc.\n\nMost medieval era Hindu temples of Java, Indonesia show Rishi Agastya statues or reliefs, usually guarding the southern side of Shaivite temples. Some examples include Candi Sambisari and the Prambanan temple near Yogyakarta. Rishi Agastya is known as Phra Reusi Akkhot in Thailand.\n\nRuesi (sanskrit: \"ṛṣi\"}}, , , ) is a hermit sage, the equivalent of Rishi in India.In Myanmar, there are some known as ရေသ့ Rase. \n\nRishi is also a male given name, and less commonly a Brahmin last name. \n\nIn Carnatic music, \"Rishi\" is the seventh \"chakra\" (group) of Melakarta ragas. The names of \"chakras\" are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are seven rishis and hence the 7th \"chakra\" is \"Rishi\".\n\nThe descendant families of these Rishis, refer to their ancestral lineage through their family \"gotra\". This is a common practice among the Brahmin sects of the current Hindu society.\n\nThe name \"Rishi\" (pronounced \"ruesi\") is also the basis of one of the letters of the Thai alphabet, \"so reu-si\" ().\n\n\n"}

The temple was built in Sogamoso, Colombia, then part of the Muisca Confederation and called Sugamuxi. It was the most important temple in the religion of the Muisca. The temple was destroyed by fire brought by the Spanish conquistadores led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada who was eager to find the legendary \"El Dorado\". A reconstruction has been built in the Archeology Museum of Sogamoso.\n\nThe Temple of the Sun was built on the right banks of the small river Monquirá. The temple was a large round structure made of poles and clay with a roof made of reed. The temple did not have any windows. The columns surrounding the temple were built in three concentric rings made of wood harvested in Casanare. The temple represented the cosmos and was built to honour Sun god Sué. The temple also was a burial ground for the most important \"caciques\" and priests (Chibcha: \"ogques\").\n\nThe Muisca had a decent knowledge of astronomy and constructed various sites across their territories. \"El Infiernito\", just outside Villa de Leyva has survived. The Sun Temple was constructed according to the positions of the Sun.\n\nAt the temple rituals were organised by the \"caciques\" and \"zaques\" of the Muisca Confederation. The mythological Idacansás held gatherings where children (\"moxas\") were sacrificed. He made the city of Sugamuxi a sacred place. Mythical Thomagata was believed to travel each night between Tunja and the temple, a march he repeated ten times per night.\n\nSpanish conquistador Jiménez de Quesada heard of the Sun Temple and entered Sogamoso in early September 1537. He arrived in the afternoon and decided to wait till next morning to take the \"cacique\" of Sugamuxi out of the temple.\n\nCurious to see the treasures in the temple, two of his soldiers, Miguel Sánchez and Juan Rodríguez Parra went to the sacred place on the night of September 4th, lighting their way with torches. When they entered the temple they found rich ornaments and mummies of ancient nobles. While they were collecting parts of the treasures of the temple they accidentally set fire to it with their torches destroying the temple.\n\nIn 1942 archeologist Eliécer Silva Celis uncovered a Muisca cemetery in Sogamoso. The cemetery contained tombs of indigenous Muisca with mummies still preserved. Based on his archeological findings he was able to locate the original site of the temple and decided to reconstruct it.\n\nThe replica of the temple is high. The symbols in the dome tell the story of the creation of the Earth by Chiminigagua, the Supreme Being of the Muisca. The small openings on the sides serve as a calendar; every year on December 22nd the sunlight falls right on the central pillar. Around the temple the cemetery with mummies, that were originally displayed inside the temple, is reconstructed. Today the temple is part of the Archeology Museum of Sogamoso, governed by the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia based in Tunja.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is 200 minutes long and split into four parts, with each part explaining the lives of four Egyptian pharaohs.\n\nThe film uses interviews of historians, re-creations through CGI, location footage, and archaeological and scientific evidence to tell the story of these Egyptian monarchs. It has been made available for instructional use by A&E, and is now being used in anthropology and archaeology courses at colleges and universities, such as the University of Vermont, San Francisco State University, Oriental Institute of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and University of California, Berkeley, as well as smaller colleges such as Blue Ridge Community College. It is available in public libraries across the United States, and in archives such as La Bibliographie nationale française.\n\nThe documentary series \"The Greatest Pharaohs\" chronicles the lives of the men and women who built and maintained the Egyptian dynasties and the resources and power of ancient Egypt. Footage is included of the recently opened pyramid complex of the Pharaoh Sneferu and the rarely seen ancient burial ground of Abydos. \nFollows the birth of Egyptian civilization and the origins of the pharaohs and their legacy of the pyramids. It begins with the story of how the first pharaoh, the warrior Narmer, united Upper and Lower Egypt and began the first dynasty. Covers Narmer, Hor-Aha, Sneferu, and Khafra. \nBy 2180 BCE, almost 1,000 years after the first pharaoh, the Egyptians had made advances in science, art, and technology and had built what was arguably the most advanced culture at that time in civilized history. However, the Old Kingdom started to decay when a child became Pharaoh. There were centuries of chaos before Egypt was reborn under a series of militarily inclined pharaohs who established the New Kingdom. Covers Menkaura, Pepi II, Mentuhotep II, and Ahmose I. \nBy 1353 BCE, Egypt was again stable, with much of the prosperity of the Old Kingdom. However, the ascension of Akhenaten brought a new crisis. Akhenaten was branded a heretic by history because of his attempts to transform Egypt's religion, but he was also considered remarkable by the way he shared power with Nefertiti. Covers Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten), Tutankhamun, Ay, and Seti I.\nConsidered by historians to be the greatest era of the New Kingdom began in 1279 BCE, when Ramses II assumed the throne. Ramses II is remembered by history as Ramses the Great. \"The Great Pharaohs of Egypt\" series concludes with an in-depth look at his 67-year reign. He led foreign conquests and embarked on what is considered the most ambitious building program since the Great Pyramids, restoring old monuments and erecting countless new ones. The program concludes with the life and death of Cleopatra as the last pharaoh. Covers Ramses II, Ramses III, and Cleopatra VII.\n\nIt was released by A&E Home Video and distributed in the U.S. by New Video Group (1997).\n\n\n\n"}
