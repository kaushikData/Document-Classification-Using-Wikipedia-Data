Oertel (1862-1942) in Sarnath, India. The statue has been decisive in matching the reign of Kanishka with contemporary sculptural style, especially the type of similar sculptures from Mathura, as its bears a dated inscription.\n\nThe inscription on the Bodhisattva explains that it was dedicated by a \"Brother\" (\"Bhikshu\") named Bala, in the \"Year 3 of Kanishka\". This allows to be a rather precise date on the sculptural style represented by the statue, as year 3 is thought to be approximately 123 CE.\n\nThe inscription further states that Kanishka (who ruled from his capital in Mathura) had several satraps under his commands in order to rule his vast territory: the names of the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps Mahakshatrapa (\"Great Satrap\") Kharapallana and the Kshatrapa (\"Satrap\") Vanaspara are mentioned as satraps for the eastern territories of Kanishka's empire. At the same time a \"General Lala\" and Satraps Vespasi and Liaka are mentioned as in charge of the north.\nThere are altogether three inscriptions, the largest one being the inscription on the octagonal shaft of the umbrella. The octagonal shaft and its umbrella are visible in \"Avatāraṇa: a Note on the Bodhisattva Image Dated in the Third Year of Kaniṣka in the Sārnāth Museum\" by\nGiovanni Verardi.\n\nOriginal text:<br>\n1. maharafszcjjasya k[a]niskasya sam 3 he 3 di 20-2<br> \n2. etaye purvaye bhiksusya pusyavuddhisya saddhyevi-<br> \n3. harisya bhiksusya balasya tr[e]pi[ta]kasya<br> \n4. bodhisatvo chatrayasti ca pratisthapit[o]<br> \n5. baranasiye bhagavato ca[m]k[r?]ame saha mata-<br> \n6. pitihi saha upaddhyayaca[rye]hi saddhyevihari-<br> \n7. hi amtevasikehi ca saha buddhamitraye trepitika-<br> \n8. ye saha ksatra[pe]na vanasparena kharapall[a]-<br> \n9. nena ca saha ca[tu]hi parisahi sarvasatvanarn<br> \n10. hita[szc]sukharttham \n<br><br>\nTranslation:<br>\n1.

{"id": "961695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=961695", "title": "Christian Democratic Party (Australia)", "text": "Christian Democratic Party (Australia)\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party (CDP) is a socially conservative political party in Australia. It was founded by a group of concerned Christian ministers in the State of NSW, who had Fred Nile, a Congregational Church minister, run as their Upper House Candidate in the NSW State election. Fred Nile, commonly refers to himself as the party's founder, however the Party states that it was founded by concerned Australian ministers.\n\nThe party was established in 1977 under the name Call to Australia, which it used until 1998. It is primarily active in New South Wales, and since the 1981 state election has had at least one member in the New South Wales Legislative Council, often holding or sharing the balance of power. The Christian Democrats have never elected anyone to federal parliament, although John Bradford briefly sat with the party in the House of Representatives after defecting from the Liberal Party prior to the 1998 election.\n\nThe Rev Hon Fred Nile, is the Federal President of the Christian Democratic Party (The Federal party currently lacks a constitution and a Board) and he is the NSW Deputy President. Ross Clifford is NSW State President of the Christian Democratic Party. Craig Hall, is the NSW State Director; the organizational leader of the Party and by extension exercises authority over the Party activities in all states. The youth wing of the CDP \"Christian Youth\" is headed by Samraat Joshua Grewal as it's President.\n\nOriginally established as the \"Call to Australia Party\" in 1977, the Party was founded by a group of concerned Christian Ministers who had Fred Nile run as their candidate. The Party name change to \"Christian Democratic Party\" was a suggestion from an executive of Hillsong Church. These groups had sought to mobilise conservative and evangelical Protestants as an electoral force. Nile was elected to the Legislative Council in 1981, and the party has managed to see a candidate elected at every subsequent New South Wales state election to date.\n\nThe Christian Democrats exists to support Christian representation in every level of government – Federal, State and Local - and to promote \"ethical values based on...Christian values\".\n\nThe party are supportive of family values (including traditional marriage), freedom of speech, protective of children and their rights including those of unborn children, and policies that are protective of established Australian values and systems, inclusive of a requirement that immigrants to Australia demonstrate a desire to learn English. They are opposed to both abortion and euthanasia as well as pornography, drug decriminalisation and sharia law.\n\nThe CDP supports rehabilitation of criminals when possible. They seek \"a wisely governed penal system that seeks to restore convicted persons where possible to good contributors to society.\"\n\nCDP's policy on the economy is to ensure \"\"a healthy environment for business to start and grow\". They support an adequately \"remunerated job\" to allow for \"a balance between work and non-work times\" and have an emphasis on \"the financial well-being of each person in [the] community\".\n\nIn 2015 Nile supported the Liberal government's privatisation of electricity infrastructure, such as poles and wires.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party believe that parental input in a child's education plus writing, reading and arithmetic are the basis of a good education system. They also support Special Religious Education (SRE).\n\nCDP believes that Health Care \"should be available, accessible and affordable\".\n\nAccording to their 2018 policies, the CDP supports a balanced approach to both environment and social security. They seek a \"good and sustainable use of the earth\" and social security for \"those who genuinely need it\".\n\nThe CDP is for local industry and local jobs and \"proactively [work] to advocate for jobs growth\".\n\nTheir policy on immigration reads:\n\n\"Each nation needs to manage its immigration so that there is a balance of visitors and immigrants that will contribute positively to the nation. In the last several years we have seen a rise in immigration that has outpaced infrastructure and potentially affecting housing affordability, health affordability, and employment declines, and a strain on the social security system resulting in community disquiet towards some new immigrants. This has the potential to change the character of the Australian society. Immigration needs to be carefully managed, taken on the advice of demographic experts and not growth economics.\"\n\nThe Christian Democrats also support strong infrastructure programs for roads, bridges, hospitals, airports, waterways and power supplies. They state that these should be \"steady and affordable\" and planned for \"future generations\", not simply as short-term goals.\n\nThe party and a candidate, Peter Madden, came under intense opposition from their policies and political campaign actions by the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Their campaign to have the Sydney Mardi Gras banned because of, as he puts it, \"the lifestyle and perversion that it promotes\" saw opposition from the RSL as one of their campaign YouTube videos, which featured Madden, labelled a \"battle cry\", calls upon \"10,000 warriors\" to rally against the event and shows Madden in front of the Anzac War Memorial in Hyde Park inviting viewers to become \"lions\" and join him. The NSW RSL president, Don Rowe, said that returned servicemen and women and the public as a whole find it \"totally offensive\" that anyone would use the image of the War Memorial to make a political statement. Don Rowe said to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"I am neither a supporter nor a detractor of the Mardi Gras and the RSL has no official position on it, but we totally disapprove of the use of the War Memorial in a politicised way. It is a sacred site and symbolises those Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and for our freedoms … not for someone trying to make a political stand.\"\n\nPeter Madden was also criticized by the LGBT community when he called for the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras to be \"moved off the streets\".’ and stated in an interview with Glenn Wheeler and Anthony Venn-Brown on the Sydney radio station 2GB that one of the main objectives of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras was \"recruitment\".\n\nThe CDP has built a small but stable electoral base among conservative Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Protestants in New South Wales, particularly in the \"Bible Belt\" suburbs of north-western Sydney and in some country areas, but the CDP has only achieved modest results in its attempts to expand its electoral base further. The party has comparable support in Western Australia (which broke away to form the Australian Christians party) but has lacked similar representation in its state parliament because its seats have higher election quotas.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party sees the policies of the major parties as an attack on their traditional views. Gordon Moyes (no longer a member of the party) explained, \"Our Christian heritage is under attack from pagan and secularist forces, militant Islamic groups, a neo communism under a Green guise and a strident homosexual lobby that has successfully gained the support of the Labor Party, Australian Democrats and the Greens, and many from the left of the Liberal Party.\"\n\nFor the 1983 federal election, the CDP formed an alliance with the Victoria-based Democratic Labor Party. They did not win any seats and contested subsequent elections separately.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party has generally had two (sometimes three) sitting Members in the Legislative Council (MLCs) at any one time. Usually, these two individuals have been Fred Nile and one other member. The 1984 NSW election saw Nile joined by former Liberal politician Jim Cameron. Cameron retired shortly after being elected, due to serious health problems, and was replaced by Marie Bignold. Nile’s wife, Elaine Nile, joined her husband and Bignold after achieving election to the Legislative Council at the 1988 NSW election. Bignold subsequently had a falling out with Fred and Elaine Nile over Bignold's opposition to the Liberal Party stance on industrial relations; a policy position supported by the Niles. The restructuring of the Legislative Council in 1991 meant that Bignold’s seat was abolished and she was forced to an early election; but she failed in her bid for re-election.\n\nThe party has been involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance.\n\nIn August 2000, it was announced that Elaine Nile would retire due to ill health and be replaced with John Bradford, a former Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from Queensland who had defected to the CDP before being defeated at the 1998 Federal election. However, this fell through due to disagreements between the Fred and Elaine Nile and Bradford. Elaine Nile served until 2002, at which time she was replaced by Gordon Moyes of Sydney’s Wesley Central Mission. Moyes was elected in his own right at the 2003 NSW election.\n\nIn 2004, Moyes suggested Nile make a bid for a Senate seat at the 2004 federal election. In that election, Nile achieved 2.6% of the primary vote, but narrowly missed attaining a seat. Another rival conservative party, Family First, won a seat in Victoria with 1.9% and a better preference deal. With Nile's return to the NSW Legislative Council, Moyes began to question the leadership of his former party leader.\n\nDuring the New South Wales legislative election, 2007 the CDP called for a moratorium on Muslim immigration to Australia, seeking to replace them with \"persecuted Christians from the Middle East.\" Nile said the moratorium should be in place to allow a study of the effects of Muslim migration. \"There has been no serious study of the potential effects upon Australia of more than 300,000 Muslims who are already here,\" he said. \"Australians deserve a breathing space so the situation can be carefully assessed before Islamic immigration can be allowed to resume. In the meantime, Australia should extend a welcoming hand to many thousands of persecuted Christians who are presently displaced or at risk in the Middle East.\" Nile and another CDP candidate Allan Lotfizadeh reported receiving death threats on account of this announcement.\n\nFred Nile was re-elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 24 March 2007, achieving a vote of 4.4%. This was the highest vote for the CDP since 1988.\n\nIn 2007, the President of the Legislative Council, Meredith Anne Burgmann retired from public service and the Council sought a replacement. Tensions flared when both Moyes and Nile applied for the position. Nile subsequently withdrew his application and nominated Moyes at Moyes' behest. Peter Primrose was confirmed President on 8 March 2007, Moyes having received only two votes, Nile's and his own. After Nile was made Assistant Deputy President on 28 June 2007 and then Assistant President 28 November 2007, Moyes began to publicly attack Nile.\n\nMoyes argued that Nile's anti-homosexual, anti-abortion and anti-Muslim focus should be altered and that greater emphasis be placed on environmental issues. In contrast to Nile, Moyes inferred that the burden of responsibility for Islamic terrorism lay at the feet of western civilisation, the \"Crusades\" and the \"excesses of the 'war on terrors'.\n\nMoyes (then aged 70 years) claimed Nile (then aged 75 years) was too old and was too \"committed to gaining money and status, and [...attacked...] any who disagree[d] with himself\". According to Moyes, Nile was a pathetic figure who has never laughed, has no friends, is a workaholic, has no interests or hobbies, eats fast-food meals and when in Sydney attending Parliament, spends every night alone in a cheap motel in western Sydney.\n\nIn February 2009, Nile wrote in his monthly newsletter that he regretted allowing Moyes to take his wife's place upon her retirement \"because of his disloyalty and divisive actions and his frequent support of the Greens\". Moyes stated that the Greens were \"far more Christian\".\n\nMoyes also attacked the Christian Democratic Party itself, stating that the party was a cult, a hypocritical, anti-Christian, anti-democratic dictatorship that adhered to the values of extremist fundamentalism. Moyes claimed that the \"end was nigh\" for the party as there was a conspiracy to disband the party and form a new conservative Christian political party. Moyes attempted to draw Nile's Parliamentary staff into the conflict by making claims that they had intimidated and bullied his own.\n\nMoyes ignored repeated warnings from the CDP management committee, claiming that they were dysfunctional. a committee of the \"sad, mad, senile and aggressively ambitious.\" As a result, Moyes was expelled from the Christian Democratic Party in March 2009 by secret ballot of its members. Moyes became an independent for several months before joining the Family First Party in 2009.\n\nMoyes failed in his attempt to be re-elected at the 2011 state election.\n\nPaul Green was elected to the NSW Legislative Council at the 2011 state election. Aged 45 years at the time of this election.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kuwait's Christians can be divided into 2 groups. The first group are Christians who are native Kuwaitis numbering approximately between 200 and 400 people. The second group, who make up the majority of Christians in Kuwait, are expatriates from various countries around the world. \nThere are also a number of believers in Christ from a Muslim background in the country, though many are not citizens. A 2015 study estimates some 350 such Christians in the country that are ex Muslim.\n\nKuwait's native Christian population is diverse. There are between 259 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens. In 2014, there were 259 Christian Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait.\n\nChristian Kuwaitis can be divided into 2 groups. The first group includes the earliest Kuwaiti Christians, who originated from Iraq and Turkey. They have assimilated into Kuwaiti society, like their Muslim counterparts, and tend to speak Arabic with a Kuwaiti dialect; their food and culture are also predominantly Kuwaiti. The make up very less than roughly a quarter of Kuwait's Christian population. The rest (roughly three-quarters) of Christian Kuwaitis make up the second group. They are more recent arrivals in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Kuwaitis of Palestinian ancestry who were forced out of Palestine after 1948. There are also smaller numbers who originally hail from Syria and Lebanon. This second group is not as assimilated as the first group, as their food, culture, and Arabic dialect still retain a Levant feel. However, they are just as patriotic as the former group, and tend to be proud of their adopted homeland, with many serving in the army, police, civil, and foreign service. Most of Kuwait's citizen Christians belong to 12 large families, with the Shammas (from Turkey) and the Shuhaibar (from Palestine) families being some of the more prominent ones.\n\nAlthough there is a small community of Christian citizens, a law passed in 1981 prevents the naturalization of non-Muslims. However, male citizens who were Christians before 1980 (and male children born to families of such citizens since that date), can transmit their citizenship to their children; however, they cannot transmit their citizenship to their spouses.\n\nKuwait is the only GCC country besides Bahrain to have a local Christian population who hold citizenship.\n\nTraditionally, Eastern Orthodox Christians in Kuwait belong to the jurisdiction of Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. Eastern Orthodox parish in Kuwait was reorganized in 1969 by late metropolitan Constantine Papastephanou of Baghdad and Kuwait (1969-2014), who visited Kuwait on many occasions. His successor is Metropolitan Ghattas Hazim of Baghdad and Kuwait (since 2014). His official seat remains in Baghdad, but administrative headquarters of the Archdiocese are located in Kuwait. Today, Eastern Orthodox parishes in Kuwait are administered by priests Ephrem Toumi and Filimon Saifi.\n\n\nThe denominations of both citizen and foreign Christians in Kuwait include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nThe constitution allows for religious freedom. Many churches exist in Kuwait. Kuwait's largest cathedral is situated in the eastern part of Kuwait city.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2918830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2918830", "title": "Doomsday cult", "text": "Doomsday cult\n\nDoomsday cult is an expression used to describe cults who believe in apocalypticism and millenarianism, and can refer both to groups that predict disaster, and to those that attempt to bring it about. The expression was first used by sociologist John Lofland in his 1966 study of a group of members of the Unification Church of the United States in California, \"\". A classic study of a group with cataclysmic predictions had previously been performed by Leon Festinger and other researchers, and was published in his book \"When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World\".\n\nReferring to his study, Festinger and later other researchers have attempted to explain the commitment of members to their associated doomsday cult, even after the prophecies of their leader have turned out to be false. Festinger explained this phenomenon as part of a coping mechanism called dissonance reduction, a form of rationalization. Members often dedicate themselves with renewed vigor to the group's cause after a failed prophecy, and rationalize with explanations such as a belief that their actions forestalled the disaster, or a belief in the leader when the date for disaster is postponed.\n\nSome researchers believe that the use of the term by the government and the news media can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which actions by authorities reinforces the apocalyptic beliefs of the group, which in turn can inspire further controversial actions. Group leaders have themselves objected to comparisons between one group and another, and parallels have been drawn between the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy and the theory of a deviancy amplification spiral.\n\nThe term \"doomsday cult\" was first used in the title of a 1966 scholarly study of a group of Unification Church members by John Lofland, entitled: \"\". Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: \"The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes,\" and in 1966 in book form by Prentice-Hall. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement. James Richardson writes in the \"Encyclopedia of Religion and Society\" that after the publication of Lofland's work, \"The term \"doomsday cult\" has become a part of everyday parlance, used by the media to refer to apocalyptic religious groups.\"\n\nA psychological study by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter found that people turned to a cataclysmic world view after they had repeatedly failed to find meaning in mainstream movements. Leon Festinger and his colleagues had observed members of the group for several months, and recorded their conversations both prior to and after a failed prophecy from their charismatic leader. The group had organized around a belief system which foretold that a majority of the Western Hemisphere would be destroyed by a cataclysmic flood on December 21, 1955. Their work was later published in the book \"When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World\".\n\nSocial scientists have found that while some group members will leave after the date for a doomsday prediction by the leader has passed uneventfully, others actually feel their belief and commitment to the group strengthened. Often when a group's doomsday prophecies or predictions fail to come true, the group leader will simply set a new date for impending doom, or predict a different type of catastrophe on a different date. Niederhoffer and Kenner say: \"When you have gone far out on a limb and so many people have followed you, and there is much \"sunk cost,\" as economists would say, it is difficult to admit you have been wrong.\"\n\nIn \"Experiments With People: Revelations from Social Psychology\", Abelson, Frey and Gregg explain this further: \"...continuing to proselytize on behalf of a doomsday cult whose prophecies have been disconfirmed, although it makes little logical sense, makes plenty of psychological sense if people have already spent months proselytizing on the cult's behalf. Persevering allows them to avoid the embarrassment of how wrong they were in the first place.\" The common-held belief in a catastrophic event occurring on a future date can have the effect of ingraining followers with a sense of uniqueness and purpose. In addition, after a failed prophecy members may attempt to explain the outcome through rationalization and dissonance reduction.\n\nExplanations may include stating that the group members had misinterpreted the leader's original plan, that the cataclysmic event itself had been postponed to a later date by the leader, or that the activities of the group itself had forestalled disaster. In the case of the Festinger study, when the prophecy of a cataclysmic flood was proved false, the members pronounced that their faith in God had prevented the event. They then proceeded to attempt to convert new members with renewed strength.\n\nIn his book \"Politeia: Visions of the Just Society\", Eric Carlton debates whether or not the term is appropriate to describe these types of groups. Carlton writes that the event is only seen as a \"doomsday\" for the \"wicked and unrepentant,\" whereas members of the group itself often regard it as a \"day of deliverance,\" or a \"renewal of the world.\" He regards these groups as \"the ultimate in exclusivity,\" and while the future will be bleak for nonbelievers due to an unforeseen cataclysm, members of the group are promised existence in a new utopia.\n\nIn \"Globalisation and the Future of Terrorism\", Brynjar Lia notes that \"Doomsday cults are nothing new,\" but also states that they are \"relatively few.\" In \"Mystics and Messiahs\", Jenkins writes that as a result of events between 1993 and 1997 including the Waco Siege involving the Branch Davidians, violence involving the Order of the Solar Temple, Aum Shinrikyo's sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, and the Heaven's Gate incident, \"Reporting on so-called doomsday cults became a mainstay of the media, just as satanic cults had been a decade before.\" Jenkins regards the Order of the Solar Temple as more of an example of organized crime than a doomsday cult.\n\nIn \"Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld\", the authors also make a comparison to organized crime, writing that Aum Shinrikyo \"...often resembled a profit-hungry racketeering gang more than a fanatic doomsday cult.\" In James R. Lewis' \"The Order of the Solar Temple\", he writes that the media made use of the term doomsday cult to characterize the movement, though former members and outsiders did not know what kind of event would occur.\nSome see the use of the term itself as a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the characterization of being called a doomsday cult may actually affect the outcome of violent events related to the group. The \"Canadian Security Intelligence Service Report on Doomsday Religious Cults\" reported:\nSanctions applied by authorities are often interpreted by a movement as hostile to its existence, which reinforces their apocalyptic beliefs and leads to further withdrawal, mobilization and deviant actions, and which in turn elicits heavier sanctions by authorities. This unleashes a spiral of amplification, as each action amplifies each action, and the use of violence is facilitated as the group believes this will ultimately actualize its doomsday scenario.\"\n\nEileen Barker has compared these concepts to the notion of a deviancy amplification spiral in the media and its effects on new religious movements, and James Richardson has also discussed this effect. In the case of the Concerned Christians, use of the term \"doomsday cult\" as a characterization of the group served as a justification for deportation of its members by the Israeli government.\n\nIn the book \"The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines\", author Loren L. Coleman discusses the effect the media can have on the seemingly innocuous intentions of a French doomsday cult. On September 5, 2002, Arnaud Mussy told his followers based in Nantes, France to look forward to voyagers from Venus who would collect them before the end of the world on October 24, 2002. Though Mussy denied any plans for a mass suicide, both police and the media drew parallels to the Order of the Solar Temple. In \"Apocalypse Observed\", authors Hall, Schuyler and Trinh discuss the effect the media had on the events surrounding the Order of the Solar Temple group.\n\nThe most prominent example of doomsday cult is various Christian churches and organisations who have been predicting the end of the world or doomsday which is based on biblical verses. Some of the major doomsday events in Christian mythology are: End time, Second Coming, Last Judgment, Great Tribulation, Rapture among others. However the various sects of Christianity vary widely in their interpretations and importance given to these elements in day-to-day practice; Christian doomsday cults such as the Branch Davidians usually place a very strong emphasis on the imminence of the Apocalypse and the personal importance of cult members to its initiation or course, with their interpretations of the Book of Revelation typically differing strongly or being completely different to that of mainstream branches of Christianity.\n"}

Charles Leonard Woolley during excavations at Ur in modern-day Iraq. He originally considered this to be a palace, a view that was later rejected in replace for a temple. The location of the royal palace at Ur remains unknown. No graves were discovered under the Ekursag during these excavations. Woolley eventually conceded that it was a \"minor temple of some sort.\" Modern scholars still vary on their interpretations of it as a temple, palace or administrative building. It has even been suggested to be a wing or annex of the main temple, having had some of its foundations destroyed. Stamped bricks used in the construction of the foundations revealed that they were built by Ur-Nammu of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Bricks from the pavement bore the stamp of his successor, Shulgi and later ones of the Isin-Larsa period after Ur was destroyed by Elamites. Ehursag is also the name or epithet of Ninhursag's temple at Hiza and has been suggested to have been an interchangeable word with Enamtila. The Ehursag at Ur was restored in 1961 using ancient and modern bricks, a 2008 report for the British Museum noted that this had collapsed in some areas, especially the northwest corner.\n\n"}

Unlike a \"mobed\" or \"dastūr\", a \"hērbad\" may not be celebrate the \"yasna\", the main service. He may however assist. A \"hērbad\" may also not officiate at a recitation of the \"Vendidad\", which is reserved for priests of higher grade. \n\nAmongst lay Zoroastrians, the three terms are used interchangeably. Unlike \"mobed\" but like \"dastūr\", \"hērbad\" may be adopted as a professional title in a person's name.\n\nMiddle Persian 𐭧𐭩𐭫𐭯𐭲 \"harpat\" (Pahlavi \"ʼyhlpt\") derives from Avestan 𐬀𐬈𐬚𐬭𐬀𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 \"aethrapaiti\", which the Avesta uses denote a priestly teacher whose students (\"aethrii\") would be taught to recite the sacred texts. By the 2nd century CE, the term had come to refer to a clergyman who taught religious subjects, and the term appears to have commanded greater prestige than it does today. In the late 3rd century inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, the high-priest Kartir refers to himself as \"hērbad\".\n\nThere is some evidence that suggest that already by the 6th century, \"hērbad\"s performed advanced theological tasks, including translations and interpretation of Avestan texts. The 10th century \"Denkard\" refers to the high-priest Tansar, who, in legend, is attributed with the collation of the Avesta, as \"hērbad\".\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Sassanid state in the 6th century, after which Zoroastrianism began to be supplanted by Islam, the increasingly impoverished Zoroastrian communities found it difficult to support a priesthood known only for their scholarship. By the 9th century, there was an active rivalry between these scholar-priests and ritual priests, with each group underbidding the other in their attempts to secure an income. For Zoroastrian laypersons, the distinction between the two groups was at best theoretical and by the 10th century, the term \"hērbad\" had lost most associations of scholarship and eventually came to refer to priests that had no theological authority. Beyond that distinction, the terms \"hērbad\", \"mobad\" and \"dastūr\" were used interchangeably.\n\nIn the 16th century, the \"Rivayat\" epistles encouraged the Indian Zoroastrians to distinguish between priests capable of officiating at a \"Vendidad\" reading and the others. That led to the reinstatement of a hierarchy, with \"hērbad\"s at the lowest rung on the ladder. Above them were the \"mobad\"s, denoting priests who had completed their training. In India, the \"mobad\"s have a \"dastur\" as their superior. This is effectively an administrative rank and denotes a director of a fire temple. A \"dastūr\" is also the highest religious instance for the community that worships at that temple.\n\n"}

The immigrants, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling in famine prone areas of Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal, helped construct the first railway line between Malawi and Mozambique.\n\nHinduism has a very small minority presence in predominantly Christian Malawi. The government tracks Christian and Muslim demographics, but does not recognize other religions separately, considers Hindus as well as the traditional African religions as a part of the \"Others\" category. The \"Others\" were about 3.1% in 2006.\n\nAccording to the 1994 constitution of Malawi, many seats in its Senate are reserved for \"major religious faiths of Malawi\", and only Christianity and Islam is recognized as \"major faiths\". Malawi thus constitutionally bars people with faiths such as Hinduism from political representation in its Senate, allows only Christians and Muslims to hold the set aside seats of political power.\n\nAfter colonialism ended, Hindus (along with Jains and Sikhs) were discriminated against in East Africa, where various East African governments promoted Africanization enacting laws and policies that required commercial and professional sectors of the economy to be owned by non-Europeans, non-Asians, and only indigenous Africans. Many Hindus previously residing in Malawi migrated to other countries during this period, particularly the United Kingdom starting with the 1960s.\n\nGujarati, Sindhi and Bengali are the Main languages of Hindus in Malawi.

{"id": "27166524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27166524", "title": "Hyang", "text": "Hyang\n\nA Hyang (Kawi, Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese) is an unseen spiritual entity that has supernatural power in ancient Indonesian mythology. This spirit can be either divine or ancestral. The reverence for this spiritual entity can be found in Sunda Wiwitan, Kejawen, and Balinese Hinduism. In the modern Indonesian this term tends to be associated with gods, devata, or God. The realm where the hyangs reside is called \"kahyangan\"; the abode of gods, now a synonym for svarga or heaven in modern Bahasa Indonesia.\n\nHindu Balinese spiritualism describes hyang as a venerated spiritual existence, that deserves a special reverence. Hyang is commonly described as a sacred and luminous personal form. It is the name for a spiritual existence that has supernatural powers, portrayed like the sun in a dream. His arrival in a person's life gives contentment without a pause for a long time, which is indistinguishable between dream and reality. Indonesians generally recognize this term to refer the cause of beauty, the cause of all existence (creator), or simply to refer God.\n\nThe term \"hyang\" now widely associated with Balinese Hinduism developed in ancient Java and Bali more than a millennium ago. However this term actually has an older origin, it has its root in the indigenous animism and dynamism beliefs of Austronesian people that inhabit the Indonesian archipelago. Native pre-Hindu Buddhist and pre-Islamic Indonesians venerated and revered ancestral spirits, they also believed that some spirits may inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or any sacred places. The \"hyang\" concept indigenously developed in the archipelago and not considered to have originated from Indian dharmic religions.\n\nBefore the adoption of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, the natives of the Indonesian archipelago believed in powerful but unseen spiritual entities that can be both benevolent or malevolent. They also believed that the deceased ancestor is not gone away or disappeared completely. The ancestral spirit may gain god-like spiritual power and remain involved in their offspring's worldly affairs. That is why the veneration and reverence to honor ancestors is an important element in the belief system of native ethnic groups, such as Nias, Dayak, Toraja, Papuan ethnic groups, as well as many ethnic groups in Indonesia.\n\nIn ancient Sundanese, Javanese, and Balinese society, this unseen spiritual entity is identified as \"hyang\". These ancestral divine spirits are believed to inhabit high places, such as mountains, hills, and volcanoes. These mountainous regions are considered sacred realms, as the abode of gods and the resting place for the soul of the ancestors.\n\nSeveral ancient Indonesian inscriptions dated from Hindu-Buddhist period (8th to 15th century), mentioned \"hyang\" either as the name of sanctuary or the name of deity revered in that temple.\n\nIn Sundanese, the term \"nga-hyang\" means \"disappear\" or \"unseen\". It is suggested that the word \"hyang\" has linguistic relation with the Malay word: \"hilang\" which means \"disappear\". In its development, the term \"hyang\" become the root word for many terms that still known and used in modern Indonesian: \n\nHyang are said to only move in straight lines. Accordingly, traditional Balinese buildings have a wall called an just inside the doorway, which keeps the spirits out because they only move in straight lines, and hence bounce off. Similar walls can be seen at the entrance of some Javanese cemeteries. Parallel beliefs are found in other spiritual traditions, as in British corpse roads.\n\n"}
{"id": "1277048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1277048", "title": "Islam in Pakistan", "text": "Islam in Pakistan\n\nIslam is the largest and the state religion of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Pakistan has been called a \"global center for political Islam\".\n\nAbout 97.0% of Pakistanis are Muslims. Pakistan has the second largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia. The majority are Sunni (75–95%) while Shias make up between 5–20% and Ahmadis (considered by the constitution of Pakistan to be non-Muslims) are 1–2%.\n\nPakistan had been created in the name of Islam. The idea of Pakistan had received overwhelming popular support among Indian Muslims, especially those in the provinces of British India where Muslims were in a minority such as U.P. The Muslim League leadership, ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah had articulated their vision of Pakistan in terms of an Islamic state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama. When Jinnah died, Islamic scholar Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani described Jinnah as the greatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and also compared Jinnah's death to the Prophet's passing. Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember Jinnah's message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream:to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from Pakistan to Morocco. He [Jinnah] wanted to see the Muslims of the world united under the banner of Islam as an effective check against the aggressive designs of their enemies.The first formal step taken to transform Pakistan into an ideological Islamic state was in March 1949 when the country's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, introduced the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly. The Objectives Resolution declared that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty. The president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, announced that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity. Khaliq believed that Pakistan was only a Muslim state and was not yet an Islamic state, but that it could certainly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit. Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world:Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims. Other Muslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this assumed that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between religion and nationality.However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments were not shared by other Muslim governments at the time. Nationalism in other parts of the Muslim world was based on ethnicity, language and culture. Although Muslim governments were unsympathetic with Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from all over the world were drawn to Pakistan. Figures such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of Islamist political movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, became frequent visitors to the country. After General Zia-ul-Haq took power in a military coup, Hizb ut-Tahrir (an Islamist group calling for the establishment of a Caliphate) expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan. Its founder, Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, would maintain regular correspondence with Abul A’la Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), and he also urged Dr Israr Ahmed to continue his work in Pakistan for the establishment of a global caliphate.\n\nSocial scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed conducted a survey in 1969 in pre-divided Pakistan on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that over 60% of people in East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh) professed to have a secular national identity. However, in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) the same figure professed to have an Islamic and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in East Pakistan defined their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not Islam. It was the opposite in West Pakistan, where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity.\n\nAfter Pakistan's first ever general elections the 1973 Constitution was created by an elected Parliament. The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam.\nOn 5 July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq led a coup d'état. In the year or two before Zia-ul-Haq's coup, his predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had faced vigorous opposition which was united under the revivalist banner of \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (\"Rule of the prophet\"). According to supporters of the movement, establishing an Islamic state based on \"sharia\" law would mean a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet Muhammad ruled the Muslims. In an effort to stem the tide of street Islamisation, Bhutto had also called for it and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing.\n\n\"Islamisation\" was the \"primary\" policy,\nor \"centerpiece\" of his government. Zia-ul-Haq committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing \"sharia\" law. Zia established separate Shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine. New criminal offences (of adultery, fornication, and types of blasphemy), and new punishments (of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death), were added to Pakistani law. Interest payments for bank accounts were replaced by \"profit and loss\" payments. \"Zakat\" charitable donations became a 2.5% annual tax. School textbooks and libraries were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material. Offices, schools, and factories were required to offer praying space. Zia bolstered the influence of the \"ulama\" (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties, whilst conservative scholars became fixtures on television. 10,000s of activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party were appointed to government posts to ensure the continuation of his agenda after his passing. Conservative \"ulama\" (Islamic scholars) were added to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985 even though Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county's political process.\n\nZia's state sponsored Islamization increased sectarian divisions in Pakistan between Sunnis and Shias and between Deobandis and Barelvis. A solid majority of Barelvis had supported the creation of Pakistan, and Barelvi ulama had also issued fatwas in support of the Pakistan Movement during the 1946 elections, but ironically Islamic state politics in Pakistan was mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi) institutions. This was despite the fact that only a few (although influential) Deobandi clerics had supported the Pakistan Movement. Zia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the military and Deobandi institutions.\n\nPossible motivations for the Islamization programme included Zia's personal piety (most accounts agree that he came from a religious family), desire to gain political allies, to \"fulfill Pakistan's \"raison d'être\"\" as a Muslim state, and/or the political need to legitimise what was seen by some Pakistanis as his \"repressive, un-representative martial law regime\".\n\nUntil the government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, \"Islamic activists\" were frustrated by the lack of \"teeth\" to enforce Islamic law in Pakistan's constitution. For example, in the 1956 constitution, the state did not enforce \"Islamic moral standards\" but \"endeavor[ed]\" to make them compulsory and to \"prevent\" prostitution, gambling, consumption of alcoholic liquor, etc. Interest was to be eliminated \"as soon as possible\".\n\nAccording to Shajeel Zaidi a million people attended Zia ul Haq's funeral because he had given them what they wanted: more religion. A PEW opinion poll found that 84% of Pakistanis favoured making Sharia the official law of the land. According to the 2013 Pew Research Center report, the majority of Pakistani Muslims also support the death penalty for those who leave Islam (62%). In contrast, support for the death penalty for those who leave Islam was only 36% in fellow South Asian Muslim country Bangladesh (which shared heritage with Pakistan). A 2010 opinion poll by PEW Research Centre also found that 87% of Pakistanis considered themselves 'Muslims first' rather than a member of their nationality. This was the highest figure amongst all Muslim populations surveyed. In contrast only 67% in Jordan, 59% in Egypt, 51% in Turkey, 36% in Indonesia and 71% in Nigeria considered themselves as 'Muslim first' rather than a member of their own nationality.\n\n\"Islamic activists\" such as much or the ulama (Islamic clerics) and Jamaat-e-Islami (Islamist party), support the expansion of \"Islamic law and Islamic practices\". \"Islamic Modernists\" are lukewarm to this expansion and \"some may even advocate development along the secularist lines of the West.\"\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook and Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, 95-97% of the total population of Pakistan is Muslim.\nThe majority of the Pakistani Muslims belong to the Sunni Hanafi Madhhab (school of jurisprudence). Estimates on the Sunni population in Pakistan range from 75% to 95%.\n\nShia Ithna 'ashariyah are estimated to be 5–20% of the country's population. Pakistan, like India, is said to have at least 16 million Shias. A PEW survey in 2012 found that only 6% of Pakistani Muslims were Shia.\n\nShias allege discrimination by the Pakistani government since 1948, claiming that Sunnis are given preference in business, official positions and administration of justice. Attacks on Shias increased under the presidency of Zia-ul-Haq, with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to Lahore and Balochistan. Sectarian violence became a recurring feature of the Muharram month every year, with sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias taking place in 1986 in Parachinar. In one notorious incident, the 1988 Gilgit Massacre, Osama bin Laden-led Sunni tribals assaulted, massacred and raped Shia civilians in Gilgit after being inducted by the Pakistan Army to quell a Shia uprising in Gilgit.\n\nSufism is a vast term and many Sufi orders exist within Pakistan where the philosophy has a strong tradition. Historically, the Sufi missionaries had played a pivotal role in converting the native peoples of Punjab and Sindh to Islam. The most notable Muslim Sufi orders in Pakistan are the Qadiriyya, Naqshbandiya, Chishtiya and Suhrawardiyya silsas (Muslim Orders) and they have a large amount of devotees in Pakistan. The tradition of visiting dargahs is still practiced today. Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Data Ganj Baksh (Ali Hajweri) in Lahore (ca. 11th century), Sultan Bahoo in Shorkot Jhang, Baha-ud-din Zakariya in Multan and Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan (ca. 12th century) and Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in Bhit, Sindh and Rehman Baba in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. The Urs (death anniversary) of Sufi saints accounts for the largest gathering upon their shrines held annually by the devotees. \n\nAlthough, popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance, certain tariqas such as Sarwari Qadri Order, refrain from such traditions and believe in paying visit to the shrines, making prayers or reciting manqabat. Moreover, contemporary Islamic fundamentalists also criticize the popular tradition of singing, dance and music, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet Mohammad and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, five in 2010 that killed 64 people. Presently, the known tariqas in Pakistan have maintained their organisations usually known as tehreeks and have their khanqahs for the dhikr of Allah, as per the old age Sufi tradition.\n\nMuslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranist, Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in Pakistan.\n\nRoughly twelve per cent of Pakistani Muslims self-describe or have beliefs overlapping with non-denominational Muslims. These Muslims have beliefs that by and large overlap with those of the majority of Muslims and the difference in their prayers are usually non-existent or negligible. Nonetheless, in censuses asking for a clarification on which strand or rite of Muslim faith they most closely align, they usually answer \"just a Muslim\".\n\nThe minority group Ahmadiyya is also present. In 1974, the government of Pakistan amended the Constitution of Pakistan to define a Muslim \"as a person who believes in finality of Prophet Muhammad\" and technically Ahmadis are declared non-Muslims. Ahmadis believe in Muhammad as the best and the last law bearing prophet and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the Christ of Muslims. Consequently, they were declared non-Muslims by a parliamentary tribunal. There are approximately 2 million Ahmadis in the country. This equates to around 1% of the population.\n\nThere have been conversions to Islam from the religious minorities of Pakistan. Deen Mohammad Shaikh, a former Hindu, is a Muslim missionary from Matli in Badin District of Sindh province and has converted over 110,000 Hindus to Islam.\n\n\n"}

In present-day Romania, most adherents to Islam belong to the Tatar and Turkish ethnic communities and follow the Sunni doctrine. The Islamic religion is one of the 16 rites awarded state recognition.\n\nAccording to tradition, Islam was first established locally around by an Alevi Sufi leader Sari Saltik also revered by the Sunnis during the Byzantine epoch. The Islamic presence in Northern Dobruja was expanded by Ottoman overseeing and successive immigration, but has been in steady decline since the late 19th century. In Wallachia and Moldavia, the two Danubian Principalities, the era of Ottoman suzerainty was not accompanied by a growth in the number of Muslims, whose presence there was always marginal. Also linked to the Ottoman Empire, groups of Islamic colonists in other parts of present-day Romania were relocated by the Habsburg expansion or by various other political changes.\n\nAfter Northern Dobruja became part of Romania following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the community preserved its self-determining status. This changed during the communist regime, when Romanian Muslims were subject to a measure of supervision by the state, but the group again emancipated itself after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Its interests are represented by the Muftiyat (\"Muftiyatul Cultului Musulman din România\"), which was created as the reunion of two separate such institutions.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 64,337 people, approx. 0.3% of the total population, indicated that their religion was Islam. The vast majority of Romania's believers in Islam are Sunnis who adhere to the Hanafi school. Ethnically, they are mostly Tatars (Crimean Tatars and a number of Nogais), followed by Turks, as well as Muslim Roma (as much as 15,000 people in one estimate), Albanians (as many as 3,000), and groups of Middle Eastern immigrants. Members of the Muslim community inside the Roma minority are colloquially known as \"Turkish Romani\". Traditionally, they are less religious than people belonging to other Islamic communities, and their culture mixes Islamic customs with Roma social norms.\n\nNinety-seven percent of the Romanian Muslims are residents of the two counties forming Northern Dobruja: eighty-five percent live in Constanța County, and twelve percent in Tulcea County. The rest mainly inhabit urban centers such as Bucharest, Brăila, Călărași, Galați, Giurgiu, and Drobeta-Turnu Severin. A single municipality, Dobromir, has a Muslim majority.\n\nIn all, Romania has as many as eighty mosques, or, according to records kept by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, seventy-seven. The city of Constanța, with its Carol I Mosque and the location of the Muftiyat, is the center of Romanian Islam; Mangalia, near Constanța, is the site of a monumental mosque, built in 1525 (\"see Mangalia Mosque\"). The two mosques are state-recognized historical monuments, as are the ones in Hârșova, Amzacea, Babadag and Tulcea, together with the Babadag tombs of two popularly revered Sufi \"sheikhs\"—the supposed tomb of \"dervish\" Sari Saltik and that of Gazi Ali Pașa. There are also 108 Islamic cemeteries in Romania.\n\nThe nationwide Islamic community is internally divided into 50 local groups of Muslims, each of whom elects its own leadership committee. Members provide funding for the religious institution, which is supplemented by state donations and subsidies, as well by assistance from international Islamic organizations.\n\nThe Muslim clergy in Romania includes \"imams\", \"imam-hatips\", and \"muezzins\". As of 2008, the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs recognizes 35 \"imams\". The Constanța Mufti, who is the community's main representative, is elected by a secret ballot from among the \"imams\". He is assisted by a synodal body, the \"Sura Islam\", which comprises 23 members and offers advice on matters of administration and discipline. The current Mufti is Murat Iusuf.\n\nThe first significant numbers of Muslims arrived in Romania with the Pechenegs and Cumans. Around 1061, when the Pechenegs ruled in Wallachia and Moldavia, there was a Muslim minority among them, as was among the Cumans. The Cumans followed the Pechenegs in 1171, while the Hungarian kings settled the Pechenegs in Transylvania and other parts of their kingdom.\n\nMuslim presence is traditional in Dobruja, and partly predates both Ottoman rule and the creation of the neighboring Danubian Principalities. Both the Pechengs and Cumans were present in the area, where they probably established a number of small communities. Around 1260, two Rûm Seljuq community leaders, the deposed Sultan Kaykaus II and the mystic Sari Saltik, were allowed to settle the region during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos, ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Kaykaus, who arrived in Dobruja with his brother and co-ruler Kilij Arslan IV, was reportedly followed by as many as 12,000 of his subjects. Researchers such as Franz Babinger and Gheorghe I. Brătianu endorse the view that Saltuk and his followers were in fact Shiite Alevis who came fron Anatolia.\n\nThe exact location of their earliest area of settlement is disputed: a group of historians proposes that the group was probably tasked with defending the Byzantine border to the north, and settled in and around what later became known as Babadag, while another one centers this presence on the Southern Dobrujan strip of land known as Kaliakra (presently in Bulgaria). In addition, various historians argue that this Seljuq migration was the decisive contributor to the ethnogenesis of the Gagauz people, which, some of them believe, could also have involved the Cumans, Pechenegs, Oghuz and other Turkic peoples. The Gagauz, few of whom have endured in Dobruja, are majority Eastern Orthodox, a fact which was attributed to a process of religious conversion from Islam.\n\nThe presence of Tatars was notably attested through the works of Berber traveler Ibn Battuta, who passed through the area in 1334. In Ibn Battuta's time, the region was regarded as a westernmost possession of the Tatar Golden Horde, a khanate centered on the Eurasian Steppe. Archeology has uncovered that another Tatar group, belonging to the Golden Horde, came to Dobruja during the rule of Nogai Khan, and were probably closely related to the present-day Nogais. Following Timur's offensives, the troops of Aktai Khan visited the region in the mid-14th century and around 100,000 Tatars settled there.\n\nBefore and after the Golden Horde fell, Dobrujan Muslims, like the Crimean Tatars, were recipients of its cultural influences, and the language in use was Kipchak. The extension of Ottoman rule, effected under Sultans Bayezid I and Mehmed I, brought the influence of Medieval Turkish, as Dobruja was added to the \"Beylerbeylik\" of Rumelia.\n\nThe grave of Sari Saltik, reportedly first erected into a monument by Sultan Bayezid, has since endured as a major shrine in Romanian Islam. The shrine, which has been described as a cenotaph, is one of many places where the \"Sheikh\" is supposed to be buried: a similar tradition is held by various local communities throughout the Balkans, who argue that his tomb is located in Kaliakra, Babaeski, Blagaj, Edirne, the Has District, Krujë, or Sveti Naum. Other accounts hold that Saltuk was buried in the Anatolian city of İznik, in Buzău, Wallachia, or even as far south as the Mediterranean island of Corfu or as far north as the Polish city of Gdańsk. The toponym \"Babadağ\" (Turkish for \"Old Man's Mountain\", later adapted into Romanian as \"Babadag\") is a probable reference to Sari Saltik, and a Dobrujan Muslim account recorded by chronicler Evliya Çelebi in the late 15th century has it that the name surfaced soon after a Christian attack partly destroyed the tomb.\n\nThe oldest \"madrasah\" in Dobruja and Romania as a whole was set up in Babadag, on orders from Bayezid II (1484); it was moved to Medgidia in 1903. From the same period onwards, groups of Muslim Tatars and Oghuz Turks from Anatolia were settled into Dobruja at various intervals; in 1525, a sizable group of these, originating from the ports of Samsun and Sinop, moved to Babadag. Bayezid also asked Volga Tatars to resettle into northern Dobruja.\n\nIn the two Danubian Principalities, Ottoman suzerainty had an overall reduced impact on the local population, and the impact of Islam was itself much reduced. Wallachia and Moldavia enjoyed a large degree of autonomy, and their history was punctuated by episodes of revolt and momentary independence. After 1417, when Ottoman domination over Wallachia first became effective, the towns of Turnu and Giurgiu were annexed as \"kazas\", a rule enforced until the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829 (the status was briefly extended to Brăila in 1542).\n\nFor the following centuries, three conversions in the ranks of acting or former local \"hospodars\" are documented: Wallachian Princes Radu cel Frumos (1462–1475) and Mihnea Turcitul (1577–1591), and Moldavian Prince Ilie II Rareș (1546–1551). At the other end of the social spectrum, Moldavia held a sizable population of Tatar slaves, who shared this status with all local Roma people (\"see Slavery in Romania\"). While Roma slavery also existed in Wallachia, the presence of Tatar slaves there has not been documented, and is only theorized. The population may have foremost comprised Muslim Nogais from the Bujak who were captured in skirmishes, although, according to one theory, the first of them may have been Cumans captured long before the first Ottoman and Tatar incursions.\n\nThe issue of Muslim presence on the territory of the two countries is often viewed in relation to the relations between the Ottoman Sultans and local Princes. Romanian historiography has generally claimed that the latter two were bound by bilateral treaties with the Porte. One of the main issues was that of \"Capitulations\" (Ottoman Turkish: \"ahdnâme\"), which were supposedly agreed between the two states and the Ottoman Empire at some point in the Middle Ages. Such documents have not been preserved: modern Romanian historians have revealed that \"Capitulations\", as invoked in the 18th and 19th centuries to invoke Romanian rights vis à vis the Ottomans, and as reclaimed by nationalist discourse in the 20th century, were forgeries. Traditionally, Ottoman documents referring to Wallachia and Moldavia were unilateral decrees issued by the Sultan. In one compromise version published in 1993, Romanian historian Mihai Maxim argues that, although these were unilateral acts, they were viewed as treaties by the Wallachian and Moldavian rulers.\n\nProvisions toward Muslim-Christian relations have traditionally been assessed by taking in view later policies. According to one prominent interpretation, this would mean that the Principalities were regarded by the Ottomans as belonging to the \"Dâr al ahd'\" (\"Abode of the Covenant\"), a status granted to them in exchange for material gains. Therefore, the Ottoman Empire did not maintain troops or garrisons or build military facilities. Instead, as it happened in several instances, Ottoman Sultans allowed their Tatar subjects to raid Moldavia or Wallachia as a means to punish the dissent of local Princes. Literary historian Ioana Feodorov notes that the relations between the two smaller states and the Ottoman suzerain were based on a set of principles and rules to which the Ottoman Empire adhered, and indicates that, early in the 17th century, this system drew admiration from the Arabic-speaking Christian traveler Paul of Aleppo.\n\nBy the 17th century, according to the notes of traveler Evliya Çelebi, Dobruja was also home to a distinct community of people of mixed Turkish and Wallachian heritage. Additionally, a part of the Dobrujan Roma community has traditionally adhered to Islam; it is believed that it originated with groups of Romani people serving in the Ottoman Army during the 16th century, and has probably incorporated various ethnic Turks who had not settled down in the cities or villages. Alongside Dobruja, a part of present-day Romania under direct Ottoman rule in 1551-1718 was the Eyalet of Temeșvar (the Banat region of western Romania), which extended as far as Arad (1551–1699) and Oradea (1661–1699). The few thousand Muslims settled there were, however, driven out by Habsburg conquest.\n\nThe presence of Muslims in the two Danubian Principalities was also attested, centering on Turkish traders and small communities of Muslim Roma. It is also attested that, during later Phanariote rules and the frequent Russo-Turkish Wars, Ottoman troops were stationed on Wallachia's territory.\n\nFollowing the Crimean Khanate's conquest by the Russian Empire (1783), many Tatars there took refuge in Dobruja, especially around Medgidia. At the time, Crimean Tatars had become the largest community in the region. Nogais in the Budjak began to arrive upon the close of the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812, when the Budjak and Bessarabia were ceded to Russia (they settled in northern Tulcea County - Isaccea and Babadag). Khotyn, once part of Moldavia, was the birthplace of Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, who was the Ottoman Grand Vizier until 1808. Two more Grand Viziers between 1821 and 1828 came from Bender (a once Moldavian city), as Benderli Pashas.\n\nOver the same period, large groups of Circassians (as many as 200,000), refugees from the Caucasian War, were resettled in the Dobruja and northern Bulgaria by the Ottomans (localities with large Circassian populace included Isaccea, Slava Cercheză, Crucea, Horia, and Nicolae Bălcescu). During the 1860s, a significant number of Nogais, also fleeing Russian conquest, left their homes in the Caucasus and joined in the exodus to Dobruja. Members of other Muslim communities which joined in the colonization included Arabs (a group of 150 families of \"fellahin\" from Syria Province, brought over in 1831-1833), Kurds, and Persians—all of these three communities were quickly integrated into the Tatar-Turkish mainstream.\n\nTatars in Tulcea County were driven out by Russian troops during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 (\"see Muhajir Balkan\"). Following the conflict and the Berlin Congress, the Romanian government of Ion Brătianu agreed to extend civil rights to non-Christians. In 1923 a monument in the shape of a small mosque was built in Bucharest's Carol Park, as sign of reconciliation after World War I. A small Muslim community resided on Ada Kaleh island in the Danube, south of the Banat, an Ottoman enclave and later part of Austria-Hungary, which was transferred to Romania in 1923.\n\nAt the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913, the Kingdom of Romania came to include Southern Dobruja, whose population was over 50% Turkish (the region was ceded to Bulgaria in 1940). As recorded after World War I, Romania had a population of 200,000 Muslims from a total of 7 million, the majority of which were Turks who lived in the two areas of Dobruja (as many as 178,000). Since 1877, the community was led by four separate muftiyats. Their number was reduced during the interwar period, when the cities of Constanța and Tulcea each housed a muftiyat. In 1943, the two institutions were again unified around the mufi in Constanța. Outside Dobruja, the relatively small presence of Albanian Muslims also left a cultural imprint: in 1921, the first translation of the \"Qur'an\" into the Albanian language was completed by Ilo Mitke Qafëzezi in the Wallachian city of Ploiești.\n\nUntil after World War II, the overall religiously conservative and apolitical Muslim population reportedly enjoyed a notable degree of religious tolerance. Nevertheless, after 1910, the community was subject to a steady decline, and many predominantly-Muslim villages were abandoned.\n\nThe Dobrujan Muslim community was exposed to cultural repression during Communist Romania. After 1948, all property of the Islamic institutions became state-owned. The following year, the state-run and secular compulsory education system set aside special classes for Tatar and Turkish children. According to Irwin, this was part of an attempt to create a separate Tatar literary language, intended as a means to assimilate the Tatar community. A reported decline in standards led to the separate education agenda being ceased in 1957. As a consequence, education in Tatar dialects and Turkish was eliminated in stages after 1959, becoming optional, while the \"madrasah\" in Medgidia was shut down in the 1960s. The population of Ada Kaleh relocated to Anatolia shortly before the 1968 construction of the Iron Gates dam by a joint Yugoslav-Romanian venture, which resulted in the island being flooded. At the same time, Sufi tradition was frowned upon by Communist officials—as a result of their policies, the Sufi groups became almost completely inactive.\n\nHowever, according to historian Zachary T. Irwin, the degree to which the Muslim community was repressed and dispersed was lower in Romania than in other countries of Eastern Europe, and the measures were less severe than, for instance, those taken against Romanian Roman Catholics and Protestants. The state sponsored an edition of the \"Qur'an\", and top clerics such as Mufti Iacub Mehmet and Bucharest \"Imam\" Regep Sali, represented the community in the Great National Assembly during Nicolae Ceaușescu's years in office. In the 1980s, a delegation of Romanian Muslims visited Iran after the Islamic Revolution succeeded in that country. They also adhered to international bodies sponsored by Libya and Saudi Arabia. These gestures, according to Irwin, brought only a few objections from the regime.\n\nFollowing the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Tatar and Turkish were again added to the curriculum for members of the respective communities, and, in 1993, the Medgidia \"madrasah\" was reopened as a Theological and Pedagogic High School named after Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The school was later elevated to National College status, and is known in Romanian as \"Colegiul Național Kemal Atatürk\". Since the 1990s, the official representatives of the Muslim community maintain close relations with international non-governmental organizations such as the Muslim World League.\n\n\n\n"}

Z.\" Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton; March 16, 1946) is an American New Age teacher and author known for her purported channelling of a spiritual entity named Ramtha.\n\nKnight has appeared on US TV shows, such as \"Larry King\", MSNBC and \"The Merv Griffin Show\", as well as in media such as \"Psychology Today\". Her teachings have attracted figures from the entertainment and political world such as Linda Evans and Shirley MacLaine.\n\nKnight claims to bridge ancient wisdom and the power of consciousness together with the latest discoveries in science. Some of the ideas are similar to those of Shirley MacLaine, which have in turn been criticized for being \"kindergarten metaphysics\" by mathematician and skeptic Martin Gardner. Ramtha's teachings have been criticized by scientists and skeptics. The Southern Poverty Law Center has criticized Knight for \"homophobic, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic racist rants\".\n\nKnight lives in a French chateau-style home and, next door, teaches courses and runs Ramtha's School of Enlightenment.\n\nKnight has been married three times and is the mother of two children from her first marriage (Brandy and Christopher), which ended in divorce.\n\nKnight grew up in poverty. After graduating from high school, she dropped out of business school. She later worked in the cable television industry, and due to her work moved to Tacoma, Washington, where, according to her autobiography, a psychic told her the \"Enlightened One\" would appear to her in the future. She says that Ramtha first appeared to her in her kitchen in 1977.\n\nKnight appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" in 1985 and wrote the autobiographical \"A State of Mind\" in 1987. \"Time\" called her \"probably the most celebrated of all current channelers\". She is currently the president of JZK, Inc and Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, located near the town of Yelm, Washington. Knight owns several U.S. trademark registrations featuring the \"Ramtha\" name. She appeared in the 2004 documentary \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\", produced by members of the Ramtha School.\n\nAfter an absence from public view of several years, she returned to public speaking on radio and in magazines and workshops. She was a guest on Coast To Coast AM with George Noory on August 14, 2011.\n\n\"Ramtha\" (the name is claimed to be derived from \"Ram\" and to mean \"the God\" in Ramtha's language) is the name of a reputed entity whom Knight says she channels. According to Knight, Ramtha was a Lemurian warrior who fought the Atlanteans over 35,000 years ago. Knight claims that Ramtha speaks of leading an army over 2.5 million strong (more than twice the estimated world population at about 30,000 BC) for 63 years, and conquering three fourths of the known world (which was allegedly going through cataclysmic geological changes). According to Knight, Ramtha led the army for 10 years until he was betrayed and almost killed.\n\nKnight maintains that Ramtha spent the next seven years in isolation recovering and observing nature, the seasons, his army making homes and families, and many other things. She says that he later mastered many skills, including foresight and out-of-body experiences, until he led his army to the Indus River while in his late fifties (after having led his army for 63 years). According to Knight, Ramtha taught his soldiers everything he knew for 120 days, he bid them farewell, rose into the air and in a bright flash of light he ascended before them. Knight says that he made a promise to his army that he would come back to teach them everything he had learned. JZ Knight says that in 1977 Ramtha appeared before her and told her that he had come to help her over the ditch. JZ Knight claims to have become his first student of what she calls the great work.\n\nRamtha is the central figure (the \"master teacher\") of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, started by Knight in 1987 near the town Yelm, Washington. Classes (or \"dialogues\") had been held around the world for the previous 10 years. There are currently over 6,000 students of Knight's teachings.\n\nA central theme of Knight's teachings involves the internalization of divinity (\"God is in Us\", \"You are God, Behold God\"). Knight describes Ramtha as having brought his knowledge to many ancient civilizations in the world such as the Ancient Egyptians. Her website also suggests that traces of the lineage of the original teachings and philosophies she claims Ramtha taught 35,000 years ago have appeared throughout history in the schools of philosophers such as Socrates, religions such as Hinduism and Judaism, and the works of great minds such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.\n\nThe four cornerstones of Knight's philosophy are:\n\nKnight's teachings appear to be a mixture of Jungian philosophy, Western occult traditions and contemporary positive-thinking attitudes (such as New Age beliefs) and have yet to stand against elementary skepticism or scrutiny. Predictions made by Knight in the name of the disembodied entity have either failed to come true (e.g. predicting that a holocaust would take place in 1985, or that the USA would be involved in a major war in 1985) or the predicted scenarios are too wide to evaluate and/or have too large an error margin to be considered, which is usually the case with channelers.\n\nWhen Knight says she is channeling Ramtha she speaks mostly in English in what sounds like an accent from the Indian Raj, sometimes in a simplistic way. The claimed entity \"Ramtha\" has expressed confusion about modern items (or even the ability to read English), although he seems to have clear understanding of complex issues of modern physics, such as the quantum field or neurology, which appear frequently in his speeches. During the alleged channeling of Ramtha, JZ Knight behaves a bit differently and speaks in a deeper and stern voice.\n\nIn her teachings \"Ramtha\" has made several controversial statements such as that Christianity is a \"backward\" religion, that Jesus' parables can be explained by means of photon waves and probability, that \"murder isn't really wrong or evil\" (if one believes in reincarnation), or (during the court case JZ Knight v Jeff Knight) Jeff Knight stated that Ramtha had declared that HIV is Nature's way of 'getting rid of' homosexuality. The Southern Poverty Law Center observed that \"Ramtha\" has made anti-semitic comments such as \"\"Fuck God's chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now\".\n\nMost books regarding Ramtha and RSE come from JZK Publishing, one of the several companies started by Knight. Other books somewhat sympathetic to Ramtha, such as \"Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom\" by Gordon Melton, have ties to RSE in other ways. The author of \"Finding Enlightenment\" testified for Knight in Knight vs. Knight (1992–1995) against her former husband, Jeffery Knight (see below).\n\nSkeptics point to Ramtha's story as proof that he does not exist. Ramtha claims to come from the continent of Lemuria and to have conquered Atlantis. The existence of the two locations is considered of legendary nature, and neither has been found. Furthermore, the claim that Ramtha led an army of 2.5 million contradicts estimates of the world population at 33,000 BC, and her claims of clairvoyant, telepathic, telekinetic and other ESP abilities, for which there is no scientific support, have been heavily criticized by skeptics and scientific communities.\n\nRamtha's claim that every person can learn to create their own reality is itself a philosophical paradox. Julian Baggini, in his book \"The pig that wants to be eaten\", argues that if everyone was capable of creating their own realities with their minds, it would be problematic as one person could then create a reality in which no one was allowed to create their own realities.\n\nMagician and skeptic James Randi said that Ramtha's believers have \"no way of evaluating [her teachings]\", while Carl Sagan in his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\" says that \"the simplest hypothesis is that Ms. Knight makes 'Ramtha' speak all by herself, and that she has no contact with disembodied entities from the Pleistocene Ice Age.\" He goes on to write a list of questions that Ramtha's answers to would help us determine whether he is actually a disembodied entity from the paleolithic times (such as \"What were the indigenous languages, and social structure?\", \"What was their writing like?\" or \"How do he know that he lived 35,000 years ago?\"), and ends by saying that \"[i]nstead, all we are offered are banal homilies.\"\n\nKnight's former husband, Jeff Knight, in an interview in 1992 with Joe Szimhart, said that Ramtha's teachings are a \"farce\" and that they are \"just a money making business for [JZ Knight]\". He also said that students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment are \"involved in a very dangerous, very evil corrupt thing\".\n\nAttacks and criticism against Ramtha's teachings and Ramtha's School of Enlightenment have also been made by former students of the school. David McCarthy, a Yelm resident and former student of the school between 1989 and 1996, has accused the school of being a cult. He further claims that he was intimidated during his studies there, and he felt like mind control was being exerted by Knight and the school. He said \"At one point I was running around scared I was going to get eaten by the lizard people.\" McCarthy became disappointed, not only with his own experience of Ramtha's teachings but also as he had cut ties from his family to become a student as they lived in a different country. This led McCarthy to form a group called \"Life After Ramtha's School of Enlightenment\", which questions the authenticity of Ramtha and encourages people to come out and express their experiences after their realization that the RSE is a cult. The school has also been characterized as a cult by skeptic Michael Shermer in his book \"Why People Believe Weird Things\".\n\nGlenn Cunningham, a former bodyguard of Knight's, in an interview with David McCarthy details the inner workings of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment and criticizes various activities (such as trademarking ideas and phrases that had been coined by other authors many years before - for example, the idea of \"Blue Body\", or mixing quantum physics with new age ideas, which can be found in Vera Stanley Alder's \"From the Mundane to the Magnificent\", first published in 1979) of Knight's and aspects of Ramtha which he simply saw as Knight acting. Among the things he mentions is the fact that Ramtha mispronounces the same words that Knight mispronounces, and that Ramtha quotes the same books that Knight has read. Glenn Cunningham admits in the video interview, that he was prone to lying to students when he saw fit or thought that it may help them.\n\nFurthermore, Ramtha's teachings as they are portrayed in the movie \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\", not only in the general gist of the film (which was directed and funded by students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment) but also in instances where Ramtha is interviewed on screen, have been heavily criticized by the scientific community, and skeptics, such as James Randi.\n\nKnight has been involved in several court disputes, some personal and others business-related. She brought a suit against a woman from Berlin named Julie Ravell for disturbing Knight's psychic state and leaving her \"hanging in spiritual limbo\" during the five years Ravell claimed she was also channeling Ramtha. The case was brought to the supreme court in Vienna and lasted over five years, at the end of which Austria's supreme court awarded copyright to Knight as the sole channeler of Ramtha, and Ravell was made to pay $800 in psychic damages to Knight. Another case involving copyright and trademark ownership was JZK, Inc vs. Glandon, in which Joseph Glandon was accused of distributing copyrighted teachings of Ramtha.\n\nIn Knight vs. Knight (1992–1995), Jeff Knight alleges that he lost years of his life by postponing modern medical treatment for his HIV infection, due to advice from his wife that Ramtha could heal him. The court decided against him; he died before he could appeal the court's decision.\n\nKnight, through JZK Inc., accused WhiteWind Weaver, a Thurston County, Washington citizen, of stealing her ideas and using her and Ramtha's teachings in her workshops. A trial began on March 10, 2008, in Thurston County Superior Court and at the end of it Knight was awarded about $10,000 after the court's decision against WhiteWind Weaver.\n\nKnight also refused to attend court as a witness in a case involving a 15-year-old who claimed rape against two students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. The 15-year-old girl had written a letter to Knight which mentioned that Wayne Allen Geis, her dancing and acting teacher, had engaged in sexual intercourse with her from 1995 to 1997. The illicit activities had also involved Ruth Beverly Martin. They had apparently told the girl that sexual intercourse would help her to relax and improve her acting ability. Knight invited the girl to a retreat at the school in November 1999. In the retreat, Ramtha questioned the girl, her father, Geis and Martin. This inquiry took place on stage in front of an audience of over 800 people for about an hour. Geis and Martin confessed to having molested the girl, and the school contacted authorities. Charged with 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor, Geis and Martin pleaded not guilty and the case went to trial. Prosecutors were reluctant to have Knight appear in court due to the \"circus atmosphere\" that would have been created. Knight herself claimed that she had been in a trance and did not remember anything of what was said in the retreat inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are as many versions of this lineage as there are sources for them. The main source is the Sangam literature – particularly, religious literature such as \"Periapuranam\", semi-biographical poems of the later Chola period such as the temple and cave inscription and left by medieval Cholas.\n\nIrrespective of the source, no list of the kings has a high level of historic fact and, while they generally are similar to each other, no two lists are exactly the same. Modern historians consider these lists not as historically reliable sources but as comprehensive conglomerations of various Hindu deities and Puranic characters attributed to local chieftains and invented ancestry of dynasty attempting to re-establish their legitimacy and supremacy in a land they were trying to conquer.\n\nA number of typical hero and demi-gods found their place in the ancestry claimed by the later Cholas in the long typical genealogies incorporated into the copper-plate charters and stone inscription of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The earliest version of this is found in the kilbil Plates which gives fifteen names before Chola including the genuinely historical ones of Karikala, Perunarkilli and Kocengannan. The Thiruvalangadu Plate swells this list to forty-four, and the Kanya Plate runs up to fifty-two. \n\nThe Cholas were looked upon as descended from the sun. These myths speak of a Chola king, supposed contemporary of the sage Agastya, whose devotion brought the river Kavery into existence. There is also the story of the king Manu Needhi Cholan who sentenced his son to death for having accidentally killed a calf.He was called thus because he followed the rules of Manu; his real name is not mentioned and is thought to be Ellalan according to Maha vamsam who was also attributed with a similar story. King Shivi who rescued a dove from a hunter by giving his own flesh to the hungry and poor hunter was also part of the early Chola legends. King Shivi was also called Sembiyan, a popular title assumed by a number of Chola kings.\n\n The early Chola kings of the Sangam period and the life of people contributed much to the cultural wealth of the Tamil country. The Sangam literature is full of legends about the mythical Chola kings.\n\nThe dates of accession are approximate interpolation of the Chronological standpoints in Tamil history.\n\nThe genealogy of the Chola family conveyed by the Thiruvalangadu copperplate grant consists of names that corroborate the historic authenticity of legends. \n\n"}
{"id": "18642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18642", "title": "Lemmy", "text": "Lemmy\n\nIan Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy, was an English musician and singer-songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band Motörhead. His music was one of the foundations of the heavy metal genre. He was known for his appearance (including his friendly mutton chops), his distinctive gravelly, \"rasp[y]\" singing voice, which \"was one of the most recognisable voices in rock\", and his way of singing, looking up towards \"...a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\". He was also known for his unmistakable bass playing style, in which he used his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\". Another unique aspect of Lemmy's bass sound is that he often played power chords using growling overdriven Marshall tube bass stacks. Alongside his music career, he also had many minor roles and cameo appearances in film and television.\n\nLemmy was born in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent and grew up in Staffordshire and later North Wales. He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of the Beatles, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s; including the Rockin' Vickers. He worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and the Nice, before joining the space rock band Hawkwind in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"Silver Machine\". After being fired from Hawkwind for drug possession in 1975, he founded Motörhead during the same year as the lead singer, bassist, songwriter and frontman. Motörhead's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 and included the hit single \"Ace of Spades\" and the top charting live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\". Lemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Motörhead until his death in December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. Aside from his musical activities, Lemmy was well known for his hard-living lifestyle, chain smoking, and regular consumption of alcohol (notably Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey) and amphetamines.\n\nLemmy was born on Christmas Eve in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. When he was three months old, his father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist, separated from his mother. His mother and grandmother moved to nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley. When Lemmy was ten years old, his mother married former footballer George Willis, who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, with whom Lemmy did not get along.\n\nThe family moved to a farm in the Welsh town of Benllech, Anglesey, with Lemmy later commenting that \"funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view\". He attended Sir Thomas Jones' School in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed \"Lemmy\". It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase \"lemmy [lend me] a quid 'til Friday\" because of his alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play slot machines, although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the name. He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll music, girls, and horses.\n\nAt school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school and had been \"surrounded by chicks\". His mother had a guitar, which he then took to school, even though he could not play, and was himself surrounded by girls. By the time he left school, his family had moved to Conwy. Whilst there, he worked at menial jobs; including one at the local Hotpoint electric appliance factory, while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and spending time at a horse-riding school. Lemmy saw the Beatles perform at the Cavern Club when he was sixteen, and then learned to play along on guitar to their first album \"Please Please Me\". He also admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of John Lennon.\n\nIn Stockport, Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played northern clubs for three years. In 1965, he joined the Rockin' Vickers who signed a deal with CBS, released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Rockin' Vickers moved to Manchester, where they shared a flat together. There, Lemmy got involved with a woman named Tracy who bore a son, Paul Inder. Lemmy did not have any involvement in his life until the boy was six.\n\nLeaving the Rockin' Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967. He shared a flat with Noel Redding, bassist of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and with Neville Chesters, their road manager. He got a job as a roadie for the band. In 1968, he joined the psychedelic rock band Sam Gopal under the name Ian Willis and recorded the album \"Escalator\" which was released in 1969. After meeting Simon King at a shopping centre in Chelsea in 1969, he joined the band Opal Butterfly; but the group soon disbanded, having failed to raise enough interest with their singles.\n\nIn August 1971, Lemmy joined the space rock band Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in Notting Hill by bandmate Michael \"Dik Mik\" Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamines. He quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using double stops and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a fundamental part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on \"Space Ritual\". He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, \"Silver Machine\", which reached #3 in 1972.\n\nIn 1975, Lemmy was arrested at the Canada/United States border in Windsor, Ontario, on drug possession charges; he spent five days in jail but was released without charge. Nonetheless, he was fired from Hawkwind.\n\nHe once said of Hawkwind: \"\"I did like being in Hawkwind, and I believe I’d still be playing with them today if I hadn’t been kicked out. It was fun onstage, not so much offstage. They didn’t want to mesh with me. Musically, I loved the drummer, the guitar player. It was a great band.” \n\nAfter Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called \"Bastard\" with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Took's Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of \"Bastard\" would never get a slot on \"Top of the Pops\", Lemmy changed the band's name to \"Motörhead\" – the title of the last song he had written for Hawkwind.\nSoon after, both Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy's guttural vocals were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time when punk rock became popular. The band's sound appealed to Lemmy's original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he even played with the Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist. The band's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits, including the single \"Ace of Spades\", which remained a crowd favourite throughout the band's career, and the UK #1 live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\". Motörhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their – and Lemmy's – final live performance was in Berlin, Germany on 11 December 2015.\n\nAt the age of 17, Lemmy met a holidaying girl named Cathy. He followed her to Stockport, Greater Manchester, where she gave birth to his son Sean, who was put up for adoption. In the 2010 documentary film \"Lemmy\", he mentioned having a son whose mother has only recently \"found him\" and \"hadn't got the heart to tell him who his father was\", indicating that the boy – perhaps Sean – was given up for adoption.\n\nIn the Channel 4 documentary \"Motörhead: Live Fast, Die Old\", broadcast on 22 August 2005, it was claimed that Lemmy had \"bedded\" in excess of 2,000 women. Lemmy stated: \"I said more than a thousand, the magazine made two thousand of it.\" \"Maxim\" had Lemmy at #8 on its top ten \"Living Sex Legends\" list, as they claimed that he had slept with around 1,200 women. Lemmy is one of the characters in the book \"Sex Tips from Rock Stars\" by Paul Miles.\n\nDave Grohl, on his Probot website, describes musicians with whom he has worked. In his entry for Lemmy, he wrote:\n\nLemmy was well known for his alcohol abuse. The documentary \"Live Fast Die Old\" stated that he drank a bottle of Jack Daniel's every day and had done so since he was 30 years old. In 2013, Lemmy stopped drinking Jack Daniel's for health reasons. During his time with Hawkwind he developed an appetite for amphetamines and LSD, particularly the former. Before joining Hawkwind, he recalled Dik Mik, a former Hawkwind sound technician, visiting his squat in the middle of the night and taking speed with him. They became interested in how long \"you could make the human body jump about without stopping\", which they did for a few months, until Mik ran out of money and wanted to return to Hawkwind, taking Lemmy with him.\n\nIn November 2005, he was invited to the National Assembly for Wales as a guest speaker by Conservative member William Graham. He was asked to express his views on the detrimental effects of drugs, and called for the legalisation of heroin. He stated that legalisation would eradicate the drug dealer from society and generate money from its taxation, however hard this would be to accept.\n\nLemmy collected German military regalia; he had an Iron Cross encrusted on his bass, which led to accusations of Nazi sympathies. He stated that he collected the memorabilia because he liked the way it looked, and considered himself an anarchist or libertarian. Lemmy said he was against religion, government, and established authority. In 2011, he identified as agnostic, saying, \"I can find out when I die. I can wait. I'm not in a hurry.\" Jeff Hanneman, the founder of the thrash metal band Slayer, befriended Lemmy due to their shared fondness for collecting Nazi memorabilia. According to Keith Emerson's autobiography, Lemmy gave him two of his Hitler Youth knives during his time as a roadie for the Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as keyholders when playing the Hammond organ during concerts with the Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer before destroying them. Lemmy defended his collection by saying that if his black girlfriend had no problem with it, nobody else should.\n\nLemmy lived in Los Angeles, from 1990 until his death, most recently in a two-room apartment two blocks away from his favourite hangout, the Rainbow Bar and Grill. In December 2000, his tour was cancelled when he was hospitalised in Italy with flu, exhaustion and a lung infection. He was hospitalised with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005. As he grew older, he used less alcohol and drugs as he suffered from diabetes and hypertension. In June 2013, it was reported that he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted. His tour was cancelled in July 2013 due to a severe haematoma. He referred to his continuing drug use as \"dogged insolence in the face of mounting opposition to the contrary\". Towards the end of his life he had to use a walking stick. He had started smoking at the age of 11. In August 2015, he said he had cut down his smoking habit from two packs a day to one pack a week. He was hospitalised with a lung infection in September 2015, after having breathing problems when performing onstage.\n\nOn 28 December 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, Lemmy died at his apartment in Los Angeles from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure. Motörhead announced his death on their official Facebook page later that day. According to the band, his cancer had only been diagnosed two days prior to his death.\n\nLemmy's manager, Todd Singerman, later revealed:\n\nLemmy's doctor had given him between two and six months to live. Following the terminal diagnosis, Rainbow Bar owner Mikael Maglieri brought a video game machine that Lemmy was fond of playing at the establishment over to his apartment so he could continue playing it from his bedside. Although his manager had planned to keep the news private until his eventual death, Lemmy strongly encouraged him to make the diagnosis public in early 2016, but he died before a press release could be drafted.\n\nLemmy's memorial service took place at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, on 9 January 2016. The service was streamed live over YouTube with more than 230,000 people logging on to watch, while others gathered at the Rainbow. His body was cremated following the funeral. His remains were placed in a 3D-printed mantelpiece shaped like his trademark cavalry hat and emblazoned with the slogan \"born to lose, lived to win\". The piece was on display during his funeral and was later interred at Forest Lawn.\n\nIn various media, additional tributes appeared from fellow rock stars such as Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Metallica, Scott Ian of Anthrax, and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.\n\nReviewing his career after his death, \"The Daily Telegraph\" said:\n\nIn 2005, the UK magazine \"Classic Rock\" presented Lemmy with its first \"Living Legend\" award. In a 2013 interview with the magazine, Lemmy said he had never expected to make it to 30, but he spoke very pointedly about the future, indicating neither he nor the band were obsessing about the end:\n\nIn February 2016, the Hollywood Vampires performed at the Grammy Award ceremony as a tribute to Lemmy. On 11 June, Download Festival paid tribute to Lemmy by renaming the main stage the \"Lemmy Stage\", and in the slot where Motorhead were due to play, there was a video tribute to Lemmy in which they played his music and his peers talked about him. On 17 November, Metallica released a tribute song titled \"Murder One\", named after Lemmy's frequently used amp. The song, from their album \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\", depicts Lemmy's rise to fame. On 18 January 2017, Lemmy was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for being the creator of thrash metal. In 2017, the extinct crocodile relative \"Lemmysuchus\" was named after Lemmy. On 14 November 2016, asteroid 243002 was officially named 243002 Lemmy, complimenting asteroid 250840 Motorhead, named after the band in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, Hawkwind recorded a new acoustic version of Lemmy's \"The Watcher\" (originally recorded on \"Doremi Fasol Latido\", 1972) on the album \"The Road to Utopia\" with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by Mike Batt and a guest appearance from Eric Clapton.\n\nLemmy worked with several musicians, apart from his Motörhead bandmates, over the course of his career. He wrote the song \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S\" for the Ramones, which he played in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He was brought in as a songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne's 1991 \"No More Tears\" album, providing lyrics for the tracks \"Hellraiser,\" (which Motörhead later recorded themselves and released as a single), \"Desire,\" \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" and the single \"Mama I'm Coming Home\". Lemmy noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song than he had in his entire time with Motörhead. After being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2000, for which he was hospitalised briefly, Lemmy again appeared with Motörhead at WrestleMania X-Seven. Lemmy published his autobiography, \"White Line Fever\", in November 2002. In 2005 Motörhead won their first Grammy in the Best Metal Performance category with their cover of Metallica's \"Whiplash\". In the same year he began recording an unreleased solo album titled \"Lemmy & Friends\", which was intended to include a collaboration with Janet Jackson.\n\nLemmy made appearances in film and television, including the 1990 science fiction film \"Hardware\" and the 1987 comedy \"Eat the Rich\", for which Motörhead also recorded the soundtracks including the title song. He appeared as himself in the 1986 \"The Comic Strip Presents...\" episode More Bad News, along with fellow heavy metal musicians Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions and Def Leppard. In 1984, Motörhead were the musical guests on the TV show \"The Young Ones\", in the episode \"Bambi\". He appears in the 1994 comedy \"Airheads\" (in which he is credited as \"Lemmy von Motörhead\"). Lemmy has a cameo in Ron Jeremy's 1994 pornographic film \"John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut\" as the discoverer of Bobbitt's severed penis. The appendage is thrown from the window of a moving car and lands at Lemmy's feet who exclaims: \"Looks like a dick! Fucking hell! Ah well, it's not mine at least.\" The film's soundtrack also features the Motörhead song \"Under the Knife\".\n\nHe has also appeared in several movies from Troma Entertainment, including the narrator in 1996's \"Tromeo and Juliet\" and as himself in both \"Terror Firmer\" and \"\". His last role was portraying the President of the United States in \"Return to Nuke 'Em High\". He has a cameo role in the film \"Down and Out with the Dolls\" (Kurt Voss, 2001). He appears as a lodger who lives in a closet. He appeared on \"Down and Dirty with Jim Norton\" as the series DJ, and also wrote the theme music. He appeared in a 2001 advertisement for Kit Kat, playing violin as part of a string quartet in a genteel tearoom. In 2015 Lemmy appeared as a central figure in the Björn Tagemose-directed silent film \"Gutterdämmerung\" opposite Grace Jones, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Tom Araya of Slayer and Eagles of Death Metal's Jesse Hughes.\n\nThe 2010 rockumentary film \"Lemmy\" was directed and produced by Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski. It consists of a combination of 16 mm film and HD video footage, produced over three years. It features interviews with friends, peers, and admirers such as Dave Grohl, Slash, Ozzy Osbourne, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo of Metallica, David Ellefson of Megadeth, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Alice Cooper, Peter Hook of Joy Division/New Order, Dee Snider, Nikki Sixx, Mick Jones of the Clash, Ice-T, Kat Von D, Henry Rollins, Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, Jim Heath of The Reverend Horton Heat, Slim Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats, Mike Inez, Joan Jett, pro skateboarder Geoff Rowley, pro wrestler Triple H, \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, Jarvis Cocker, Marky Ramone, former Hawkwind bandmates Dave Brock and Stacia, and Steve Vai.\n\nHe was the main character in the 16-bit video game \"Motörhead\", released for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in 1992. Lemmy provided his voice as the Arms Dealer in the 2006 game \"\". Lemmy also appeared as an unlockable character in the 2009 game \"\". He also provided his voice for the 2009 video game \"Brütal Legend\", voicing the Kill Master, a character designed and based on his surname and likeness. Lemmy was also the inspiration for the Mario game character Lemmy Koopa, who made his first appearance in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\". In the \"Victor Vran\" \"Downloadable content\" \"Motorhead Through The Ages\", there is a new \"Lemmy's Outfit\" armour. The other Motörhead bandmates' armour is also available.\n\nLemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for \"personal comfort, that's all. It's also one way of avoiding seeing the audience. In the days when we only had ten people and a dog, it was a way of avoiding seeing that we only \"had\" ten people and a dog.\"\n\nLemmy's first bass was a Hopf model that he bought soon after joining Hawkwind. For the majority of his career, he used Rickenbacker basses. In September 1996, his Rickenbacker bass was featured in the \"Bang Your Head\" exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US. Rickenbacker has introduced a signature 4004LK \"Lemmy Kilmister\" bass.\n\nHe used a bass stack made by Marshall Amplification, with three JMP Super Bass amplifier heads each driving a cabinet with four 15-inch speakers; the three heads were labelled \"Killer,\" \"No Remorse,\" and \"Murder One.\" After he blew up \"Murder One\" he replaced it with a Marshall he named \"Marsha.\" Early on he used perhaps his best known amp named \"Hammer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can also be called Manchu Shamanism by virtue of the word \"shaman\" being originally from Tungusic \"šamán\" (\"man of knowledge\"), later applied by Western scholars to similar religious practices in other cultures. It is a pantheistic system, believing in a universal God called \"Apka Enduri\" (\"God of Heaven\") which is the omnipotent and omnipresent source of all life and creation. Deities (\"enduri\") enliven every aspect of nature, and the worship of these gods is believed to bring favour, health and prosperity. Many of the deities are original Manchu kins' ancestors, and people with the same surname are generated by the same god.\n\nShamans are persons of unusual ability, strength and sensitivity, capable of perception and prediction of the ways of the gods. They are endowed with the social function to conduct the sacrificial ceremonies and approach the deities asking them intervention or protection. Because of their abilities the shamans are people of great authority and prestige. Usually, every Manchu kin has its own shaman.\n\nManchu folk religious rites were standardised by the Qianlong Emperor (1736-96) in the \"Manchu Sacrificial Ritual to the Gods and Heaven\" (\"Manjusai wecere metere kooli bithe\"), a manual published in Manchu in 1747 and in Chinese (\"Manzhou jishen jitian dianli\") in 1780. With the conquest of imperial power in China (Qing dynasty) the Manchu people gradually adopted Chinese language and assimilated into the Chinese religion, although Manchu folk religion persists with a distinct character within broader Chinese religion.\n\nStudy of Manchu religion usually distinguishes two types of ritual, \"domestic\" and \"primitive\", which can be performed in two cultic settings, \"imperial\" and \"common\". The domestic ritual primarily involves the sacrifices for the progenitors of lineages and is the most important, while the primitive ritual involves the sacrifices for zoomorphic gods. The ritual manual of Qianlong was an attempt to adapt all kins' ritual traditions to the style of the imperial kin's ritual tradition. This was only partially effective as common cults were preserved and revitalised over time.\n\nThe ancestral ritual is the same in the common and imperial cults. It is composed of three main moments: the dawn sacrifice (Chinese: \"chaoji\"), the sunset sacrifice (\"xiji\") and the \"light-extinguishing\" sacrifice (\"beidingji\") held at midnight. Both common and imperial rituals make use of the gods' pole (Chinese: 神杆 \"shéngān\" or 神柱 \"shénzhù\", Manchu: \"šomo\") as a means of establishing connection with Heaven.\n\nWhile the domestic ritual is bright and harmonious, the primitive or \"wild\" ritual is associated with darkness and mystery. Deities involved are not those of the sky, the earth or the ancestors, but are zoomorphic chthonic deities. With its reliance on techniques of ecstasy, the primitive ritual had long been discouraged by the court (Hong Taiji proscribed it as early as 1636).\n\nManchu religious cults originally took place in shrines called \"tangse\" (Chinese: 堂子 \"tángzi\", \"hall\"; or 谒庙 \"yèmiào\", \"visitation temple\")) but at least by 1673 all communal \"tangse\" were prohibited with the exception of the imperial cult building. Households continued their rituals at private altars called \"weceku\".\n\nCommon cults gradually adopted deities from Chinese religion in addition to Tungusic gods. \"Guwan mafa\" (关帝 \"Guāndì\", \"Divus\" Guan), whose martial character appealed to the Manchus, became one of the most beloved deities. Another popular cult was that of the Goddess (娘娘 \"Niángniáng\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30864247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30864247", "title": "Mike Pinder", "text": "Mike Pinder\n\nMichael Thomas Pinder (born 27 December 1941 in Erdington, Birmingham) is an English rock musician, and is a founding member and original keyboard player of the British rock group the Moody Blues. He left the group following the recording of the band's ninth album \"Octave\" in 1978. He is especially noted for his technological contribution to music.\nIn 2018, Pinder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Moody Blues.\n\nPinder was born to Bert and Gladys Pinder in Kingstanding, Birmingham, and as a young adult played in El Riot and the Rebels, a rock band that achieved some regional success. Bandmates in El Riot included future Moody Blues members Ray Thomas and John Lodge. \n\nAfter a spell in the British Army, Pinder and Thomas played together in a band called the Krew Cats; the band wound up in Germany playing at some of the cellars where The Beatles had polished their musicianship. Pinder and Thomas, with no money, had to walk across northern Europe to get back home to England. Around this time, Pinder was employed by Streetly Electronics, a firm that manufactured the Mellotron.\n\nPinder, Thomas and members of other successful Birmingham bands (singer/guitarist Denny Laine, singer/bassist Clint Warwick and drummer Graeme Edge) formed The Moody Blues in 1964. Their initial single, \"Steal Your Heart Away\" on Decca, failed to chart. Their second release, \"Go Now\" however became UK No.1 in January 1965. The band went on to have a further UK hit with \"I Don't Want To Go On Without You\" and then release their first album \"The Magnificent Moodies\" (Decca) in mono only, on which Pinder took the lead vocal on a cover of James Brown's \"I Don't Mind\". \"Bye Bye Bird\" from this album was also a big hit for the band in France. The album was released in the USA, retitled as \"Go Now\" on London Records.\n\nPinder and guitarist/lead vocalist Laine began songwriting for the band, providing most B-sides over the 1965–66 period, including \"You Don't (All The Time)\", \"And My Baby's Gone\", \"This Is My House (But Nobody Calls)\" and \"He Can Win\". They progressed to writing A-sides, including the UK chart hits \"Everyday\", \"From The Bottom of My Heart\" (both 1965), \"Boulevard De La Madeline\" (1966), and \"Life's Not Life\" (issued in January 1967 but recorded much earlier in 1966), before bassist/vocalist Warwick and then frontman Laine left the group.\n\nA rare non-UK Pinder–Laine song from this era was \"People Gotta Go\", released on the France-only EP \"Boulevard De La Madeline\" and later included as a bonus track on a CD release of \"The Magnificent Moodies\" in 2006. The song is also known as \"Send the People Away\".\n\nPinder was instrumental in the selection of young Swindon guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Justin Hayward as Laine's replacement. It was Pinder who phoned Hayward and then collected him at the railway station. Old friend John Lodge from the El Riot days came in to replace the temporary Rod Clarke as permanent bassist/vocalist, thus completing the 'classic' Moodies line-up.\n\nAfter an initial abortive attempt to continue with R&B material, the band decided to drop all covers and record only original songs. Pinder and Hayward led the way: Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" was the first release from the revised line-up, released on Decca in early 1967 with Pinder's older-style rocker \"Really Haven't Got The Time\" as the B-side.\n\nA recorded but unreleased Pinder song from this time (1967) was the jazz-blues ballad \"Please Think About It\", which would later be included on the \"Caught Live + 5\" double album issued by Decca in 1977.\n\nPinder obtained a secondhand Mellotron from Streetly and, after removing all the special effects tapes (train whistles, cock crowing, etc.) and then doubling up the string section tapes, used it on numerous Moody Blues recordings. This began with their single \"Love and Beauty\", a flower power song written and sung by Pinder, and his only Moodies A-side after 1966. Pinder introduced the Mellotron to his friend John Lennon. The Beatles subsequently used the instrument on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nPinder's \"Dawn (Is A Feeling)\" – with lead vocals by Hayward, and Pinder singing the bridge section – began the \"Days of Future Passed\" album, on which Pinder also contributed \"The Sun Set\" and narrated drummer Edge's opening and closing poems, \"Morning Glory\" and \"Late Lament\".\n\nPinder, along with Moodies recording engineer Derek Varnals and longtime producer Tony Clarke (a Decca staff producer assigned to them from \"Fly Me High\" onwards) managed to devise an innovative way of playing and recording the unwieldy Mellotron to make the sound flow in symphonic waves, as opposed to the sharp cutoff the instrument normally gave. This symphonic sound would characterise most of what later were seen as the Moodies' seven major albums between 1967 and 1972.\nPinder was one of the first musicians to use the Mellotron in live performance, relying on the mechanical skills he had gained from his time with Streetly to keep the unreliable instrument in working order. Typical of his travails was the Moodies' first US concert. When the band struck their first harmony, the back of the Mellotron fell open and all of the tape strips cascaded out. Pinder grabbed his tool box and got the instrument back into working order in 20 minutes' time, while the light crew entertained the audience by projecting cartoons.\n\nIn addition to the mellotron, organ and piano, Pinder also played harpsichord, Moog synthesizer, tablas, various forms of keyboards and percussion, autoharp, tambura and both acoustic and electric guitars on Moody Blues recordings from 1967 onwards, as well as providing key vocal harmonies and lead vocals from 1964 to 1978. Pinder also acted as the group's main musical arranger up to 1978.\n\nThe 1969 concert on the \"Caught Live + 5\" album and the \"Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970\" DVD show Pinder and Thomas acting as the group's onstage spokesmen.\n\nPinder wrote and sang several of the Moodies' more progressive, even mystic numbers, including \"(Thinking is) The Best Way To Travel\" and \"Om\" (both from 1968's \"In Search of the Lost Chord\"), plus the innovative symphonic rock piece \"Have You Heard/The Voyage/Have You Heard (part two)\" which concluded their 1969 album \"On the Threshold of a Dream\". Parts of this track later featured on the Loving Awareness jingles on Radio Caroline during the 1970s. Pinder also continued to narrate Edge's poems, notably \"The Word\" (1968); \"In The Beginning\" (with Edge himself and Hayward) and \"The Dream\" (both 1969); and \"The Balance\" (1970).\n\nOn Edge's \"Higher And Higher\" (1969) Pinder's Mellotron simulated the sound of a rocket blasting off to open the \"To Our Children's Children's Children\" album, to which he wrote and sang \"Sun is Still Shining\" and a rare co-written song (with John Lodge), \"Out and In\", on which he also sang lead vocals. Pinder's Mellotron stands out particularly on tracks such as Edge's instrumental \"Beyond\" and the Hayward–Thomas closing track \"Watching And Waiting\".\n\nPinder's earlier non-album song \"A Simple Game\" (1968), for which he won an Ivor Novello Award, was used as the B-side of their UK hit single \"Ride My See Saw\" from the \"In Search of the Lost Chord\" album on Deram; both this song and Pinder's \"On The Threshold of A Dream\" song \"So Deep Within You\" (1969) were both later successfully covered by The Four Tops.\n\nOn 12 October 1968 The Moodies had also cut a then unissued version of \"A Simple Game\", featuring Hayward on lead vocal, considering the song as a potential UK single which never materialised. The version sung by Pinder was used instead. The rare 'Hayward' version later appeared as a bonus track on the remastered CD version of \"In Search of the Lost Chord\", issued in 2006.\n\nPinder's 1970 album track \"Melancholy Man\" (from \"A Question of Balance\") became a No.1 hit as an overseas single in France that year. Pinder's \"How is it (We Are Here)\" was his other song contribution (a working title; \"Mike's Number One\" from the album sessions has since surfaced as a later CD release). All three songs had him singing lead vocals, as was usually the case with his compositions.\n\nPinder's composition and lead vocal \"My Song\", a deep, reflective atmospheric item, concluded the Moodies' 1971 album \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\", on which he also took co-credit with the entire band for the unusual opening track \"Procession\" (an attempt aurally to depict the evolution of vocal and musical harmony through time). He also sang a featured co-lead vocal and solo spot along with Hayward, Lodge and Thomas on Edge's song \"After You Came\".\n\nAlso in 1971 Pinder guested on John Lennon's \"Imagine\" album on the songs \"I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier (I Don't Wanna Die)\" and \"Jealous Guy\", playing tambourine rather than the mellotron he intended to play, because by Pinder's account the tapes in Lennon's mellotron looked like \"a bowl of spaghetti\", hence the switch to tambourine.\n\nIn 1972 the Moodies, then at the height of their popularity, retreated to Mike Pinder's home studio to record \"Seventh Sojourn\", which included two Pinder-penned and -sung contributions: \"Lost in a Lost World\", and \"When You're A Free Man\", dedicated to Timothy Leary. However, Pinder switched to the similar-sounding but less-troublesome Chamberlin for this album.\n\nThe Moody Blues took a break from recording in 1974, and Pinder relocated to California, releasing a solo album \"The Promise\" in 1976 through the Moodies' Threshold label.\n\nIn 1977 the band returned to recording and performing; Pinder declined full participation, although he collaborated on the 1978 release \"Octave\" by recording an unused \"Promise\"-era song \"One Step Into the Light\" with the band. He also added some synthesizer and backing vocals to the album, notably the album intro to Lodge's \"Steppin' in a Slide Zone\" and the instrumental climax on Edge's \"I'll Be Level with You\"; he then stopped coming to the sessions when interpersonal conflicts (mostly with Edge) arose. During this time, Pinder was also in a new relationship resulting in marriage and children, thus he preferred not to tour with the band at the time. As a result, the band hired Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz, formerly of Yes, in his place.\n\nPinder took employment as a consultant to the Atari computer corporation (primarily working on music synthesis), remarried, and started a family in Grass Valley, California. He remained out of the public eye until the mid-1990s, when he began to grant interviews and work on new recording projects. The year 1994 saw the release of his second solo album, \"Among the Stars\", on his own One Step label, to limited success. Another One Step release, \"A Planet With One Mind\" (1995), capitalised on Pinder's experience as chief reciter of Graeme Edge's poetry on the seminal Moody Blues albums; in this recording, Pinder reads seven children's stories from different world cultures, accompanied by appropriate world music. As his first spoken word album, it was well received among its contemporaries in the genre – it was a finalist for the Benjamin Franklin Award for Excellence in Audio as an outstanding children's recording.\n\nPinder has continued to work in the studio on his own and others' projects, and in developing new artists and nurturing the creative process. \n\nPinder's first marriage was to Donna, with whom he had his eldest son Daniel, but the marriage ended in divorce. Pinder then married an American, Tara Lee, with whom he had two sons Matt and Michael Lee. All three of his sons are musicians: his eldest, Daniel, is a film music editor and consultant, with many credits, including \"\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\". Matt and Michael Lee perform as The Pinder Brothers. They have two CDs, \"Jupiter Falls\" and \"Ordinary Man\". Several songs from both albums can be heard on their website and their Myspace page. Mike Pinder plays his trademark Mellotron on some of the songs.\n\nIn 2013 Justin Hayward spoke of Pinder's learning Transcendental Meditation in 1967, along with other members of the Moody Blues.\n\n\n\n"}

He became known by his name, which was addressed to the deity Seth.\n\nNefer-Setekh is known by his damaged tomb stele found at Helwan. This stela depicts Nefer-Setekh as a deceased sitting in front of an offering table, dressed in a very tight gown. He looks to the right, his name and title are carved in directly above his head. At the right side of the offering table the stele depicts and describes sacrificial food such as poultry, onions, lettuce and bread. Furthermore, the stela contains a list in tabular form, it provides the enumeration and description of precious clothes and fabrics such as canvas and yarn. The list also contains the enumeration and description of several sorts of fragrance oil and incense.\n\nNefer-Setekh's only preserved bureaucratic title is that of an \"wab-priest of the king\". Details about his family are unknown.\n\nNefer-Setekh's name means \"Seth is merciful\", since the hieroglyphic sign for \"Nefer\" (Gardiner sign F35) means \"kindly\" or \"merciful\" when connected to a certain deity. The name is of special interest for Egyptologists and Historians as well, because it is directly addressed to the deity Seth. This leads Egyptologists such as Toby Wilkinson and Christiana Köhler to a datation of Nefer-Setekh's lifetime into the late midst of the 2nd dynasty, when the deity Seth experienced special popularity. Other Egyptologists, such as Jochem Kahl and Katrin Scheele contradict this datation. The use of slab stelas with tabular lists including the enumeration of offering items is not archaeologically attested until the beginning of the 3rd dynasty and special signs for numbers such as used in Nefer-Setekh's stela were also not in use before that time.\n"}
{"id": "495248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=495248", "title": "Ostiarius", "text": "Ostiarius\n\nAn ostiarius, a Latin word sometimes anglicized as ostiary but often literally translated as porter or doorman, originally was a servant or guard posted at the entrance of a building. See also gatekeeper.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, this \"porter\" became the lowest of the four minor orders prescribed by the Council of Trent. This was the first order a seminarian was admitted to after receiving the tonsure. The porter had in ancient times the duty of opening and closing the church-door and of guarding the church; especially of ensuring no unbaptised persons would enter during the Eucharist. Later on, the Porter would also guard, open and close the doors of the Sacristy, Baptistry and elsewhere in the church.\n\nThe porter was not a part of Holy Orders administering sacraments but simply a preparatory job on the way to the Major orders: subdiaconate (until its suppression, after the Second Vatican Council by Pope Paul VI), diaconate and the priesthood. Like the other minor orders and the subdiaconate, it is retained in societies such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter.\n\nPorter denoted among the Romans the slave whose duty it was to guard the entrance of the house. In the Roman period all houses of the upper classes had an ostiarius, or ostiary, whose duties were considered very inferior. A basilica originally served as a Roman court of law, and it was the duty of the ostiarius to regulate the approach of litigants to the judge.\n\nWhen, from the end of the second century, the Christian communities began to own houses for holding church services and for purposes of administration, church ostiaries are soon mentioned, at least for the larger cities. They are first referred to in the letter of Pope Cornelius to Bishop Fabius of Antioch written in 251, where it is said that there were then at Rome 46 priests, 7 deacons, 7 subdeacons, 42 acolytes, and 52 exorcists, lectors, and ostiaries, or doorkeepers. According to the statement of the \"Liber Pontificalis\", an ostiary named Romanus suffered martyrdom in 258 at the same time as St. Lawrence.\n\nIn Western Europe the office of the ostiary was the lowest grade of the minor clergy. In a law of 377 of the \"Codex Theodosianus\" intended for the Vicariate of Italy, the ostiaries are also mentioned among the clergy who have a right to personal immunity. In his letter of 11 March 494, to the bishops of southern Italy and Sicily, Pope Gelasius says that for admission into the clergy it was necessary that the candidate could read (must, therefore, have a certain amount of education), for without this prerequisite an applicant could, at the most, only fill the office of an ostiary.\n\nIn Rome itself this office attained to no particular development, as a large part of these duties, namely the actual work necessary in the church building, what is now probably the duty of the sexton, was at Rome performed by the mansionarii. The clergy of the three lower grades (minor orders) were united at Rome into the \"Schola cantorum\" (choir) and as such took part in the church ceremonies. There are no special prayers or ceremonies for the ordination of the lower clergy in the oldest liturgical books of the Roman Church.\n\nFor the Gallican Rite, short statements concerning the ordination of the lower orders, among them that of the ostiaries, are found in the \"Statuta ecclesiæ antiqua\" a collection of canons which appeared at Arles about the beginning of the sixth century. The \"Sacramentarium Gelasianum\" and the \"Missale Francorum\" contain the same rite with the prayers used on this occasion.\n\nAccording to these the ostiaries are first instructed in their duties by the archdeacon; after this he brings them before the bishop who takes the keys of the church from the altar and hands them to the candidate for ordination with the words: \"Fulfil thine office to show that thou knowest that thou wilt give account to God concerning the things that are locked away under these keys.\" Then follows a prayer for the candidate and a prayer for the occasion that the bishop pronounces over him. This ceremony was also at a later date adopted by the Roman Church in its liturgy.\n\nIn Latin Western Europe, outside of Rome, in the late Roman era and the one following, the ostiaries were still actually employed as guardians of the church buildings and of their contents. This is shown by the epitaph of one Ursatius, an ostiary of Trier. An ostiary of the church of Salona is also mentioned in an epitaph. Later, however, in the Latin Church the office of ostiary universally remained only one of the degrees of ordination and the actual work of the ostiary was transferred to the laity (sacristans, sextons, etc.).\n\nIn the ordination of ostiaries their duties are thus enumerated in the Pontifical: \"Percutere cymbalum et campanam, aperire ecclesiam et sacrarium, et librum ei aperire qui prædicat\" (to ring the bell, to open the church and sacristy, to open the book for the preacher). The forms of prayer for the ordination are similar to those in the old Gallican Rite.\n\nIn the East there were also doorkeepers in the service of the Church. They are enumerated as ecclesiastical persons by the Council of Laodicea (c. 343-81). Like the acolytes and exorcists, they were only appointed to serve the church, but received no actual ordination and were not regarded as belonging to the ecclesiastical hierarchy. According to the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" belonging to the end of the fourth century the guarding of the door of the church during the service was the duty of the deacons and subdeacons. Thus the doorkeepers exercised their office only when service was not being held.\n\nThe minor order no longer exists officially in the Eastern Catholic Churches and was abolished in the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Paul VI in his apostolic letter, \"Ministeria quaedam\" of August 15, 1972.\n\n"}
{"id": "52878356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52878356", "title": "Patricia Stallings", "text": "Patricia Stallings\n\nPatricia Stallings (born 1964 or 1965) is an American woman who was wrongfully convicted of murder after the death of her son Ryan on September 7, 1989. Because testing seemed to indicate an elevated level of ethylene glycol in Ryan's blood, authorities suspected antifreeze poisoning and they arrested Patricia Stallings the next day. She was convicted of murder in early 1991 and sentenced to life in prison. \n\nAfter she went to prison, Stallings gave birth to another child; he was diagnosed with methylmalonic acidemia, a medical condition that can mimic antifreeze poisoning. Prosecutors initially did not believe that the sibling's diagnosis had anything to do with Ryan's case, but experts testified that Ryan had also died of MMA. Stallings was released from prison in July 1991 and prosecutors decided to close the case two months later. Stallings later sued the hospital and laboratories that were involved in Ryan's care and reached an out-of-court settlement.\n\nStallings lived in St. Louis and was a convenience store clerk in the mid-1980s. David Stallings frequently came into her store and they began to date in 1986. They got married in 1988. Their first son, Ryan, was born in April 1989. Patricia took Ryan to Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in early July 1989. He was experiencing vomiting and difficulty breathing, and he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.\n\nNoting a high level of what they then believed to be ethylene glycol in the baby's blood, physicians suspected that the boy had been poisoned with antifreeze. The infant was placed in protective custody. On August 31 of that year, Stallings was allowed a short visit with her son. Ryan's illness seemed to recur 4 days after the visit, and Stallings was arrested on assault charges on September 5. Ryan was treated for ethylene glycol poisoning but Ryan died two days later. The charges were revised to first-degree murder.\n\nWhile she was in jail awaiting trial, Stallings gave birth to another son, David Jr., on February 17, 1990. He was placed in foster care, but in March, he developed similar symptoms as those that had affected Ryan. He was diagnosed with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a genetic condition in which the body produces propionic acid, a compound that differs from ethylene glycol by one carbon atom. David Jr. recovered and was placed in foster care. \n\nDuring the investigation and ensuing trial, Stallings's defense attorney wanted to introduce the theory that Ryan had died of MMA, but the prosecutor, George B. McElroy, considered the sibling's diagnosis irrelevant to Ryan's death and the judge, Gary Kramer, would not allow him to advance the theory without any evidence that Ryan was actually affected by MMA. Stallings wanted her attorney to call character witnesses to testify on her behalf, but he did not do so. She was convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence.\n\nIn May of 1990, defense attorney Eric Rathbone obtained copies of notes which later determined to have been written by assistant prosecutor John S. Appelbaum. The notes indicated that the doctor who pronounced Ryan dead had considered the possibility of an MMA diagnosis, but also that he had not tested Ryan for it at the time. After the discovery of the note, prosecutors said that they believed that there were important differences between ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, and they said that even if Ryan had had MMA, they thought that he had also been poisoned.\n\nThe Stallings case was featured on the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" television program, and biochemist William Sly of Saint Louis University saw the episode. He agreed to test Ryan's blood, and gave it to Dr. James Shoemaker, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Metabolic Screening Lab at St Louis University. Dr. Shoemaker immediately confirmed that Ryan had had MMA. However, ethylene glycol is not a human metabolite, even in cases of MMA, and Patricia Stallings went to trial with no explanation linking MMA to ethylene glycol. Much later, after the case was featured on \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" Dr. Shoemaker asked prosecutor George McElroy for the methods that had been used to measure ethylene glycol in Ryan's blood, and McElroy supplied that information. When the method was used on blood from Ryan and DJ, it was seen that propionic acid, which \"is\" produced in methylmalonic acidemia, caused a result that careless observers might mistake for ethylene glycol. (ref. 14, below) Dr. Shoemaker then sent samples of propionate-spiked blood to several laboratories, who tested it with the same methods used in the Stallings case. Some of the laboratories came to the incorrect conclusion that the blood reflected ethylene glycol poisoning. At Sly's and Shoemaker's request, Piero Rinaldo of Yale University also looked at the case and concluded that Ryan had died of MMA. His testimony helped to convince McElroy that Ryan might not have been poisoned.\n\nIn July of 1991, Stallings was released from jail pending a new trial. She was placed on house arrest. In September of 1991, prosecutors apologized to Stallings and dropped the case against her. Stallings said that she lost a lot of weight due to the stress of being imprisoned. She said that her Buddhist faith helped to keep her strong during that time.\n\nStallings won a settlement against Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital and the laboratory that tested Ryan's blood. She later said that the perception of her case may have been influenced by the case of Paula Sims, which had unfolded around the same time. In that case, a mother had been tried and convicted of killing her two daughters, and there was considerable public outcry over the murders. \n\nIn 1994, McElroy ran for reelection as Jefferson County prosecutor, and Stallings donated $10,000 to his opponent, Robert Wilkins. Wilkins won the race. When McElroy offered to show Wilkins his information on the Stallings case, Stallings found out and asked a court to have her arrest record expunged. Some of the information was ordered to be expunged, but a judge said that Missouri law mandated that prosecutors confidentially maintain some of the information related to felony arrests.\n\nThe Stallings case continues to be cited as an extreme case of a metabolic disorder that mimics a criminal act.\n\nPatricia's son, David P. \"D.J.\" Stallings, Jr., died on September 17, 2013, at the age of 23.\n\n\n14.

{"id": "12524350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12524350", "title": "Philosophy and religion of the Tlingit", "text": "Philosophy and religion of the Tlingit\n\nThe philosophy and religion of the Tlingit, although never formally codified, was historically a fairly well organized philosophical and religious system whose basic axioms shaped the way all Tlingit people viewed and interacted with the world around them. Between 1886 and 1895, in the face of their shamans' inability to treat Old World diseases including smallpox, many Tlingit people converted to Orthodox Christianity. It has been argued that they saw Eastern Orthodox Christianity as a way of resisting assimilation to the \"American way of life\", which was associated with Presbyterianism. Russian Orthodox missionaries had translated their liturgy into the Tlingit language. After Christianization, the Tlingit belief system began to erode.\n\nToday, some young Tlingits look back towards what their traditional tribal religions and worldview for inspiration, security, and a sense of identity. While many elders converted, contemporary Tlingit \"reconcile Christianity and the 'traditional culture.'\"\n\nThe Tlingit see the world as a system of dichotomies. The most obvious is the division between the light water and the dark forest which surrounds their daily lives in the Tlingit homeland.\n\nWater serves as a primary means of transportation, and as a source of most Tlingit foods. Its surface is flat and broad, and most dangers on the water are readily perceived by the naked eye. Light reflects brightly off the sea, and it is one of the first things that a person in Southeast Alaska sees when they look outside. Like all things, danger lurks beneath its surface, but these dangers are for the most part easily avoided with some caution and planning. For such reasons it is considered a relatively safe and reliable place, and thus represents the apparent forces of the Tlingit world.\n\nIn contrast, the dense and forbidding rainforest of Southeast Alaska is dark and misty in even the brightest summer weather. Untold dangers from bears, falling trees, dank muskeg, and the risk of being lost all make the forest a constantly dangerous place. Vision in the forest is poor, reliable landmarks are few, and food is scarce in comparison to the seashore. Entering the forest always means travelling uphill, often up the sides of steep mountains, and clear trails are rare to nonexistent. Thus the forest represents the hidden forces in the Tlingit world. \n\nAnother series of dichotomies in Tlingit thought are wet versus dry, heat versus cold, and hard versus soft. A wet, cold climate causes people to seek warm, dry shelter. The traditional Tlingit house, with its solid redcedar construction and blazing central fireplace, represented an ideal Tlingit conception of warmth, hardness, and dryness. Contrast the soggy forest floor that is covered with soft rotten trees and moist, squishy moss, both of which make for uncomfortable habitation. Three attributes that Tlingits value in a person are hardness, dryness, and heat. These can be perceived in many different ways, such as the hardness of strong bones or the hardness of a firm will; the heat given off by a healthy living man, or the heat of a passionate feeling; the dryness of clean skin and hair, or the sharp dry scent of cedar.\n\nThe Tlingit divide the living being into several components:\n\nThe physical components are those that have no proper life after death. The skin is viewed as the covering around the insides of the body, which are divided roughly into bones and flesh. The flesh decays quickly, and in most cases has little spiritual value, but the bones form an essential part of the Tlingit spiritual belief system. Bones are the hard and dry remains of something which has died, and thus are the physical reminder of that being after its death. In the case of animals, it is essential that the bones be properly handled and disposed, since mishandling may displease the spirit of the animal and may prevent it from being reincarnated. The reason for the spirit's displeasure is rather obvious, since a salmon who was resurrected without a jaw or tail would certainly refuse to run again in the stream where it had died.\n\nThe significant bones in a human body are the backbone and the eight \"long bones\" of the limbs. The eight long bones are emphasized because that number has spiritual significance in Tlingit culture. The bones of a cremated body must be collected and placed with those of the person's clan ancestors, or else the person's spirit might be disadvantaged or displeased in the afterlife, which could cause repercussions if the ghost decided to haunt people or if the person was reincarnated.\n\nThe source of living can be found in \"xh'aséikw\", the essence of life. This bears some resemblance to the Chinese concept of qi as a metaphysical energy without which a thing is not alive; however in Tlingit thought this can be equated to the breath as well. For example, the shaman's simplest test for whether a person is alive is to hold a downy feather above the mouth or nose; if the feather is disturbed then the person is breathing and thus alive, even if the breath is not audible or sensible. This then implies that the person still maintains \"xh'aséikw\".\n\nThe feelings and thoughts of a person are encompassed by the \"khaa toowú\". This is a very basic idea in Tlingit culture. When a Tlingit references their mind or feelings, he always discusses this in terms of \"axh toowú\", \"my mind\". Thus \"Axh toowú yanéekw\", \"I am sad\", literally \"My mind is pained\".\n\nBoth \"xh'aséikw\" and \"khaa toowú\" are mortal, and cease to exist upon the death of a being. However, the \"khaa yahaayí\" and \"khaa yakghwahéiyagu\" are immortal and persist in various forms after death. The idea of \"khaa yahaayí\" is that it is the person's essence, shadow, or reflection. It can even refer to the appearance of a person in a photograph or painting, and is metaphorically used to refer to the behavior or appearance of a person as other than what he is or should be.\n\nHeat, dryness, and hardness are all represented as parts of the Tlingit practice of cremation. The body is burned, removing all water under great heat, and leaving behind only the hard bones. The soul goes on to be near the heat of the great bonfire in the house in the spirit world, unless it is not cremated in which case it is relegated to a place near the door with the cold winds. The hardest part of the spirit, the most physical part, is reincarnated into a clan descendant.\n\nThe shaman is called ixht'. He was the healer, and the one who foretold the future. He was called upon to heal the sick, drive out those who practiced witchcraft, and tell the future.\n\nIt is a mis-nomer to call him \"witch doctor\" as the practices of the ixht' and the \"witch\" are completely different and they were at odds with each other. To call one a medicine man is not correct either as \"medicine master\" is naak'w s'aati, which is the Tlingit term for a witch.\n\nThe name of the ixht' and his songs and stories of his visions are the property of the clan he belongs to. He would seek spirit helpers from various animals and after fasting for four days when the animal would 'stand up in front of him' before entering him he would obtain the spirit. The tongue of the animal would be cut out and added to his collection of spirit helpers. This is why he was referred to by some as \"the spirit man\".\n\nFuture shamans would be chosen before their birth by the elders of a Tlingit community. The elders knew about people and what they would be before they were born. The boy training to become a shaman would be told how to approach the grave and how to handle the objects. Touching shaman objects was strictly forbidden except to a shaman and his helpers. In fact, the elders had a word solely for the instance when a child tried to touch or play with a shaman's objects. The word carried a heavy tone and that was all that needed to be said.\n\nAll shamans are gone from the Tlingit today and their practices will likely never be revived, although shaman spirit songs are still done in their ceremonies, and their stories re-told at those times.\n\nThe Kushtaka (kû'cta-qa) are the dreaded and feared Land Otter People, human from the waist up, and otter-like below. Land otters are excellent fishers. Those who are drowned often marry (and become) land otters, and land otters can assist in drownings. Land otters are sinister and potentially harmful. When properly controlled, however, the land otter can be of great help to humans, such as fishermen who penetrate the sacred realm beyond social boundaries. Those drowned and married to land otters (and their land otter children) can return to their human relations and assist them, usually by helping them catch abundant supplies of seafood. The land otters can only eat raw food, for if they eat cooked fish they will die; and as supernatural beings, after being out on the water they must regain land and find shelter before the raven calls or they will die.\n\nThose that drown and are saved by the Kushtaka are known as Kushtakakhaa. They live with the Kushtaka, but because they were once human, they travel back to their old communities now and again. Except now, as Kushtakakhaa, they have the power to sway people's minds and shape shift.\n\nIt is impossible for any of the information on this page to be taken literally for the fact that so much is lost in converting the Tlingit culture to English words. Meaning is lost in language conversion, especially between two so very different languages such as these as opposed to, say, the closer related tongues of French and Spanish.\n\n"}
{"id": "1993094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993094", "title": "Precentor", "text": "Precentor\n\nA precentor is a person who helps facilitate worship. The details vary depending on the religion, denomination, and era in question. The Latin derivation is \"præcentor\", from cantor, meaning \"the one who sings before\" (or alternatively, \"first singer\").\n\nThe chief precentor was the highest position in many ancient Mesopotamian cities (see Music of Mesopotamia).\n\nJewish precentors are song or prayer leaders, leading synagogue music. A Jewish precentor is typically called a hazzan or cantor. In the Middle Ages, women precentors leading prayers in the \"weibershul\" (women's gallery) were known as firzogerin, vorsangerin, foreleiner, zugerin, or zugerke.\n\nA precentor is a member of a church who helps facilitate worship. The role of precentor was carried over from the synagogues into the early church.\n\nThe term \"precentor\" described sometimes an ecclesiastical dignitary, sometimes an administrative or ceremonial officer. Anciently, the precentor had various duties: he was the first or leading chanter, who on Sundays and greater feasts intoned certain antiphons, psalms, hymns, responsories etc.; gave the pitch or tone to the bishop and dean at Mass (the succentor performing a similar office to the canons and clerks); recruited and taught the choir, directed its rehearsals and supervised its official functions; interpreted the rubrics and explained the ceremonies, ordered in a general way the Divine Office and sometimes composed desired hymns, sequences, and lessons of saints. He was variously styled \"capiscol\" (from the Latin \"caput scholæ\", head of the choir-school), \"prior scholæ\", \"magister scholæ\", and \"primicerius\" (a word of widely different implications). Victor of St. Hugo tells us that in the care of the primicerius were placed the acolytes, exorcists, lectors, and psalmists (chanters).\n\nIn the Middle Ages the principal dignitaries of cathedral, collegiate chapters, and monastic orders, imitated the example of St. Gregory the Great in acting as directors of chant-schools. The schola was always in attendance when the bishop officiated in his cathedral, and to the precentor was assigned a place near the bishop and high in dignity. His office was obviously one demanding much learning and executive ability, and his dignity corresponded with his duties.\n\nIn the cathedrals of England, France, Spain, and Germany, he ranked sometimes next to the dean, sometimes next to the archdeacon. In some instances his sphere of activity was much broader, including the duty of installing deans, canons, and other dignitaries; and in some monasteries, the duties of librarian and registrar. But from the fourteenth century his title and dignity were largely handed over to incumbents whose musical knowledge did not fit them for the duties to which the name of precentor owed its origin; the dignities remained, but the duties became obscured. \"In France, some chapters retain traces of the dignity of Precentor, and one may see sometimes an archdeacon, sometimes a titular or honorary canon, carrying the baton cantoral, the insignia of his office\". This \"baton cantoral\" is a silver or white staff. \"In the dioceses of Aix, Carcassonne, Coutances, Dijon, Metz, Orléans, the dignity of Precentor is still the highest in the chapter... Some chapters have sub-chanters, those of Arras being among the honorary resident canons\", where also the quoted statutes of the Bishop of Dijon may serve to illustrate the modern idea of the office of precentor: \"The Précenteur or Grand Chantre is the head of the choir and ... brings the antiphon to the bishop when officiating pontifically. Sacristans, chanters, choir-boys, and employés of the Cathedral are placed under his surveillance. He will also preserve order and silence in the sacristy\").\n\nA precentor is a person, usually a clergy member, who is in charge of preparing worship services. This position is usually held in a large church. Most cathedrals have a precentor in charge of the organisation of liturgy and worship. The precentor of a cathedral is usually a residentiary canon or prebendary, and may be assisted by a succentor (particularly in the daily task of leading choral singing). In some cathedrals (including Canterbury), the Precentor is a minor Canon, and therefore part of the Foundation, but not part of the Chapter.\n\nTraditionally the precentor's stall (seat) in the cathedral is on the opposite side of the Quire from that of the Dean, leading to the traditional division of the singers into Decani (the Dean's side) and Cantoris (the precentor's side).\n\nIn Presbyterian churches that worship in the historical fashion (i.e., sing a cappella; see Presbyterian worship), a precentor is a person (man or woman, not necessarily clergy) who leads the singing, often by means of conducting techniques, but sometimes just by singing from amongst the congregation.\n\nChurches that use a repeat-after-me manner of singing called lining out (used primarily when sufficient numbers of psalm books are unavailable, or the congregation insufficiently literate, as was the case in the black church in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird) are usually led by the precentor, much as with other non-instrumental churches.\n\nThe word \"precentor\" is also used at two English public schools, Radley College and Eton College, to refer to the Head of Music. These school precentors have no specific religious duties although, as part of their musical function, they may conduct the college chapel choir. At Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the precentor's main responsibility is as director of the college choir, which provides music for chapel services.\n\n"}

In Theravada Buddhism, as part of daily practice, one typically prostrates before and after chanting and meditation. On these occasions, one typically prostrates three times: once to the Buddha, once to the Dhamma, and once to the Sangha. More generally, one can also prostrate before \"any sacred object of veneration.\"\n\nTheravada Buddhists execute a type of prostration that is known as \"five-point veneration\" (Pali: \"patitthitapanca\") or the \"five-limbed prostration\" (Pali: \"pañc'anga-vandana\") where the two palms and elbows, two sets of toes and knees, and the forehead are placed on the floor. More specifically:\n\nIn Myanmar (Burma), prostrations are accompanied by the common Buddhist prayer, known as okāsa.\n\nIn Thailand, traditionally, each of the three aforementioned prostrations are accompanied by the following Pali verses:\nIn Theravadin countries such as Sri Lanka, when one goes before one's teacher, in order to \"open one's mind up to receive instructions,\" one bows and recites the phrase, \"Okāsa ahaṃ bhante vandāmi\" (\"I pay homage to you venerable sir\").\n\nIn Zen Buddhism, both half- and full-prostrations are used. Zen master Robert Aitken writes:\nRoshi Philip Kapleau writes:\nZen master Huang Po, of the 9th century, is said to have done prostrations so intensely that he wore a permanent red mark on his forehead.\n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism, prostrations are often performed before meditation or teachings, but can form a separate practice by itself. Prostrations are seen as a means of purifying one's body, speech and mind of karmic defilements, especially pride. Prostrations are used in tandem with visualization and can be used to express reverence to Guru Rinpoche and others.\n\nFor example, in the context of offering homage to Guru Rinpoche, prostrations are to be performed as follows:\n\nThis type of prostration is often done 3, 7, 21, or 108 times. A prostration mala can be used to facilitate counting.\n\nThis form of prostration is used with enlightened beings other than Guru Rinpoche as well.\n\nProstrations done in large numbers (like 100,000) can be part of the preliminary practices to the practice of tantra. Other practices like this can be reciting the Refuge prayer, mandala offerings, Vajrasattva mantras and other practices called ngöndro.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4748941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4748941", "title": "Religion in Carthage", "text": "Religion in Carthage\n\nThe religion of Carthage in North Africa was a direct continuation of the Phoenician variety of the polytheistic ancient Canaanite religion with significant local modifications. Controversy prevails regarding the possible existence and practice of propitiatory child sacrifice in the religion of Carthage. However, a recent study of archeological evidence confirms this ritual.\n\nCarthage derived the original core of its religion from Phoenicia. The Phoenician pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon. The system of gods and goddesses in Phoenician religion also influenced many other cultures.\n\nThe supreme divine couple was that of Tanit and Baal Hammon. The goddess Astarte seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of ancient Rome, \nancient Greece, Ancient Egypt and the Etruscan civilization.\n\nSurviving Punic texts portray an organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions for a variety of prices. Priests were cleanshaven, unlike most other people. In the first centuries of the city, ritual celebrations included rhythmic dancing, derived from Phoenician traditions.\n\nCippi and steles of limestone are characteristic monuments of the art and religion of the Punics and are found throughout the western Phoenician colonial world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. The majority were set up over urns containing the ashes of sacrifices which had been placed within open-air sanctuaries. Some Carthaginian votive steles (several in Egyptian style) display a priest carrying a child; at least one has been interpreted as a living child for sacrifice. The identification of this child as living has been questioned.\n\nOne of the most important stelae is the Marseilles Tariff, found in the port of Marseille but originally from the temple of Baal-Saphon in Carthage. The tariff regulated the payments to the priests for performing sacrifices and described the nature of the victims. All victims are male animals, and females are not mentioned. Porphyry (philosopher), De Abst. 2.11, states that the Phoenicians did not sacrifice or eat females.\n\nMost archaeologists supposed that infant sacrifices occurred. Lawrence E. Stager, who directed the excavations of the Carthage Tophet in the 1970s, initially believed that infant sacrifice was practiced there, and his early opinion influenced later historians. Paolo Xella of the National Research Council in Rome summarized the textual, epigraphical, and archaeological evidence for Carthaginian infant sacrifice. Some modern scholars - and currently Lawrence E. Stager himself - argue that evidence of Carthaginian child sacrifice is sketchy at best and that these reports are more likely to have been a Roman libel against the Carthaginians to justify their conquest and destruction.\n\nAccounts of child sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible have been compared with similar ones from Greek and Latin sources, speaking of the offering of children by fire as sacrifices in the city of Carthage. Plutarch (c. 46–120 CE) mentions the practice, as do Tertullian, Orosius, Diodorus Siculus and Philo. However, Livy and Polybius do not. Diodorus (c. 90-60 BCE) states:\n\nTertullian, about 200 CE, states that although the priests who sacrificed children had been crucified by a Roman procurator, \"that holy crime persists in secret\".\n\nCleitarchus, Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch all mention burning of children as an offering to Cronus or Saturn, that is to Bal Ammūn, the chief god of Carthage. According to Justin, the Carthaginians accepted the Persian Achaemenid Empire's instructions to stop sacrificing children (and eating dogs).\n\nSome of these sources suggest that babies were roasted to death on a heated bronze statue. According to Diodorus Siculus, \"There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.\" They placed their children alive in the arms of a bronze statue of the lady Tanit:\nAccording to Stager and Wolff, there is a consensus among scholars that Carthaginian children were sacrificed by their parents, who would make a vow to kill the next child if the gods would grant them a favor: for instance, their shipment of goods were to arrive safely in a foreign port.\n\nHowever, some historians have disputed that child sacrifice occurred, suggesting instead that the tophets were resting places for the cremated remains of children that died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was \"a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were \"offered\" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead\". The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make no mention of child sacrifice (very few mention religion at all).\n\nChild sacrifice may also have been overemphasized for effect; after the Romans finally defeated Carthage and totally destroyed the city, they engaged in postwar propaganda to make their archenemies seem cruel and less civilized.\n\n\"Tophet\" is a term derived from the Bible, used to refer to a site near Jerusalem in which Canaanites and Israelites sacrificed children. It is now used as a general term for all such sites with cremated human and animal remains. The Hebrew Bible does not specify that the Israelite victims were buried, only burned although the \"place of burning\" was probably adjacent to the place of burial. It is not at all known how the Phoenicians themselves referred to the places of burning or burial or to the practice itself.\n\nSeveral apparent \"Tophets\" have been identified, chiefly a large one in Carthage, dubbed the \"Tophet of Salammbô\" after the neighbourhood where it was unearthed in 1921. Soil in the Tophet of Salammbó was found to be full of olive wood charcoal, probably from the sacrificial pyres. It was the location of the temple of the goddess Tanit and the necropolis. Animal remains, mostly sheep and goats, found inside some of the Tophet urns strongly suggest that this was not a burial ground for children who died prematurely. The animals were sacrificed to the gods, presumably in place of children (one surviving inscription refers to the animal as \"a substitute\"). It is conjectured that the children unlucky enough not to have substitutes were also sacrificed and then buried in the Tophet. The remains include the bodies of both very young children and small animals, and those who argue in favor of child sacrifice have argued that if the animals were sacrificed, then so too were the children. The area covered by the Tophet in Carthage was probably over an acre and a half by the fourth century BCE, with nine different levels of burials. About 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BCE and 200 BCE, with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and 2-year-olds. These double remains have been interpreted to mean that in the cases of stillborn babies, the parents would sacrifice their youngest child.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between the frequency of deposition of child remains and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) sacrifices may have become more frequent, indicating an increased assiduousness in seeking divine appeasement or possibly a population-controlling response to the reduction of available food or perhaps increased child mortality from famine or disease.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the age of the buried children includes pre-natal individuals, stillbirths. It is also argued that the age distribution of remains at this site is consistent with the burial of children who died of natural causes, shortly before or after birth. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was \"a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were \"offered\" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead\". He adds that this was probably part of \"an effort to ensure the benevolent protection of the same deities for the survivors.\" However, that analysis is disputed; Patricia Smith and colleagues from the Hebrew University and Harvard University show from the teeth and skeletal analysis at the Carthage Tophet that infant ages at death (about two months) do not correlate with the expected ages of natural mortality (perinatal).\n\nSites within Carthage and other Phoenician centres such as Motya, near Sicily, revealed the remains of male children under the age of five. There was no evidence of disease in the bones that survived cremation. Tophets have been also found in Sardinia at Sulci, Nora, Monte Sirai, Tharros and Bithia.\n\n\n"}

Two of the chambers (Alpha and Gamma) are decorated and depict very similar scenes: in the Alpha chamber Akhenaten and Nefertiti bend over the inert body of a woman, weeping and gripping each other's arms for support. Nearby a nurse stands with a baby in her arms, accompanied by a fan-bearer, which indicates the baby's royal status. The names in the scene have been hacked out. In the Gamma chamber a very similar scene is shown; here the hieroglyphs identify the dead young woman as Meketaten. In the same chamber another scene shows Meketaten standing under a canopy which is usually associated with childbirth but can also interpreted as representing the rebirth of the princess. In front of her, amongst courtiers, stand Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their three remaining daughters, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit.

{"id": "594857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=594857", "title": "Sanctification", "text": "Sanctification\n\nSanctification is the act or process of acquiring sanctity, of being made or becoming holy. It is a gift given through the power of God to a person or thing which is then considered sacred or set apart in an official capacity within the religion. In general anything from a temple, to vessels, to days of the week, to a human believer who willingly accepts this gift can be sanctified. To sanctify is to literally \"set apart for particular use in a special purpose or work and to make holy or sacred.\" Etymologically, \"sanctify\" derives from the Latin verb \"sanctificare\" which in turn derives from \"sanctus\" \"holy\" and \"facere\" \"to make\".\n\nIn the various branches of Christianity sanctification usually refers to a \"person\" becoming holy, with the details differing in different branches.\n\nA 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that “there is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies”. A glossary of the Episcopal Church (USA) gives some teaching: “Anglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God's work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life.” Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception.\n\nThe 16th century Anglican Theologian Richard Hooker (1554-1600) distinguished between the “righteousness of justification” that is imputed by God and the “righteousness of sanctification” that comprises the works one does as an “inevitable” result of being justified.\n\nJeremy Taylor (1613-1667) argued that justification and sanctification cannot be separated; they are “two steps in a long process”.\n\nA 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are “inseparable”. However, they are not the same thing. Justification is “found in Christ’s work alone”. “Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, and is a progressive work.”\n\nCalvinist and Evangelical theologians interpret sanctification as the process of being made holy only through the merits and justification of Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit that are then reflected in man. Sanctification cannot be attained by any works-based process, but only through the works and power of the divine. When a man is unregenerate, it is his essence that sins and does evil. But when a man is justified through Christ, it is no longer the man (in his essence) that sins, but the man is acting outside of his character. In other words, the man is not being himself, he is not being true to who he is.\n\nOrthodox Christianity teaches the doctrine of theosis, whereby humans take on divine properties. A key scripture supporting this is . In the 4th century, Athanasius taught that God became Man that Man might become God.\nEssentially, Man does not become divine, but in Christ can partake of divine nature. This Church's version of salvation restores God's image in man.\nOne such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world.\n\nMartin Luther, the founder of Lutheranism, taught in his Large Catechism that Sanctification is only caused by the Holy Spirit through the powerful Word of God. The Holy Spirit uses churches to gather Christians together for the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.\n\nPietistic Lutheranism heavily emphasizes the \"biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living, or sanctification.\"\n\nIn Wesleyan-Arminian theology, which is upheld by the Methodist Church as well as by Holiness Churches, \"sanctification, the beginning of holiness, begins at the new birth\". With the Grace of God, Methodists \"do works of piety and mercy, and these works reflect the power of sanctification\". Examples of these means of grace (works of piety and works of mercy) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the sacrament of Holy Communion (work of piety), and visiting the sick and those in prison (work of mercy). Wesleyan covenant theology also emphasizes that an important aspect of sanctification is the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. As such, in \"sanctification one grows to be more like Christ.\" This process of sanctification that begins at the new birth (first work of grace) has its goal as Christian perfection, also known as entire sanctification (second work of grace), which John Wesley, the progenitor of the Methodist faith, described as a heart \"habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor\" and as \"having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked\". This is the doctrine that by the power of God's sanctifying grace and attention upon the means of grace may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of original sin in this life. It is expounded upon in the Methodist Articles of Religion: \n\nJustification is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God's holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it. A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14: \"Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.\" The Wesleyan Church (formerly known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church) states that sanctification has three components—initial, progressive, and entire:\n\nJohn Wesley taught that outward holiness in the form of \"right words and right actions\" should reflect the inner transformation experienced through the second work of grace.\n\nThe Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification, teaching that:\nAccording to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" \"sanctity\" differs for God, individual, and corporate body. For God, it is God's unique absolute moral perfection. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine gift. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church's holiness is beyond human power, beyond natural power.\n\nSanctity is regulated by established conventional standards.\n\nBeliefs about sanctification vary amongst the Christian denominations and movements, influenced by various Christian movements. These beliefs differ from each other on: whether sanctification is a definitive experience or process, when the process/experience takes place, and if entire sanctification is possible in this life.\n\nInfluenced by the Holiness movement some Pentecostal churches, such as the Church of God in Christ and the Apostolic Faith Church, believe that sanctification is a definitive act of God's grace and spiritual experience whereby we are made holy subsequent to salvation and prior to the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Reformed Churches are amongst denominations that teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion, and believers are required to \"do good works\" which are \"… all sanctified by (God’s) grace\". Similarly, non-Wesleyan Pentecostals such as Assemblies of God teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion and progressive sanctification after conversion. Converted believers are expected to \"make every effort to live a holy life… Even though Christians may not attain absolute perfection in this life.\" The event of entire sanctification occurs when Christ comes back and gives us glorified bodies.\n\nHigher Life movement and Brunstad Christian Church believe that sinless perfection is attainable in Christian life. Higher Life movement teaches that even though believers still have an inclination to sin after conversion, they must constantly rely on the Holy Spirit to struggle against this tendency, and therefore can attain sinless perfection in this life. Further, the movement proclaims that \"the secret of complete victory is faith: simply believing that Jesus has done and is doing all\". On the contrary, Brunstad Christian Church teaches that because Jesus, as a man, was tempted in all points as other human beings, yet never committed sin, he opened a way back to God, and therefore those who want to be disciples can follow on that same way. They proclaim that this means a Christian does not only receive the forgiveness of sins, but can also conquer all sinful tendencies in their own human nature.\n\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) sanctification is a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy, according to their repentance and righteous efforts, through the Savior Jesus Christ's matchless grace. To become Sanctified, or Holy, one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived, according to the teachings of Christ. One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy. In the scriptural canon of the LDS Church, one reference to sanctification appears in Helaman 3:35, in the Book of Mormon: Dallin H. Oaks, an LDS General authority and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has written to expand on the meaning of sanctity.\n\n"}

It is mentioned in the Bible by this name, and in other period sources as Shim'on. In late antiquity, it was known by the name Simonias (). The city is identified with the tell called Tell Samunia in Arabic, also written Samunieh. The tell rises 60 meters above its surroundings, north-east of moshav Nahalal, on the border between the Lower Galilee, and the Jezreel Valley. Today the tell in not settled, Timrat was established alongside, to the east.\n\nShimron was one of the Bronze Age fortified Canaanite cities that controlled the Jezreel Valley, possibly the largest of them. All of these cities were located at an entrance to the valley, and controlled one of the roads leading into it.\n\nIn the Amarna letters and the Execration texts, the city is referred to as \"Shim'on\". It is also mentioned as one of the cities that were attacked by Joshua (), and also as belonging to the Tribe of Zebulun ().\n\nIn the Hellenistic period, there was a large settlement at the foot of the tell, called \"Shimonia\" or \"Samunia\". The city was central during First Jewish–Roman War, and in 66 CE a battle occurred here between the Jewish rebels and the Romans, who besieged the city. Josephus, mentioning the village by name, states that he was attacked there at night by the Roman decurion, Æbutius, who had been entrusted with the charge of the Great Plain and who had one-hundred horse and two-hundred infantry at his disposal. The Roman soldiers, however, were forced to withdraw since their horses were of little use in that terrain (\"Life of Flavius Josephus\", § 24).\n\nThe name of the city occurs also elsewhere, in the Babylonian Talmud (Niddah 24b), and in the Middle Ages it is mentioned by Ishtori Haparchi (\"Kaftor wa-Feraḥ\", ch. xi, written in 1322).\n\nArtificial mounds, traces of ruins, and a sarcophagus have been found here.\n\nA map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed a village here, named \"Sammouni\". In 1838, Edward Robinson found here a small Arab village called \"Semunieh\", and he noted it again in 1852.\n\nIn 1867, a group of German Templers attempted to establish a settlement on the site, which failed due to malaria.\n\nIn 1875, Victor Guérin visited the place and noted:\n\n\"The present village has succeeded a small ancient city, now completely destroyed. East of the site which it occupied rises a round isolated hill, which commands the plain in every direction, and was once surrounded on its summit by a wall, of which a few traces still remain. This hill must probably have been fortified. Scarped towards the east, it slopes gently on the western side towards the town, which covered the lower hillocks at its feet. Among them I found, in the midst of the various debris which cover the soil, the remains of a building in cut stone, completely overthrown, once ornamented by columns, as is attested by two mutilated shafts lying on the spot. This edifice seems to have been constructed from east to west, so that it may have been a Christian church.\n\n\"In another place I saw an enclosure measuring thirty-five paces in length by twenty-five in breadth. From a distance it appears ancient. It is, however, of modern date, constructed of stones of all sizes and shapes ; among them pillars of broken sarcophagi\".\n\nIn 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" (SWP) described it as a small village on a knoll with three springs, having probably less than 100 inhabitants. A population list from about 1887 showed that \"Semunieh\" had about 100 inhabitants; all Muslims. \n\nGottlieb Schumacher, as part of surveying for the construction of the Jezreel Valley railway, noted in 1900 that the village “had not increased [since the 1881 SWP survey] due to its unhealthy position and bad water. The proprietor, Sursock, built a number of dwellings covered with tile masonry.”\n\nIn 1936, the site became an agricultural training station for the Moshavim Movement. One group that trained here came from Nahalal, and continued on to establish kibbutz Hanita.\n\nIn 1948, kibbutz Timorim was established on the site. Timorim became a moshav shitufi in 1953 and moved to the south of the country, due to lack of farming lands. When it was vacated, it became a Ma'abara (transit camp) for new immigrants destined for Migdal Ha'Emek and Ramat Yishai.\n\nIn 1965, a 28-dunam nature reserve was declared, preserving the Apple-ring Acacia (syn. Acacia albida) trees that grow on the site. This is the northern-most occurrence of these trees in Israel. The Apple-ring Acacia, native to Africa and the Middle East, is used for nitrogen fixation, erosion control for crops, for food, drink and medicine. It sheds its leaves in the rainy season and is highly valued in agroforestry as it can grow among field crops without shading them.\n\n"}

{"id": "7546919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7546919", "title": "Sulh", "text": "Sulh\n\nSulh () is an Arabic word meaning \"resolution\" or \"fixing\" generally, in problem solving. It is frequently used in the context of social problems.\n\nIn Quranic Arabic, sulh is used as a term signifying an agreement or settlement over a property dispute and retains this sense in later Islamic legal usage. In Bedouin customary law, it can signify a settlement of a tribal feud and in modern Arabic usage, it is applied to treaties, such as the \"sulh\" Versailles (Treaty of Versailles). In general, it reflects a sense of resolution of conflict through negotiation. The two parties select respected individuals to mediate the conflict, a truce (\"hudna\") is declared, a settlement is reached that maintains the honor and status of both parties, and a public ritual takes place. Particularly important is the fact that the practice affirms bonds between groups and not just individuals. It averts a cycle of revenge.\n\nSulh, in its sense of conflict mediation, is still common in rural areas where governmental systems of justice have little force.\n\nIn the early days of the Islamic Empire, \"sulh\", in the sense of \"treaty\" or \"armistice,\" typically meant that a region had \"surrendered on terms\" or similarly during the Ottoman retreat it preceded a region's independence. Typically, it signified an area that was ruled and administered by its local political structure but acknowledged itself as a subject through the payment of tribute.\n\nIn the Muslim world view on divisions of the world the region called the Dar al-'Ahd ( \"house of truce\") or Dar al-Sulh (\"house of treaty\") or Dar al Hudna (Arabic: \"house of calm\") was seen as an intermediate to Dar al-Islam (, literally house/abode of Islam; or Dar as-Salam, house/abode of Peace) and Dar al-Harb ( \"house of war\").\n\nDar al-Sulh, was then seen as non-Muslim territory that had concluded an armistice with Muslims, and had agreed to protect Muslims and their clients and interests within its borders. Often this implied a tributary situation, however modern writings also include friendly countries in Dar al-Sulh. By no means, was this particular division however recognized by all Muslim jurists, and due to historical changes, these concepts have little significance today.\n\n"}

In Japanese Buddhism, it is a type of good deed, and was done as a type of puja.\n\nIn the Nara period, the practice of copying sutras was the center of Buddhism in the country, and was done as a government project. During the Heian period, however, the idea of Pure Land Buddhism spread, and with it the objective of doing personal prayer. In the middle part of the Heian period, it was predicted that the mappō age would come into existence, and it was said that this would start in China and Korea.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra was the main sutra that was buried, but the Heart Sutra, Amitabha Sutra, Mahavairocana Tantra, Vajrasekhara Sutra were also buried. In other locations, the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, Kannon sutra, and opening and closing sutras were also found. The sutras were usually copied onto paper, but materials like clay, copper, pebbles and shells were also used. The sutras were stored in metal vessels called , and inscriptions were written on them.\n\nThe sutra tubes were small, but some hexagon-shaped boxes and two-storied pagoda shapes with affixed ornaments were found. The tubes also had caps on them. The tubes were usually made of metal or ceramics, but bamboo and other containers have also been found. The tubes were buried with ancient mirrors, coins, swords and jewels, and were buried with dehumidification substances like charcoal. The sutra tubes were often buried in sacred places such as mountain summits and on the grounds of Shinto temples. Occasionally they were buried underground or above ground, and stone huts were built to enshrine their contents.\n\nFor Japanese buildings, in 1007, Fujiwara no Michinaga built the oldest sutra mound at the summit of Kinpusen, a mountain range in Yamato Province. He did so because there was a sense of impending danger about the coming of mappō among the aristocracy, and he wanted to prepare for the coming of Maitreya and ensure that the sutras would be passed along to future generations.\n\nIn the middle of the 12th century, a monk who traveled around the country went around handing out copies of the sutras to the masses as a way of improving his spirit and puja.\n\nSince they were first buried, the small sutra tubes have decayed, so instead, sutra words have been written on small flat stones. Mounds containing stones where one character has been written on each, and mounds with multiple characters on each stone, became more popular. There are places where the stones were buried and covered up and a memorial stone was placed.\n\nIn recent centuries, an increase in agriculture and the permeation of a monetary economy has moved religious actions to the background. Giving copied sutras to temples has become standard as a way to spread knowledge about the sutras.\n\nWhile the ritual burial of sūtra, typically on paper, is known from over two thousand two hundred sites, at several that date to the late-Heian period, have been found. The text was incised into clay tiles that were then low fired; the selection of a more durable medium may have had some symbolic significance. Several examples have been excavated in Fukuoka Prefecture. A clay tile sutra mound in Itano is among the Historic Sites of Tokushima Prefecture.\n"}

He has with him a Torah scroll for the San Francisco synagogue. Belinski, an innocent, trusting, and inexperienced traveler, falls in with three con men, the brothers Matt and Darryl Diggs and their partner Mr. Jones, who trick him into helping pay for a wagon and supplies to go west, then brutally rob him and leave him and most of his belongings scattered along a deserted road in Pennsylvania.\n\nStill determined to make it to San Francisco, Belinski spends time with some Pennsylvania Dutch Amish people (whom at first he takes for Jews). Because he was injured when he was dumped out of the speeding wagon, the Amish nurse takes care of Belinski until he is back to good health and gives him money for the train west to the end of the line. When he reaches the end of the line in Ohio, the rabbi manages to find work on the railroad. On his way west again after saving up enough money to buy a horse and some supplies, he is befriended and looked after by a stranger named Tommy Lillard (Ford), a bank robber with a soft heart who is moved by Belinski's helplessness and frank personality, despite the trouble it occasionally gives him.\n\nFor instance, when Lillard robs a bank on a Thursday, he finds that Belinski (an Orthodox Jew) will not ride on the Shabbat — even with a hanging posse on his tail. However, they still manage to get away, mainly because with the horses rested from having been walked for a full day, they are fresh and able to ride all night, outdistancing their pursuers.\n\nOn another occasion, due to Belinski's insistence on riding into foul weather, he and Lillard have to use an old Indian trick and snuggle up next to their horses, which they have gotten to lie on the ground, to wait out a snowstorm. While traveling together, the two also experience American Indian customs and hospitality, disrupt a Trappist monastery's vow of silence with an innocent gesture of gratitude, and learn a little about each other's culture.\n\nWhile stopping in a small town not too far from San Francisco, Belinski encounters the Diggs brothers and Jones again. He gets into a fight with the three of them and, after taking a beating, is rescued by Lillard, who takes back what they had stolen from Belinski and more besides.\n\nSeeking revenge, the three bandits follow the pair and ambush them on a California beach where they have stopped to bathe and a firefight ensues. Tommy shoots Jones dead and creases Matt Diggs, who flees the scene. Belinski experiences a crisis of faith when he is forced to kill Darryl Diggs in self-defense after Darryl wounded Tommy. Lillard restores his faith by an eloquent argument with simple language, reminding him that he still is what he is inside, despite what he had to do on the beach.\n\nWhen Matt Diggs, sole survivor of the ambushing trio, prepares to avenge his brother by killing Belinski and Lillard springs to his friend's defense, Belinski, regaining his composure, shows his wisdom and courage in front of the entire community by disarming and exiling Diggs from San Francisco. The film ends with Belinski marrying Rosalie Bender, younger daughter of the head of San Francisco's Jewish community, with Lillard attending the ceremony as his best man.\n\n\nThe film was in development for seven years. It was known as \"No Knife\" for a long time, then briefly as \"Greenhorn\" before someone suggested \"The Frisco Kid\".\n\nRobert Aldrich replaced director Dick Richards during pre-production. Roger Ebert wrote, \"It's really nobody's movie. The screenplay has been around Hollywood for several years, and Aldrich seems to have taken it on as a routine assignment.\"\n\nAccording to Gene Wilder's autobiography, \"Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art\", the Tommy Lillard role, played by Harrison Ford, was originally planned for John Wayne. John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis writes that Wayne was \"eager to take it on as a comic follow-up to \"True Grit\" and \"Rooster Cogburn\". Salary concerns nixed the idea, though, and it's questionable he would have finished the shooting, in any case, as he died shortly before \"The Frisco Kid\" opened.\" (Another source says Wayne did not want to make the film due to \"vulgarity\" in the script.)\n\nWilder said he was offered the film in 1976 but turned it down. The script was rewritten, he read it again the following year and thought it was better but still turned it down. However when he read a revised second draft he agreed to do it. Warners asked him to work on the script, so he helped with the construction of a third draft, then wrote a fourth draft.\nFilming started 30 October 1978 under the working title \"No Knife\".\n\nAldrich said \"With the exception of Bette Davis, Gene is the best actor I've worked with. He's very intuitive, very bright.\"\n\nWilder said he liked working with Aldrich too calling the film \"Young Frankenstein Meets the Dirty Dozen\" and saying \"the way he chooses to do a scene is the most artistic of any director I've ever worked with.\"\n\nAldrich did not always get on with Harrison Ford during the shoot. \"I think every time Aldrich looked at Harrison, he saw John Wayne,\" said Mace Neufeld, the producer. \"Harrison was aware of that, but he was always fun to be around, very funny. \"\n\nFord later said \"It was fun to work with Gene... [but] every time the director, Robert Aldrich, looked at me, he was thinking about how unhappy he was that he didn't have John Wayne, instead.\"\n\nThe film earned $4.7 million at the US box office in its first year.\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 53% rating based on 15 reviews.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described \"The Frisco Kid\" as \"harmless chaos\": \"People keep coming and going and doing ferociously cute things, but never anything that could appeal to anyone except a close relative or someone with a built-in weakness for anything ethnic whatsoever.\" He criticized the lack of plot development, saying that, while based on a clever idea, \"The Frisco Kid\" ultimately fails to deliver on its promise.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie a mixed review, admitting that after seeing \"Cat Ballou\" he was \"forever after spoiled on the subject of comic Westerns.\" \"The movie's based on a good idea, yes... But what approach do you take to this material? What's your comic tone? \"The Frisco Kid\" tries for almost every possible tone.\"\n\nJordan Hiller called it one of \"25 Essential Jewish Movies\", praising its \"uncommon innocence and unselfconscious humility.\" He called it an \"unpredictably paced part screwball comedy farce, part dramatic buddy picture, part spaghetti western\" and wrote, \"\"The Frisco Kid\" has the feel of an artist’s charmingly naive youthful indiscretion... \"The Frisco Kid\" is, all pratfalls and tuchus jokes aside, the quintessential 'Torah' movie.\" Reviewer Ken Hanke wrote, \"Robert Aldrich's penultimate film is an easygoing work of some considerable charm that relies far too much on ethnic humor — mostly Jewish, but not entirely — to sit quite as comfortably as it might like... [Aldrich's] professionalism serves the film well. It's very hard to fault on a technical level, and he brings a strong visual sense to bear on a number of sequences that raise them several notches above the TV flavor of the material. The dance sequence, when Avram and his unlikely companion, Tommy (Harrison Ford), are prisoners of a tribe of Indians, is a good case in point, as is the final shoot-out in the streets of San Francisco... Never a great movie, it's nonetheless a pleasant one — an old-fashioned entertainment that more than gets by on the unforced (albeit unlikely) chemistry of Wilder and Ford.\"\n\nPuccio of Movie Metropolis called the film \"humorous and touching\" and \"uplifting as well\": \"\"The Frisco Kid\" is not a great film; it's not even a very good film by the best filmmaking standards; but it's such a sweet and gentle film, it's hard not to like... The film moseys along at a leisurely pace, and the director has a little difficulty finding the right comedic tone between dry, subtle farce and outright slapstick; yet it manages to find a soft spot in the heart for every scene, so maybe 'heartwarming' is what Aldrich had in mind, in which case he couldn't have done better.\"\n\nWilder's performance was widely praised. Ebert wrote, \"What's poignant about the film is that Wilder's performance is such a nice one. He's likable, plucky, versatile. He is, in fact, as good an actor here as he's ever been before, and at his own brand of complex vulnerability Gene Wilder has never been surpassed.\" Hanke said, \"But the main interest in the film is probably Gene Wilder's performance, which is interesting simply because it's one of the few times that Wilder played a character that wasn't essentially Gene Wilder. And, lo and behold, he does a perfectly credible job of being someone else — or at least someone else who isn't Willy Wonka.\" Film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV declares that Wilder gives \"one of his very best performances\" and calls his character \"incredibly endearing\": \"\"The Frisco Kid\" is a real surprise, offering as it does one of Gene Wilder's best characterizations in a film that's alternately funny and sweetly touching, this despite Robert Aldrich's generally indelicate direction.\" Puccio wrote, \"Nobody does nice like Gene Wilder... Nor have many actors been so willing to celebrate their culture and religious convictions as Wilder does here, perhaps also a trait he picked up from [Mel] Brooks.\"\n\n"}

In Otuzco existed a chapel dedicated to Immaculate Conception, Patroness of Otuzco in that time. When the news became known that the northern cities Guayaquil and Zaña had been attacked by pirates and believing that Trujillo would be the next city to be attacked, from Trujillo were sent messages to the nearby villages so they could take their preventive measures. Residents of Otuzco placed an image of the Virgin of the Conception in the entrance of the village as a symbol of prayer and protection of piracy attacks. Miraculously Trujillo was not attacked by pirates dangerous, and since then born worship and faith to \"Virgin of La Puerta\" which spans the north of Peru.\n\nThe celebration originated in 1664 when it placed the image of the Virgin at the entrance of Otuzco as precaution of the risk of a pirate raid. The main day is celebrated on December 15 every year and in 2012 the feast of Our Lady of the Gate was declared a National Cultural Heritage by the Peruvian government.

The newspaper was edited by Joshua Gershman until his death in 1978. \n\nThe newspaper was launched in 1926 as \"Der kampf\" ('The Struggle') by the Communist Party of Canada, with Joshua Gershman as editor. The paper was renamed \"Der veg\" ('The Road'), and finally \"Der keneder yidishe vochenblatt\" in October 1940.' The title 'Vochenblatt' was perceived as more 'safe' by the party, seeking to avoid state interference in its press activities. Harry Guralnick served as the executive secretary of the Canadian Jewish Weekly Association, the organization that published the newspaper.\n\nIn March 1943 \"Vochenblatt\" began including English pages regularly, in an effort to reach out to English-speaking Jews. Nathan Cohen served as editor of the English pages and wrote theatr and film reviews. The English-language section of \"Vochenblatt\" was later replaced by a monthly supplement, the \"Canadian Jewish Outlook\", which later became a standalone publication.\n\nInitially, \"Vochenblatt\" adopted a firm anti-Zionist stand, but that posture was softened as World War II progressed. The newspaper was supportive of calls from the Zionist leadership in Palestine to support the Allies. As of mid-1942, \"Vochenblatt\" began using the term \"Eretz Yisrael\" for Palestine. Still, the newspaper still maintained its support for the Birobidzhan movement. During the 1941–1945 period the newspaper supported the foundation of an independent joint Jewish-Arab state in Palestine. As of 1948 \"Vochenblat\" favoured the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and as the Arab–Israeli War began it issued a call to Canadian Jews to campaign against any compromise against the UN resolution on establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.\n\nIn 1948, the newspaper became the \"de facto\" organ of the United Jewish People's Order. Gershman served as general secretary of UJPO. UJPO cut its ties and financial relationship with the newspaper when it severed its affiliation to the Communist Party of Canada (then known as the Labor-Progressive Party) at the end of 1956.\n\nIn its later years, \"Vochenblat\" was published biweekly, rather than every week.\n\n\n"}
