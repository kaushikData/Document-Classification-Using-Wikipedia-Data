Schäfer responded he wanted to lead another expedition to Tibet. Schäfer requested that his expedition be under the patronage of the cultural department of the foreign affairs department or of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (\"German Research Foundation\"). Himmler was fascinated by Asian mysticism and therefore wished to send such an expedition under the auspices of the SS Ahnenerbe (SS Ancestral Heritage Society), and he desired that Schäfer perform research based on Hanns Hörbiger’s pseudoscientific theory of \"Glacial Cosmogony\" promoted by the Ahnenerbe. Schäfer had scientific objectives and therefore refused to include Edmund Kiss, an adept of this theory, in his team and required 12 conditions to ensure scientific freedom. Wolfram Sievers, from the Ahnenerbe, therefore expressed criticism concerning the objectives of the expedition, and Ahnenerbe would not sponsor it. Himmler was agreeable to the expedition going ahead provided all members joined the SS and Schäfer found he had no alternative but to accept this condition even without sponsorship.\n\nWhile preparing the expedition, Ernst Schäfer used the term \"Schaefer Expedition 1938/1939\" on his letterhead and to apply for sponsorship from businessmen. The official expedition name had to be changed on order of the \"Ahnenerbe\", however, to \"German Tibet-Expedition Ernst Schaefer\" (in big letters), \"under the patronage of the Reichsführer-SS Himmler and in connection with the Ahnenerbe\" (in small letters).\n\nAfter the German Consul-General in Calcutta criticised the letterhead in a report to the German Foreign Office, \"arguing that the prescribed letterhead was counter-productive and immediately generated mistrust among the British\", Schäfer \"ordered a new, discreet letterhead in Antiqua font, which read 'Deutsche Tibet Expedition Ernst Schäfer'.\" During the expedition, Schäfer used only the latter letterhead or his original \"Schaefer Expedition\" paper. The Ahnenerbe prescribed letterhead was only used prior to the expedition's departure.\n\nBritish writer Christopher Hale claims that one cannot infer that Schäfer was independent of the SS and was able to do \"pure science\" simply from the special letterhead that he got printed for the expedition: to all intents and purposes, the expedition remained under Himmler's patronage and Schäfer had no interest in losing his support.\n\nIn its time, the expedition was also commonly referred to in German newspapers and academic journals as the \"SS Tibet Expedition\" as it had Heinrich Himmler as its patron and all five members were officers in the SS. The \"SS Tibet Expedition\" designation was used by Ernst Schäfer himself in the \"Atlantis\" Journal. \"SS Tibet Expedition\" is the title used in a 1946 report by US military intelligence in Western Europe.\n\nIn the \"Register of the Heinrich Himmler Papers\", 1914–1944, archived at Stanford University's Hoover institution, the folder containing the material pertaining to the expedition bears the title \"The SS-Tibet-Expedition, 1939\".\n\nThis designation is still in use by modern scholars, such as Mechtild Rössler in 2001 and Suzanne Heim in 2002, as well as by writer Peter Lavenda in 2002.\n\nAccording to Christopher Hale, as Ernst Schäfer was demanding more than 60,000 Reichsmarks for his expedition and the coffers of the SS were depleted at the time, he was forced to raise the funds himself.\n\nAccording to researcher Isrun Engelhardt, the expedition was not funded by the Ahnenerbe. Ernst Schäfer raised the funds by himself, 80% of which came from Public Relations and Advertising Council of German Industry (Werberat der deutschen Wirtschaft) as well as large German business enterprises, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) and Brooke Dolan II. Himmler's personal friends sponsored only the flight back to Germany.\n\nAccording to the United States Forces, the expedition's funding was provided by various public and private contributors, with the return flight to Germany paid for by the SS. The cost of equipping the expedition was RM 65,000, and the expedition itself cost another RM 65,000, excluding the flight back.\n\nErnst Schäfer was a member of the SS when he arrived at the German consulate in Chungking in 1935. Schäfer had just returned from a trip through parts of Asia, mainly India and China, in which the other two heads of the expedition had abandoned him in fear of native tribes. Schäfer turned the expedition from a complete failure into a great success, and the SS took note, sending him a letter informing him of a promotion to SS-Untersturmführer and summoning him back to Germany from Philadelphia. In June 1936, Schäfer met with Himmler, who consequently informed Sievers and Galke to start organizing an expedition to Tibet.\n\nSchäfer recruited young, fit men who would be well suited for an arduous journey. At age 24, Karl Wienert (an assistant of Wilhelm Filchner, a famous explorer) was the team's geologist. Also age 24, Edmund Geer was selected as the technical leader to organize the expedition. A relatively old teammate at the age of 38 was Ernst Krause (not to be confused with the German biologist of the same name), who was to double as a filmmaker and entomologist. Bruno Beger was a 26-year-old Rassekunde expert and student of Hans F.K. Günther's who was to be the team's anthropologist.\n\nResearcher Roger Croston described the objective of the expedition as \"an holistic creation of a complete biological record of Tibet alongside a synthesis of inter-relating natural sciences with regard to geography, cartography, geology, earth magnetics, climate, plants, animals and mankind.\"\n\nReacting to Dr Isrun Engelhardt's conclusions that the Schäfer Expedition was \"purely scientific\" and her claim that the historical context of Germany in the 1930s makes the expedition's goals appear as somehow sinister, British writer Christopher Hale observes that \"while the idea of ‘Nazi botany’ or ‘Nazi ornithology’ is probably absurd, other sciences are not so innocent – and Schäfer's small expedition represented a cross-section of German science in the 1930s.\" To Hale, this has considerable significance as \"under the Third Reich anthropology and medicine were cold-bloodedly exploited to support and enact a murderous creed.\" There have been allegations that one of the expedition's purposes was to determine whether Tibet was the cradle of the \"Aryan race\". The taking of cranial measurements and making of facial casts of local people by anthropologist Bruno Beger did little to dissipate the allegations.\n\nHale also recalls the existence of a secret warning issued by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to German newspapers in 1940 saying that \"the chief task of the Tibet expedition,\" was \"of a political and military nature\" and \"had not so much to do with the solution of scientific questions,\" adding that details could not be revealed.\n\nHowever, Croston agrees with Engelhardt and states that the expedition \"was planned as a scientific mission […] but it was caught up in the politics of the time. […] Schaefer’s vehement refusal to accept Himmler’s plans led, eventually, to the expedition not being sponsored by Himmler’s SS or its organisations 'because it would lie outside the scope of his work'.\"\n\nChinese journalist Ren Yanshi, quoting the Austrian weekly \"Wochenpresse\", writes that the first major task of the expedition was \"to investigate the possibility of establishing the region as a base for attacking the British troops stationed in India\" while its second major assignment was \"to verify Heinrich Himmler's Nazi racial theory that a group of pure-blooded Aryans had settled in Tibet.\"\n\nAccording to American journalist Karl E. Meyer, one of the expedition's aims was to prepare maps and survey passes \"for possible use of Tibet as a staging ground for guerrilla assaults on British India.\"\n\nItalian essayist Claudio Mutti states that the official plan included research on the landforms, climate, geography, and culture of the region, and contacting the local authorities for the establishment of representation in the country.\n\nAccording to Claudio Mutti, the group of five researchers intended to contact the Regent of Tibet and visit the sacred cities of Lhasa and Shigatse. Even with wartime difficulties the group was able to contact the Tibetan authorities and people. They returned to Germany with a complete edition of the Tibetan sacred text the Kangyur (108 volumes), examples of Mandala, other ancient texts, and one alleged document regarding the \"Aryan race\". These documents were kept in Ahnenerbe archives.\n\nIn July 1937, the team suffered a setback when Japan invaded Manchuria, China, ruining Schäfer's plans to use the Yangtze River to reach Tibet. Schäfer flew to London to seek permission to travel through India, but was turned down by the British government who feared an imminent war with Germany.\n\nAnother problem in the preparations for the Tibetan expedition occurred during a duck hunting accident on November 9, 1937, when Schäfer, his wife of four months and two servants were in a rowboat. A sudden wave caused Schäfer to drop his gun which broke in two and discharged, mortally wounding his wife. Despite subsequent emotional problems, Schäfer was back to work on the expedition in eight weeks.\n\nIn a move that lost the Ahnenerbe's support, Schäfer asked Himmler for permission to simply arrive in India and try to force his way into Tibet. Himmler agreed with this plan, and set about furthering it by contacting influential people, including Germany's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. On April 21, 1938, the team departed from Genoa, Italy, on their way to Ceylon where they would then travel to Calcutta, British India.\n\nThe day before the team left Europe the \"Völkischer Beobachter\" ran an article on the expedition, alerting British officials of its intentions. Schäfer and Himmler were both enraged: Schäfer complained to SS headquarters and Himmler in turn wrote to Admiral Barry Domvile. Domvile was a Nazi supporter and former head of British naval intelligence who gave the letter to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain permitted the SS team to enter Sikkim, a region bordering Tibet.\n\nIn Sikkim's capital of Gangtok, the team assembled a 50-mule caravan and searched for porters and Tibetan interpreters. Here, the British official, Sir Basil Gould, observed them, describing Schäfer as \"interesting, forceful, volatile, scholarly, vain to the point of childishness, disregardful of social convention,\" and noted that he was determined to enter Tibet regardless of permission.\n\nThe team began their journey June 21, 1938, traveling through the Teesta River valley and then heading north. Krause worked light traps to capture insects, Wienert toured the hills making measurements, Geer collected bird species and Beger offered locals medical help in exchange for allowing him to take measurements of them.\nIn August 1938, a high official of the Rajah Tering, a member of the Sikkimese royal family living in Tibet, entered the team's camp. Although Beger wished to ask the guest's permission to measure him, he was dissuaded by the Tibetan porters who encouraged him to wait for Schäfer to return from a hunting trip. Schäfer met with the official, and presented him with mule-loads of gifts.\n\nIn December 1938 the Tibetan council of ministers invited Schäfer and his team to Tibet, but forbade them from killing any animals during their stay, citing religious concerns. After a supply trip back to Gangtok, Schäfer learned he had been promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer, and the rest of the team had been promoted to SS-Obersturmführer.\n\nDuring the trip to Tibet's highlands, Beger began making facial casts of local people, including his personal servant, a Nepalese Sherpa named Passang. During the first casting, paste got into one of Passang's nostrils and he panicked, tearing at the mask. Schäfer threatened to terminate the employment of the porters who had seen the incident, if they told anyone. Most of the Tibetans had a much more friendly and light-hearted attitude, however, and photographic and film footage remains of smiling and laughing Tibetans undergoing facial and skull feature measurements.\n\nOn January 19, 1939, the team reached Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. Schäfer proceeded to pay his respects to the Tibetan ministers and a nobleman. He also gave out Nazi pennants, explaining the reverence shown for the shared symbol in Germany. His permission to remain in Lhasa was extended, and he was permitted to photograph and film the region. The team spent two months in Lhasa, collecting information on agriculture, culture, and religion.\n\nAs the arrival of the expedition had been announced in advance, its members, according to Bruno Beger's testimony, were welcome everywhere in Tibet and provided with all the things they needed for their trip and sojourn. In Lhasa itself, they got into close touch with government officials and other noteworthy people.\n\nSchäfer met the Regent of Tibet, Reting Rinpoche, on several occasions. During one of their meetings, the Regent asked him point blank whether his country would be willing to sell weapons to Tibet.\n\nIn March 1939, the expedition left Lhasa, heading for Gyantse and escorted by a Tibetan official. After exploring the ruins of the ancient deserted capital city of Jalung Phodrang, they reached Shigatse, the city of the panchen lamas, in April. They received a warm welcome from the locals, with thousands coming out to greet them. In a 1946 \"Final Interrogation Report by American Intelligence\", Schäfer claims to have met \"the pro-German regent of Shigatse\" (the 9th Panchen Lama had died in 1937 and the 10th was not to arrive before 1951). In May, the expedition returned to Gyantse where negotiations were held with local British officials about the trip back to India and transport of the expeditions's gear and collections.\n\nThroughout his stay in Lhasa, Ernst Schäfer remained in touch with Germany through mail and the Chinese Legation's radio. Himmler is reported to have followed the expedition enthusiastically, writing several letters to Schäfer and even broadcasting Christmas greeting to him via shortwave.\n\nThe Germans collected anything they could: thousands of artifacts, a huge number of plants and animals, including live specimens. They sent back specimens of three breeds of Tibetan dogs, rare feline species, wolves, badgers, foxes, animal and bird skins.\n\nThe expedition members collected a huge quantity of plants, in particular hundreds of varieties of barley, wheat and oats. The seeds were later stored in the SS-Institute for Plant Genetics in Lannach near Graz, Austria, a research centre run by SS botanist Heinz Brücher. Brücher entertained hopes of using both the Tibet collection and that of the Vavilov Institute in the Eastern territories to select crop plants able to withstand the climate of Eastern Europe – considered at the time as part of the Nazi Lebensraum or \"living space\" – with a view to reaching autarky.\n\nWienert took four sets of geomagnetic data. Krause studied Tibetan wasps. Schäfer observed Tibetan rituals, including sky burial (he even bought some human skulls). They took stills and film footage of local culture, notably the spectacular New Year celebrations when tens of thousands of pilgrims flocked to Lhasa. Bruno Beger recorded the measurements of 376 people and took casts of the heads, faces, hands and ears of 17 more, as well as fingerprints and hand prints from another 350. To carry out his research, he posed as a medicine man to win the favour of Tibetan aristocrats, dispensing drugs and tending to monks with sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nSchäfer kept meticulous notes on the religious and cultural customs of the Tibetans, from their various colorful Buddhist festivals to Tibetan attitudes towards marriage, rape, menstruation, childbirth, homosexuality and masturbation. In his account of Tibetan homosexuality he describes the various positions taken by older lamas with younger boys and then goes on to explain how homosexuality played an important role in the higher politics of Tibet. There are pages of careful observation of Himalayan people engaged in a variety of intimate acts.\n\nSchäfer presented the results of the expedition on 25 July 1939 at the Himalaya Club Calcutta.\n\nAfter Schäfer read a letter from his father who reported to him about the imminent threat of war, and urged him to return to Germany as quickly as possible, Schäfer decided to return to Germany. After being given two complimentary letters – one to Hitler and the other to Himmler, Schäfer and his companions left Lhasa in August 1939. They also took with them two presents for Hitler consisting of a Lhama dress and a hunting dog, as well as a copy of the Tibetan \"Bible\", the 120-volume Kangyur. They headed south to Calcutta, boarding a seaplane at the mouth of the Hooghly River, and began the journey home.\n\nAccording to Engelhardt:\nAccording to Trimondis at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, they were greeted on the runway by an ecstatic Heinrich Himmler who presented Schäfer with the SS skull ring and dagger of honor.\n\nWhen grilled by US military intelligence in February 1946, Schäfer stated that after his return, he had a meeting with Himmler in which he outlined his plans to launch another expedition to Tibet in case of war. The idea was to win Tibet over to the German side and organize a resistance movement there. The project never took off.\n\nAfter returning to Germany, Wienert, Krause and Geer went back to civilian life and were heard of no more. Beger worked together with August Hirt at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg. His assignment, which he carried out, was to provide the Nazi physician with a selection of detainees of diverse ethnic types from Auschwitz in order to serve Hirt's racial experiments.\n\nIn 1943, Schäfer was given his own institute within the Ahnenerbe. He named it \"the Sven Hedin Institute for Inner Asian Research\" after a Swedish explorer who visited Tibet in 1907.\n\n1943 also saw the release of the film \"Geheimnis Tibet\" put together from the various rolls brought back from Tibet. It premiered on January 16, during the inauguration of the Sven Hedin Institute, with the Swedish explorer himself in attendance.\n\nBecause of the war, Schäfer's writings about the trip were not published until 1950, under the title \"Festival of the White Gauze Scarves: A research expedition through Tibet to Lhasa, the holy city of the god realm.\"\n\nAll through the expedition, Beger kept a travel diary which was published in book form 60 years later, \"Mit der deutschen Tibetexpedition Ernst Schäfer 1938/39 nach Lhasa\" (Wiesbaden, 1998). Only 50 copies of it exist.\n\n\n"}

The two most famous such ships were the \"Paralus\" and the \"Salaminia\", which also served as the messenger ships of the Athenian government in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Other notable ships included one possibly named the \"Delias\", a \"triakonter\" (thirty-oared galley) believed to be the ship in which Theseus had sailed to Crete, and which was involved in several traditional theoria to Delos; the vessel was constantly repaired by replacing individual planks to keep it seaworthy while maintaining its identity as the same ship. (For the philosophical question of the ship's identity, see Ship of Theseus.) After the reforms of Cleisthenes, a ship was named for each of the ten tribes that political leader had created; these ships may also have been sacred ships.\n\nThe \"Paralus\" and the \"Salaminia\", and possibly some other sacred ships, served in the Athenian combat fleet. Those two vessels, being particularly swift, were used as scout and messenger ships, but also fought in the line of battle. The \"Paralus\" and \"Salaminia\", meanwhile, also performed various tasks for the government; the \"Paralus\" appears to have carried most diplomatic missions, and the \"Salaminia\" carried official state messages; most famously, it was sent to arrest Alcibiades while that politician was commanding the Sicilian Expedition. These two triremes also had dedicated treasurers, or \"tamiai\".\n\n"}

He is a trickster and a powerful sorcerer as well. The myth involving him is the wellspring of the Warlpiri fire ceremonies. He is often regarded as a deity, but this notion is not exactly true.\n\nBluetongue Lizard had two sons, and the three of them camped in the Place of Fire, which was known as Warlukurlangu. He pretended he was blind so his sons would hunt for him. However, once they were gone, he would leave to hunt his own food, which he ate on the spot. The place he went hunting was Ngama, also known as the Cave of the Rainbow Snake. It was there he gained his sorcery skills. One day, the two sons went hunting and killed a kangaroo, which they presented to their father to eat. The two sons did not know this kangaroo was sacred and used to speak to Bluetongue Lizard, telling him secrets. Upon learning of the kangaroo's slaying, Bluetongue Lizard was filled with rage and summoned a magic fire, sending it after his sons. The fire followed them wherever they went. It would die down at night, but start up again in the morning, driving Bluetongue Lizard's sons around all of the Tjukurrpa. Finally, the sons stopped at the Ngarra salt lake and drowned there, too fatigued to go on.\n\nThe Warlpiri people recapture the spirit of Bluetongue Lizard with dramatic fire ceremonies that involve a young male dancer emerging from total darkness into the glow of a ceremonial fire. The dancer selected moves carefully and willingly and then kneels by the fire, shaking his shoulders. He takes brushes from the fire and proceeds to scatter the embers over his back. The Warlpiri elders walk by the youth to coach him in the proper performance of the dance. The Ngarra is one of the most sacred sites of the Warlpiri – so sacred, only men are permitted to go there.\n\n"}

{"id": "188576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188576", "title": "Demonization", "text": "Demonization\n\nDemonization is the reinterpretation of polytheistic deities as evil, lying demons by other religions, generally monotheistic and henotheistic ones. The term has since been expanded to refer to any characterization of individuals, groups, or political bodies as evil.\n\nReligions, even those that are radically monotheistic, do not necessarily deny the existence of other gods or spiritual beings. On the contrary, they claim other gods are not worthy of worship and in actuality are demons who mislead followers from proper belief or practice. Christian missionaries often employed demonization tactics when converting pagans, although Judaism, Islam, and other religions have similar histories. Demonization is not limited to focusing on other religions but can also be directed inward to condemn various schools of thought or movements. \n\nFrom a secular viewpoint, demonization can be used to denigrate an opposed individual or group, making adherents to your own religion or viewpoint less inclined to do business with them (and possibly convert) and more inclined to fight against them. If foreigners are evil and corrupted by demonic influence, then any means of self-defense is easily portrayed as legitimate. The portrayal of almost all pagans in the Middle East as Baal-worshippers in the Hebrew Bible is an example of this. If pagans are corrupted by the demon-\"god\" Baal, then clearly they must be fought or at least oppressed. Especially in the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, foreign deities are portrayed as existing and corrupting entities rather than being mere powerless idols. Some would argue this later transferred to Christianity after Constantine I's ascension in its suppression of Roman paganism. Some of the most known of these demonizations are Lucifer, Beelzebub and Baphomet up to the extend that they became synonym for the devil/satan of Abrahamic religions. Later, the language of demonization would be invoked during the Spanish Inquisition, leading to the expulsion of Jews and Moriscos from Spain.\n\nThe view of early Judaism treating foreign deities as devils and later Judaism treating them as non-existent is not universal. Psalms 96:5, for example, is alternately translated as, \"For all the Gods of the gentiles are nothing,\" \"For all the Gods of the gentiles are devils\" (Vulgate), and \"For all the gods of the peoples are idols.\"(NRSV) The Greek Septuagint translation of that passage, used by the early Christian Church, used the \"devils\" version. Jerome would follow the Greek text rather than the Hebrew when he translated the Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible. The \"devils\" epithet would still appear in Bibles up until the end of the 20th century when the consensus reverted to the original Hebrew text for modern translations.\n\nAnalogs to demonization exist outside monotheistic religions, as well. Polytheism easily accepts foreign gods in general, and in times of conflict, a foreign nation's gods would sometimes be portrayed as evil. Less commonly, it would be applied to other religions as well. For example, Buddha's portrayal in Hinduism varies: Some strains of Hinduism consider the Buddha an incarnation of Vishnu while in some texts such as the Puranas, he is portrayed as an avatar born to mislead those who deny the Vedic knowledge. \n\nIn a certain way, the demonization had sometimes a positive side. For example, during Catholic missions in South America, the demonization of indigenous beliefs or acts make those peoples be regarded as so human as the Europeans.\n\nDemonization is sometimes used against what are arguably political opponents rather than religious ones. The Knights Templar were destroyed by accusations that they worshipped Baphomet from King Philip the Fair. Baphomet, often thought to be Beelzebub, may have been used because of the likeness of this horned deity with the Christian images of Satan.\n\nIn colloquial usage, the term demonization is used metaphorically to refer to propaganda or moral panic directed against any individual or group.\n\n"}

In December 1774 he was appointed eparch and on December 25 of the same year consecrated Melkite Catholic eparch of Acre by Melkite Patriarch of Antioch, Theodosius V Dahan. In July 1777 he became archbishop of Aleppo; anyway due to the persecution by the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch he dwelt for most of his life in Zouk Mikael, Lebanon. From 1792 to 1798 he traveled in Italy, where he came in contact with Jansenist circles and in particular with Scipione de' Ricci.\nReturned to Syria he was highly esteemed by Patriarch Agapius II Matar and played an important role in the 1806 Melkite Catholic Church's synod in Qarqafe (or \"Karkafeh\").\nGermanos Adam died in Zouk Mikael on 10 November 1809.\n\nThe doctrine of Germanos Adam was deeply influenced by the theological works of the 18th century Gallicans and Jansenists (like Febronius), which he read during his studies in Rome, and mainly by his 1792-8 travel in Italy where he became friend of the Jansenist Scipione de' Ricci.\nConsequently, in his 1799 book \"Réponse de Mgr Germain Adam éveque d'Alep et de ses environs à l'ouvrage intitulé: Voix des Perés missionaires\" Adam supported the doctrine of Conciliarism, and stated that the papal authority was more honorary than actual. Further he affirmed that an explicit epiclesis was essential in the Eucharistic consecration, a statement that implied the non-validity of the Latin Rite Mass.\n\nHis works were attacked by the Maronite Patriarch Joseph Tyan who in March 1801 wrote an encyclical to his faithfuls against Adam's ideas, but the Melkite Patriarch Agapius II Matar in June 1801 defended the doctrine of Adam as correct. Moreover, Germanos Adam wrote a catechism that was used for popular instruction. Adam's doctrine was confirmed by the 1806 Melkite synod of Qarqafe, which acts were signed also by Patriarch Joseph Tyen and by Aloisio Gandolfi, the Apostolic Legate.\n\nThe next years were marked by the reaction to his ideas. Adam himself made amends for the sacramental part of his work and before he died he humbly submitted all his works to Rome for examination. In 1812 a formal condemnation of the Jansenist and Gallican doctrine, issued by Propaganda Fide, was signed by all the Eastern Catholic Churches. On 3 June 1816 Pope Pius VII condemned Adam's works and his catechism. The actions of the 1806 Melkite Synod of Qarqafe were finally condemned by the Apostolic Letter \"Melchitarum Catholicorum Synodus\" () issued by Pope Gregory XVI on 3 June 1835.\n\n"}

{"id": "16342516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16342516", "title": "Haibutsu kishaku", "text": "Haibutsu kishaku\n\nAn early example of \"haibutsu kishaku\" is the Mononobe clan's anti-Buddhist policies during the time of Buddhism's early introduction to Japan in the Kofun period. The Mononobe were opposed to the spread of Buddhism not on religious grounds, but rather because of nationalism and xenophobia. The Nakatomi clan, ancestors of the Fujiwara, were allies of the Mononobe in their opposition to Buddhism.\n\nAnother example is the policies of temple closure and monk defrocking of the Okayama, Aizu, and Mito Domains, also adopted for political and economic, rather than religious, reasons during the early modern period. These domainal policies were in general based on Confucian anti-Buddhist thought. The Meiji period form of \"haibutsu kishaku\", based on kokugaku and Shinto-centrism, was instead dictated by a desire to distinguish between foreign Buddhism and a purely Japanese Shinto.\n\nThe \"haibutsu kishaku\" during the Meiji Restoration, the most famous instance of the phenomenon, was an event triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (or \"shinbutsu bunri\") that after 1868 caused great damage to Buddhism in Japan. The destruction of Buddhist property took place on a large scale all over the country. For example, Kōfuku-ji in Nara suffered greatly. The temple, which is now a National Treasure, was hit with full force by the movement. The temple's land was seized, the priests forced to become Shinto priests, walls were torn down, trees were planted, and the area became part of one of the city's parks. The anti-Buddhist riots caused damage to all large temples of the city. The violence marked permanently every region of the country. Between 1872 and 1874, 18 thousand temples were eradicated, and maybe as many again from 1868 to 1872. Japanologist Martin Collcutt believes Japanese Buddhism was on the verge of total eradication.\n\nThe violence had just released pent-up popular anger at the Buddhists which had been brewing for centuries because of their close alliance with the Tokugawa in the \"danka\" system, an alliance from which the religion had derived immense benefit. Although the shogunate's official philosophy was lay Neo-Confucianism, Buddhism had become an integral part of the state as a consequence of the Tokugawa's anti-Christian policy. To stop the propagation of the Christian religion, they had introduced the \"danka\" system, which obliged families to affiliate themselves with a Buddhist temple and, in return, this would certify that they were not Christian. Without this certification a normal life in Tokugawa Japan was impossible. Because of this, temples could and often would blackmail parishioners. Under the \"danka\" system families had by law several obligations towards Buddhist institutions, among them monetary donations to their affiliated temple. Because there were some 100,000 temples in a country of 30 million people, on average 300 persons had to support a temple, so the burden was considerable. Buddhism, as an institution, had a vested interest in the shogunate system, and therefore became a target of all the parties working for the downfall of the shogunate.\n\nThere were definite political and economic motivations too, in that the domainal governments wanted to restore public finances at Buddhists's expense, and the \"shinbutsu bunri\" offered a pretext to appropriate Buddhist lands.\n\nIt is estimated that 40,000 Buddhist temples were destroyed in Japan during this disastorous nationwide anti-Buddhist mayhem, and in certain places the percentage of Buddhist temples destroyed reached 80%.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many temples were closed during the turmoil, because it seems likely that many disappeared simply because Buddhist authorities, taking advantage of the fall of the Tokugawa, were trying to streamline the system and eliminate redundancies. Under the shogunate, obtaining the permission to open or close a temple had not been easy. However, the complete disappearance of Buddhist temples from domains like Satsuma was indeed due to the \"haibutsu kishaku\".\n\n\n"}

It was spread to Ghana actively by Ghana's Hindu Monastery headed by Swami Ghananand Saraswati and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\n\nIn 2009, of the 12,500 Hindus in Ghana, 10,000 are indigenous Africans. Swami Ghananand Saraswati has set up five temples in Ghana which have been the cornerstone of the African Hindu Monastery (AHM). The Indian community in Ghana participates in the AHM, but also has its own temples (most for the Sindhi community). ISKCON also has a fairly large presence in the nation, as do śishya (disciples) of Sathya Sai Baba. Hinduism is the fastest growing religion in Ghana.\n\nAside from the basic beliefs of Reincarnation and Karma that are attributed to a vast majority of Hindus, Ghanaian followers of Hindu tradition have a few specific beliefs and practices that are primarily emphasized. First and foremost, the primary indication that a person in Ghana is a believer of the Hindu faith is that he or she has made the decision to not include meat in their diet. This is considered a primary indicator because other Hindu practices such as prohibition from illicit sex and abstinence from alcohol are also commonly demanded by other Ghanaian religions, while the avoidance of meat is rather unusual. Ghanaian Hindus tend to avoid meat consumption due to the belief that every life is sacred and manifestation of supreme God. Eating consciously when other sources of food are available in order not to harm anyone. Stemming from this idea, the second defining belief of Hindus in Ghana is the notion that cows are sacred beings that must not be harmed, but rather revered. This belief comes from the understanding that when the Hindu deity Krishna was incarnated on Earth, he came as a cowherd. Also, the Vedic Hindu Goddess Aditi is portrayed as a cow who's milk is identified with the invigorating drink \"soma\" which is believed to nourish creation. This Ghanaian Hindu belief is also a defining one, as not only do a majority of Ghanaians eat cow's meat daily, but the remaining resources from the cow's body are also commonly used for other practical tasks in traditional Ghanaian lifestyles.\n\n"}
{"id": "27490724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27490724", "title": "Independent minyan", "text": "Independent minyan\n\nAn independent minyan is a lay-led Jewish worship and study community that has developed independently of established denominational and synagogue structures within the organized Jewish community. Some began in the late 1990s and most since the year 2000, though some are several decades older. These new groups often combine a commitment to halakha/Jewish law with egalitarianism, and strive to create worship services where traditional prayer can become \"spiritual experiences.\"\n\nThe name, minyan, comes from the Hebrew word (מנין) for the prayer quorum traditionally required for a full Jewish prayer service.\n\nScholars of religion are looking very closely at the development of these lay-led congregations, most of which are held in locations other than synagogues, although some use synagogue space while maintaining separate leadership and organizational structures. Some synagogue and Jewish community leaders take a negative position on this development, seeing the new groups as a threat to conventional synagogue and Jewish community organization.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who view the trend as extremely positive, and one that will ultimately lead to new approaches to religion and spirituality within the modern Jewish community: a \"triumphant story of day-school education and egalitarianism.\" \nJack Wertheimer, a Professor of Jewish History at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America has written that:\n\nSome sources refer to the \"independent minyan movement\", drawing a parallel between the increasing number of independent minyanim and the past creation of established Jewish denominations (known as \"movements\"). Others reject the \"movement\" terminology and refer instead to the \"independent minyan phenomenon\" or simply to \"independent minyanim\" without a collective noun, because independent minyanim are not affiliated with a set of central organizations, and do not share a religious ideology.\n\nOthers still refer to the \"independent minyan movement\", understanding \"movement\" not in the sense of Jewish religious movements, but in the sense of social movements (such as the civil rights movement, or more closely parallel, the havurah movement); or a community/cultural movement, such as the Jewish Community Center movement. Others reject this sense of \"movement\" as well, because the connotation of \"movement\" among some members of the American Jewish community is too strongly related to its use regarding \"denominations\" (a fact that has led to confusion in the case of the havurah movement), and because independent minyanim arise for a number of different reasons, so that not all can be attributed to the same \"movement\".\n\nSome (see \"2007 Spiritual Communities Study,\" below) have argued for incorporating the independent minyan model as a subcategory of a broader \"Jewish Emergent\" phenomenon (named after a parallel movement in the Christian church). \"Jewish emergent\" encompasses both the independent minyan movement and so-called \"rabbi-led emergent\" communities, such as IKAR and Kavana.\n\nRabbi Elie Kaunfer, executive director of Mechon Hadar and a rosh yeshiva (Rabbinic dean) of Yeshivat Hadar has defined today's \"independent minyan\" as a congregation meeting three requirements: (1) volunteer-led and organized with no paid clergy; (2) no denomination/movement affiliation; and (3) founded in the past 10 years. Kaunfer adds the goal of \"spiritual prayer\" to this list, noting that he himself often experienced worship services more as a \"community experience\" than as a \"spiritual one.\"\n\nKaunfer notes that Kehilat Hadar began in New York as a result of a number of young Jews who were \"looking for new ways to connect to the substance of their religion and tradition\"—but instead of becoming \"just a local minyan,\" \"it became a model of grassroots religious community that spread dramatically across the United States and Israel. That model of community came to be known as an \"independent minyan.\" An article on Kol Zimrah, another independent minyan on New York's Upper West Side, called many of the new independent minyans \"part of what some have called a Jewish spiritual renaissance, with its emphasis on personal spirituality and connection with the divine.\"\nKaunfer emphasizes that the word \"independent\" means that many of these groups developed independently in terms of volunteers coming together to create and lead it, but—in agreement with Wertheimer's assessment of these minyanim—they are not nor do they seek to be independent of the larger Jewish community in terms of their vision or self-identity. \"Quite the contrary,\" he says, \"they see themselves filling a need not being met by existing institutions, but operating within the larger Jewish map, not outside or against it.\"\n\nIn his view, the phenomenon represented by the increasingly large number of independent minyans (Hebrew: minyanim) on both the national and international scene carries an important message for Jewish community leaders:\n\nAmong American Jews, there is a significant demand for meaningful, engaged Jewish life. There is a temptation to assume that Jews – especially young adults – are only interested in surface level engagement with Jewish culture: jokes, bagels, singles events. Anything challenging, deep or smacking of religion might scare people away. This is simply not the case. Jews are in search of meaning and engagement, and they are interested in the wisdom of their own heritage. They may not find that engagement in existing institutions, but that does not mean they aren't looking for it. They are looking for more than a class; they want to build real community. They want substance, and they want the skills to own their Jewish lives.\n\nExperts like Jonathan Sarna, professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, agree, noting that the values that participants are bringing to these groups can add a new vision to the community:\n\nIt is an interesting mix between the egalitarian, pluralistic, inclusive values coming from the left and the values of learning and of observance coming from the right. They are making a new synthesis of these traditional and modern values that we haven't seen before.\n\nAri Kelman, a professor of American studies at the University of California at Davis, predicts that, \"They are going to have a huge impact, because we are living in a moment where denominations are really not very successful, particularly with these 20- and 30-somethings.\"\n\nIn 2007, Hebrew Union College sociologist Steven Cohen conducted a survey on behalf of the S3K Synagogue Studies Institute and Mechon Hadar. Based on 1354 responses to an online questionnaire, the study, co-authored by Shawn Landres, Elie Kaunfer, and Michelle Shain, found that social networking, not institutional structures, was the primary way that information about independent minyans spread. Additional findings included the fact that participants that the majority of participants had some day school education, or experience in Jewish summer camps, or college organizations like Hillel; 40% grew up in the Conservative movement; most were unmarried, and under 40; one third were male, and two thirds female; and most were \"comfortable in Hebrew.\" More than half of the respondents had spent more than four months in Israel. Additionally, most attended services at least once a month, and two thirds prayed with more than one congregation.\n\nIn terms of affiliation with one of the religious movements within Judaism, the study found that:\n\nWhile the study's findings are subject to interpretation, it is clear that the majority of participants in independent minyanim have benefited from the institutions and programs of the organized Jewish community, but are now seeking to add something new:\n\nYou can see the growth of independent minyanim as proof of the failure, or of the success, of the established U.S. Jewish community's efforts to keep the next generation involved. Those efforts include the expansion of Jewish day schools, of the on-campus Hillel movement for Jewish students, and of programs in Israel for young Jews. Independent minyan members, much more than other American Jews, are alumni of all these programs. The 2007 study showed that over half had spent four months or more in Israel for a single visit -- far above the proportion for the wider Jewish community. Yet they haven't found their place in the established synagogues. They're likely to say they are \"nondenominational\" -- a term usually, and mistakenly, taken as meaning that someone is drifting away from Judaism. Instead, they've created a traditional Judaism with an anarchic accent, in which participants expect rabbis to teach them but not to lead their services or be religious in their place.\n\nIt is also clear that participants in the minyans support the idea of Jewish community, in the United States and abroad, but think for themselves. So, for example, the study showed that the majority felt \"very emotionally attached to Israel,\" but only the minority answered yes to the question of whether they are \"always\" proud of Israel.\n\nMany independent minyanim seek approaches within traditional Jewish law as foundation for egalitarianism, and an expanded role of women both in the worship service and in the leadership structure. Jerusalem's Kehilat Shira Hadasha is credited as being the first Jewish congregation to implement an opinion by Modern Orthodox Rabbi Mendel Shapiro, whose writing, \"Qeri’at ha-Torah by Women: A Halakhic Analysis\", cites and explains some precedents for allowing women to read from the Torah. (Some minyanim, like the Leader Minyan, also in Jerusalem, had a similar practice since the 1990s, before Rabbi Shapiro's opinion was released.)\n\nAnother Modern Orthodox rabbi whose writings are frequently cited by minyanim like Shira Hadasha is Daniel Sperber. Like Shapiro, Sperber argues in \"Congregational Dignity and Human Dignity: Women and Public Torah Reading\" that many past opinions recognized that there was religious legal support for the increased participation of women, but that this participation was not allowed because it was considered in societal/sociologial terms to be an \"affront to the congregation\" (Hebrew: kevod ha-tsibur). Based on changes in society—at least within the context of the communities that make up some specific minyanim—rabbis like Shapiro and Sperber support such participation as no longer being an affront to the participants. Furthermore, Sperber argues that human dignity (Hebrew: kevod ha beriyot) should be recognized as the value that should drive changes in the participation of women in services.\n\nWhile the positions of rabbis like Shapiro and Sperber have been criticized by some others, Shapiro responds that, \"Among Jews there have been disputes throughout all the generations.\" Rabbi Shapiro, who himself prays at Shira Hadasha, adds, \"This is a synagogue where the congregants are people who are interested in religious development. We don't want to harm anyone, and we don't want others to harm us.\"\n\nIn addition to its early use of opinions like those of Shapiro and Sperber, Shira Hadasha is also generally recognized as the first independent minyan to come up with the hybrid of tradition and egalitarianism that adds to the prayer quorum requirement of ten men the additional requirement of ten women. Today, many other independent minyanim follow this approach, as well. For example, the Australian congregation Shira Melbourne notes on its website that it is \"modeled on the Shira Hadasha community in Jerusalem.\" One Los Angeles minyan, which also notes that it is \"modeled after Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem,\" takes its name from this practice, calling itself the \"Ten and Ten Minyan.\" Some other minyanim, like MigdalOr admit that they \"struggle\" with the concept, but sometimes find it impractical to implement.\n\nThough independent minyanim indeed operate independently and share no formal \"movement\" structure, there are strong informal links between these communities in different cities. Thus, many groups cite others as models, learning from and even modeling themselves after others:\n\nThe founders of these independent minyans have all learned from one another. Indeed, most know each other through networks such as the Dorot Fellowship’s alumni organization and have shared ideas and inspiration. D.C. Minyan founder Jessica Lieberman explicitly took Hadar as a model. Tiferet founder Evan Hochberg said he and his co-founders \"were inspired by Darchei Noam and by Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem. We wanted to create a safe space for people to be Orthodox and feminist at the same time.\"\n\nUltimately, the leaders of many of these groups see the commitment to tradition on the one hand, and to egalitarianism (or feminism) on the other, as the \"core values\" of the vision that gives their communities foundation—although individual participants and individual congregations take different positions on exactly \"how these values should intersect.\" For example, the website for Minyan Na'aleh in Denver, Colorado, explains:\n\nAt Minyan Na'aleh, you can expect a traditional and complete davening that is conducted mainly in Hebrew. We are completely lay-led and have no official Rabbi or affiliation with a particular movement. Our Friday night service is completely egalitarian, with men and women seated together, while Shabbat morning and some of our other services (Shavuot and Kol Nidrei ) are conducted in an Orthodox egalitarian style (women lead some, but not all, parts of the service and seating is separated by gender). Why do we conduct services differently at different times? Because adherence to tradition and egalitarianism are core values for us, and because members of our community have differing opinions about how these values should intersect.\n\nAn article about Minyan Shivyoni, in the Baka area of Jerusalem, describes how the resolution of these \"differing opinions\" often results in a process of struggle among participants that is not easy, but the goal is \"communal consensus\":\n\nAs the Minyan Shivyoni navigates the process of becoming more egalitarian, each decision begins with open communal learning on the topic of discussion. From that point, there is an e-mail follow-up, disseminating the traditional sources discussed, which lead to more ideological and value-driven missives. Then, there is a vote. \"There is a shared culture and atmosphere, even though there are great gaps between the different people in the minyan,\" [Co-founder Yair] Furstenburg said. \"People give different weight to different elements—values, custom, traditional legal texts, atmosphere.\"\n\nOne new term being used to describe the synthesis of traditional Jewish law and equal participation by men and women is \"halakhic egalitarian.\"\n\nIn addition to \"core values\" such as halakha and egalitarianism, some congregations, like Darchei Noam, in Modiin, Israel, add a \"commitment to social justice,\" as well—a concept that many participants believe includes egalitarianism, but is not limited to it.\n\nWithin the overall rubric of the independent minyan phenomenon described by experts like Wertheimer, Kaunfer, Sarna, Kelman, and others who are studying it, many independent minyanim work as active participants in The Minyan Project, an international effort to support lay-led congregations, under the leadership of New York's Mechon Hadar, an institution that developed as a result of the growth of Kehilat Hadar.\n\nIt is \"designed to empower vibrant prayer communities,\" offering one-on-one consulting, including resources and strategic planning advice, to leaders of groups around the county. In addition, it offers both on-line and traditional classes and courses. In November 2008, it facilitated a three-day leadership conference for over 90 representatives from 32 communities to create a system of networking and mutual support, in an effort to share best practices, lessons learned, and define ongoing and upcoming issues. It also held a one-day public forum at Brandeis University that attracted 120 representatives from conventional Jewish institutions, and included a keynote address in addition to eight panel discussions, involving scholars, Jewish professionals, and community worship leaders. Mechon Hadar organized another conference in April 2010 which included sessions on such issues as \"Building a Singing Community,\" \"expanding the concept\" of egalitarianism, the \"theory and practice\" of pluralism, \"empowering\" existing communities, and the challenges and rewards of holding simultaneous multiple worship services within a synagogue setting.\n\nAs part of this ongoing effort, the Minyan Project has developed a \"Halakhic Think Tank\" to provide a forum for discussion and guidance on \"crucial halakhic issues facing ... burgeoning communities, including gender, kashrut, defining relationships and boundaries with the non-Jewish world ... [and] navigating different levels of observance with the Jewish community.\"\n\nWhile many independent minyanim do not identify with any one of the Jewish religious movements, Partnership minyan is a term being used by the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA) to describe those that seek to expand the leadership role of women while still identifying themselves as part of the Modern Orthodox community, within the overall rubric of Orthodox Judaism.\n\nIn 2008, members of JOFA approached two PhD candidates in New England who were working as consultants to a number of minyanim, with the recommendation that a guide be created to help groups such as Partnership minyanim.\nThe guide is meant to help minyanim seeking halakhic justification for expansion of women in leadership roles in different areas of the service and in different ways, whether or not complete egalitarianism, equal roles, is part of the minyan's self-described vision or goals: \"While many ... minyanim aim to extend participation to women as far as Halacha permits, they are by no means egalitarian - hence the phrase 'halachic minyan' in the title of the guide, and not 'egalitarian minyan.'\"\n\n\n"}

Her father was interned in a concentration camp by the British during the South African War because of his pro-Boer leanings.[1] Irma and her younger brother, Rudi, were thus taken to Cape Town by their mother. After the war, the family returned to Germany and constant travel. This travel would influence Irma's work.\n\nIn 1913 Stern studied art in Germany at the Weimar Academy, in 1914 at the Levin-Funcke Studio and notably from 1917 with Max Pechstein, a founder of the Novembergruppe. Stern was associated with the German Expressionist painters of this period. She held her first exhibition in Berlin in 1919. In 1920 Stern returned to Cape Town with her family where she was first derided and dismissed as an artist before becoming an established artist by the 1940s.\n\nIn 1926 she married Dr Johannes Prinz, her former tutor, who subsequently became professor of German at the University of Cape Town. They were divorced in 1934.\n\nIrma Stern travelled extensively in Europe and explored Southern Africa, Zanzibar and the Congo region. These trips provided a wide range of subject matter for her paintings and gave her opportunities to acquire and assemble a collection of artifacts. Stern's dream was to travel extensively in her lifetime: in 1930 to Madeira, in 1937 and 1938 to Dakar, Senegal, 1939 Zanzibar, 1942 Congo, 1945 Zanzibar, 1946 Central Africa, 1952 Madeira, 1955 Congo, 1960 Spain and 1963 France. Stern travelled extensively in South Africa, for example in 1926 to Swaziland and Pondoland, in 1933 to Namaqualand, in 1936 generally, and in 1941 to the Eastern Cape. In 1931 she visited Madeira and Dakar, Senegal, in 1937 and 1938. Irma Stern refused to either travel or exhibit in Germany during the period 1933 - 1945. Instead, she undertook several journeys into Africa; going to Zanzibar twice in 1939 and 1945 and then planned three trips to the Congo region in 1942, 1946 and 1955. These expeditions resulted in a wealth of artistic creativity and energy as well as the publication of two illustrated journals; \"Congo\" published in 1943 and \"Zanzibar\" in 1948.\n\nAlmost one hundred solo exhibitions were held during her lifetime both in South Africa and Europe: including Germany, France, Italy and England. Although accepted in Europe, her work was unappreciated at first in South Africa where critics derided her early exhibitionsin the 1920s with reviews titled \"Art of Miss Irma Stern - Ugliness as a cult\".\n\nThe Irma Stern Museum was established in 1971 and is the house the artist lived in for almost four decades. She moved into \"The Firs\" in Rondebosch in 1927 and lived there until her death. Several of the rooms are furnished as she arranged them while upstairs there is a commercial gallery used by contemporary South African artists.\n\nOn 8 May 2000, one of her works sold at Sotheby’s South Africa in Johannesburg for an all-time record of R1.7 million. This record was soon broken, however, and in March 2007 Stern's work was sold for R6.6 million. Stern's Gladioli was sold for an all-time high of R13.3 million in October 2010, but was then followed by the sale of Bahora Girl for R26.7 million later that month - both were also records for sales of South African art at the time. A new South African record was set in March 2011, when a Stern painting sold for R34 million at Bonham's, London.\n\nOn 11 November 2012, Stern’s painting, Fishing Boats, was stolen along with four other paintings from a museum in Pretoria. A tip-off led South African police to a cemetery in Port Elizabeth where four of the five paintings were recovered from under a bench.\n\ngroen piesangs\n\n\n"}

Bau himself appears in the film's epilogue placing a stone on Oskar Schindler's grave in Jerusalem, along with his wife Rebecca.\n\nAfter Płaszów, Bau was transferred to Gross-Rosen concentration camp and then to Schindler's camp where he stayed until the end of the war, while Rebecca was sent to Auschwitz. After liberation, Bau was reunited with his wife finished his degree at University of Plastic Arts in Kraków. In 1950, he immigrated to Israel together with his wife and three-year-old daughter, Hadassah, where their other daughter, Clila, was born. He worked as a graphic artist at the Brandwein Institute in Haifa and for the government of Israel. Bau opened his own studio in 1956 in Tel Aviv, which is now a museum managed by daughters Hadassa and Clila. He was well known for creating graphic fonts and drawing titles for Israeli movies in the 1960s and 1970s. He also authored a number of Hebrew books and continued to write poetry.\n\nBau's wife Rebecca died in 1997. Bau died from pneumonia in Tel Aviv on May 24, 2002, at age 81.\n\nThe English version of Joseph Bau's memoir, \"Dear God, Have You Ever Gone Hungry?\" came out in June 1998. It was first published in Hebrew and Polish and was published in several languages, including Chinese.\n\nJoseph Bau also created his own animated films, for which he has been referred to in the press as the \"Israeli Walt Disney\" or as the \"founder of Israel's animation industry\". His paintings and drawings have been listed by Sotheby's as significant contributions to the art of the Holocaust and his works have been shown in galleries in New York, Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis.\n\nJoseph Bau's art is filtered through the prism of his own experiences. It reflects both the brutal reality of life during the war, as well as the joy and humour he observed in later years in Israel. Joseph Bau was nominated for the prestigious Israel Prize in 1998.\n\n"}

He currently serves as Professor Emeritus of Ethics, Philosophy of Religion, and Ecology at the Rio de Janeiro State University.\n\nBoff was born in Concórdia, Santa Catarina, Brazil, he entered the Franciscan Order in 1959 and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1964. He spent the following years studying for a doctorate in theology and philosophy at the University of Munich, which he received in 1970. Boff's doctoral thesis studied in what measure the Church can be a sign of the sacred and the divine in the secular world and in the process of liberation of the oppressed. He has since published his thesis as a book available in German, entitled \"Die Kirche als Sakrament im Horizont der Welterfahrung\".\n\nHis brother is the theologian Clodovis Boff.\n\nBoff became one of the best-known supporters (along with Gustavo Gutiérrez, Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino) of the early liberation theologians. He was present in the first reflections that sought to articulate indignation against poverty and marginalization with a promissory discourse on faith, leading to liberation theology. He continues to be a controversial figure in the Catholic Church, primarily for his sharp criticism of the church's hierarchy, which he sees as \"fundamentalist\", but also for his past critical support of communist régimes.\n\nBoff is critical of secular power as well of American foreign policy. He opposed the Iraq War and considered George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon's leadership to be similar to that of \"fundamentalist terrorist states.\" He also criticizes despotic rulers in the Middle East: \"Those [emirs and kings] are despotic, they do not even have a constitution. Though extremely rich, they maintain the people in poverty.\"\n\nBoff has voiced his supported for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.\n\nAuthorities in the Roman Catholic Church did not consider Boff's views of the Church's leadership acceptable. They also saw his support of liberation theology as having \"politicized everything\" and reproached his proximity to Marxism. In 1985, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, directed at that time by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), silenced him for a year for his book \"Church: Charism and Power\". He later accused Ratzinger of \"religious terrorism\".\n\nBoff was almost silenced again in 1992 by Rome, this time to prevent him from participating in the Eco-92 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which finally led him to leave the Franciscan religious order and the priestly ministry. \n\nBoff joined the international group of Catholic Scholars who in 2012 issued the Jubilee Declaration on reform of authority in the Catholic Church.\n\nFor most of his life Boff has worked as a professor in the academic fields of theology, ethics and philosophy throughout Brazil and also as lecturer in many universities abroad such as University of Lisbon, University of Barcelona, University of Lund, University of Oslo, University of Torino and others.\n\nBoff commented on the election of Pope Francis in March 2013: \"I am encouraged by this choice, viewing it as a pledge for a church of simplicity and of ecological ideals.\" He said the new pope was conservative in many respects but had liberal views on some subjects as well.\n\n\n"}

It was created to affirm the rights of local councils to hold prayers before council and committee meetings.\n\nIn 2012, Bideford Town Council held prayers as the first action at meetings. A former councillor supported by the National Secular Society challenged the Council in court over the Christian prayers which had been held traditionally since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The High Court of England and Wales held that there was no legal authority for councils to pray at their meetings as it was not specifically mentioned in the Local Government Act 1972 as not being \"conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions\". Both MPs and bishops of the Church of England condemned the decision. \n\nThe Communities Secretary Eric Pickles expressed disappointment at this judgment and signed a Parliamentary Order to bring forward the introduction of the general power of competence for principal local authorities passed as part of the Localism Act 2011. Pickles asserted that the power would permit councils to pray at their meetings, and therefore overturned the court's judgment within a week. However there was doubt as to whether Pickles' move had actually made council prayers legal as the section he had brought forward only said that councils could do anything an individual could do, but did not specifically mention prayers. The Localism Act also only applied to English councils which meant that Welsh councils were still bound by the High Court judgment.\n\nA number of councils in response to the judgment and uncertainty of the wording in the Localism Act either continued as before, removed prayers from the agenda or moved the prayers prior to meetings so that they were not a part of the formal proceedings.\n\nDespite Pickles claiming his act restored the rights of councils to hold prayers as part of official agendas, it did not apply to all councils such as some town and parish councils. Conservative Party MP Jake Berry introduced the Local Government (Religious etc. Observances) Bill as a Private Members Bill, in order to affirm the rights of all councils and authorities to hold prayers before meetings. During introduction, he called the 2011 court judgment “an aggressive and unwelcome secular attack on our British values”. The bill was supported by the Government and passed both the House of Commons and House of Lords. It received Royal Assent from Queen Elizabeth II on 26 March 2015. The legislation would be permissive and made no obligation for councillors to attend prayers if the council decided to hold them. Observers noted that the act had the effect of returning the law to the perceived \"status quo ante\" before 2011 but afforded protection against similar legal challenges.\n"}
{"id": "43645780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43645780", "title": "Mama Kin (musician)", "text": "Mama Kin (musician)\n\nDanielle Caruana, known professionally as Mama Kin, is an Australian singer-songwriter. She has released two albums, \"Beat and Holler\" and \"The Magician's Daughter\". She lives with her family in Fremantle.\n\nCaruana grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Newport, the youngest, by some years, of six siblings by parents of Maltese extraction. The family was musical and she studied classical piano from the age of five to 16. Every child in the family was expected to play an instrument and to play in the family band in church and for members of the Maltese community who visited their house. Her strongest musical influence was her sister Carmen, 14 years older, with whom she sang and who taught her to harmonise, and who introduced her to lasting musical influences: blues and gospel, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, the Pretenders and Joan Armatrading. Other family influences were country, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, the crooners, Stevie Wonder, Dr John, The Cure, The Police, Prince and Michael Jackson. Caruana says, \"I loved all of it, because my brothers and sisters were into it. I couldn't imagine a life without music\", but also that the musicality of her family inhibited her own career: \"I was completely petrified. After having grown up under two really incredibly, incredibly diverse musical brothers and a really musical family, I think I just made a decision really early on that I wasn't good enough, that I wasn't as good as them.\"\n\nCaruana first started writing songs in 2006. Prior to her solo career, she provided vocals on albums by her husband, John Butler. The Mama Kin band came about through playing with her brothers Nicky Bomba and Michael Caruana. The name Mama Kin was given her by Bomba, a former member of the John Butler Trio. Caruana says, \"we were toying with the idea of doing a creative project together called Kin. A couple of days into the process I found out I was pregnant with my second child and he called me the Mama Kin.\" When it stuck as her band name she had not heard of the Aerosmith song. Caruana, her brother Michael on keyboards and drummer George Servanis are the principal members of the Mama Kin ensemble.\n\nHer first released recording was an EP, \"Papoose\", followed by a single, \"Tore My Heart Out\", released in early 2010 and named iTunes Single of the Week. Her debut album, \"Beat and Holler\", written almost entirely on an old Wurlitzer organ and recorded at The Compound, Fremantle, was distributed by MGM in July 2010. Prior to its release Mama Kin had become a popular act at Australian music festivals supporting notably Butler, Gurrumul and The Cat Empire, and the band launched a first headline national tour in October 2010 to promote \"Beat and Holler\". Of the album Caruana has said, \"In almost every song, although it might sound like I'm talking about a partner, I'm generally talking about a part of myself.\" \"Beat and Holler\" was nominated for an AIR Award for Best Blues and Roots Album 2010.\n\nCaruana's second album, \"The Magician's Daughter\", was released in early 2013. It is named after her mother, an actual magician's daughter. Caruana's grandfather worked as a professional magician in post-World War II Malta, and her mother, Iris, was one of his assistants. The album was written mostly from home and recorded at The Compound. It was produced by Jan Skubiszewski. \"The Magician's Daughter\" was nominated for a 2013 ARIA Award for Best Blues & Roots Album.\n\nCaruna joined with Tommy Spender from Offcutts to form Mama Kin Spender. They released their debut album \"Golden Magnetic\" in 2018 and it was nominated for the 2018 ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album.\n\nCaruana contributes to philanthropic activities in the fields of indigenous and environmental rights.\n\nIn February 2011 John Butler and Caruana performed as Brave and the Bird at the annual Gimme Shelter fundraising event for the homeless at the Fremantle Arts Centre, their set introduced by Kevin Rudd.\n\nThe Seed Fund, originally the JB Seed Fund, was set up in 2005 by Butler, Caruana and others with an initial donation of A$80,000, to help artists and musicians become self-sustained. Its flagship project is the Management Workshop, in which 25 emerging managers have three days of workshops with experienced industry managers of internationally known Australian bands. Caruana says the main motivation behind creating the organisation is to create community within the music industry.\n\nCaruana met John Butler in Fremantle, Western Australia and they were married in Broome in 1999. Their home is in Fremantle. They have a daughter, Banjo, and a son, Jahli. Both children play music and Caruana credits having them, along with the Seed Fund, with starting her musical career. Of her musical relationship with her husband, she has said, \"I love and respect his opinion, but we definitely have different tastes in music.\" Prior to beginning her solo musical career Caruana suffered from depression, an experience that has informed her songwriting and which she ascribes to her suppression of her musicality. She reports that one of her biggest discoveries was Transcendental Meditation and that, \"When I first started this practice I remember thinking 'Oh, this is what sanity must feel like.'\"\n\nThe John Butler Trio song \"Daniella\" is about Caruana.\n\n"}
{"id": "17492789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17492789", "title": "Mary Help of Christians", "text": "Mary Help of Christians\n\nMary Help of Christians (; ; Filipino: \"Maria, Mapag-ampon sa mga Kristiyano\"), is a Roman Catholic Marian devotion with a feast day celebrated on May 24. \n\nSaint John Chrysostom was the first person to use this Marian title in year 345 as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. Don Bosco also propagated Marian devotion under this title. The title of \"Mary Help of Christians\" is associated with the defense of Christian Europe (Latin and Greek), the north of Africa and the Middle East from non-Christian peoples during the Middle Age. \n\nIn 1572, during the expansion of the Islamic Ottoman Empire intended to invade Christian Europe, Pope Pius V invoked Christian armies and its victory achieved was consequently attributed to the intercession of Mary under this title. Ultimately, Pope Leo XIII granted a Canonical coronation towards the Marian image bearing the same title on 17 May 1903, now permanently enshrined within the Basilica of Mary Help of Christians.\n\nThere are two inscriptions of the first centuries of Christianity in Greek related to the Virgin Mary: : θεοτοκος (Teotokos, Theotokos, Mother of God) and βοηθεια (Boetheia, the Helper). The Fathers of the Church referred to Mary as \"βοηθεια\". John Chrysostom used the title in a homily of 345, Proclus in 476 and Sebas of Caesarea in 532. After the Patristic period (5th century), other persons used it like Romanos the Melodist in 518, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius in 560, John of Damascus in 749 and German of Constantinople in 733.\n\nIn the view of Fr. Johann G. Roten, SM, the invocation of Mary as Help of Christians is part of the oldest prayer addressed directly to Mary, the \"Sub tuum praesidium\", which was found on a papyrus dating, at the latest, from the end of the 3rd century. \"Praesidium\" is translated as \"an assistance given in time of war by fresh troops in a strong manner.\"\n\nAround 1576, Bernardino Cirillo, archpriest of Loreto, published at Macerata two litanies of the Blessed Virgin, which, he contended, were used at Loreto. One is in a form which is entirely different from our present text. Another form (\"Aliae litaniae B.M.V.\") is identical to the litany of Loreto approved by Pope Clement VIII in 1601 and now used throughout the entire Church. This second form contains the invocation \"Auxilium Christianorum\". Possibly warriors returning from the Battle of Lepanto (October 7, 1571) visited the sanctuary of Loreto, and saluted the Holy Virgin there for the first time with this new title. It is more probable, however, that it is only a variation of the older invocation \"Advocata Christianorum\", found in a litany of 1524.\n\nTorsellini (1597) and the Roman Breviary (May 24, Appendix) say that Pope Pius V inserted the invocation in the litany of Loreto after the battle of Lepanto. But the form of the litany in which it is first found was unknown at Rome at the time of Pius V.\n\nThe feast of \"Our Lady, Help of Christians\", was instituted by Pope Pius VII. By order of Napoleon I of France, Pius VII was arrested on June 5, 1808, and detained a prisoner first at Grenoble, and then at Fontainebleau. In January 1814, after the battle of Leipzig, he was brought back to Savona and set free on March 17, on the eve of the feast of Our Lady of Mercy, the Patroness of Savona. The journey to Rome was a veritable triumphal march. The pontiff, attributing the victory of the Church after so much agony and distress to the Blessed Virgin, visited many of her sanctuaries on the way and crowned her images (e.g., the \"Madonna del Monte\" at Cesena, \"della Misericordia\" at Treja, \"della Colonne\" and \"della Tempestà\" at Tolentino). The people crowded the streets to catch a glimpse of the venerable pontiff who had so bravely withstood the threats of Napoleon. He entered Rome on May 24, 1814, and was enthusiastically welcomed. To commemorate his own sufferings and those of the Church during his exile Pope Pius VII extended the feast of the Seven Dolours of Mary to the universal Church on September 18, 1814.\n\nWhen Napoleon left Elba and returned to Paris, Murat was about to march through the Papal States from Naples; Pius VII fled to Savona 22 March 1815. After the Congress of Vienna and the battle of Waterloo, the Pope returned to Rome on July 7, 1815. To give thanks to God and Our Lady, on 15 September 1815 he declared 24 May, the anniversary of his first return, to be henceforth the feast of \"Our Lady, Help of Christians\"; the 1913 Catholic Encyclopaedia article commented that \"it has spread nearly over the entire Latin Church, but is not contained in the universal calendar.\"\n\nThe Marian feast was celebrated by the order of Servites since the 17th century. The veneration to Mary became popular under this title in Rome especially, where the feast was especially promoted by Saint John Bosco and Saint Vincent Pallotti St. John Bosco was an ardent promoter of devotion to \"Mary, Help of Christians\". He even built a huge Basilica in her honour in 1868 and founded a religious Congregation for women, under the title of, \"The Daughters of Mary, Help of Christians\". Interpreting the painting he had commissioned inside the Basilica, St. John Bosco referred to it as depicting Mary Mother of the Church. This suggests an identical connection to how popes have addressed Mary as both Mother and Help of the Church. Recall the two Marian Greek attribution of θεοτοκος (Teotokos, Theotokos, Mother of God) and βοηθεια (Boetheia, the Helper) at the start of this article?\nSt. John Bosco infact, chose this devotion because of its affinity to his devotion to the Church the bearer of Christ. \n\nVatican II, in the Constitution on the Church (sections 61, 62), cites this title of Mary, placing it in the context of Mary's maternal role. \"In an utterly singular way she co-operated by her obedience, faith, hope and burning charity in the Saviour's work of restoring supernatural life to souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the order of grace…By her maternal charity, Mary cares for the brethren of her Son who still wander through this world in the midst of dangers and difficulties until they are led to the happiness of their heavenly home\".\n\nThe Church has traditionally focused on two aspects of Our Lady's help on this feast day. Firstly, the Church focuses in this feast upon the role of Our Lady's intercession in the fight against sin in the life of a believer. Secondly, the Church has focused upon Our Lady as one who assists Christians as a community, through her intercession, in fighting against anti-Christian forces.\n\nMichael Daniel observes that while this approach may be regarded as outdated, in light of Vatican II, where the world and non Christians elements therein were seen in a positive rather than a hostile or threatening light, it would seem that it would be naïve on the part of Christians to regard all movements and all social trends as either good or harmless.\n\nThe dioceses of Tuscany adopted it on February 12, 1816. The hymns of the Office were composed by Brandimarte.\n\nIt became the patronal feast of Australasia, a double of the first class with an octave; after the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, it was designated a Solemnity, to be kept on the first available Sunday on or after 24 May.\n\nThe Fathers of the Foreign Missions of Paris, in accordance with a vow (1891), celebrated this feast with great splendor in their churches.\n\nIt has attained special renown since Don Bosco, founder of the Salesian Congregation, dedicated his foundation to \"Our Lady, Help of Christians\", the mother church of his congregation at Turin on June 9, 1868. The Salesians have carried the devotion to their numerous establishments.\n\nIt was established due to the great appreciation of Saint Don Bosco for this Marian title and the development of the Salesian works in many countries since the second half of the 19th century. Although it is commonly associated with the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church has also known the devotion since 1030 in Ukraine, when the country was defended from a barbarian invasion.\n\nThe Salesian National Shrine of Our Lady Help of Christians is located in Stony Point, New York. There is also the National Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Parañaque City, Philippines , and is also in the care of the Salesians of Don Bosco \n\nThe Abbey of Mary Help of Christians, better known as Belmont Abbey, is a small American monastery of Benedictine monks in the town of Belmont, Gaston County, North Carolina, outside of Charlotte, North Carolina. The minor basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThere is a chapel of Our Lady Help of Christians at the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Washington D.C.\n\nUnder this title, the Virgin Mary is venerated by many Chinese Catholics, particularly at the Shrine of our Lady of Sheshan. In May 2007, Pope Benedict XVI designated her May 24 feast for the Roman Catholics in China, who face persecution and restriction from the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.\n\n\n\n"}

She was executed on 2 November 2001 at the age of 45, after being convicted of the murder of a politician, Mazlan Idris, in 1993.\n\nAfter leaving the music business, she became involved in black magic activities and was known to be a \"bomoh\", a local shaman. She began offering her services to clients, mostly from the upper-class society. She also claimed to have provided politician clients in the ruling party with a variety of charms and talismans.\n\nIt was reported that Mazlan Idris, a state assemblyman for the constituency of Batu Talam in the state of Pahang, wanted to boost his political career and sought the services of Mona for assistance. Mazlan was educated in the United States and was an ambitious politician from the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party. At that time, Mona worked with her husband Mohamad Nor Affandi Abdul Rahman, 44, and their assistant Juraimi Hassan, 31. Mona and her husband promised to help Mazlan by giving him a talisman consisting of a cane and \"sbatmi\" headgear which was supposedly owned by former Indonesian President Sukarno. Mona convinced Mazlan that he would be \"invincible\" if he held the talisman. In return, Mona demanded RM 2.5 million. Mazlan paid the couple RM 500,000 as deposit, and gave them 10 land titles as surety for the remaining RM 2 million.\n\nAn appointment was made for cleansing rituals to be performed at Mona's house. Mazlan was told to lie on the floor face up while Mona placed flowers on him. She then told Mazlan to close his eyes and wait for the money to \"fall from the sky\". Juraimi then, using an axe, chopped Mazlan's head off. They also dismembered and partially skinned Mazlan's body. His body was found in 18 parts buried in a storeroom near Mona's house in Kampung Peruas, Ulu Dong, Raub Pahang.\n\nMazlan was reported missing on 2nd July 1993 after withdrawing RM 300,000 from a bank. After the murder, Mona was reported to have been on a shopping spree where she bought a Mercedes-Benz and had a facelift. It was alleged that the murder occurred between 10:00 PM and 12 midnight on 18 July 1993. On 22 July 1993, police found Mazlan's body; Mona, her husband, and Juraimi were arrested and a highly publicised trial began. They were tried in Temerloh High Court by a 7-person jury (trial by jury was abolished from 1 January 1995). The High Court found all three of them guilty and sentenced them to death by hanging. Mona and the others filed appeals to the Federal Court and in 1999 the court dismissed their appeals and upheld the death sentence. Finally, the three convicts sought to obtain a pardon or clemency from the Pardons Board of Pahang, their final chance redemption. However, the board refused to give clemency. The three were given a last meal of KFC on the night before their execution. Mona, Affandy, and Juraimi were finally hanged on 2 November 2001 at Kajang Prison. A prison official said the trio expressed no remorse at the pre-dawn execution.\n\nThroughout the trial, Mona exhibited strange behaviour including appearing cheerful, constantly smiling and posing for press photographers. She dressed extravagantly with bright and colourful designs on her dress. She also remarked, \"looks like I have many fans\". It was also reported that during her execution she uttered the words \"aku takkan mati\", meaning \"I will never die\", and was still calm and smiling. The last female executed in Malaysia had been Tan Bee Lee in 1994 for a drug trafficking offence.\n\nMona Fandey gained more notoriety than she had been when she was still a pop singer. There was wide local and even international media coverage and plenty of public interest. Anti-death penalty movements including Amnesty International voiced their opposition to the execution of the trio. In 2002, Malaysian film director Amir Muhammad made a short film entitled \"Mona\" in his \"6horts\" series. \n\nIn 2006, a film by Dain Iskandar Said entitled \"Dukun\" was widely assumed to be based on Mona Fandey. The public screening of this highly anticipated film was constantly pushed back, most likely due to concerns relating to the contents of the film, the relationship with Mona Fandey, and the implications for her family. However, the movie was leaked online through Facebook early February 2018. The movie has now been set for release in cinemas from 5 April 2018.\n\nThe Mona Fandey affair was one of the last jury trials to be conducted in Malaysia. The sensational nature of the case contributed toward the government's decision to discontinue the jury system. All trials by jury were abolished on 1 January 1995.\n\n \n"}

It is a very potent variety of tobacco. The high concentration of nicotine in its leaves makes it useful for producing pesticides.\n\n\"Nicotiana rustica\" is often used for entheogenic purposes by South American shamans. It contains up to nine times more nicotine than common species of \"Nicotiana\" such as \"Nicotiana tabacum\" (common tobacco). Other reasons for its shamanic use are the comparatively high levels of beta-carbolines, including the harmala alkaloids harmane and norharmane. Most commonly, in South American ethnobotanical preparations, it is allowed to soak or be infused in water, and the water is then insufflated into the stomach in a preparation known as \"singado\" or \"singa\"; it is also smoked in cigars, used as an enema, made into a lickable product known as \"ambil\", and made into a snuff with the bark of a species of \"Theobroma\", creating \"nu-nu\". In the southeast part of Turkey, people use this herb and ashes of some tree bodies to make a moist snuff called \"maraş otu\". They use this by putting the mixture under their lips like Swedish snus or Afghan naswar. It is also a common admixture of Ayahuasca in some parts of the Amazon.\n\n\"N. rustica\" is no longer cultivated in its native North America, as \"N. tabacum\" has replaced it. In Russia, \"N. rustica\" is called \"makhorka\" (махорка). Historically, makhorka was smoked mainly by the lower classes. \"N. rustica\" is a hardy plant and can be grown in most of Russia (as opposed to \"N. virginiana\" which requires a warm climate), it was more readily and cheaply available, and did not depend on transport in a country with an underdeveloped road network and climatic portage problems. This remained the case until ordinary tobacco became widely available in the 20th Century. During Soviet times, rustic tobacco was an important industrial crop of agriculture. In those times, dozens of varieties were bred, some of them considered equal in quality to \"N. virginiana\". In modern times, makhorka is still sometimes smoked by peasants and farmers due to its high availability and being almost for free for them.\n\n\"N. rustica\" leaves have a nicotine content as high as 9%, whereas \"N. tabacum\" leaves contain about 1 to 3%.\n\nIn Vietnam, it is most commonly smoked after a meal on a full stomach to \"aid in digestion\", or along with green tea or local beer (most commonly the cheap \"bia hơi\"). A \"hít\" of thuốc lào is followed by a flood of nicotine to the bloodstream inducing strong dizziness that lasts several seconds. It should be said, however, that even heavy cigarette smokers have had trouble with the intense volume of smoke and the high nicotine content, and that side effects include nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe main difference between smoking thuốc lào and the use of other tobaccos is in the method of consumption, in that thuốc lào is consumed with a water pipe. The smoker is presented with either a bamboo pipe called a \"điếu cày\" (English: \"farmer's pipe\") or a ceramic hookah called a \"điếu bát\". It may also occasionally be smoked in a more uncommon pipe known as a \"điếu ống\". The pipe is filled with an appropriate amount of water and a small amount of thuốc lào is pressed into the bowl.\n\nOne then ignites the tobacco and inhales to create a body of smoke inside the pipe, before exhaling the smoke, reversing the process of air in the pipe by blowing into it to pop out the tobacco. The smoker then sharply inhales, usually tilting the pipe upwards to an almost horizontal position (but not completely, as the water would drain out of the mouth).\n\nMaraş otu (English: Maraş weed) is a chewing variant of \"Nicotiana rustica\". Commonly used by people who live in Maraş, Turkey. Maraş Otu is a mix of Oak tree ash and \"Nicotiana rustica\" that resembles henna. It is recognized as a drug by anti-drug activists. It can contribute to mouth cancers.\n"}

Young Serer boys in the \"Ndut\" (nest) were required to compose religious songs during their circumcision rite of passage in order to take their minds off the pending circumcision operation, develop their artistic skills and spirituality. These songs are Serer religious in nature. The Njuup tradition is the progenitor of Mbalax and for a long part of its history has remained within the confines of the \"Ndut\". Unlike the \"Mbalax\" which is a party music, the Njuup tradition is religious, and it was not until some prominent Senegalese artists such Youssou N'Dour (himself of Serer heritage) began to incorporate it in their early works thereby giving birth to the \"Mbalax\" music. All Mbalax artists are strongly influenced by the Njuup tradition. There are also other Senegambian artists who sing the purest form of Njuup in the Serer language, some of these include Rémi Jegaan Dioh, the late Serer diva - Yandé Codou Sène, etc.\n\nThe Serer religion especially the veneration of certain Serer Pangool influenced the religious songs sang in the Ndut such as the Njuup, which in turn influenced the Mbalax and who specializes in Mbalax i.e. Mbaye Dieye Faye, Youssou N'Dour, Thione Seck, etc.\n\n\n"}

These bacteria can produce novel enzymes that allow them to feed on by-products of nylon manufacture which did not exist prior to the invention of nylon in the 1930s. Critics of creationism have argued that this contradicts creationist claims that no new information can be added to a genome by mutation, and that proteins are too complex to evolve through a process of mutation and natural selection. Creationists have posted responses to these challenges on their own websites, which have in turn generated more responses from their critics.\n\nThe issue was first raised by critics of creationism such as the National Center for Science Education, and New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) who stated that research refutes claims made by creationists and intelligent design proponents. The claims were that random mutation and natural selection can never add new information to a genome and that the odds against a useful new protein, such as an enzyme, arising through a process of random mutation would be prohibitively high.\n\nPhysicist Dave Thomas, the President of NMSR, has stated that gene duplication and frame-shift mutations were powerful sources of random mutation. In particular, in response to comments by creationists such as Don Batten, NMSR has stated that it was these mutations that gave rise to nylonase, even if the genes were part of a plasmid as suggested by Batten.\n\nProponents of creationism, such as Answers in Genesis and Creation Ministries International, have cited analyses posted by Don Batten that cited scientific research that showed the genes involved were on a plasmid, and stated that the phenomenon is evidence that plasmids in bacteria are a designed feature intended to allow bacteria to adapt easily to new food sources or cope with toxic chemicals. Batten stated\nIt seems clear that plasmids are designed features of bacteria that enable adaptation to new food sources or the degradation of toxins. The details of just how they do this remains to be elucidated. The results so far clearly suggest that these adaptations did not come about by chance mutations, but by some designed mechanism.\n\nOpponents of creationism have dismissed Batten's analysis. NMSR has stated that the gene duplication and frame-shift mutations that gave rise to nylonase were powerful sources of random mutation, whether or not the genes were part of a plasmid as suggested by Batten. A posting at TalkOrigins Archive by Ian Musgrave states that bacteria carry many genes in plasmids, particularly those involved in xenobiotic handling or metabolic functions. He states that in \"Pseudomonas\", most of the xenobiotic degradation genes are on plasmids. Therefore it is entirely likely that a xenobiotic handling enzyme will arise from mutations of xenobiotic handling genes. The fact that these genes are on plasmids does not invalidate the fact that they exist, and exist only in two strains of bacteria. Musgrave also criticized Batten for mis-stating the conclusions of some of the authors of the scientific literature on nylon eating bacteria.\n\nMSNBC published an editorial from science writer Ker Than that stated that the evolution of the enzymes, known as nylonase, produced by nylon-eating bacteria was a compelling argument against the claim made by intelligent design proponents that specified complexity required an intelligent designer, since nylonase function was both specified and complex. The intelligent design proponent William Dembski posted a response that questioned whether the genetic changes that produced nylonase were complex enough to be considered specified complexity. Ken Miller said that intelligent design proponents claim that we can't see either design or evolution taking place and that therefore, according to the design proponents, intelligent design and evolution are both just matters of faith or world view. However, Miller said, the evolution of the enzyme nylonase, which scientists were able to repeat in the lab with another strain of bacteria, is one of a number of cases that show that evolution can be observed as it occurs.\n\n"}

{"id": "69596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69596", "title": "Pharisees", "text": "Pharisees\n\nThe Pharisees () were at various times a political party, a social movement, and a school of thought in the Holy Land during the time of Second Temple Judaism. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism.\n\nConflicts between Pharisees and Sadducees took place in the context of much broader and longstanding social and religious conflicts among Jews, made worse by the Roman conquest. Another conflict was cultural, between those who favored Hellenization (the Sadducees) and those who resisted it (the Pharisees). A third was juridico-religious, between those who emphasized the importance of the Second Temple with its rites and services, and those who emphasized the importance of other Mosaic Laws. A fourth point of conflict, specifically religious, involved different interpretations of the Torah and how to apply it to current Jewish life, with Sadducees recognizing only the Written Torah (with Greek philosophy) and rejecting doctrines such as the Oral Torah, the Prophets, the Writings, and the resurrection of the dead.\n\nJosephus (37 – c. 100 CE), believed by many historians to be a Pharisee, estimated the total Pharisee population before the fall of the Second Temple to be around 6,000. Josephus claimed that Pharisees received the full support and goodwill of the common people, apparently in contrast to the more elite Sadducees, who were the upper class. Pharisees claimed Mosaic authority for their interpretation of Jewish Laws, while Sadducees represented the authority of the priestly privileges and prerogatives established since the days of Solomon, when Zadok, their ancestor, officiated as High Priest. The phrase \"common people\" in Josephus' writings suggests that most Jews were \"just Jewish people\", distinguishing them from the main liturgical groups.\n\nOutside Jewish history and literature, Pharisees have been made notable by references in the New Testament to conflicts with John the Baptist and with Jesus. There are also several references in the New Testament to the Apostle Paul being a Pharisee. The relationship between Early Christianity and Pharisees was not always hostile however: e.g. Gamaliel is often cited as a Pharisaic leader who was sympathetic to Christians.\n\n\"Pharisee\" is derived from Ancient Greek \"Pharisaios\" (), from Aramaic \"Pərīšā\" (), plural \"Pərīšayyā\" (), meaning \"set apart, separated\", related to Hebrew \"pārûš\" (), plural \"pĕrûšîm\" (), the Qal passive participle of the verb \"pāraš\" ().\n\nThe first historical mention of the Pharisees and their beliefs comes in the four gospels and the Book of Acts, in which both their meticulous adherence to their interpretation of the Torah as well as their eschatological views are described. A later historical mention of the Pharisees comes from the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus (37–100 CE) in a description of the \"four schools of thought\", or \"four sects\", into which he divided the Jews in the 1st century CE. (The other schools were the Essenes, who were generally apolitical and who may have emerged as a sect of dissident priests who rejected either the Seleucid-appointed or the Hasmonean high priests as illegitimate; the Sadducees, the main antagonists of the Pharisees; and the \"fourth philosophy\".) Other sects emerged at this time, such as the Early Christians in Jerusalem and the Therapeutae in Egypt.\n\n2 Maccabees, a deuterocanonical book of the Bible, focuses on the Jews' revolt against the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes and concludes with the defeat of his general, Nicanor, in 161 BCE by Judas Maccabeus, the hero of the work. It was likely written by a Pharisee or someone sympathetic toward Pharisees, as it includes several theological innovations: propitiatory prayer for the dead, judgment day, intercession of saints and merits of the martyrs.\n\nJudah haNasi redacted the Mishnah, an authoritative codification of Pharisaic interpretations, around 200 CE. Most of the authorities quoted in the Mishnah lived after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE; it thus marks the beginning of the transition from Pharisaic to Rabbinic Judaism. The Mishnah was supremely important because it compiled the oral interpretations and traditions of the Pharisees and later on the Rabbis into a single authoritative text, thus allowing oral tradition within Judaism to survive the destruction of the Second Temple.\n\nHowever, none of the Rabbinic sources include identifiable eyewitness accounts of the Pharisees and their teachings.\n\nThe deportation and exile of an unknown number of Jews of the ancient Kingdom of Judah to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar II, starting with the first deportation in 597 BCE and continuing after the fall of Jerusalem and destruction of the Temple in 587 BCE, resulted in dramatic changes to Jewish culture and religion. During the 70-year exile in Babylon, Jewish houses of assembly (known in Hebrew as a \"beit knesset\" or in Greek as a \"synagogue\") and houses of prayer (Hebrew \"Beit Tefilah\"; Greek προσευχαί, \"proseuchai\") were the primary meeting places for prayer, and the house of study (\"beit midrash\") was the counterpart for the synagogue.\n\nIn 539 BCE the Persians conquered Babylon, and in 537 BCE Cyrus the Great allowed Jews to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple. He did not, however, allow the restoration of the Judean monarchy, which left the Judean priests as the dominant authority. Without the constraining power of the monarchy, the authority of the Temple in civic life was amplified. It was around this time that the Sadducee party emerged as the party of priests and allied elites. However, the Second Temple, which was completed in 515 BCE, had been constructed under the auspices of a foreign power, and there were lingering questions about its legitimacy. This provided the condition for the development of various sects or \"schools of thought,\" each of which claimed exclusive authority to represent \"Judaism,\" and which typically shunned social intercourse, especially marriage, with members of other sects. In the same period, the council of sages known as the Sanhedrin may have codified and canonized the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), from which, following the return from Babylon, the Torah was read publicly on market-days.\n\nThe Temple was no longer the only institution for Jewish religious life. After the building of the Second Temple in the time of Ezra the Scribe, the houses of study and worship remained important secondary institutions in Jewish life. Outside Judea, the synagogue was often called a house of prayer. While most Jews could not regularly attend the Temple service, they could meet at the synagogue for morning, afternoon and evening prayers. On Mondays, Thursdays and Shabbats, a weekly Torah portion was read publicly in the synagogues, following the tradition of public Torah readings instituted by Ezra.\n\nAlthough priests controlled the rituals of the Temple, the scribes and sages, later called \"rabbis\" (\"Heb.\": \"Teacher/master\"), dominated the study of the Torah. These men maintained an oral tradition that they believed had originated at Mount Sinai alongside the Torah of Moses; a God-given interpretation of the Torah.\n\nThe Hellenistic period of Jewish history began when Alexander the Great conquered Persia in 332 BCE. The rift between the priests and the sages developed during this time, when Jews faced new political and cultural struggles. After Alexander's death in 323 BCE, Judea was ruled by the Egyptian-Hellenic Ptolemies until 198 BCE, when the Syrian-Hellenic Seleucid Empire, under Antiochus III, seized control. Then, in 167 BCE, the Seleucid king Antiochus IV invaded Judea, entered the Temple, and stripped it of money and ceremonial objects. He imposed a program of forced Hellenization, requiring Jews to abandon their own laws and customs, thus precipitating the Maccabean Revolt. Jerusalem was liberated in 165 BCE and the Temple was restored. In 141 BCE an assembly of priests and others affirmed Simon Maccabeus as high priest and leader, in effect establishing the Hasmonean dynasty.\n\nAfter defeating the Seleucid forces, Judas Maccabaeus's nephew John Hyrcanus established a new monarchy in the form of the priestly Hasmonean dynasty in 152 BCE, thus establishing priests as political as well as religious authorities. Although the Hasmoneans were considered heroes for resisting the Seleucids, their reign lacked the legitimacy conferred by descent from the Davidic dynasty of the First Temple era.\n\nThe Pharisee (\"separatist\") party emerged largely out of the group of scribes and sages. Their name comes from the Hebrew and Aramaic \"parush\" or \"parushi\", which means \"one who is separated.\" It may refer to their separation from Gentiles, sources of ritual impurity or from irreligious Jews. The Pharisees, among other Jewish sects, were active from the middle of the second century BCE until the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus (\"Ant.\" xiii. 5, § 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) \"outside\" the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.\n\nJosephus indicates that the Pharisees received the backing and good-will of the common people, apparently in contrast to the more elite Sadducees associated with the ruling classes. In general, whereas the Sadducees were aristocratic monarchists, the Pharisees were eclectic, popular, and more democratic. (Roth 1970: 84) The Pharisaic position is exemplified by the assertion that \"A learned \"mamzer\" takes precedence over an ignorant High Priest.\" (A \"mamzer\", according to the Pharisaic definition, is an outcast child born of a forbidden relationship, such as adultery or incest, in which marriage of the parents could not lawfully occur. The word is often, but incorrectly, translated as \"illegitimate\".)\n\nSadducees rejected the Pharisaic tenet of an Oral Torah. In their personal lives this often meant an excessively stringent lifestyle from a Jewish perspective, as they did away with the oral tradition, and in turn the Pharisaic understanding of the Torah, creating two Jewish understandings of the Torah. An example of this differing approach is the interpretation of, \"an eye in place of an eye\". The Pharisaic understanding was that the value of an eye was to be paid by the perpetrator. In the Sadducees' view the words were given a more literal interpretation, in which the offender's eye would be removed. From the point of view of the Pharisees, the Sadducees wished to change the Jewish understanding of the Torah, to a Greek understanding of the Torah. The Pharisees preserved the Pharisaical oral law in the form of the Talmud. They would become the foundation of Rabbinic Judaism.\n\nThe sages of the Talmud see a direct link between themselves and the Pharisees, and historians generally consider Pharisaic Judaism to be the progenitor of Rabbinic Judaism, that is normative, mainstream Judaism after the destruction of the Second Temple. All \"mainstream\" forms of Judaism today consider themselves heirs of Rabbinic Judaism and, ultimately, the Pharisees.\n\nAlthough the Pharisees did not support the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when a Pharisee named Eleazar insulted the Hasmonean ethnarch John Hyrcanus at his own table, suggesting that he should abandon his role as High Priest due to a rumour, probably untrue, that he had been conceived while his mother was a prisoner of war. In response, he distanced himself from the Pharisees.\n\nAfter the death of John Hyrcanus his younger son Alexander Jannaeus made himself king and openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees. However, on his deathbed Jannaeus advised his widow, Salome Alexandra, to seek reconciliation with the Pharisees. Her brother was Shimon ben Shetach, a leading Pharisee. Josephus attests that Salome was favorably inclined toward the Pharisees, and their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the Sanhedrin or Jewish Council, which they came to dominate.\n\nAfter her death her elder son Hyrcanus II was generally supported by the Pharisees. Her younger son, Aristobulus II, was in conflict with Hyrcanus, and tried to seize power. The Pharisees seemed to be in a vulnerable position at this time.\n\nThe conflict between the two sons culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey intervened, and captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE.\n\nJosephus' account may overstate the role of the Pharisees. He reports elsewhere that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Queen Salome Alexandra (JW.1.110). As Josephus was himself a Pharisee, his account might represent a historical creation meant to elevate the status of the Pharisees during the height of the Hasmonean Dynasty.\n\nLater texts like the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings by rabbis, some of whom are believed to be from among the Pharisees, concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. In their day, the influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people was strong and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many.\n\nAccording to Josephus, the Pharisees appeared before Pompey asking him to interfere and restore the old priesthood while abolishing the royalty of the Hasmoneans altogether (\"Ant.\" xiv. 3, § 2). Pharisees also opened Jerusalem's gates to the Romans, and actively supported them against the Sadducean faction. When the Romans finally broke the entrance to the Jerusalem's Temple, the Pharisees killed the priests who were officiating the Temple services on Saturday. They regarded Pompey's defilement of the Temple in Jerusalem as a divine punishment of Sadducean misrule. Pompey ended the monarchy in 63 BCE and named Hyrcanus II high priest and ethnarch (a lesser title than \"king\"). Six years later Hyrcanus was deprived of the remainder of political authority and ultimate jurisdiction was given to the Proconsul of Syria, who ruled through Hyrcanus's Idumaean associate Antipater, and later Antipater's two sons Phasael (military governor of Judea) and Herod (military governor of Galilee). In 40 BCE Aristobulus's son Antigonus overthrew Hyrcanus and named himself king and high priest, and Herod fled to Rome.\n\nIn Rome, Herod sought the support of Mark Antony and Octavian, and secured recognition by the Roman Senate as king, confirming the termination of the Hasmonean dynasty. According to Josephus, Sadducean opposition to Herod led him to treat the Pharisees favorably (\"Ant.\" xiv. 9, § 4; xv. 1, § 1; 10, § 4; 11, §§ 5–6). Herod was an unpopular ruler, perceived as a Roman puppet. Despite his restoration and expansion of the Second Temple, Herod’s notorious treatment of his own family and of the last Hasmonaeans further eroded his popularity. According to Josephus, the Pharisees ultimately opposed him and thus fell victims (4 BCE) to his bloodthirstiness (\"Ant.\" xvii. 2, § 4; 6, §§ 2–4). The family of Boethus, whom Herod had raised to the high-priesthood, revived the spirit of the Sadducees, and thenceforth the Pharisees again had them as antagonists (\"Ant.\" xviii. 1, § 4).\n\nWhile it stood, the Second Temple remained the center of Jewish ritual life. According to the Torah, Jews were required to travel to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices at the Temple three times a year: Pesach (Passover), Shavuot (the Feast of Weeks), and Sukkot (the Feast of Tabernacles). The Pharisees, like the Sadducees, were politically quiescent, and studied, taught, and worshiped in their own way. At this time serious theological differences emerged between the Sadducees and Pharisees. The notion that the sacred could exist outside the Temple, a view central to the Essenes, was shared and elevated by the Pharisees.\n\nAt first the values of the Pharisees developed through their sectarian debates with the Sadducees; then they developed through internal, non-sectarian debates over the law as an adaptation to life without the Temple, and life in exile, and eventually, to a more limited degree, life in conflict with Christianity. These shifts mark the transformation of Pharisaic to Rabbinic Judaism. \n\nNo single tractate of the key Rabbinic texts, the Mishnah and the Talmud, is devoted to theological issues; these texts are concerned primarily with interpretations of Jewish law, and anecdotes about the sages and their values. Only one chapter of the Mishnah deals with theological issues; it asserts that three kinds of people will have no share in \"the world to come:\" those who deny the resurrection of the dead, those who deny the divinity of the Torah, and Epicureans (who deny divine supervision of human affairs). Another passage suggests a different set of core principles: normally, a Jew may violate \"any\" law to save a life, but in Sanhedrin 74a, a ruling orders Jews to accept martyrdom rather than violate the laws against idolatry, murder, or adultery. (Judah haNasi, however, said that Jews must \"be meticulous in small religious duties as well as large ones, because you do not know what sort of reward is coming for any of the religious duties,\" suggesting that all laws are of equal importance). In comparison with Christianity, the Rabbis were not especially concerned with the messiah or claims about the messiah or ranking the laws in importance.\n\nOne belief central to the Pharisees was shared by all Jews of the time is monotheism. This is evident in the practice of reciting the \"Shema\", a prayer composed of select verses from the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4), at the Temple and in synagogues; the \"Shema\" begins with the verses, \"Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is one.\" According to the Mishna, these passages were recited in the Temple along with the twice-daily \"Tamid\" offering; Jews in the diaspora, who did not have access to the Temple, recited these passages in their houses of assembly. According to the Mishnah and Talmud, the men of the Great Assembly instituted the requirement that Jews both in Judea and in the diaspora pray three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening), and include in their prayers a recitation of these passages in the morning (\"Shacharit\") and evening (\"Ma'ariv\") prayers.\n\nPharisaic wisdom was compiled in one book of the Mishna, \"Pirkei Avot\". The Pharisaic attitude is perhaps best exemplified by a story about the sages Hillel the Elder and Shammai, who both lived in the latter half of the 1st century BCE. A gentile once challenged Shammai to teach him the wisdom of the Torah while he stood on one foot. Shammai drove him away. The same gentile approached Hillel and asked of him the same thing. Hillel chastised him gently by saying, \"What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation – now go and study.\"\n\nAccording to Josephus, whereas the Sadducees believed that people have total free will and the Essenes believed that all of a person's life is predestined, the Pharisees believed that people have free will but that God also has foreknowledge of human destiny. This also accords with the statement in \"Pirkei Avot\" 3:19, \"Rabbi Akiva said: All is foreseen, but freedom of choice is given\". According to Josephus, Pharisees were further distinguished from the Sadducees in that Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead.\n\nUnlike the Sadducees, who are generally held to have rejected any existence after death, the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees on the afterlife. According to the New Testament the Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead, but it does not specify whether this resurrection included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people would be reincarnated and \"pass into other bodies,\" while \"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\" The Apostle Paul, declared himself to be a Pharisee before his conversion to Christianity.\n\nFundamentally, the Pharisees continued a form of Judaism that extended beyond the Temple, applying Jewish law to mundane activities in order to sanctify the every-day world. This was a more participatory (or \"democratic\") form of Judaism, in which rituals were not monopolized by an inherited priesthood but rather could be performed by all adult Jews individually or collectively; whose leaders were not determined by birth but by scholarly achievement.\n\nMany, including some scholars, have characterized the Sadducees as a sect that interpreted the Torah literally, and the Pharisees as interpreting the Torah liberally. R' Yitzhak Isaac Halevi suggests that this was not, in fact, a matter of religion. He claims that the complete rejection of Judaism would not have been tolerated under the Hasmonean rule and therefore Hellenists maintained that they were rejecting not Judaism but Rabbinic law. Thus, the Sadducees were in fact a political party not a religious sect. However, according to Jacob Neusner, this view is a distortion. He suggests that two things fundamentally distinguished the Pharisaic from the Sadducean approach to the Torah. First, Pharisees believed in a broad and literal interpretation of Exodus (19:3–6), \"you shall be my own possession among all peoples; for all the earth is mine, and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,\" and the words of 2 Maccabees (2:17): \"God gave all the people the heritage, the kingdom, the priesthood, and the holiness.\"\n\nThe Pharisees believed that the idea that all of the children of Israel were to be like priests was expressed elsewhere in the Torah, for example, when the Law itself was transferred from the sphere of the priesthood to every man in Israel (Exodus 19: 29–24; Deuteronomy 6: 7, 11: 19; comp. 31: 9; Jeremiah 2: 8, 18:18). Moreover, the Torah already provided ways for all Jews to lead a priestly life: the precepts concerning unclean meat were perhaps intended originally for the priests, but were extended to the whole people (Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14:3–21); the prohibition of cutting the flesh in mourning for the dead (Deuteronomy 14: 1–2, Leviticus 19: 28; comp. Lev. 21: 5). The Pharisees believed that all Jews in their ordinary life, and not just the Temple priesthood or Jews visiting the Temple, should observe rules and rituals concerning purification.\n\nThe standard view is that the Pharisees differed from Sadducees in the sense that they accepted the Oral Torah in addition to the Scripture. Saldarini argues that this assumption has neither implicit nor explicit evidence. A critique of the ancient interpretations of the Bible are distant from what modern scholars consider literal. Saldarini states that the Oral Torah did not come about until the third century AD, although there was an unstated idea about it in existence. Every Jewish community in a way possessed their own version of the Oral Torah which governed their religious practices. Josephus stated that the Sadducees only followed literal interpretations of the Torah. To Saldarini, this only means that the Sadducees followed their own way of Judaism and rejected the Pharisaic version of Judaism. To Ruether the Pharisaic proclamation of the Oral Torah was their way of freeing Judaism from the clutches of Aaronite priesthood, represented by the Sadducees. The Oral Torah was to remain oral but was later given a written form. It did not refer to the Torah in a status as a commentary, rather had its own separate existence which allowed Pharisaic innovations.\n\nThe sages of the Talmud believed that the Oral law was simultaneously revealed to Moses at Sinai, \"and\" the product of debates among rabbis. Thus, one may conceive of the \"Oral Torah\" not as a fixed text but as an ongoing process of analysis and argument in which God is actively involved; it was this ongoing process that was revealed at Sinai, and by participating in this ongoing process rabbis and their students are actively participating in God's ongoing act of revelation.\n\nAs Jacob Neusner has explained, the schools of the Pharisees and rabbis were and are holy\n\"because there men achieve sainthood through study of Torah and imitation of the conduct of the masters. In doing so, they conform to the heavenly paradigm, the Torah believed to have been created by God \"in his image,\" revealed at Sinai, and handed down to their own teachers ... If the masters and disciples obey the divine teaching of Moses, \"our rabbi,\" then their society, the school, replicates on earth the heavenly academy, just as the disciple incarnates the heavenly model of Moses, \"our rabbi.\" The rabbis believe that Moses was (and the Messiah will be) a rabbi, God dons phylacteries, and the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions. These beliefs today may seem as projections of rabbinical values onto heaven, but the rabbis believe that they themselves are projections of heavenly values onto earth. The rabbis thus conceive that on earth they study Torah just as God, the angels, and Moses, \"our rabbi,\" do in heaven. The heavenly schoolmen are even aware of Babylonian scholastic discussions, so they require a rabbi's information about an aspect of purity taboos.\n\nThe commitment to relate religion to daily life through the law has led some (notably, Saint Paul and Martin Luther) to infer that the Pharisees were more legalistic than other sects in the Second Temple Era. The authors of the Gospels present Jesus as speaking harshly against some Pharisees (Josephus does claim that the Pharisees were the \"strictest\" observers of the law). It is more accurate to say they were legalistic in a different way.\n\nIn some cases Pharisaic values led to an extension of the law — for example, the Torah requires priests to bathe themselves before entering the Temple. The Pharisees washed themselves before Sabbath and festival meals (in effect, making these holidays \"temples in time\"), and, eventually, before all meals. Although this seems burdensome compared to the practices of the Sadducees, in other cases, Pharisaic law was less strict. For example, Jewish law prohibits Jews from carrying objects from a private domain (\"reshut ha-yachid\") to a public domain (\"reshut ha-rabim\") on Sabbath. This law could have prevented Jews from carrying cooked dishes to the homes of friends for Sabbath meals. The Pharisees ruled that adjacent houses connected by lintels or fences could become connected by a legal procedure creating a partnership among homeowners; thereby, clarifying the status of those common areas as a private domain relative to the members of the partnership. In that manner people could carry objects from building to building.\n\nThe Mishna in the beginning of Avot and (in more detail) Maimonides in his Introduction to \"Mishneh Torah\" records a chain of tradition (mesorah) from Moses at Mount Sinai down to R' Ashi, redactor of the Talmud and last of the Amoraim. This chain of tradition includes the interpretation of unclear statements in the Bible (e.g. that the \"fruit of a beautiful tree\" refers to a citron as opposed to any other fruit), the methods of textual exegesis (the disagreements recorded in the Mishna and Talmud generally focus on methods of exegesis), and Laws with Mosaic authority that cannot be derived from the Biblical text (these include measurements (\"e.g.\" what amount of a non-kosher food must one eat to be liable), the amount and order of the scrolls to be placed in the phylacteries, etc.).\n\nThe Pharisees were also innovators in that they enacted specific laws as they saw necessary according to the needs of the time. These included prohibitions to prevent an infringement of a biblical prohibition (e.g. one does not take a Lulav on Shabbat \"Lest one carry it in the public domain\") called gezeirot, among others. The commandment to read the Megillah (Book of Esther) on Purim and to light the Menorah on Hanukkah are Rabbinic innovations. Much of the legal system is based on \"what the sages constructed via logical reasoning and from established practice\". Also, the blessings before meals and the wording of the Amidah. These are known as Takanot. The Pharisees based their authority to innovate on the verses: \"...according to the word they tell you... according to all they instruct you. According to the law they instruct you and according to the judgment they say to you, you shall do; you shall not divert from the word they tell you, either right or left\" (Deuteronomy 17:10–11) (see \"Encyclopedia Talmudit\" entry \"Divrei Soferim\").\n\nIn an interesting twist, Abraham Geiger posits that the Sadducees were the more hidebound adherents to an ancient Halacha whereas the Pharisees were more willing to develop Halacha as the times required. See however, Bernard Revel's \"Karaite Halacha\" which rejects many of Geiger's proofs.\n\nJust as important as (if not more important than) any particular law was the value the rabbis placed on legal study and debate. The sages of the Talmud believed that when they taught the Oral Torah to their students, they were imitating Moses, who taught the law to the children of Israel. Moreover, the rabbis believed that \"the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions.\" Thus, in debating and disagreeing over the meaning of the Torah or how best to put it into practice, no rabbi felt that he (or his opponent) was rejecting God or threatening Judaism; on the contrary, it was precisely through such arguments that the rabbis imitated and honored God.\n\nOne sign of the Pharisaic emphasis on debate and differences of opinion is that the Mishnah and Talmud mark different generations of scholars in terms of different pairs of contending schools. In the first century, for example, the two major Pharisaic schools were those of Hillel and Shammai. After Hillel died in 20 CE, Shammai assumed the office of president of the Sanhedrin until he died in 30 CE. Followers of these two sages dominated scholarly debate over the following decades. Although the Talmud records the arguments and positions of the school of Shammai, the teachings of the school of Hillel were ultimately taken as authoritative.\n\nFollowing the Jewish–Roman wars, revolutionaries like the Zealots had been crushed by the Romans, and had little credibility (the last Zealots died at Masada in 73 CE). Similarly, the Sadducees, whose teachings were closely connected to the Temple, disappeared with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The Essenes too disappeared, perhaps because their teachings so diverged from the concerns of the times, perhaps because they were sacked by the Romans at Qumran.\n\nOf all the major Second Temple sects, only the Pharisees remained. Their vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives was a position meaningful to the majority of Jews. Such teachings extended beyond ritual practices. According to the classic midrash in \"Avot D'Rabbi Nathan\" (4:5):\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Temple, Rome governed Judea through a Procurator at Caesarea and a Jewish Patriarch and levied the Fiscus Judaicus. Yohanan ben Zakkai, a leading Pharisee, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Yavneh (see the related Council of Jamnia) under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the (now-destroyed) Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give charity. Moreover, they argued that all Jews should study in local synagogues, because Torah is \"the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob\" (Deut. 33: 4).\n\nAfter the destruction of the First Temple, Jews believed that God would forgive them and enable them to rebuild the Temple an event that actually occurred within three generations. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews wondered whether this would happen again. When the Emperor Hadrian threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, in 132, Aelia Capitolina, some of the leading sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion led by Simon Bar Kosiba (later known as Bar Kokhba), who established a short-lived independent state that was conquered by the Romans in 135. With this defeat, Jews' hopes that the Temple would be rebuilt were crushed. Nonetheless, belief in a Third Temple remains a cornerstone of Jewish belief.\n\nRomans forbade Jews to enter Jerusalem (except for the day of Tisha B'Av), and forbade any plan to rebuild the Temple. Instead, it took over the Province of Judea directly, renaming it Syria Palaestina, and renaming Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina. Romans did eventually reconstitute the Sanhedrin under the leadership of Judah haNasi (who claimed to be a descendant of King David). They conferred the title of \"Nasi\" as hereditary, and Judah's sons served both as Patriarch and as heads of the Sanhedrin.\n\nAccording to historian Shaye Cohen, by the time three generations had passed after the destruction of the Second Temple, most Jews concluded that the Temple would not be rebuilt during their lives, nor in the foreseeable future. Jews were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions:\nRegardless of the importance they gave to the Temple, and despite their support of Bar Koseba's revolt, the Pharisees' vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives provided them with a position from which to respond to all four challenges in a way meaningful to the vast majority of Jews. Their responses would constitute Rabbinic Judaism.\n\nDuring the Second Temple era, when Jews were divided into sects, the Pharisees were one sect among many, and partisan. Each sect claimed a monopoly on the truth, and discouraged marriage between members of different sects. Members of different sects did, however, argue with one another over the correctness of their respective interpretations, although there is no significant, reliable record of such debates between sects. After the destruction of the Second Temple, these sectarian divisions ended. The Rabbis avoided the term \"Pharisee,\" perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian. The Rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and added to the Amidah the \"birkat haMinim\", a prayer which in part exclaims, \"Praised are You O Lord, who breaks enemies and defeats the wicked,\" and which is understood as a rejection of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to debates within Rabbinic Judaism. The Pharisaic commitment to scholarly debate as a value in and of itself, rather than merely a byproduct of sectarianism, emerged as a defining feature of Rabbinic Judaism.\n\nThus, as the Pharisees argued that all Israel should act as priests, the Rabbis argued that all Israel should act as rabbis: \"The rabbis furthermore want to transform the entire Jewish community into an academy where the whole Torah is studied and kept ... redemption depends on the \"rabbinization\" of all Israel, that is, upon the attainment of all Jewry of a full and complete embodiment of revelation or Torah, thus achieving a perfect replica of heaven.\"\n\nThe Rabbinic era itself is divided into two periods. The first period was that of the Tannaim (from the Aramaic word for \"repeat;\" the Aramaic root TNY is equivalent to the Hebrew root SNY, which is the basis for \"Mishnah.\" Thus, Tannaim are \"Mishnah teachers\"), the sages who repeated and thus passed down the Oral Torah. During this period rabbis finalized the canonization of the Tanakh, and in 200 Judah haNasi edited together Tannaitic judgements and traditions into the Mishnah, considered by the rabbis to be the definitive expression of the Oral Torah (although some of the sages mentioned in the Mishnah are Pharisees who lived prior to the destruction of the Second Temple, or prior to the Bar Kozeba Revolt, most of the sages mentioned lived after the revolt).\n\nThe second period is that of the \"Amoraim\" (from the Aramaic word for \"speaker\") rabbis and their students who continued to debate legal matters and discuss the meaning of the books of the Bible. In Palestine, these discussions occurred at important academies at Tiberias, Caesarea, and Sepphoris. In Babylonia, these discussions largely occurred at important academies that had been established at Nehardea, Pumpeditha and Sura. This tradition of study and debate reached its fullest expression in the development of the Talmudim, elaborations of the Mishnah and records of Rabbinic debates, stories, and judgements, compiled around 400 in Palestine and around 500 in Babylon.\n\nRabbinic Judaism eventually emerged as normative Judaism and in fact many today refer to Rabbinic Judaism simply as \"Judaism.\" Jacob Neusner, however, states that the Amoraim had no ultimate power in their communities. They lived at a time when Jews were subjects of either the Roman or Iranian (Parthian and Persian) empires. These empires left the day-to-day governance in the hands of the Jewish authorities: in Roman Palestine, through the hereditary office of Patriarch (simultaneously the head of the Sanhedrin); in Babylonia, through the hereditary office of the \"Reish Galuta\", the \"Head of the Exile\" or \"Exilarch\" (who ratified the appointment of the heads of Rabbinical academies.) According to Professor Neusner:\n\nIn Neusner's view, the rabbinic project, as acted out in the Talmud, reflected not the world as it was but the world as rabbis dreamed it should be.\n\nAccording to S. Baron however, there existed \"a general willingness of the people to follow its self imposed Rabbinic rulership\". Although the Rabbis lacked authority to impose capital punishment \"Flagellation and heavy fines, combined with an extensive system of excommunication were more than enough to uphold the authority of the courts.\" In fact, the Rabbis took over more and more power from the Reish Galuta until eventually R' Ashi assumed the title Rabbana, heretofore assumed by the exilarch, and appeared together with two other Rabbis as an official delegation \"at the gate of King Yazdegard's court.\" The Amorah (and Tanna) Rav was a personal friend of the last Parthian king Artabenus and Shmuel was close to Shapur I, King of Persia. Thus, the Rabbis had significant means of \"coercion\" and the people seem to have followed the Rabbinic rulership.\n\nThe Pharisees appear in the New Testament, engaging in conflicts between themselves and John the Baptist and with Jesus, and because Nicodemus the Pharisee () with Joseph of Arimathea entombed Jesus' body at great personal risk. Gamaliel, the highly respected rabbi and defender of the apostles, was also a Pharisee, and according to some Christian traditions secretly converted to Christianity.\n\nThere are several references in the New Testament to Paul the Apostle being a Pharisee before converting to Christianity, and other members of the Pharisee sect are known from to have become Christian believers. It was some members of his group who argued that gentile converts must be circumcised and obliged to follow the Mosaic law, leading to a dispute within the early Church addressed at the Apostolic Council in Jerusalem, in 50 CE.\n\nThe New Testament, particularly the Synoptic Gospels, presents especially the leadership of the Pharisees as obsessed with man-made rules (especially concerning purity) whereas Jesus is more concerned with God’s love; the Pharisees scorn sinners whereas Jesus seeks them out. (The Gospel of John, which is the only gospel where Nicodemus is mentioned, particularly portrays the sect as divided and willing to debate.) Because of the New Testament's frequent depictions of Pharisees as self-righteous rule-followers (see also Woes of the Pharisees and Legalism (theology)), the word \"pharisee\" (and its derivatives: \"pharisaical\", etc.) has come into semi-common usage in English to describe a hypocritical and arrogant person who places the letter of the law above its spirit. Jews today typically find this insulting and some consider the use of the word to be anti-Semitic.\n\nSome have speculated that Jesus was himself a Pharisee and that his arguments with Pharisees is a sign of inclusion rather than fundamental conflict (disputation being the dominant narrative mode employed in the Talmud as a search for truth, and not necessarily a sign of opposition). Jesus' emphasis on loving one's neighbor (see Great Commandment), for example, echoes the teaching of the School of Hillel. Jesus' views of divorce, however, are closer to those of the School of Shammai, another Pharisee.\n\nOthers have argued that the portrait of the Pharisees in the New Testament is an anachronistic caricature. Although a minority of scholars follow the Augustinian hypothesis, most scholars date the composition of the Christian gospels to between 70 and 100 CE, a time after Christianity had separated from Judaism (and after Pharisaism emerged as the dominant form of Judaism). Rather than an accurate account of Jesus' relationship to Pharisees and other Jewish leaders, this view holds that the Gospels instead reflect the competition and conflict between early Christians and Pharisees for leadership of the Jews, or reflects Christian attempts to distance themselves from Jews in order to present themselves in a more sympathetic (and benign) light to Romans and other Gentiles.\n\nExamples of disputed passages include the story of Jesus declaring the sins of a paralytic man forgiven and the Pharisees calling the action blasphemy. In the story, Jesus counters the accusation that he does not have the power to forgive sins and forgives them, and also heals the man. Christians interpret the account of the Paralytic Man as showing that the \"man-made\" teachings of the Pharisees had so \"blinded their eyes\" and \"hardened their hearts\", that they were persisting (unlike the crowds) in refusing to credit his authority. Hence, the New Testament describes Jesus as tackling what he saw as the Pharisees' non-scriptural judgmentalism concerning sin, disability and sickness.\n\nSome historians, however, have noted that Jesus' actions are actually similar to and consistent with Jewish beliefs and practices of the time, as recorded by the Rabbis, that commonly associate illness with sin and healing with forgiveness. Jews (according to E.P. Sanders) reject the New Testament suggestion that the healing would have been critical of, or criticized by, the Pharisees as no surviving Rabbinic source questions or criticizes this practice. Another argument is that according to the New Testament, Pharisees wanted to punish Jesus for healing a man's withered hand on Sabbath. No Rabbinic rule has been found according to which Jesus would have violated Sabbath.\n\nSome scholars believe that those passages of the New Testament that are seemingly most hostile to the Pharisees were written sometime after the destruction of Herod's Temple in 70 CE. Only Christianity and Pharisaism survived the destruction of the Temple, and the two competed for a short time until the Pharisees emerged as the dominant form of Judaism. When many Jews did not convert, Christians sought new converts from among the Gentiles. Christians had to explain why converts should listen to them rather than the Non-Messianic Jews, concerning the Hebrew Bible, and also had to dissociate themselves with the rebellious Jews who so often rejected Roman authority and authority in general. They thus were perceived to have had presented a story of Jesus that was more sympathetic to Romans than to Jews.\n\nSome scholars have found evidence of continuous interactions between Jewish-Christian and rabbinic movements from the mid- to late second century c.e. to the fourth century c.e.\n\n\n\n"}

SRI is an initiatic order within the lineage of Inayat Khan (\"Inayati-Chishtiyya\"). Murshid Sufi Ahmed Murad Chishti (Samuel L. Lewis), a disciple of Inayat Khan, formally founded the order in 1970. There are centers throughout the United States, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Sufi Ruhaniat International has five primary activities.\n\nInitiation and progress on the path of discipleship is the central theme of the Sufi Ruhaniat International. The relationship between teacher and student exists for the purpose of providing training that leads to realization of the Divine essence in each human being, and to leading a life of service to God and humanity. Through various centers, classes are offered both to the general public (in accordance with the brother/sisterhood work) and to those interested in the path of initiation. Initiates are expected to maintain a relationship with a spiritual guide. Students are referred to as \"mureeds\".\n\nThe Dervish Healing Order serves as that aspect of the Sufi Ruhaniat International which maintains and promotes the vision of health and Divine Healing as presented by Inayat Khan. The Dervish Healing Order is an initiatory order. All members have demonstrated their deep involvement in some aspect of healing, either toward self or others. A primary activity is the conduction of the Healing Service of Inayat Khan.\n\nZiraat is a heart-based approach to gardening and food production outwardly, and to spiritual growth inwardly. The heart, like the earth, is regarded as sacred soil to be prepared for planting. Rocks and roots are removed; last year's stubble is plowed under. New seed is placed in the furrow. Sunshine and rain attend the turning of the seasons, and the ancient cycles of sowing, growth, fruition and harvest are realized in ourselves and in our gardens and farms.\n\nThe Universal Worship Service was created by Inayat Khan to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the diverse religious traditions of the world: both in the beauty of their distinctions and differences, externally, and in the transformative and healing power of their inner Unity...all coming from the same Source. Conducted by ministers called Cherags (Lamps of the Message), the Service honors nine of world's major religious traditions – the Goddess Tradition, Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, the Native Traditions of the world, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. For each tradition, a candle is lit, a selection from the sacred scriptures is read, and a spiritual practice or Dance of Universal Peace is led. Leaders of the Universal Worship Service are referred to as \"cherags\" and \"cheragas\".\n\nThe Dances of Universal Peace are simple, meditative, joyous, multi-cultural, circle dances that use sacred phrases, chants, music, and movements from the many traditions of the earth to touch the spiritual essence within ourselves and others. Based on the work begun in the late 1960s by Murshid Samuel L. Lewis, they promote peace and integration within individuals and groups worldwide. There are no performers nor audience – new arrivals and old hands form the circle together. The International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace was formed under the auspices of SRI to serve as a network for the many Dance meetings and leaders throughout the world, to publish recordings and instructions for the Dances, and as a resource for the ongoing development of new Dances and for the training of dance leaders. Dance leader certification is available through the affiliated Mentor Teachers Guild.\n\nThe Sufi Ruhaniat International was incorporated as the Sufi Islamia Ruhaniat Society by Murshid Samuel L. Lewis in November 1970, shortly before his death in 1971. In 2002 the name was changed to Sufi Ruhaniat International.\n\nLeadership of SRI is provided by a \"pir\" (spiritual leader) and a council of \"murshids\" and \"murshidas\" (senior teachers). Teachers are referred to as \"sheiks\" and \"sheikhas\". SRI is not \"guru-centered\" and maintains a minimal hierarchy required for any effective organization to function. All members are respected for the unique perspectives and abilities they offer.\n\nOther teachers have informed the Sufi Ruhaniat International's spiritual tradition. Among these are:\n\nSensei Nyogen Senzaki (1876–1958) was a Rinzai Zen monk and student of Soyen Shaku. He was the Zen teacher of Samuel L. Lewis. His last words were said to be \"Remember the Dharma! Remember the Dharma! Remember the Dharma!\" \n\nRuth St. Denis (1879–1968) was a modern dance pioneer and a major influence on Samuel L. Lewis, who called her \"Mata-Ji\" (Honored Mother) and referred to her as \"my fairy godmother\". She was a source of inspiration in Samuel L. Lewis' creation of the Dances of Universal Peace and of the Spiritual Walks.\n\nJoe Miller (1904–1992) was an American mystic best known for his Thursday Morning Walks in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with his wife Guin during the 1970s and 1980s. Joe was widely respected for his spiritual clarity and Dr. Evans-Wentz, the original translator of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and other sacred Mahayana texts, considered Joe Miller \"the only man he had met in the West who understood the Doctrine of the Clear Light.\" Joe was a close friend of Samuel L. Lewis who upon his deathbed asked Joe to \"Take care of my disciples.\" Joe provided spiritual guidance to Sam's disciples, and many others, until his death in 1992.\n\nJoe Miller- http://sftslodge.org/category/miller-archive\n\n"}

It was the last Genesis single featuring Phil Collins on vocals.\n\nA royalty from the single was donated to the Bosnian Save the Children and Red Cross charities.

Both editions came in digipaks with identical artwork, and were backed by a live version of \"Dreaming While You Sleep.\" The first CD featured a 1992 version of \"Turn It On Again\" as an exclusive track, while the second included a full performance of \"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\" from the video, \"Live at Wembley Stadium\" (this song segued into \"Invisible Touch\" on the \"We Can't Dance\" tour).\n\nIn Europe the live B-sides were \"Mama\", \"The Brazilian\" (both from the Invisible Touch tour) and the single version of \"Invisible Touch.\"\n\nUnlike its four predecessors, the single was not a commercial success, barely breaching the UK Top 40.\n\nThe working title of \"Tell Me Why\" was originally \"Rickenbacker\" after the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar used by Mike Rutherford on the song.

{"id": "33862680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33862680", "title": "Temple of Montu (Medamud)", "text": "Temple of Montu (Medamud)\n\nThe Temple of Montu (also Temple of Monthu, Montju, or Menthu) is an Egyptian temple dedicated to the worship of Monthu. The site is located northeast of Karnak, which is located within Luxor. Medamud was excavated by French archaeologist Fernand Bisson de la Roque from 1925 to the post-war, and revealed many buildings including a temple dedicated to Montu. This temple replaced an ancient sanctuary and consists of an open forum with a tower and enclosing two mounds that housed the chapels of worship. It is thought that original sanctuary dates to the Old Kingdom. The ruins of the last structure date to the Ptolemy VIII period of the 2nd century BC, although decorations and additions continued to be added centuries later by the Romans. Because of Montu's strong association with raging bulls, the temple was a major centre of worship for bulls, containing many statues of bulls for worship and reliefs. Most of these statues are now located in various museums around the world.\n\nMontu was a falcon-headed, god of war. He was the tutelary deity of Thebes. His consorts were Tjenenyet (or Tanen-t) and rˁỉ.t-tꜣ.wỉ (\"female Ra of the Two Lands\"); his son was Harpora. He is also associated with a sacred bull named Buchis. \n\nIn addition to the temple at Medamud, temples dedicated to Montu were built in Karnak, Armant, and Tod. From 1925-1932, the Medamud Temple of Montu was excavated by French archaeologist, Fernand Bisson de la Roque, of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale, in conjunction with the Louvre.\n\nMedamud (or Madu) was an outpost of Thebes, located away. Little is known about the town of Medamud or its other structures. Prior to construction of the Middle Kingdom temple, the site had been burned and earlier mounds were razed. The Middle Kingdom temple is situated on a circular mound. Its orientation bears east-west.\n\nNearby are the Egyptian temple complexes at Luxor and Karnak. The Karnak Temple Complex contains three precincts, including the Precinct of Montu, which contains another Temple of Montu.\n\nThe Old Kingdom temple site, dedicated to Montu, was walled and had a sacred grove. It had a tunnel system, mounds and chambers.\n\nThe Middle Kingdom 12th dynasty building is a rare example of the foundation of religion in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt era. Others of this period are the temple of Sesostris III in Abydos, the Temple of Medinet Madi and Qasr el-Sagha in Fayoum dating from approximately the same time, and the funerary temple of Mentuhotep II of the 11th dynasty in Deir el-Bahari. The sanctuary was remodeled in later periods..\n\nThe temple's features included a tribune platform, a canal, a dromos, main gate, portico, hall, and sanctuary. There was also a courtyard for the living sacred bull. It consisted of a first chamber, 200 by 180 meters. The main access was by the east and north. A sacred lake was probably on the west side of the temple. The temple consisted of two distinct, contiguous sections that have been interpreted as a temple to the north and one to the south where the priests would have had their quarters. Typical of the period, the temple was built of brick; it included raw elements for the doors and frames, and column or carved stone, the bases of which were decorated. Carved stone would have been present in the most intimate parts of the sanctuary, but no trace of it has been discovered. No doubt these parts were considered sacred and reused in later buildings. The plan of the sanctuary of the Middle Kingdom is still subject to discussion. But it was to have at least one hypostyle antechamber, giving access to chapels of worship or shrine. A large courtyard surrounded by portico columns where a sacred bull would have lived would have been revered as the hypostasis of the living Montu.\n\nThis temple has provided many examples of royal statuary and lithic elements of Ancient Egyptian architecture. One of the extravagant doors, dated to Sesostris III, is in the Louvre. The temple continued to be decorated in the 13th dynasty of Egypt, including Sobekhotep II, and included some reliefs of his predecessors and of his ancestor Sesostris III, dressed in the fashion of the Sed festival.\n\nThe temple was revised later by the kings of the 18th dynasty of Egypt and was rebuilt by Thutmose III, who rebuilt the stone sanctuary and adorned it with statues in his likeness.\n\nThe site is currently closed to the public as a team of archaeologists and restorers work to protect against the modern city encroachment on the ancient remains of the former city.\n\nComposed of twelve columns, the structure was built under Ptolemy VIII, who was then one of the great rebuilders of Medamud. Four of the six columns of the facade are still connected by walls. The elements of the inner temple are dated them from the beginning of the Ptolemaic period. The enclosure of the temple included a sacred lake and a deep well but was blocked off because it represented a danger to children playing in the area. The temple continued to be enlarged and decorated for centuries under the Roman emperors, including Tiberius (14-37), up until the reign of Antoninus Pius. A wharf, which was reached by a canal, connected the temple with a line of sphinxes; it is in a state of ruin. Although grass grows throughout the site, there is still find evidence of ancient pilgrims in the form of graffiti or engraved footprints. Following the processional aisle, it was possible to access a large door whose decoration dates from the reign of Tiberius. This monumental gateway was a large opening within the walls of the temple axis. It was Ptolemy VIII, however who built the towered portico around the door, its decoration not completed until the reign of Ptolemy XII. Another door dates to Ptolemy II.\n\nSome of the artifacts found in the temple date to Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV. Many of these artifacts are statues of bulls which were used for worship and reliefs. The interior of this monument is interesting because it and its doors describes the traditional scenes of the Sed festival when the king in traditional costume receives offerings or during an important step in the inauguration ceremony of royal power. The Temple of Montu is also an important insight into how very popular bull cults were in ancient Egypt, Montu being strongly associated with raging bulls. A long corridor retained the scenes of the cult of the bull Bukhis which date mostly from the emperor Domitian (81-96). There is also a wall relief of a procession of musicians who came to visit Trajan.\n\nNothing remains of the earlier or later temples, and the remains are dated mainly from the Greco-Roman period. The temple at Medamud was probably founded as the place of worship for the living god Montu while the temple Bouchéum (or Bucheum) at Ermant included a necropolis of sacred bulls, and was probably dedicated to his death. There are Coptic remains on the temple site.\n\nWhat could be removed from the original structure, parts of the building and artifacts, were taken to museums including the Karnak Open Air Museum. Most of the temples statues are now located in various museums, such as the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon and the Louvre.\n\n"}

He investigated and juxtaposed two histories: the origin and evolution of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a modern double murder committed in the name of God by brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who subscribed to a fundamentalist version of Mormonism.\n\nThe Laffertys were formerly members of a very small splinter group called the School of Prophets, led by Robert C. Crossfield (also known by his prophet name Onias). The group accepts many beliefs of the original LDS church at the time when it ceased the practice of polygamy in the 1890s, but it does not identify with those who call themselves fundamentalist Mormons. The book examines the ideologies of both the LDS Church and the fundamentalist Mormons polygamous groups, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church).\n\nIn 2011 Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for an adaptation. As of 2016, it was still in development.\n\nThe book opens with news accounts of the 1984 murder of Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter Erica. Brenda was married to Allen Lafferty, the youngest of the Lafferty brothers. His older brothers Dan and Ron disapproved of their sister-in-law Brenda because they believed she was the reason Ron's wife left him (after refusing to allow him to marry a plural/second wife). Both men's extremism reached new heights when they became members of the School of the Prophets, founded and led by Robert Crossfield. After joining this group, Ron claimed that God had sent him revelations about Brenda. Communication with God is a core belief of fundamentalist Mormonism, as well as the mainstream LDS Church. Ron showed the members of the School of Prophets a written \"removal revelation\" that allegedly called for the killing of Brenda and her baby. After other members of the School failed to honor Ron's removal revelation, the brothers quit the School.\n\nDan claimed that he slit both of the victims' throats. But, at the 2001 trial, Chip Carnes, who was riding in the getaway car, testified that Ron said that he had killed Brenda, and that Ron had thanked his brother for \"doing the baby.\"\n\nAfter the murders, the police found the written \"revelation\" concerning Brenda and Erica. The press widely reported that Ron had received a revelation to kill the mother and child. Afterward, the Lafferty brothers conducted a recorded press conference at which Ron said that the \"revelation\" was not addressed to him, but to \"Todd\" [a drifter whom Ron had befriended while working in Wichita, Kansas] and that the revelation called only for \"removal\" of Brenda and her baby, and did not use the word \"kill.\" The jury at Ron's trial was shown these remarks of Ron denying he had received a revelation to kill Brenda and Erica.\n\nAfter opening with the Lafferty case, Krakauer explores the history of Mormonism, starting with the early life of Joseph Smith, founder and first prophet of the Latter Day Saint movement. He follows his life from a criminal fraud trial to leading the first followers to Jackson County, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Illinois. While violence seemed to accompany the Mormons, Krakauer notes that they did not necessarily initiate it. Early Mormons faced severe religious persecution from mainstream Protestant Christians, due to their unorthodox beliefs, including polygamy. In addition they tended to conduct business and personal relations only with other Mormons. There were violent clashes between Mormons and non-Mormons, culminating in Smith's death on June 27, 1844. A mob shot him, pulling him from jail in Carthage, Illinois, where he was awaiting trial for destroying the printing press of a local publication that had portrayed him negatively.\n\nFrom Nauvoo, the Mormons trekked westward to modern-day Utah, led by Smith's successor Brigham Young (after some controversy). Arriving in what they called Deseret, many Mormons believed they would be left alone by the United States government, as the territory was then part of Mexico. Soon after their arrival, the Mexican–American War occurred, with Mexico's eventual defeat. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo signed on February 2, 1848, this land, California and the Southwest were ceded to the United States.\n\nSmith's highly controversial revelation of plural marriage threatened to split apart followers of the faith. The Utah Territory was a theocracy ruled by Brigham Young, and Utah was denied statehood for 50 years due to the Mormons' practice of polygamy. Finally, on September 23, 1890, Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of LDS Church, officially banned the practice of polygamy after having received a revelation from God. Six years later, Utah was granted statehood.\n\nAfter the Woodruff Manifesto, some members broke away from the mainstream church to form what eventually became the FLDS Church, the most popular group of fundamentalist Mormonism. The FLDS Church encourages polygamy, as do some other breakaway groups.\n\nKrakauer examines events in Latter Day Saint history and compares them to modern-day FLDS doctrine (and other minority versions of Mormonism, such as the Crossfield School of the Prophets). He examines the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre during the Utah War, in which Mormons and some local Paiute Indians rounded up and murdered approximately 120 members of the Baker–Fancher party of emigrants passing through their territory. The Mormons went to great lengths to conceal their part in the massacre (including dressing as the Paiute and painting their faces in similar fashion). The Civil War interrupted investigations of the events, and no one was indicted until 1874, when nine men were charged. For nearly two decades the falsehood held that the massacre was due solely to the Paiute. The only person ever convicted in the affair was John D. Lee, a member of the LDS Church. He was convicted and executed by the state in 1877 for his role in the crime.\n\nKrakauer cites information gleaned from several interviews with Dan Lafferty and former and current members of the Crossfield School of the Prophets, as well as other fundamentalist Mormons. He refers to several histories about the formation of Mormonism to tie the origins of the religion to the modern iterations of both the church and the fundamentalists.\n\nThe title of the book is drawn from an 1880 address by John Taylor, the third president of the LDS Church, defending the practice of plural marriage: \n\nGod is greater than the United States, and when the Government conflicts with heaven, we will be ranged under the banner of heaven against the Government. The United States says we cannot marry more than one wife. God says different.\n\nCharles Graeber of \"The Guardian\" listed the book in his top 10 true crime books, and described Krakauer as 'a master journalist and storyteller who is unfettered and unafraid of the true crime mantle. (He) pries open the golden doors to one of the newest and fastest-growing religions in America to set the stage for the non-fiction drama.'\n\nIn advance of the book's release in 2003, Richard E. Turley, managing director of the Church History Department of the LDS Church, argued that the book contained mistakes and incorrect assertions. He accused Krakauer of \"condemn[ing] religion generally.\" In his 2004 paperback edition of the book, Krakauer responded to these allegations.\n\nMike Otterson, managing director of public affairs for the LDS Church, condemned Krakauer's example of religious \"zealots\" to draw conclusions about all Mormons and any propensity for violence. Otterson said that, after reading the book, \"One could be forgiven for concluding that every Latter-day Saint, including your friendly Mormon neighbor, has a tendency to violence. And so Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist.\"\n\nIn July 2011, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the book, with Ron Howard directing and Dustin Lance Black writing the screenplay. It is still in development. Black had written for the HBO series, \"Big Love\" (2006 to 2011), about a polygamous family in the modern world.\n\nIn 2015, Amy Berg released her independent documentary, \"Prophet's Prey,\" about fundamentalist Mormons practicing polygamy, based on the case of Warren Jeffs, sentenced to life for polygamy and abuse of minors. Krakauer participated in this film and appears on camera, as he continued his own investigation of sects that practiced polygamy. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, both working on the above project as producers, were executive producers of this documentary.\n\n"}

Founded in 1939 in Mandatory Palestine, \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" has been the largest newspaper in Israel by sales and circulation.\n\n\"Yedioth Ahronoth\" was established in 1939 by an investor named Gershom Komarov. It was the first evening paper in the British Mandate of Palestine, and attempted to emulate the format of the \"London Evening Standard\". Running into financial difficulties, Komarov sold the paper to Yehuda Mozes, a wealthy land dealer who regarded the paper as an interesting hobby and a long-term financial investment. His sons, Reuben and Noah ran the paper with Noah as the first managing editor.\n\nIn 1948, a large group of journalists and staff members led by chief editor Ezriel Carlebach left to form \"Yedioth Maariv,\" later known as \"Maariv\". Carlebach was replaced by Herzl Rosenblum. This began an ongoing battle for circulation and prestige between the rival newspapers, which peaked during the 1990s when both papers were discovered to have bugged one another's phones.\nAs of 2017, the paper is headed by Noah Mozes's son, Arnon Mozes. For many years it was edited by Herzl Rosenblum's son, Moshe Vardi, who was replaced in 2005 by Rafi Ginat. It is published in tabloid format, and according to one author, its marketing strategy emphasizes \"drama and human interest over sophisticated analysis.\" It has been described as \"undoubtedly the country's number-one paper.\" The paper is open to a wide range of political views.\n\nIt is owned by the Yedioth Ahronoth Group, which also owns stocks in several Israeli companies, such as \"Channel 2\", a commercial television channel; \"Hot\", the Cable TV company; \"Yedioth Tikshoret\", a group of weekly local newspapers; \"Vesti\", a Russian language newspaper; magazines, such as the weekly TV guide magazine \"Pnai Plus\" and weekly women's magazine \"La'Isha\"; and other non-media companies. Shilo De-Beer was promoted to editor in April 2007.\n\nIn January 2017, secret recordings were released of conversations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mozes discussing a potential deal in which the newspaper would provide better coverage of Netanyahu in exchange for the government limiting the circulation of competitor Israel Hayom.\n\nIn a TGI survey of the media comparing the last half of 2009 with the same period in 2008, \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" retained the title of most widely read newspaper in Israel but saw its market share fall slightly from 35.9 to 33.9 percent. In July 2010, a TGI survey reported that \"Israel HaYom\" had overtaken \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" as the most read newspaper in terms of exposure with a rate of 35.2% compared to \"Yedioth\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 34.9%. After only a few months of publication of a weekend edition, it scored it 25.7% of exposure compared with \"Yedioth\"'s 43.7% rate.\n\n\"Yedioth Ahronoth\" is generally critical of Benjamin Netanyahu. A study conducted by Moran Rada with the Israeli Democracy Institute showed that \"Yedioth\"'s coverage of the 2009 Israeli legislative election was biased in favor of Kadima and its leader Tzipi Livni in most editorial decisions and that the paper chooses to play down events that don't help to promote a positive image for her, while on the other hand, touting and inflating events that help promote Livni and her party. Oren Frisco reached a similar conclusion after the 2009 Knesset elections, writing that throughout the campaign, \"Yediot Ahronoth\" was biased against Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu was taped trying to strike a deal with Arnon Mozes to have more favorable coverage of him in the paper in return for legislation harming the paper's main competitor, Israel Hayom. This led to the opening of \"Case 2000\", a corruption case with Netanyahu as its main suspect.\n\n\n"}

The best known \"zemirot\" are those sung around the table during Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Some of the Sabbath \"zemirot\" are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon. In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook (siddur), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer (kiddush) for each meal. Other \"zemirot\" are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion.\n\nThe words to many \"zemirot\" are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the Middle Ages. Others are anonymous folk songs that have been passed down from generation to generation. The words generally focus on the themes of the Sabbath or the specific holiday being celebrated.\n\nThe melodies vary greatly from one Jewish community to another, as local tunes and styles of music are adapted to the same liturgical poems.
