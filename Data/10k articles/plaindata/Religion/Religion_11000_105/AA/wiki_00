As suggested by the similarity to the Old Norse \"√¶sir\", Indo-Iranian \"*H√°suras\" may have an even earlier Indo-European root.\n\nIt is commonly supposed that Indo-Iranian \"*H√°suras\" was the proper name of a specific divinity with whom other divinities were later identified. \n\nFor obscure reasons, the Oxford English Dictionary lists \"asura\", rather than \"ahura\", as a Zoroastrian term.\n\nIn the Gathas, the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, the prophet exhorts his followers to pay reverence to only the \"ahura\"s and to rebuff the \"daeva\"s and others who act \"at Lie's command\". That should not, however, be construed to reflect a view of a primordial opposition. Although the \"daeva\"s would, in later Zoroastrian tradition, appear as malign creatures, in the Gathas the \"daeva\"s are (collectively) gods that are to be rejected.\n\nIn the Gathas, the prophet does not specify which of the divinities other than Ahura Mazda are considered to be \"ahura\"s.\n\nIn the \"Fravaraneh\", the Zoroastrian credo summarized in \"Yasna\" 12.1, the adherent declares: \"I profess myself a Mazda worshiper, a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster, rejecting the \"daevas\", ... \" This effectively defines \"ahura\" by defining what \"ahura\" is not.\n\nIn the Younger Avesta, three divinities of the Zoroastrian pantheon are repeatedly identified as ahuric. These three are Ahura Mazda, Mithra, and Apam Napat, the \"Ahuric triad\". Other divinities with whom the term \"Ahuric\" is associated include the six Amesha Spentas, and (notable among the lesser \"yazata\"s) Aredvi Sura of the Waters and Ashi of Reward and Recompense.\n\n"}

The vigil is celebrated on the eves of Sundays and of major liturgical feasts.\n\nThe vigil has been set to music most famously by Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose setting of selections from the service is one of his most admired works. Tchaikovsky's setting of the all-night vigil, along with his Divine Liturgy and his collection of nine sacred songs were of seminal importance in the later interest in Orthodox music in general, and settings of the all-night vigil in particular. Other musical settings include those by Chesnokov, Grechaninov, Ippolitov-Ivanov, Alexander Kastalsky, Hilarion Alfeyev, Clive Strutt and Einojuhani Rautavaara. It is most often celebrated using a variety of traditional or simplified chant melodies based on the Octoechos or other sources.\n\nWhen celebrated at the All-night vigil, the orders of Great Vespers and Matins vary somewhat from when they are celebrated by themselves. In parish usage, many portions of the service such as the readings from the Synaxarion during the Canon at Matins are abbreviated or omitted, and it therefore takes approximately two or two and a half hours to perform.\n\nThe Psalms cited below are numbered according to the Septuagint, which differs from that found in the Masoretic.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7562910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7562910", "title": "Assist (Scientology)", "text": "Assist (Scientology)\n\nThe Scientology Assist is a procedure claimed to alleviate \"a present time [current] discomfort\" or bring a person who has recently died back to life.\n\nAssists are claimed to address the spirit, the person themselves, in bringing about a speedier recovery from illness and injury. For this reason it is made very clear that Assists do not \"heal the body\", it is the spirit that helps heal the body and that is what assists are actually addressing and there are many records where parishioners of the Church have attested to their effectiveness either receiving or administering them.\n\nThere are many different types of Assists that anyone can easily and swiftly learn to do at home for aiding recovery of all manner of illnesses, accidents and injuries and even domestic upsets, of any and all age groups including babies and even pets. There are also assists to, Scientologists believe, help make someone sober or recover from the loss of a loved one.\n\nNo drugs or medication are used. They are not intended to replace competent professional medical treatment, which is why they are correctly called ASSISTS and not \"medicine\" or \"healing\". They are thought to assist the ill or injured person themselves to recover more swiftly in the way they were designed and prescribed, as well as in conjunction with competent professional medical treatment where necessary. Assists can and often are administered without any medical treatment necessary, but does not replace it when it is necessary. \n\nThousands of examples of miraculous results of Assists are claimed.\n\nThe Church and its founder have been accused of unauthorized \"healing\" or \"practicing medicine\" (i.e. addressing the body) with Assists, when internal publications within the Church on Assist procedure state this is not the case.\n\nIn the past, the Church of Scientology has received negative attention from law enforcement and regulatory agencies for practicing medicine without proper licensing. Thus, even though assists are intended to treat pain, injuries, and even death, modern Church of Scientology publications are careful to note that they are not intended to replace medicine, since it often goes against current scientific understanding of the subject and may result in direct conflict with the relevant authorities.\n\nAs the \"Scientology Handbook\" (1994 edition) states, \"Medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed, and where treatment is routinely successful, medical treatment should be obtained. An assist is not a substitute for medical treatment and does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid, but is complementary (adds) to it.\"\n\nThis action is supposed to resuscitate a person who has recently died, or \"done a bunk,\" by speaking to or shouting commands at their corpse within a few minutes of his or her death. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard described the process in his 1972 lecture \"Illness Breakthrough\":\nI was just a couple of minutes late. State cops were in my way, but a Negro had been drowned and I was just... They were in my road to a point where I couldn‚Äôt get to the guy and tell him to pick up the body again, where he would have, don‚Äôt you see. And they were busy resuscitating him and that was the end of that. It was too late. He really had done a bunk. He finished. \nWe‚Äôve actually brought little kids back to life and that sort of thing‚Äîjust tell them ‚Äúpick up the body,‚Äù you know. Now, you just tell them with Tone 40, just say it around the vicinity. \nThey‚Äôre still around. And back they come again.\n\nDescription of the Bring Back to Life Assist also appears in official orders entitled HCO BULLETIN OF 8 APRIL 1988:\n\nIf a person has done a bunk, you can simply order him to come back and bring the body to life. The commands are addressed to the person and should be given in a tone of authority. \nIt would be as simple as commanding, ‚ÄúCome back and bring this body to life!‚Äù Or ordering the person, ‚ÄúCome back here and pick up your body! At once! Pick it up! I order you! Right now!‚Äù \nYou just keep commanding him with Tone 40. He is still around and can be gotten to come back again. \nThere is another means of bringing a person back to life. You can coax the person back. In one case, an auditor pleaded along the lines that the person should remember her husband, should think of her children, and so on, all with no response. He couldn‚Äôt get her to pick up the body at all. Finally, the auditor said, ‚ÄúThink of your poor auditor!‚Äù at which point she came back and brought the body to life. \nOnce you have brought the person back to life, that is the end of this assist action.\n\nScientologists are taught that all physical illnesses are caused by lack of communication with the ill body part. In the touch assist, a Scientologist repeatedly touches a person near the injury and while calling attention to the touch. This process is claimed to reestablish communication and promote healing.\n\nAccording to the \"Scientology Handbook\" (pg.207), \"There is a basic principle in Scientology which consists of putting an injured body member exactly on and in the place it was injured. Doing this can have a therapeutic effect and is called a Contact Assist.\" The \"Handbook\" then goes on to give an example:\n\"Let‚Äôs say a child stubbed his shin on the lawn mower and now doesn‚Äôt want to come nearer than one hundred feet from that lawn mower. You would make him do a Contact Assist with his shin and body at that point (one hundred feet from the same lawn mower), having him go through the motions of the accident. Gradually, gradient by gradient, you narrow the distance that he is willing to approach it and eventually he will go up and do a Contact Assist on the lawn mower.\"\n\nThe Nerve Assist is based on Scientology's teaching that standing waves of energy can form in nerves and cause pain. The assist involves stroking a person along the spine, around the torso, and down the limbs. This process is claimed to dissipate the standing wave. There is, however, no evidence at all to suggest that standing waves are present in the spinal cord or that pain is stored in the nerves. Other information given by the Church of Scientology about the anatomical effects of nerve assists are patently false (e.g.: There are not 12 major nerves in the spinal cord).\n\nThis assist is intended for \"a person who is unconscious, even someone who has been in a long-continued coma\". The person doing the assist takes the unconscious person's hand and places it on various objects, commanding them to feel it as they go along. The idea is to reach not only the person's subconscious mind, but the person's Thetan. The \"Handbook\" states: \"Don‚Äôt fall for the belief that ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù people are unable to think or be aware in any way. A thetan is seldom unconscious regardless of what the body is doing or not doing\". It also notes: \"If you are handling a person in a coma, you may not get him back to consciousness in a single assist session.\"\n\nIn this assist, one simply points to various objects and asks the subject to acknowledge them. The purpose is \"directing a person‚Äôs attention off the painful area of his body or his difficulties and out onto the environment.\" \n\nThe Locational Processing Assist is touted as an antidote to alcohol intoxication. The \"Handbook\" claims \"It can make a drunk person sober in a very few minutes\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "68889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68889", "title": "Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement", "text": "Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement\n\nBiblical and Talmudic units of measurement were used primarily by ancient Israelites and appear frequently within the Hebrew Bible as well as in later Judaic scripture, such as the Mishnah and Talmud. These units of measurement are still an important part of Jewish life today.\nThere is much debate within Judaism, as well as by outside scholars, about the exact relationship between measurements in the system and those in other measurement systems. Classical statements, such as that an \"Etzba\" was seven barleycorns laid side by side, or that a \"Log\" was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are so indefinite and vague as to be nearly useless.\nNevertheless, the entire system of measurement corresponds almost exactly with the Babylonian system, and in all probability the Israelite measurement system was derived from the Babylonian measurement system, with some lesser level of influence from the Egyptian system. It may therefore be assumed that the relationship between the Israelite measurements and contemporary units is the same as the relationship between the Babylonian system and contemporary units.\n\nNote: The listed measurements of this system range from the lowest to highest acceptable halachic value, in terms of conversion to either English or SI units.\n\nThe original measures of length were clearly derived from the human body ‚Äî the finger, hand, arm, span, foot, and pace ‚Äî but since these measures differ between individuals, they are reduced to a certain standard for general use. The Israelite system thus used divisions of the digit or fingerbreadth (Hebrew: ◊ê◊¶◊ë◊¢, \"Etzba\"; plural \"etzba'ot\"), the palm or handbreadth (Hebrew: ◊ò◊§◊ó, \"Tefah\"/\"Tefach\"; plural \"Tefahim\"/\"Tefachim\"), the span (Hebrew: ◊ñ◊®◊™, \"Zeret\"), the ell (Hebrew: ◊ê◊û◊î, \"Amah\", plural \"Amot\"), the mile (Hebrew: ◊û◊ô◊ú, \"Mil\"; plural \"milin\"), and the parsa (Hebrew: ◊§◊®◊°◊î, \"Parasa\"). The latter two are loan words into the Hebrew language, and borrowed measurements - the Latin \"mille\", and Iranian \"parasang\", respectively; both were units of itinerant distance, and thus varied according to terrain and stride length, and, in the case of the \"parasang\", also on the speed of travel.\n\nThe Israelite measurements were related as follows:\n\nThe biblical \"ell\" is closely related to the cubit, but two different factors are given in the Bible; Ezekiel's measurements imply that the ell was equal to 1 cubit plus 1 palm (\"Tefah\"), while elsewhere in the Bible, the ell is equated with 1 cubit exactly. Ezekiel's ell, by which he gave measurements in his guided vision through a future Jerusalem Temple, is thus one sixth larger than the standard ell, for which an explanation seems to be suggested by the Book of Chronicles; the Chronicler writes that Solomon's Temple was built according to \"cubits following the first measure\", suggesting that over the course of time the original ell was supplanted by a smaller one. The Egyptians also used two different ells, one of which ‚Äî the \"royal\" ell ‚Äî was a sixth larger than the common ell; this \"royal\" measurement was the earlier of the two in Egyptian use, and the one which the Pyramids of the 3rd and 4th Dynasties seem to be measured in integer multiples of.\n\nThe smaller of the Egyptian ells measured , but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the statues of King Gudea, was 49.5¬†cm (19.49¬†in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8¬†cm (20.67 and 20.79¬†in). The Books of Samuel portray the Temple as having a Phoenician architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships. Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5¬†cm (19.49 or 20.67¬†in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures. From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit ‚Äî the finger-breadth (\"Etzba\") ‚Äî can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2¬†cm (0.83 or 0.87¬†in); Rav Avraham Chaim Naeh approximates at 2¬†cm (0.79¬†in); Talmudic scholar Chazon Ish at 2.38¬†cm (0.94¬†in). The \"mile\" (\"Mil\") is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760¬†ft) ‚Äî approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land mile of 5280¬†ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6¬†km).\n\nThe precise width of the \"etzba\" (finger) has been a subject of controversy among halakhic authorities. The best known are those of the Rav Chayim No'eh and Chazon Ish.\n\nSee also Rabbi Chaim P. Benish's \"Midos V'Shiurei Torah\" where he brings an alternative view in understanding the \"Rambam\" and therefore suggests that the \"etsba\", according to the \"Rambam\", is 0.748‚Äì0.756¬†in (1.90‚Äì1.92¬†cm). This would affect the other measurements in the following ways: \"Tefah\" 2.99‚Äì3.02¬†in (7.59‚Äì7.67¬†cm); \"Zeret\" 8.98‚Äì9.07¬†in (22.81‚Äì23.03¬†cm); \"Amah\" 17.95‚Äì18.14¬†in (45.59‚Äì46.08¬†cm).\n\nAlternatively, according to some early authorities a \"zeret\" is two \"tefahim\" instead of three.\n\nTo the somewhat simple system of distance, the Talmud adds a few more units, namely the double palm (Hebrew: ◊ó◊°◊ô◊ò, \"hasit\"), the pace (Hebrew: ◊§◊°◊ô◊¢◊î, \"pesiah\"), the cord (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ë◊ú, \"hebel\"), the stadium (Hebrew: ◊®◊ô◊°, \"ris\"), the day's journey (Hebrew:◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ô◊ï◊ù, \"derekh yom\"), and an undetermined quantity named the garmida (Hebrew: ◊í◊®◊û◊ô◊ì◊ê). The \"stadium\" appears to have been adopted from Persia, while the \"double palm\" seems to have been derived from the Greek \"dichas\".\nThe relationship between four of these \"additional\" units and the earlier system is as follows:\n\nThe other two additional units are more ambiguous. The \"garmida\" is mentioned repeatedly but without its size being indicated; it is even sometimes treated as an area, and as a volume. The \"cord\" is given two different definitions; in the Mishnah it is 50 ells, but in the Gemara it is only 4 ells.\n\nThe Israelite system of measuring area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown with a certain volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 \"seah\"s of barley. The closest thing to a formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew \"semed\") (sometimes translated as \"acre\"), which referred to the amount of land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.\n\n\"Searah\" () - (pl. \"searot\") hair, square 1/36 of a \"geris\"\n\n\"Adashah\" () - (pl. \"adashot\") lentils, 1/9 of a \"geris\"\n\n\"Geris\" () - (pl. \"gerisin\") hulled fava bean, a circle with a diameter of about 2 centimeters (0.8¬†in)\n\n\"Amah al amah\" () - (pl. \"amot\") square cubit 0.232 to 0.328¬†m (2.50-3.53¬†ft)\n\n\"Beit rova\" () - (pl. \"batei rova\") space for sowing ¬º of a \"kav\" 24 to 34.5 m (258‚Äì372¬†ft)\n\n\"Beit seah\" () - (pl. \"batei seah\") space for sowing a \"seah\" 576 to 829.5 m (689-992 yd)\n\n\"Beit kor\" () - (pl. \"batei kor\") space for sowing a \"kor\" of seed, or what is 30 \"seah\" in volume; the area needed is appx. 1.73 to 2.48 hectares (4.27-6.15 acres), or about 23,000 m in area.\n\nThe Israelite system of powder/liquid volume measurements corresponds exactly with the Babylonian system. Unlike the Egyptian system, which has units for multiples of 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 of the base unit, the Babylonian system is founded on multiples of 6 and 10, namely units of 1, 12, 24, 60, 72 (60 plus 12), 120, and 720. The basic unit was the \"mina\", which was defined as 1 sixtieth of a \"maris\", which itself was the quantity of water equal in weight to a light royal talent; the \"maris\" was thus equal to about 30.3 litres, and hence the \"mina\" is equal to about 0.505 litres. In the Israelite system, the term \"log\" is used in place of the Babylonian \"mina\" but the measurement is otherwise the same.\n\nAlthough they both use the \"log\" as the basic unit, the Israelites differentiated their systems of volume measure between dry and liquid states.\n\nFor dry measurements, the smallest unit was the egg (Hebrew: \"Beitza\"), then came the \"Log\" (◊ú◊í), \"Kab\" (◊ß◊ë), \"Se'ah\" (◊°◊ê◊î), \"Eiphah\" (◊ê◊ô◊§◊î), \"Lethek\" (◊ú◊™◊ö), and \"Kor\" (◊õ◊ï◊®). The \"Lethek\" is mentioned only once in the masoretic text, and the Septuagint translates it by the Greek term \"nebeloinou\", meaning \"wine-skin\". These measurements were related as follows:\n\nThe smaller unit the Ke'zayit is, by different sources, considered equal to 1/2 a beitza, 1/3 of a beitza, or not directly related to the other units of volume.\n\nThe \"Omer\", which the Torah mentions as being equal to one-tenth of an \"Eiphah\", is equivalent to the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of three \"seahs\". In dry weight, the \"omer\" weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the dough offering. In the Torah, it is the Priestly Code which refers to the \"Omer\", rather than to the \"Se'ah\" or \"Kab\"; textual scholars view the Priestly Code as one of the later sources of the Torah, dating from a period when Egypt and Assyria had much more direct influence over Israel.\n\nAccording to Ezekiel 45:11 both the eipha and the bath were one tenth an omer (◊î◊ï◊û◊® \"HOMeR\"). Boadt notes the word homer comes from the Hebrew for an \"ass.\" \"It is one ass-load.\"\n\nUse of the \"Omer\" to collect manna is explained by Egyptian influence.\n\nFor liquid measure, the main units were the \"Log\", \"Hin\", and \"Bath\", related as follows:\n\nThe \"Bath\", equal to 72 \"Logs\", is thus the liquid equivalent of the \"Ephah\", also equal to 72 \"Logs\". The liquid equivalent of the \"omer\", which appears without a special name, only being described as the tenth part of a bath, is as much of an awkward fit as the \"omer\" itself, and is only mentioned by Ezekiel and the Priestly Code; scholars attribute the same explanation to it as with the \"Omer\" ‚Äî that it arose as a result of decimalisation. The Omer is mentioned as a tenth of an ephah in Exodus 16:36, before the Priestly code.\n\nAccording to Herbert G. May, chief editor of two classic Bible-related reference books, the bath may be archaeologically determined to have been about 22 liters (5.75 US gal) from a study of jar remains marked 'bath' and 'royal bath' from Tell Beit Mirsim.\n\nIn Talmudic times many more measures of capacity were used, mostly of foreign origin, especially from Persia and Greece, which had both held dominance over Judea by the time the Talmud came to be created. The definitions for many of these are disputed. Those that were certain (disputed) fractions of the \"Kab\" include, in increasing order of size, \"ukla\" (◊¢◊ï◊õ◊ú◊ê), \"tuman\" (◊™◊ï◊û◊ü), and \"kapiza\" (◊ß◊§◊ô◊ñ◊ê). Those that were larger, in increasing order of size, included the \"modius\" (◊û◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ê), \"geriwa\" (geriwa), \"garab\" (◊í◊®◊ë). Of unidentified size were the \"ardaba\" (◊ê◊ì◊®◊ë), the \"kuna\" (◊õ◊ï◊†◊ê), and the \"qometz\" (◊ß◊û◊•); the latter two of these were said to equate to a \"handful\".\n\nThe Babylonian system, which the Israelites followed, measured weight with units of the \"talent\", \"mina\", \"shekel\" (Hebrew: ◊©◊ß◊ú), and \"giru\", related to one another as follows:\n\nIn the Israelite system, the ratio of the \"giru\" to the \"shekel\" was altered, and the \"talent\", \"mina\", and \"giru\", later went by the names \"kikkar\" (◊õ◊õ◊®), \"litra\", and \"gerah\" (◊í◊®◊î), respectively; \"litra\" is a loan word from Latin - \"libra\", meaning \"pound\".\nThe Israelite system was thus as follows:\n\n\nThere were, however, different versions of the \"talent\"/\"kikkar\" in use; a \"royal\" and a \"common\" version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light \"royal\" talent was often represented in the form of a duck, while the heavy \"royal\" talent often took the form of a lion. The \"mina\" for the heavy \"royal\" talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23¬†lbs), while that for the heavy \"common\" talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17¬†lbs); accordingly, the heavy \"common\" shekel would be about 15.87 grams (0.56¬†oz). According to Josephus, it was the heavy \"common\" talent, and its \"mina\" and \"shekel\", that was the normal measure of weight in Syria and Judea; Josephus also mentions an additional unit ‚Äì the \"bekah\" ‚Äì which was exactly half a shekel.\n\nGradually, the system was reformed, perhaps under the influence of Egypt, so that a \"mina\" was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the shekel remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard \"mina\" was reduced. Moses mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of silver; thus each shekel coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical shekel was initially worth about 3‚Öì denarii, but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hebrew calendar is a lunar calendar synchronised with the seasons by intercalation, i.e. a lunisolar calendar. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as \"Ziv\" (meaning \"light\") and \"Ethanim\" (meaning \"strong\", perhaps in the sense of \"strong rain\" - i.e. \"monsoon\"), with Canaanite origins, but after the Babylonian captivity, the names were changed to the ones used by the Babylonians. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as \"Adar I\", the following month being \"Adar\"/\"Adar II\" (in the Babylonian calendar, it was \"Adar II\" that was considered to be the intercalary month).\n\nThe Israelite month was clearly broken up into weeks, since the Genesis creation (and biblical references to Shabbat) describe a seven-day week. The seven-day cycle is not seen as a cycle in nature and is rather a custom biblically originating from .\n\nThe modern Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day weekly cycle, which runs concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the Sabbath, as well as the true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus 20:10 and 24:21; Deut. 5:14; Amos 8:5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon , as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1:13; Amos 8:5; H Kings 6:23).\n\nThe names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example \"Day 1, or Yom Rishon\".\n\nIn addition to \"tomorrow\" (\"machar\") and \"yesterday\" (\"etmol\"), the Israelite vocabulary also contained a distinct word for \"two days ago\" (\"shilshom\"). \"Ma·∏•aratayim\" (\"the day after tomorrow\"), is a dual form of \"machar\", literally \"two tomorrows\". In the Bible, the day is divided up vaguely, with descriptions such as \"midnight\", and \"half-night\". Nevertheless, it is clear that the day was considered to start at dusk.\n\nBy Talmudic times, the Babylonian system of dividing up the day (from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to sunset), into hours (Hebrew: ◊©◊¢◊î, \"sha'ah\"), parts (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ú◊ß, \"heleq\", plural \"halaqim\"), and moments (Hebrew: ◊®◊í◊¢, \"rega\", plural \"rega'im\"), had been adopted; the relationship of these units was:\n\n\nTo complicate matters, Halakha, speaking of the relative hour, states that there are always 12 hours between the break of dawn and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.\n\n\n\n"}

They were founded in 1990 and disbanded some two years after Stoll's early death in 1998. At the time of Stoll's death there were five \"Christian Communities\", four in the U.S. and one in Canada. G.C. Waldrep calls them \"perhaps the most important \"para-Amish\" group\".\n\nElmo Stoll of Aylmer, Ontario, born 1945, was ordained as an Amish minister in 1971 and as an Amish bishop in 1984. As such he forced the members of his church to dress plainer and he also enforced other changes in the direction of stricter plainness and less modern technology , e. g. he forbade to use of electronic calculators. Moreover, he became an ardent preacher. He also wrote a regular column in the Amish magazine \"Family Life\", until he left the Amish and created the ‚ÄúChristian Communities‚Äù.\n\nElmo Stoll helped a young couple, seekers of French-Canadian background, Marc Villeneuve and his wife, to join the Amish community at Aylmer. This young man started to raise questions about several religious practices and was backed by Elmo's sons and more and more by Elmo himself. In December 1989 the ministers of the Aylmer Amish settlement met to discuss five issues, Elmo and his followers had raised: Evangelizing outside the Plain churches, the use of the English language to reach seekers, Christian community of goods (like the Hutterites), the mandatory wearing of hats for men and the question of fellowship with other plain churches. Elmo Stoll was favoring fellowship with the Noah Hoover Mennonites and the Orthodox Mennonites. No decision was made after this meeting. Elmo Stoll then explained his ideas in the Book \"Let Us Reason Together\".\n\nIn July 1990 the disunion was that strong that the other bishops of Aylmer consulted with outside bishops and the decision was made to let Elmo start a new community, separated from the Aylmer community. Elmo and his followers were not excommunicated, but it was not allowed that individuals could freely move between the two communities. So Elmo Stoll and his followers withdrew from the Amish church in Aylmer in September 1990 to organize a plain, horse-and-buggy, English-speaking community in Cookeville, Tennessee, that was rooted in Anabaptism. Cookeville was chosen because of its proximity to the like-minded Noah Hoover Mennonites in Scottsville, Kentucky.\n\nElmo Stoll intended to create a church mostly modeled on the Amish, but with community of goods and without the German language and other obstacles in order to help Christian seekers from a non-plain background to integrate into a very plain, low technology Christian life without materialism.\n\nTwo hundred acres with a dilapidated barn on it were bought in Cookeville, Tennessee and on October 5, 1990, Elmo Stoll and his followers arrived there. In the beginning they lived in two small houses rented on a nearby farm. Building houses without modern appliances was hard and with the help of several men from nearby Noah Hoover Mennonites from Scottsville, they dug the basements and foundations by hand. There was no indoor plumbing, that is no running water, no showers or bath tubes and no toilets in the houses, instead there were outhouse.\n\nFrom the beginning there was disunion among the members, because some members wanted a communal living, with all meals shared, and only private rooms, while other members wanted private houses and meals only with a communal purse. In the end it was decided that each family would have its own household. Within months more and more people arrived and in spring each family started to plant a market garden.\n\nEven though officially there was no Ordnung (set of rules), the people of the Christian Community at Cookeville dressed very plain, but in a way distinctive from the Amish. The men wore collarless shirts, suspenders and untrimmed beards with mustaches. Hats for men were allowed, but strongly discouraged. The women wore some kind of kerchiefs, instead of bonnets and plain dresses with capes. Cars were forbidden, but bicycles were allowed. Power tools and other modern equipment, for example gasoline engines, were also not allowed.\n\nStoll's charisma and the spiritual and theological openness of the group did not only attract Amish and people with an Old Order Mennonite or an Old German Baptist background, but also dozens of families and individuals from non-plain churches. The community at Cookeville had to struggle to accommodate all the visitors, who wanted to move in.\n\nThe emphasis on voluntary poverty and the community of goods in the beginning made it impossible to save money to buy more land in other locations. Therefore the community of goods was soon abandoned and the ‚ÄúChristian Community\" could spread to other places. When Elmo Stoll died in 1998, there were five ‚ÄúChristian Communities‚Äù: \n\nAfter the early death of Elmo Stoll by heart failure two of the \"Christian Communities\", Cookeville and Woodstock, disbanded while the one in Holland, KY and part of the one in Decatur, who moved to Delano, Tennessee, joined the Noah Hoover Mennonites, a very plain horse and buggy Old Order group, that is rather intentionalist minded than traditional. The community in Smyrna, after having lost most of its members without Amish background, developed a fellowship with an Amish community in Manton, Michigan, which is affiliated with the Amish Michigan Churches. The community in Smyrna, that became Amish, was the first Amish community in Maine. Several of Elmo Stoll's sons and others with Amish background returned to the Amish community in Aylmer, Ontario.\n\nA community in Kentucky of some 15 families, the Caneyville Christian Community, founded in 2004 by three men, among them one of Elmo Stoll's sons, still adheres to Elmo Stoll's vision.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1998 the \"Christian Communities\" at Cookeville published a small bimonthly pamphlet, called \"The Update\", which contained lengthy \"community news\", columns, letters (both approving and critical) and long articles on faith and practice written by Elmo Stoll and other ministers. Very important for the community were two books written by Elmo Stoll: \"Let Us Reason Together\" (1990) and \"Why We Live Simply\" (1996).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22579780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22579780", "title": "Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy", "text": "Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy\n\nIn Bible prophecy, several verses relate to the future of the Davidic line. Christians argue that Jesus fulfills these prophecies, while skeptics and Jews disagree.\n\nAfter Zedekiah, the last king of Judah was forced out by Nebuchadnezzar in the siege of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 32:4-5), the says: 'David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel...'\"(Jeremiah 33:17) Jehoiachin was placed in a position of authority during Babylonian exile at the end of 2 Kings. He was called king under exile in several Babylonian food-rationing lists.\n\nJeremiah prophesied that Jehoiakim will have no one to sit on the throne of David (Jeremiah 36:30). His son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king for three months and ten days before Nebuchadnezzar forced him out, ending the reign of Jehoiakim's descendants (2 Chron. 36:8,9; 2 Kings 24:8). After Jehoiachin spent 37 years in prison, Nebuchadnezzar's successor Evil-merodach released the imprisoned king Jehoiachin and elevated him above all other captive kings that were in Babylon(2 Kings 25:27). Jehoiakim is the ancestor of Jesus' earthly father Joseph according to Matt. 1:11 (skipped in list) (see 1 Chronicles 3:15-16 and 2 Kings 24:8).\n\nIn Jeremiah 22:30, God states that neither Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah) or his offspring will prosper, for none of his offspring will sit on throne of David and rule over Judah.\n\nJehoiachin's offspring did not sit on the throne of David or rule over Judah. 2 Kings 25:27 records that Jehoiachin was a prisoner for thirty seven years. For two years, Evil-merodach king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon and gave him a regular daily allowance all the days of his life. (2 Kings 25:27-30) His family retained leadership of the Babylonian exiles (Ezek. 1:2), and his descendants were at the head of those who returned to Zion. He is the ancestor of Jesus' earthly father Joseph according to Matt. 1:12.\n\nGod states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called \"the one who will build a house for my Name\" in the verse) will last forever.(2 Sam. 7:12-16, 2 Chronicles 13:5, Psalm 89:20-37) 1 Kings 9:4-7 as well as 1 Ch 28:5 and 2 Ch 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on Solomon obeying God's commandments.\n\nSolomon built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chron. 6:7-10, 2 Chronicles 2:1) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1-14).\n\nThe destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David.\n\nSome scholars state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally.(1 Kings 11:36, 15:4, 2 Kings 8:19) They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4-7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression \"throne of Israel\" as a reference to the throne of the United Monarchy. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the Book of Kings.\n\nChristians believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king, which they state Jesus did, rather than a permanent earthly kingship. The Bible Knowledge Commentary states:\n\nGod did not promise an unbroken monarchy but an unbroken line of descendants from David who would be qualified to sit on that throne when it was reestablished. David‚Äôs line would not fail before the righteous Branch came to claim His throne (cf. Luke 1:31-33). The genealogies of Matthew and Luke show that this promise was fulfilled as Christ was able to trace both His legal line through Joseph and His physical line through Mary back to David (Matt. 1:1-16; Luke 3:23-31).\n\nChristians believe that Matthew and Luke present two different genealogies. They point out that some names are common to both, but many names are different. Matthew begins at the patriarch Abraham and works his way to Jesus the Christ, while Luke begins at Jesus and works his way back to Adam. They argue Matthew presents the genealogy of Joseph, and Luke presents the genealogy of Mary. In Luke's days they argue, it was proper and correct to cite Joseph's name in Mary's genealogy. Christians argue that Joseph adopted Jesus as his legal son and thus Jesus became both David's direct descendant through David's son Nathan (Luke's genealogy) and David's legal royal heir through Solomon (Matthew's genealogy).\n\nCritics claim this is just a required reinterpretation of the prophecy. In rabbinic thinking, the reestablishment of the Davidic kingdom was tied to the Messiah, who was to be a descendant of King David. He would redeem the Jews from exile and reestablish their independence in the land of Israel. Jews argue this is not fulfilled in Jesus. Jews and skeptics argue that Matthew and Luke made numerous mistakes in their genealogies of Jesus that eliminate him from Messianic consideration. Matthew and Luke traced Jesus' lineage through Joseph back to King David. (However, the gospels also assert that Jesus was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit, not Joseph. There is, nonetheless, an implied indication in the Gospels that Joseph adopted Jesus.).\n\nIf he was adopted, they argue, based on a distinction between full-blooded Jews and half-blooded Jews in the scripture,(Numbers 1:18-44, 34:14; Leviticus 24:10) under Jewish law certain family and tribal affiliations must be through the birth father and cannot be claimed by adoption. Moreover, Jews argue that the Messiah must descend through David's son Solomon (2 Sam 7:12-16, Psalm 89:28-38, 1 Chronicles 17:11-14, 22:9-10, 28:6-7). Luke's genealogy of Joseph is traced back to David through his son Nathan (who was not a king). They argue this eliminates Jesus' genealogy in Luke. In addition, to presume that Mary was of Davidic descent in Luke presents the problem that Mary could not pass on what she did not possess: (1) Maternal connection does not enter into consideration for succession to the throne of David which is passed on only through a continuous male line: \"There shall not be cut off from David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel\" (Jeremiah 33:17); (2) Biblically, the right of lineal privilege, that is, kingship and priesthood, are exclusively passed on through the male line. Matthew's genealogy of Joseph is traced back to David through his son Solomon, but ultimately down to the cursed Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim who was also cursed in Jeremiah 36:30. Jeconiah was told that none of his descendants could ever sit on the throne of David.(Jeremiah 22:30) Jews thus argue the Messiah must descend from King Solomon but not from King Jeconiah. Jews point out that Jeconiah's grandson, Zerubbabel, held power granted by God, though he was never king. Jews argue that on top of Nathan not being king, Luke 3:27 includes Shealtiel and Zerubbabel, both of whom are descendants of the cursed Jeconiah in Matthew 1:12. This is part of the reason Jews give for rejecting Jesus as the promised future descendant of David who would once again rule over Israel.\n\nChristians respond that a virgin birth avoids what they claim is a physical but not legal curse of Jehoiakim (while a reversal of the curse may have even occurred; and even if no reversal occurred, an adoption by a descendant of King Solomon gives Jesus legal inheritance rights to that kingdom‚Äîthus, again, protecting him from the physical curse.). Christians and the New Testament itself also argue that the names Zerubbabel and Shealtiel in the two lineages have different parents and children and therefore are just common names that do not refer to the same people. Christians also argue that the promise that the Messiah would descend from Solomon is conditional.(1 Kings 9:4-7; 1 Chron. 28:7) Christians point to Solomon violating this condition.(1 Kings 11:1-14) Furthermore, Christians argue that although Jewish nationality and tribal identity were normally determined by the father, with the Messiah it would be different. This exception to the rule became apparent, it is argued, when Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that the Messiah would be born of a virgin: \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.\"\n\nJews respond that the virgin birth is substantiated by a misused excerpt of Isaiah(see ). Accordingly, Jewish scholars never considered Isaiah 7:14 as a messianic prophecy.\n\n"}

{"id": "8691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8691", "title": "Divination", "text": "Divination\n\nDivination (from Latin \"divinare\" \"to foresee, to be inspired by a god\", related to \"divinus\", divine) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual. Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.\n\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.\n\nDivination is dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstition. In the 2nd century, Lucian devoted a witty essay to the career of a charlatan, \"Alexander the false prophet\", trained by \"one of those who advertise enchantments, miraculous incantations, charms for your love-affairs, visitations for your enemies, disclosures of buried treasure, and successions to estates\", even though most Romans believed in prophetic dreams and charms.\n\nThe Oracle of Amun at the Siwa Oasis was made famous when Alexander the Great visited it after conquering Egypt from Persia in 332 BC.\nBoth oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. Oracles were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles‚Äô limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (\"ŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒµŒπœÇ\" in Greek).\n\nSeers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including extispicy, bird signs, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.\n\nThe disadvantage to seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.\n\nAt battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the campground (a process called the \"hiera\") and at the battlefield (called the \"sphagia\"). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal‚Äôs last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate omens.\n\nBecause the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks.\n\nThe divination method of casting lots (Cleromancy) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus in to select a replacement for Judas Iscariot. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christian emperors during ancient Rome.\n\nIn 692 the Quinisext Council, also known as the \"Council in Trullo\" in the Eastern Orthodox Church, passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices. Fortune-telling and other forms of divination were widespread through the Middle Ages. In the constitution of 1572 and public regulations of 1661 of Kur-Saxony, capital punishment was used on those predicting the future. Laws forbidding divination practice continue to this day.\n\nSm√•land is famous for √Örsg√•ng, a practice which occurred until the early 19th century in some parts of Sm√•land. Generally occurring on Christmas and New Year's Eve, it is a practice in which one would fast and keep themselves away from light in a room until midnight to then complete a set of complex events to interpret symbols encountered throughout the journey to foresee the coming year.\n\nDivination was a central component of ancient Mesoamerican religious life. Many Aztec gods, including central creator gods, were described as diviners and were closely associated with sorcery. Tezcatlipoca is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of magic. His name means \"smoking mirror\", a reference to a device used for divinatory scrying. In the Mayan \"Popol Vuh\", the creator gods Xmucane and Xpiacoc perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.\n\nEvery civilization that developed in pre-Columbian Mexico, from the Olmecs to the Aztecs, practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, mirrors, or the casting of lots were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice. Visions derived from hallucinogens were another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more common hallucinogenic plants used in divination are morning glory, jimson weed, and peyote.\n\nBuddhists in Asia divine by different methods.\nAs seen previous to this section, many different cultures around the world use divination as a way of understanding the future. The most common act of divination in the Bao‚Äôan village in Taiwan is called the Poe, Bao‚Äôan is not the actual name of the village, but for privacy purposes that is what it will be called. The Poe translated to English means ‚Äúmoon boards‚Äù. The Poe consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The one edge is rounded while the other is flat; the two are mirror images. Both crescents are held out in one‚Äôs palms and while kneeling, they are raised to the forehead level. Once in this position the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing. If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up, that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree. If the blocks land one rounded and one flat, the deity agrees. ‚ÄúLaughing poe‚Äù is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill. ‚ÄúNegative poe‚Äù is seen when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop, this indicates anger. When there is a positive fall, is called ‚Äúsacred poe‚Äù, although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously. As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur, and if the answer is yes, the blocks are dropped again. To make sure the answer is definitely a yes, the blocks must fall in a ‚Äúyes‚Äù position three times in a row.\nA more serious type of divination is the Ki≈ç-√°. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, during this incense are being burned, and the supernatural agent is asked to descend into the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the god who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted .\n\nIn Japan, divination methods include Futomani from the Shinto tradition.\n\nDivination is one of the tenets of Serer religion. However, only those who have been initiated as Saltigues (the Serer high priests and priestesses) can divine the future. These are the \"hereditary rain priests\" whose role is both religious and medicinal.\n\nSpecialized diviners called Ob'guega (doctor of Oguega oracle), as well as Ob'Oronmila (doctor of Oronmila oracle) from the Edo people of West Africa for thousands have used divination as a means of foretelling the past, present and future. These diviners are initiated and trained in Iha (divination) of either Ominigbon or Oronmila (Benin Orunmila).\n\nThe Yoruba people of West Africa are internationally known for having developed the If√° system, an intricate process of divination that is performed by an \"Awo\", an initiated priest or priestess of Orunmila, the spirit of the Yoruba oracle.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4620655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4620655", "title": "Eastern Chalukyas", "text": "Eastern Chalukyas\n\nEastern Chalukyas, also known as the Chalukyas of Vengi, were a dynasty that ruled parts of South India between the 7th and 12th centuries. They started out as governors of the Chalukyas of Badami in the Deccan region. Subsequently, they became a sovereign power, and ruled the Vengi region of present-day Andhra Pradesh until . They continued ruling the region as feudatories of the Cholas until 1189 CE. \n\nOriginally, the capital of the Eastern Chalukyas was located at the Vengi city (modern Pedavegi near Eluru). It was subsequently moved to Rajamahendravaram (modern Rajahmundry). Throughout their history the Eastern Chalukyas were the cause of many wars between the more powerful Cholas and Western Chalukyas over the control of the strategic Vengi country. The five centuries of the Eastern Chalukya rule of Vengi saw not only the consolidation of this region into a unified whole, but also saw the efflorescence of Telugu culture, literature, poetry and art during the later half of their rule.\n\nThe Chalukyas of Vengi branched off from the Chalukyas of Badami. The Badami ruler Pulakeshin II (608‚Äì644 C.E) conquered the Vengi region in eastern Deccan, after defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina dynasty. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana the governor of this newly acquired territory in 624 CE. Vishnuvardhana's viceroyalty subsequently developed into an independent kingdom, possibly after Pulakeshin died fighting the Pallavas in the Battle of Vatapi.\n\nFrom the 11th century onward, the dynasty started claiming legendary lunar dynasty origins. According to this legend, the dynasty descended from the Moon, via Budha, Pururava, the Pandavas, Satanika and Udayana. 59 unnamed descendants of Udayana ruled at Ayodhya. Their descendant Vijayaditya was killed in a battle with Trilochana Pallava, during an expedition in Dakshinapatha (Deccan). His pregnant widow was given shelter by Vishnubhatta Somayaji of Mudivemu (modern Jammalamadugu). She named her son Vishnuvardhana after her benefactor. When the boy grew up, he became the ruler of Dakshinapatha by the grace of the goddess Nanda Bhagavati.\n\nBetween 641 CE and 705 CE some kings, except Jayasimha I and Mangi Yuvaraja, ruled for very short durations. Then followed a period of unrest characterised by family feuds and weak rulers. Meanwhile, the Rashtrakutas of Malkhed ousted Western Chalukyas of Badami. The weak rulers of Vengi had to meet the challenge of the Rashtrakutas, who overran their kingdom more than once. There was no Eastern Chalukya ruler who could check them until Gunaga Vijayaditya III came to power in 848 CE. The then Rashtrakuta ruler Amoghavarsha treated him as his ally and after Amoghavarsha's death, Vijayaditya proclaimed independence.\n\nIn its early life, the Eastern Chalukya court was essentially a republic of Badami, and as generations passed, local factors gained in strength and the Vengi monarchy developed features of its own. External influences still continued to be present as the Eastern Chalukyas had long and intimate contact, either friendly or hostile, with the Pallavas, the Rashtrakutas, the Cholas and the Chalukyas of Kalyani.\n\nThe Eastern Chalukyan government was a monarchy based on the Hindu philosophy. The inscriptions refer to the traditional seven components of the state (Saptanga), and the eighteen Tirthas (Offices), such as:\n\n\nNo information is available as to how the work of administration was carried out. The \"Vishaya\" and \"Kottam\" were the administrative subdivisions known from records. The \"Karmarashtra\" and the \"Boya-Kottams\" are examples of these. The royal edicts (recording gifts of lands or villages) are addressed to all \"Naiyogi Kavallabhas\", a general term containing no indication of their duties, as well as to the \"Grameyakas\", the residents of the village granted. The \"Manneyas\" are also occasionally referred in inscriptions. They held assignments of land or revenue in different villages.\n\nFratricidal wars and foreign invasions frequently disturbed the land. The territory was parcelled out into many small principalities (estates) held by the nobility consisting of collateral branches of the ruling house such as those of Elamanchili, Pithapuram and Mudigonda, and a few other families such as the Kona Haihayas (Heheya, Kalachuris, Kolanu Saronathas, Chagis, Parichedas, Kota Vamsas, Velanadus and Kondapadamatis, closely connected by marriage ties with the Eastern Chalukyas and families who were raised to high position for their loyal services. When the Vengi ruler was strong, the nobility paid allegiance and tribute to him, but when the weakness was apparent, they were ready to join hands with the enemies against the royal house.\n\nThe population in the Vengi country was heterogeneous in character. Xuanzang, who travelled in the Andhra country after the establishment of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom, noted that the people were of a violent character, were of a dark complexion and were fond of arts. The society was based on hereditary caste system. Even the Buddhists and Jains who originally disregarded caste, adopted it. Besides the four traditional castes, minor communities like Boyas and Savaras (Tribal groups) also existed.\n\nThe Brahmins were held in high esteem in the society. They were proficient in Vedas and Shastras and were given gifts of land and money. They held lucrative posts such as councillors, ministers and members of civil service. They even entered the army and some of them rose to positions of high command. The Kshatriyas were the ruling class. Their love of intrigue and fighting was responsible for civil war for two centuries. The Komatis (Vaishyas) were a flourishing trading community. Their organisation into a powerful guild (Nakaram) which had its headquarters in Penugonda (West Godavari) and branches in seventeen other centres had its beginnings in this period. It seems there used to be a minister for communal affairs (Samaya Mantri) in the government. The Shudras constituted the bulk of the population and there were several sub-castes among them. The army furnished a career for most of them and some of them acquired the status of Samanta Raju and Mandalika.\n\nHinduism was the prominent religion of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom, with Shaivism being more popular than Vaishnavism. The Mahasena temple at Chebrolu became famous for its annual Jatra, which involved a procession of the deity's idol from Chebrolu to Vijayawada and back. Some of the rulers, declared themselves as \"Parama Maheswaras\" (Emperors). The Buddhist religious centres eventually attained great celebrity as Siva pilgrim centres. Eastern Chalukya rulers like Vijayaditya II, Yuddhamalla I, Vijayaditya III and Bhima I took active interest in the construction of many temples. The temple establishments like dancers and musicians show that during this period, temples were not only a centre of religious worship but a fostering ground for fine arts.\n\nBuddhism, which was dominant during the Satavahanas was in decline. Its monasteries were practically deserted. Due to their love of sacred relics in stupas, a few might have lingered on, Xuanzang noticed some twenty or more Buddhist monasteries in which more than three thousand monks lived.\n\nJainism, unlike Buddhism, continued to enjoy some support from the people. This is evident from the several deserted images in ruined villages all over Andhra. The inscriptions also record the construction of Jain temples and grants of land for their support from the monarchs and the people. The rulers like Kubja Vishnuvardhana, Vishnuvardhana III and Amma II patronised Jainism. Vimaladitya even became a declared follower of the doctrine of Mahavira. Vijayawada, Jenupadu, Penugonda (West Godavari) and Munugodu were the famous Jain centres of the period.\n\nTelugu literature owes its origin to the Eastern Chalukyas. Poetry makes its first appearance in the Addanki, Kandukur and Dharmavaram inscriptions of Pandaranga, Army Chief of Vijayaditya III, in the later half of the 9th century. However, literary compositions dating earlier than 11th century CE are not clearly known. Nannaya was the poet-laureate of Rajaraja Narendra in the middle of the 11th century. An erudite scholar, he was well-versed in the Vedas, Shastras and the ancient epics, and undertook the translation of the Mahabharata into Telugu. Narayana Bhatta who was proficient in eight languages assisted him in his endeavour. Though incomplete, his work is acclaimed as a masterpiece of Telugu literature.\nKubja Vishnuvardhana, the founder of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty, was the brother of the Chalukya king, Pulakeshin II. The Chalukyas therefore governed both the Karnata and Andhra countries and patronised Kannada as well as Telugu. This very likely led to a close connection between Telugu and Kannada literature. A number of Telugu authors of the age also wrote in Kannada and vice versa. Nannaya-Bhatta's \"Bharata\" in Telugu includes the \"Akkara\", a metre considered unique to Kannada works. The same metre is also found in Yudhamalla's Bezwada inscription. Another inscription notes that Narayana-Bhatta, who assisted Nannaya-Bhatta in composing the \"Bharata\", was also a Kannada poet and was granted a village by Rajaraja Narendra in 1053 for his contribution. Later Kannada poets, Pampa I and Nagavarma I, also hailed from families originally from Vengi.\n\nDue to the widely spread Shiva devotional cult in the kingdom, the Eastern Chalukyan kings undertook construction of temples on a large scale. Vijayaditya II is credited with the construction of 108 temples. Yuddhamalla I erected a temple to Kartikeya at Vijayawada. Bhima I constructed the famous Draksharama and Chalukya Bhimavaram (Samalkot) temples. Rajaraja Narendra erected three memorial shrines at Kalidindi (West Godavari). The Eastern Chalukyas, following the Pallava and Chalukya traditions, developed their own independent style of architecture, which is visible in the Pancharama shrines (especially the Draksharama temple) and Biccavolu temples. The Golingeshvara temple at Biccavolu contains some richly carved out sculptures of deities like Ardhanarishvara, Shiva, Vishnu, Agni, Chamundi and Surya.\n\n\n"}

The species was formerly widely included in the genus \"Acacia\" as \"Acacia albida\". It has also been introduced to Pakistan and India. Common names for it include apple-ring acacia (their circular, indehiscent seed pods resemble apple rings), ana tree, balanzan tree, gao tree and winter thorn.\n\nIt is a thorny tree growing up tall and in trunk diameter. Its deep-penetrating tap root makes it highly resistant to drought. The bark is grey, and fissured when old. There are 11,000 seeds/kg. \"Faidherbia albida\" is not listed as being a threatened species.\n\nIt grows in areas with of rain per year.\n\n\"Faiderbia albida\" is known in the Bambara language as \"balanzan\" and is the official tree of the city of Segou on the Niger River in central Mali. According to legend, Segou is home to 4,444 \"balanzan\" trees, plus one mysterious \"missing tree\" the location of which cannot be identified.\n\nIn Serer and some of the Cangin languages, it is called \"Saas\". Saas figures prominently in the creation myth of the Serer people. According to their creation myth, it is the tree of life and fertility.\n\nThe northernmost natural populations are found in relict groves in Israel (in the Shimron nature reserve, near the community settlement of Timrat). All of the trees in a given grove are genetically identical and seem to have multiplied by vegetative reproduction only, for thousands of years.\n\n\"Faidherbia albida\" is important in the Sahel for raising bees, since its flowers provide bee forage at the close of the rainy season, when most other local plants do not.\n\nThe seed pods are important for raising livestock, are used as camel fodder in Nigeria, and are relished by elephant, antelope, buffalo, baboons and various browsers and grazers, though strangely ignored by warthog and zebra.\n\nThe wood is used for canoes, mortars, and pestles and the bark is pounded in Nigeria and used as a packing material on pack animals. The wood has a density of about 560¬†kg/m at a water content of 12%. The energy value of the wood as fuel is 19.741 kJ/kg.\n\nAshes of the wood are used in making soap and as a depilatory and tanning agent for hides. The wood is used for carving; the thorny branches useful for a natural barbed fence. Pods and foliage are highly regarded as livestock fodder. Some 90% of Senegalese farmers interviewed by Felker (1981) collected, stored, and rationed Acacia alba pods to livestock. Zimbabweans use the pods to stupefy fish. Humans eat the boiled seeds in times of scarcity in Zimbabwe.\n\nIt is also used for nitrogen fixation, erosion control for crops, for food, drink and medicine. Unlike most other trees, it sheds its leaves in the rainy season; for this reason, it is highly valued in agroforestry as it can grow among field crops without shading them. The leaves from this legume tree are high in nitrogen, and can double yields in maize crops when added to the soil.\n\nThe extract is used to treat ocular infections in farm animals.\n\n"}

Several buildings in the cluster have a classic \"chartaq\" \"four arch\" floor-plan, characteristic of Zoroastrian fire-temples of the 3rd century onwards and that are the actual \"atashgah\"s that housed sacred fires. Other buildings include what may have been storage rooms and living quarters for priests and affluent pilgrims. A tentative identification of the purpose of the ruins was first made in 1937 by Andre Godard, but it was not until 1960, when architect Maxine Siroux made the first drawings, that the site could be properly studied. Godard's identifications were subsequently confirmed by Klaus Schippman in 1971.\n\nAnother feature of the complex are the remains of a tower-like circular building on the very top of the same hill. This structure, which was once at least twenty meters high, is known by the local populace as the \"Burj-i Gurban\", or \"Burj-i Kurban\", \"Tower of Sacrifice,\" and appears to have been a military watch-tower with a flare that could be lit to warn of an approaching enemy (i.e. a beacon).\n\nIn both cases, the remaining walls are of baked brick, held together with a clay-reed mixture. In the 10th century, the buildings were used by the EsmƒÅ'ili inhabitants of Isfahan to hide from tax collectors. The Arab historian Masudi visited the site around the same time, and records local tradition as having believed that the site was converted from one of idol worship to one of fire by \"King Yustasf (i.e. Vishtaspa, the patron of Zoroaster) when he adopted the religion of the Magi.\"\n\nIn 2002 archaeologist Alireza Jafari Zand published a report on pre-Islamic Isfahan in which he emphasizes the religious role of the complex, and with reference to radiocarbon dating suggests that the construction was Elamite (pre-6th century). A doctoral thesis suggests a \"similarity\" between the tower and an edifice in Qom known as the \"Chahak\" fire temple; the similarity being that the building in Qom has a cylindrical structure at the top while the tower in Isfahan is based on a circular plan.\n\n"}
{"id": "657147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657147", "title": "General authority", "text": "General authority\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a general authority is a member of the highest levels of leadership in the church who has administrative and ecclesiastical authority over the church. A general authority's jurisdiction is church-wide, in contrast to the responsibilities of a local authority or an area authority, which relate to a particular area, unit, or department of the church. As a group, the general authorities are often referred to as \"the Brethren\". As of October 2017, there are 109 general authorities.\n\nThe first scriptural use of the term \"general authority\" was in minutes of a meeting for the organization of the Presiding High Council in 1834. Though the original minutes did not refer to the term \"general authorities\", the revised minutes, which were included in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, stated that decisions of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles \"can only be called into question by the general authorities of the church in case of transgression.\" The use of the term \"general authorities\" at this time and in this context is generally interpreted to include the First Presidency and the Presiding High Council.\n\nBy definition, general authorities are members of the church's priesthood. In order of precedence, the general authorities include the members of the following leadership organizations:\n\nNot all church leaders with church-wide responsibility are considered general authorities. The general presidencies of the church's auxiliary organizations, which are sustained as general officers of the church, but are not general authorities, include the general presidencies of the following organizations:\n\n\nThe latter three groups are composed of women and represent the only three organizations in which women are given church-wide authority. \n\nAlso excluded from the definition of general authorities are members of the Third through the Eighth Quorums of the Seventy, who are called \"area seventies\" and have responsibilities relating to a limited geographical area, not church-wide authority.\n\nUntil 2004, general leadership for the Sunday School and Young Men organizations had historically been filled by general authorities. However, in the church's April 2004 general conference, Thomas S. Monson, of the First Presidency, announced that \"a recent decision [has been made] that members of the Quorums of the Seventy [will] not serve in the general presidencies of the Sunday School and Young Men.\"\n\nDue to this change, no general auxiliary presidencies are composed of general authorities. Rather, the general authority seventies remain active in general church committees and have less jurisdiction over local stakes, particularly in North America. Generally, stake presidents now report to area seventies, who in turn report to area presidencies, which are usually composed of general authority seventies. In North America, there are no area presidencies, with members of the Presidency of the Seventy taking the responsibility of overseeing the areas.\n\nTypically, general authorities are given the sealing power, while general officers and area seventies are not.\n\nA person is typically called to be a general authority or general officer by a member of the First Presidency or the Quorum of the Twelve. The president of the church and members of the Quorum of the Twelve are typically called for life, although there have been more than a dozen instances when an apostle has been released from his service in the Quorum of the Twelve due to disfellowshipment, excommunication, or resignation.\n\nAs with any calling in the church, general authorities and general officers serve \"until they are released\". In current church practice, men called to the First Quorum of the Seventy typically remain general authorities for life, but are granted emeritus status in the October following their 70th birthday. Members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy are typically called for a period of five to seven years. When members of the Second Quorum are released, they are no longer general authorities of the church. When members of the presiding bishopric are released, they typically become members of the First Quorum of the Seventy and are therefore retained as lifetime general authorities, including later being granted emeritus status.\n\nIn the biannual general conferences of the church held in April and October, all of the general authorities and general officers of the church are presented to the Latter-day Saints for a sustaining vote, in accordance with the church's interpretation of the principle of \"common consent\". This is a voluntary indication made by each member (usually by raising the right hand) that the member assents to be led by the individuals presented as general authorities and general officers. Members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are always named by name, as are any persons being added or released from a position or any general authority or general officer moving from one organization to another (e.g., a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy being called to the Presidency of the Seventy). Otherwise, the general authorities and general officers of the church are simply sustained \"as presently constituted\".\n\nThis biannual procedure is dictated by church theology, which states that the church shall be governed by the common consent of its membership. Dissenting votes are rare and have even more rarely prevented a person from holding the proposed position. General authorities and general officers are also assigned to deliver sermons during the two-day conferences.\n\n"}
{"id": "25551068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25551068", "title": "God the Father in Western art", "text": "God the Father in Western art\n\nFor about a thousand years, in obedience to interpretations of specific Bible passages, pictorial depictions of God in Western Christianity had been avoided by Christian artists. At first only the Hand of God, often emerging from a cloud, was portrayed. Gradually, portrayals of the head and later the whole figure were depicted, and by the time of the Renaissance artistic representations of God the Father were freely used in the Western Church.\n\nGod the Father can be seen in some late Byzantine Cretan School icons, and ones from the borders of the Catholic and Orthodox worlds, under Western influence, but after the Russian Orthodox Church came down firmly against depicting him in 1667, he can hardly be seen in Russian art. Protestants generally disapprove of the depiction of God the Father, and originally did so strongly.\n\nEarly Christians believed that the words of Book of Exodus 33:20 \"Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live\" and of the Gospel of John 1:18: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father.\nThe Hand of God, an artistic metaphor, is found several times in the only ancient synagogue with a large surviving decorative scheme, the Dura Europos Synagogue of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into Early Christian art from Jewish art. It was common in Late Antique art in both East and West, and remained the main way of depicting the actions or approval of God the Father in the West until about the end of the Romanesque period. It also represents the \"bath Kol\" (literally \"daughter of a voice\") or voice of God, similar to Jewish depictions.\n\nHistorically considered, God the Father is more frequently manifested in the Old Testament, while the Son is manifested in the New Testament. Hence it might be said that the Old Testament refers more especially to the history of the Father and the New Testament to that of the Son. Yet, in early depictions of scenes from the Old Testament, artists used the conventional depiction of Jesus to represent the Father, especially in depictions of the story of Adam and Eve, the most frequently depicted Old Testament narrative shown in Early Medieval art, and one that was felt to require the depiction of a figure of God \"walking in the garden\" (Genesis 3:8).\n\nThe account in Genesis naturally credits the Creation to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\", and New Testament references to Christ as Creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the Logos, or pre-existing Christ, God the Son. From the 4th century the church was also keen to affirm the doctrine of consubstantiality confirmed in the Nicene Creed of 325.\nIt was therefore usual to have depictions of Jesus as Logos taking the place of the Father and creating the world alone, or commanding Noah to construct the ark or speaking to Moses from the Burning bush. There was also a brief period in the 4th century when the Trinity were depicted as three near-identical figures, mostly in depicting scenes from Genesis; the Dogmatic Sarcophagus in the Vatican is the best known example. In isolated cases this iconography is found throughout the Middle Ages, and revived somewhat from the 15th century, though it attracted increasing disapproval from church authorities. A variant is Enguerrand Quarton's contract for the Coronation of the Virgin requiring him to represent the Father and Son of the Holy Trinity as identical figures.\n\nOne scholar has suggested that the enthroned figure in the centre of the apse mosaic of Santa Pudenziana in Rome of 390-420, normally regarded as Christ, in fact represents God the Father.\n\nIn situations, such as the Baptism of Christ, where a specific representation of God the Father was indicated, the Hand of God was used, with increasing freedom from the Carolingian period until the end of the Romanesque. This motif now, since the discovery of the 3rd-century Dura Europos synagogue, seems to have been borrowed from Jewish art, and is found in Christian art almost from its beginnings.\n\nThe use of religious images in general continued to increase up to the end of the 7th century, to the point that in 695, upon assuming the throne, Byzantine emperor Justinian II put an image of Christ on the obverse side of his gold coins, resulting in a rift which ended the use of Byzantine coin types in the Islamic world. However, the increase in religious imagery did not include depictions of God the Father. For instance, while the eighty second canon of the Council of Trullo in 692 did not specifically condemn images of The Father, it suggested that icons of Christ were preferred over Old Testament shadows and figures.\n\nThe beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of Byzantine iconoclasm (literally \"image-breaking\") started. Emperor Leo III (717‚Äì741), suppressed the use of icons by imperial edict of the Byzantine Empire, presumably due to a military loss which he attributed to the undue veneration of icons. The edict (which was issued without consulting the Church) forbade the veneration of religious images but did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross. Theological arguments against icons then began to appear with iconoclasts arguing that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of Jesus at the same time. In this atmosphere, no public depictions of God the Father were even attempted and such depictions only began to appear two centuries later.\n\nThe Second Council of Nicaea in 787 effectively ended the first period of Byzantine iconoclasm and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general. However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint John of Damascus, drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.\n\nIn his treatise \"On the Divine Images\" John of Damascus wrote: \"In former times, God who is without form or body, could never be depicted. But now when God is seen in the flesh conversing with men, I make an image of the God whom I see\". The implication here is that insofar as God the Father or the Spirit did not become man, visible and tangible, images and portrait icons can not be depicted. So what was true for the whole Trinity before Christ remains true for the Father and the Spirit but not for the Word. John of Damascus wrote:\n\"If we attempt to make an image of the invisible God, this would be sinful indeed. It is impossible to portray one who is without body:invisible, uncircumscribed and without form.\"\n\nAround 790 Charlemagne ordered a set of four books that became known as the Libri Carolini (i.e. \"Charles' books\") to refute what his court mistakenly understood to be the iconoclast decrees of the Byzantine Second Council of Nicaea regarding sacred images. Although not well known during the Middle Ages, these books describe the key elements of the Catholic theological position on sacred images. To the Western Church, images were just objects made by craftsmen, to be utilized for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and to be respected for the sake of the subject represented, not in themselves.\n\nThe Council of Constantinople (869) (considered ecumenical by the Western Church, but not the Eastern Church) reaffirmed the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea and helped stamp out any remaining coals of iconoclasm. Specifically, its third canon required the image of Christ to have veneration equal with that of a Gospel book:\nWe decree that the sacred image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the liberator and Savior of all people, must be venerated with the same honor as is given the book of the holy Gospels. For as through the language of the words contained in this book all can reach salvation, so, due to the action which these images exercise by their colors, all wise and simple alike, can derive profit from them.\nBut images of God the Father were not directly addressed in Constantinople in 869. A list of permitted icons was enumerated at this Council, but images of God the Father were not among them. However, the general acceptance of icons and holy images began to create an atmosphere in which God the Father could be depicted.\n\nPrior to the 10th century no attempt was made to represent a separate depiction as a full human figure of God the Father in Western art. Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the 10th century AD.\n\nIt appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a delineation of the whole person. Typically only a small part would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person. In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.\n\nBy the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French illuminated manuscripts, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in stained glass church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the Baptism of Christ on the famous baptismal font in Li√®ge of Rainer of Huy is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene). Gradually the amount of the body shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in Giotto's fresco of c. 1305 in Padua. In the 14th century the Naples Bible carried a depiction of God the Father in the Burning bush. By the early 15th century, the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry has a considerable number of images, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the Garden of Eden (gallery), which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress. The \"Gates of Paradise\" of the Florence Baptistry by Lorenzo Ghiberti, begun in 1425 show a similar tall full-length Father. The Rohan Book of Hours of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer. At the same period other works, like the large Genesis altarpiece by the Hamburg painter Meister Bertram, continued to use the old depiction of Christ as \"Logos\" in Genesis scenes. In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ.\n\nIn an early Venetian school \"Coronation of the Virgin\" by Giovanni d'Alemagna and Antonio Vivarini, (c. 1443) (see gallery below) The Father is shown in the representation consistently used by other artists later, namely as a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the description of the Ancient of Days in the Old Testament, the nearest approach to a physical description of God in the Old Testament:. ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. (Daniel 7:9) \nIn the \"Annunciation\" by Benvenuto di Giovanni in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as \"hands and dove\" continued, e.g. in Verrocchio's \"Baptism of Christ\" in 1472.\n\nIn Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father as an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal tiara, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book. He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the Throne of Mercy iconography. A dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian Piet√†, God the Father is often shown wearing a papal dress and a papal tiara, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They float in heaven with angels who carry the instruments of the Passion.\n\nThe orb, or the globe of the world, is rarely shown with the other two persons of the Trinity and is almost exclusively restricted to God the Father, but is not a definite indicator since it is sometimes used in depictions of Christ. A book, although often depicted with the Father is not an indicator of the Father and is also used with Christ.\n\nRepresentations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the Jansenist and Baianist movements as well as more orthodox theologians. As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones. In the Western Church, the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image.\n\nArtistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the Trinity were condemned. In 1745 Pope Benedict XIV explicitly supported the Throne of Mercy depiction, referring to the \"Ancient of Days\", but in 1786 it was still necessary for Pope Pius VI to issue a papal bull condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.\n\nGod the Father appears in several Genesis scenes in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, most famously \"The Creation of Adam\". God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in \"Titian's Assumption of the Virgin\" (see gallery below) in the Frari of Venice, long admired as a masterpiece of High Renaissance art. The Church of the Ges√π in Rome includes a number of 16th-century depictions of God the Father. In some of these paintings the Trinity is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but Giovanni Battista Fiammeri also depicted God the Father riding on a cloud, above the scenes.\n\nIn both the \"Last Judgment\" and the \"Coronation of the Virgin\" paintings by Rubens (see gallery below) he depicted God the Father in the form that by then had become widely accepted, as a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray. In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists Vel√°zquez (whose father-in-law Francisco Pacheco was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and Murillo both depicted God the Father as a patriarchal figure with a white beard (see gallery below) in a purple robe.\n\nWhile representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the Star Chamber court in England (except the Archbishop of York) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal. Later in the 17th century Sir Thomas Browne wrote that he considered the depiction of God the Father as an old man \"a dangerous act\" that might lead to Egyptian symbolism. In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a \"Romish trend\" (a term used to refer to Roman Catholics) that he considered best avoided in England.\n\nIn 1667 the 43rd chapter of the Great Moscow Council specifically included a ban on a number of depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list, mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the \"Ancient of Days\" was Christ, as \"Logos\", not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as Greece, Romania, and other Orthodox countries.\n\n\n\n"}

It was written in the year 1628 Sakabda (1718 CE) at Galtaji (Galta) near the present city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, by Baladeva Vidyabhushana to defend Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology.\n\nAround this time (1718 CE), a branch of the Sri (Ramanuja) Sampradaya known as the Ramanandi sect, in the court of the king Sadacari Raja at Jaipur, Rajasthan, complained that since the Gaudiya Vaisnavas had no commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, they were not qualified to worship the Deity and therefore the worship should be turned over to the Sri Sampradaya. They also objected to the worship of Srimati Radharani along with Sri Krishna as not being authorised anywhere in the shastras.\n\nThe king was initiated within the Gaudiya sampradaya and he sent word to Vrindavana, informing the devotees what had happened. At that time Srila Visvanatha Chakravarti was very aged so in his place he sent his student, Sri Baladeva. In a great assembly he posed such forceful arguments to the followers of Ramanuja that they could not reply to them. He further explained: \"The originator of the Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, has accepted Srimad Bhagavatam as the natural commentary on the Vedanta-sutra, as composed by Srila Vyasadeva Himself. This is proven in the Sat-sandarbhas.\"\n\nThe scholars in the assembly, however, refused to accept anything other than a direct commentary on the sutra. Having no other recourse, Baladeva promised to present them with one.\n\nFeeling very aggrieved, Sri Baladeva came to Sri Govindaji's mandira (temple) and informed Sri Govinda of everything that had happened. That night the Lord appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to write a commentary on the Vedanta-sutra: \"I will dictate to you what to write and therefore no one will be able to refuse to accept it.\"\n\nThus Baladeva began to write, and within a few days completed the commentary which was titled 'Sri Govinda Bhashya'. It convinced the Ramanandi scholars and they bestowed upon Sri Baladeva the title 'Vidyabhushana' ('ornament of knowledge (vidya)').\n\nThey expressed their desire to accept initiation from Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana. However, he declined their request by stating that amongst the four authorized sampradayas, the Sri sampradaya was highly respectable and the foremost adherent of dasya-bhakti (devotion in servitorship). If there was any cause of loss of respect to the sampradaya this might be considered an offense.\n\nAn English translation of this text was presented by Rai Bahadur Srisa Chandra Vasu in 1916.\n\n"}

According to a study in 2015, Islam has 1.8 billion adherents, making up about 24.1% of the world population. Most Muslims are either of two denominations: Sunni (80-90%, roughly 1.5 billion people) or Shia (10‚Äì20%, roughly 170-340 million people). Islam is the dominant religion in the Central Asia, Indonesia, Middle East, North Africa, the Sahel and some other parts of Asia. The diverse Asia-Pacific region contains the highest number of Muslims in the world, easily surpassing the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nAbout 31% of all Muslims are of South Asian origin, therefore South Asia contains the largest population of Muslims in the world. Within this region, however, Muslims are second in numbers to Hindus, as Muslims are a majority in Pakistan and Bangladesh, but not India.\n\nThe various Hamito-Semitic (including Arab, Berber), Turkic, and Iranic countries of the greater Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region, where Islam is the dominant religion in all countries other than Israel, hosts 23% of world Muslims.\n\nThe country with the single largest population of Muslims is Indonesia in Southeast Asia, which on its own hosts 13% of the world's Muslims. Together, the Muslims in the countries of Southeast Asia constitute the world's third largest population of Muslims. In the countries of the Malay Archipelago Muslims are majorities in each country other than Singapore, the Philippines, and East Timor.\n\nAbout 15% of Muslims reside in Sub-Saharan Africa, and sizeable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas, the Caucasus, China, Europe, the Philippines and Russia.\n\nWestern Europe hosts many Muslim immigrant communities where Islam is the second largest religion after Christianity, where it represents 6% of the total population or 24 million people. Converts and immigrant communities are found in almost every part of the world.\n\nIslam is divided into two major religious denominations: Sunni and Shi'a. Of the total Muslim population, 87-90% are Sunni and 10-13% are Shi'a. Most Shi'as (between 68% and 80%) live in mainly four countries: Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Iraq.\nToday, many of the Shia sects are extinct. The major surviving Imamah-Muslim Sects are Usulism (with nearly more than 10%), Nizari Ismailism (with nearly more than 1%) and Alevism (with slightly more than 0.5% but less than 1%). The other existing groups include Zaydi Shi'a of Yemen whose population is nearly more than 0.5% of the world's Muslim population, Musta‚Äôli Ismaili (with nearly 0.1% whose Taiyabi adherents reside in Sindh and Gujarat in South Asia. There are also significant diaspora populations in Europe, North America, the Far East and East Africa), and Ibadis from the Kharijites whose population has diminished to a level below 0.15%. On the other hand, new Muslim sects like the Nation of Islam, Ahmadi Muslims (with nearly around 1%), non-denominational Muslims, Quranist Muslims and Wahhabis (with nearly around 1-2% of the world's total Muslim population) were later independently developed.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center in 2010, there were 50 Muslim-majority countries. Around 62% of the world's Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region (from Turkey to Indonesia), with over 1¬†billion adherents. The largest Muslim population in a country is in Indonesia, a nation home to 12.7% of the world's Muslims, followed by Pakistan (11.0%), and India (10.9%).\nAbout 20% of Muslims live in Arab countries. In the Middle East, the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey are the largest Muslim-majority countries; in Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have the most populous Muslim communities. The study found more Muslims in the United Kingdom than in Lebanon and more in China than in Syria. Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has more Muslims than all the other Muslim majority countries except Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran and Turkey.\n\nMost of the percentages of Muslim populations of each country, if not stated otherwise, were taken from the study by the Pew Research Center report of \"The Future of the Global Muslim Population\", as of 27 January 2011.\n\nMany of the near-100% figures are likely overestimates as many of those same countries have laws against blasphemy and/or apostasy, punishable by prison or even death.

{"id": "352544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=352544", "title": "Jedi census phenomenon", "text": "Jedi census phenomenon\n\nThe Jedi census phenomenon is a grassroots movement that was initiated in 2001 for residents of a number of English-speaking countries, urging them to record their religion as \"Jedi\" or \"Jedi Knight\" (after the quasi-religious order of Jedi Knights in the fictional \"Star Wars\" universe) on the national census.\n\nIn Australia more than 70,000 people (0.37%) declared themselves members of the Jedi order in the 2001 census. The Australian Bureau of Statistics issued an official press release in response to media interest on the subject. The ABS announced that any answers that were Jedi-related in the religion question were to be classified as \"not defined\" and stressed the social impact of making misleading or false statements on the census. An ABS spokesperson said that \"further analysis of census responses has been undertaken since the release of census data on June 17 to separately identify the number of Jedi-related responses\".\nIt is believed that there is no numerical value that determines a religion per definition of the ABS, but there would need to be a belief system or philosophy as well as some form of institutional or organisational structure in place.\n\nThe push for Australians to declare themselves as members of the Jedi order was one of the first examples of a concept going \"viral\" on the internet in Australia. The website which was set up to promote the concept was visited over 100,000 times in a five-week period and was first archived by the Wayback Machine on 21 October 2001.\n\nThe 2006 census recorded 58,053 Jedi. In the 2011 census, the numbers listing their faith as Jedi had picked up from the 2006 census to 65,000.\n\nThe Jedi Census phenomenon attracted the attention of sociologist of religion Adam Possamai who discusses it in his book \"Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament\". Possamai‚Äôs study placed Jediism in the context of a specific methodological classification (‚Äòhyper-real religions‚Äô) and attempted to demonstrate that hostility existed towards new religions in Australia.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2006 census, there were reports that writing Jedi on the 2006 census could lead to a fine for providing \"false or misleading\" information. This is despite previous admissions by the ABS that they were \"fairly relaxed\" about the issue in 2001 and that nobody had been prosecuted in at least 15 years. In the lead-up to the 2016 census, there was a push from atheists warning not to use Jedi, imploring that it could be counted as being religious.\n\nIn the 2001 census, 21,000 Canadians put down their religion as Jedi Knight. This fact was referenced by the prime minister's office as a rationale for making the 40-page long census form voluntary. In the 2011 National Household Survey the number fell to 9,000.\n\nIn the 2011 census, 303 Croats put Jedi as their religion.\n\nThe 2011 census preliminarily recorded 15,070 people answering the voluntary question on religion as belonging to the Jedi religion, described by the Czech Statistics Office as \"the moral values of the Jedi knights\". The office noted that this is an international phenomenon. As the 2011 census form did not list religions, these having to be filled out, the total number of Jedi is not artificially boosted by those who were not aware of the phenomenon prior to filling out the census form. On the other hand, many people encouraged others in discussions and then media to fill the Jedi religion prior 2011 census (as a form of protest against range, overall cost and obligatory filling of the census), which is probably the cause. The highest number of Jedi were recorded to live in Prague.\n\nIn a May 2012 review of the 2011 census, the D√°il Public Accounts Committee asked the Central Statistics Office about the reliability of self-reported answers, instancing people listing Jedi as their religion. The response was \"We could probably tell you the number of people who have declared themselves as such, but we don't publish it\". The 2016 census results list all religions receiving more than 30 responses, including 2,050 under \"Jedi Knight\".\n\nIn the 2011 census in Montenegro, a group of young men declared themselves as \"Jedi\" on the ethnicity question, as they believe that ethnicity should not be an issue today.\n\nOver 53,000 people listed themselves as Jedi in New Zealand's 2001 census. New Zealand had the highest per capita population of reported Jedi in the world that year, with 1.5% marking \"Jedi\" as their religion. The city of Dunedin had the highest population of reported Jedi per capita. Statistics New Zealand treated Jedi responses as \"Answer understood, but will not be counted\". The percentages of religious affiliations were:\nThere was a fall in the number of New Zealand Jedi five years later, with some 20,000 people giving this as their religion in the 2006 census. It is unknown whether the numbers have continued to fall as the 2011 census was not completed due to an earthquake in Christchurch.\n\nIn 2012, it was reported that 640 Serbs had identified as Jedi.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, thousands of Turkish students raised their voices in campaigns to build Jedi and Buddhist temples at their universities, after a series of mosques were constructed on their campuses by rectors who stressed \"huge demand.\" A number of Dokuz Eyl√ºl University students in the western province of Izmir have demanded a Jedi temple to be built on their campus. \"There are less and less Jedi left on the Earth... the nearest temple [is] billions of light years away,\" the petition says. It adds that \"uneducated Padawan\" are moving to the dark side... To recruit new Jedi and to bring balance to the Force, we want a Jedi temple,\" said the petition that received more than 6,000 signatures on change.org, referring to the famed knights of the fictional \"Star Wars\" universe. The page on Change.org also features a still of Jedi Grand Master Yoda from \"Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones\" teaching young Jedi how to use a light saber. The petition was started by Akin Cagatay Caliskan, an 18-year-old computer science student from Ankara: \"We want freedom of worship. There are mosques everywhere, but no Jedi temple!\" Caliskan says he is surprised by the impact his petition has made: \"I did not expect so many supporters. I thought maybe it might (have) 100.\"\n\nIn England and Wales 390,127 people (almost 0.8%) stated their religion as Jedi on their 2001 Census forms, surpassing Sikhism, Judaism, and Buddhism, and making it the fourth largest reported religion in the country. In the 2001 Census, 2.6% of the population of Brighton claimed to be Jedi. The percentages of religious affiliations were:\n\nIt was confirmed prior to the census that citizens were not liable for a fine in relation to question 10 (on religion). This was based on section 1(2) of the Census (Amendment) Act 2000, which amended section 8 of the Census Act 2000 to state that \"no person shall be liable to a penalty under subsection (1) for refusing or neglecting to state any particulars in respect of religion\". The change in the law was implemented by The Census (Amendment) Order 2000 and The Census (Amendment) Regulations 2000.\n\nJedi was assigned its own code in the United Kingdom for census processing, the number 896. Officials from the Office for National Statistics pointed out that this merely means that it has been registered as a common answer to the \"religion\" question and that this does not confer on it the status of official recognition. John Pullinger, Director of Reporting and Analysis for the Census, noted that many people who would otherwise not have completed a Census form did so solely to record themselves as Jedi, so this joke helped to improve the quality of the Census. The Office for National Statistics revealed the total figure in a press release entitled \"390,000 Jedi there are\".\n\nIn June 2005, Jamie Reed, newly elected Labour Member of Parliament for Copeland in Cumbria, declared himself to be the first Jedi Member of Parliament during his maiden speech. The statement, made in the context of an ongoing debate regarding the Incitement to Religious Hatred Bill, was confirmed by Reed's office to be a joke instead of a serious statement of faith. During a subsequent committee debate on the bill, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Beaconsfield, Dominic Grieve, proposed as \"a bit of a joke\" to exclude Jedi Knights from the protection of the proposed act, along with Satanists and proponents of animal sacrifice, illustrating the difficulty of defining religious belief in legislation. Similarly, in April 2006, Edward Leigh, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Gainsborough, asked whether he would be allowed to set up a Jedi knights faith school during a Committee debate on the Education and Inspections Bill.\n\nOn 16 November 2006, two Jedi delivered a protest letter to UN officials in recognition of the International Day for Tolerance. The letter, written by Simon Cohen of the Global Tolerance public relations agency, requested that it be renamed the \"UN Interstellar Day of Tolerance\" and cited the 2001 Census showing 390,000 Jedi in England and Wales.\n\nAccording to 2011 census figures, the number of Jedi had fallen to 176,632, placing it in seventh place, having been overtaken by Judaism and Buddhism, but still comfortably outnumbering any other alternative or mock religions. The magazine \"Metal Hammer\" also encouraged readers to mark \"Heavy Metal\" as their religion, leading to over 6,000 responses.\n\nIn Scotland, 14,052 people stated that Jedi was their current religion (14,014 \"Jedi\", 24 \"Jedi Order\" and 14 \"Sith\") and 2,733 stated that it was their religion of upbringing (2,682 \"Jedi\", 36 \"Jedi Order\" and 15 \"The Dark Side\") in the 2001 census. The proportion of people stating their religion as Jedi in Scotland was lower than that in England and Wales, at 0.277%.\n\nIn April 2009, it became known that eight police officers serving with Scotland's largest police force, Strathclyde, listed their official religion as Jedi in voluntary diversity forms. The details were obtained in a Freedom of Information request by \"Jane's Police Review\".\n\nThe Australian Atheist Foundation objects to non-religious individuals answering with any joke answer, because this would lead to a census undercount of non-religious people, and lessen their political influence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43122448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43122448", "title": "Kafa'ah", "text": "Kafa'ah\n\nKafa'ah or Kafaah (; \"\") is a term used in the field of Islamic jurisprudence with regard to marriage in Islam, which in Arabic, literally means, \"equality\" or \"equivalence\". It is thus defined as the compatibility or equivalence between a prospective husband and his prospective wife which should be adhered to. This compatibility is dependent on multiple factors that include religion, social status, morality, piety, wealth, lineage or custom.\n\nIslamic scholars (ulama) hold differing opinions and arguments on the doctrine of Kafa'ah based on the Quran and Hadith. What is consistently agreed upon by the four Sunni Madhabs is the compatibility of religion. Muslim women can thus marry only Muslim men, but Muslim men are also permitted to marry Jewish or Christian women. In Shia Islam, there is no concept of Kafa'ah on the basis of lineage.\n\nAccording to the traditional Hanafi school of thought, kafa'ah represents a special proportionality between a man and a woman in marriage.\n\nThe traditional Maliki position states that kafa'ah is the proportionality in religion for both husband and wife who are not in disgrace so it allows the woman to exercise rights to decide her marriage.\n\nAccording to the ShƒÅfi'i school of thought, kafa'ah concerns the factors of lineage, religiousness, profession, and being free of defects that permit annulling the marriage contract (nikah). It must not be misunderstood as a recommendation of whom to marry. Rather, it should be taken as a legal restriction to protect a woman's interest in her marriage. If a woman wishes to marry someone who is seemingly incompatible based these factors, there is nothing wrong in her doing so. Accordingly, an Arab woman should not marry a non-Arab man; similarly, a virtuous woman should not marry a corrupt man, (though it is sufficient should the husband give up his wrongdoing). A daughter of someone with a higher profession should not marry a man of a lowly profession. The wealth of either parties is not a factor to be considered, as it is merely temporary and \"those with self-respect and intelligence do not take pride in it.\"\n\nScholars of the Hanbali school of thought state that kafa'ah represents the similarities and proportionality based on five factors, namely, religion, lineage, independence, jobs and wealth.\n\nThe main goal of Kafa'ah is to make a peaceful and lasting marriage. The argument is that a household built based on the common perceptions, equivalent views, and understandings would make a peaceful and happy marriage. However, if such a rationale is to be accepted, it begs the question as to why these restrictions only apply to a prospective wife and not the husband. An objective more congruous with the legal rulings would be to protect the interests of the prospective wife by ensuring that she is not in disgrace in her conjugal bond. This however, raises the question as to why it would be a disgrace for an Arab woman to marry a non-Arab man.\n\nThe controversies associated with the doctrine of kafa'ah were exemplified in a chain of events which occurred in Hadhramaut, Yemen, in 1905. People of the Ba 'Alawi sada, especially of Hadhrami descent, adhered to a stricter and more rigid system of social stratification based on the kafa'ah of descent. In particular, a Sayyid woman is prohibited from marrying a non-Sayyid man. It must be noted, however, that this extreme position is absent in the canon of orthodox ShƒÅfi'i scholarship, the school to which the Hadramis otherwise adhered. Controversy erupted when a number of marriages between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men were publicly discovered, which thus became a subject of public condemnation and clamour because of their perceived unsuitability.\n\nIn response to the heated controversy, an Islamic reformer by the name of Rashid Rida argued that such marriages were valid and permissible, in his journal \"al-ManƒÅr\" in Egypt. There was nothing in Islamic law, as he argued, that prohibited marriages between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men. Rida's views were echoed by Ahmad Surkati, who wrote a pamphlet in 1915 titled \"Surah al-JawƒÅb\" (The Form of the Answer) in permitting such marriages based on the principle of equality. According to Surkati, kafa'ah should be restricted to the rationale of ensuring a good relationship between the partners; accordingly, if a woman decides to marry someone seemingly inferior, because \"of other such qualities which please women\", she is allowed to do so.\n\nIt must be stressed again that the traditional Hadhrami interpretation of kafa'ah (in restricting marriage between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men) is not found in the canon of orthodox Islamic scholarship. The arguments promulgated by Rida and S≈´kartƒ´ are thus merely a defense of traditional Islamic scholarship as much as they are a rejection of Hadhrami societal attitudes determined by self-interest.\n\nThese arguments, however, were strongly rebutted by Sayyids, one of whom was Sayyid Umar al-Attas, a leading Hadhrami scholar residing in Singapore, who declared such marriages to be unlawful. In doing so, he identified four levels of compatibility based on descent (which always applies for women and not for men, \"i.e.,\" a man can marry someone from a lower rank, but a woman cannot): Arabs must not marry non-Arabs, Qurashƒ´s must not marry non-Qurashƒ´s, HƒÅshimites must not marry non-HƒÅshimites, and descendants of Hasan and Husayn must not marry anyone other than other Hasanids and Husaynids. In his book published in 1905, \"The Marriage Between A Sharifah and A Non-Sharif and Esteemed Position of Ahl al-Bayt\", he concluded that it is impermissible for a Sayyid woman to marry a non-Sayyid man, even if it is based on her own desires or with the consent of her wali. Additionally, AbdullƒÅh Da·∏•lƒÅn attacked Surkati's stance that all humans were equal, arguing instead that God had created some humans like the Prophet's family as superior to others. The dispute quickly deteriorated into racist diatribes. Da·∏•lƒÅn reportedly remarked about Sukarti, \"Will the Negro stand corrected of his saying or persist in his stubbornness?\" Other Hadhrami Sayyids insulted Sukarti by calling him \"the black death\", \"black slave\", \"the black\", \"the Sudanese\" or \"the Negro\", all while claiming that he could not speak Arabic and that he was a non-Arab.\n\nThe far-reaching consequences of this heated discussion went beyond the doctrine of kafa'ah and sparked a power struggle in Hadhramƒ´ communities in South East Asia. People began to openly question the rigid system of social stratification dominated by the Sayyids, their status and privileges. Some of the practices that became publicly contentious include the custom of taqbil (kissing the hands of Sayyids), and the exclusive use of the title, \"Sayyid\" itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "2482303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2482303", "title": "Metternich Stela", "text": "Metternich Stela\n\nThe Metternich Stela is a magico-medical stele that is part of the Egyptian Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It dates to the thirtieth dynasty of Egypt around 380‚Äì342 B.C. during the reign of Nectanebo II. The provenance of the stele is unknown.\n\nThe stela belongs to a group of stelae known as the \"Cippi of Horus\" or 'Stelae of Horus on the crocodiles'. These types of stelae were used to protect the ancient Egyptian people from dangerous animals such as crocodiles and snakes. The Magical Stela is one of the largest and most complete of this kind. \n\nIt is theorized that in the reign of Nectanebo II, a priest named Esatum traveled to the burial place of the Mnevis bulls at Heliopolis. There he noticed certain inscriptions that he thought were interesting and ordered them to be copied onto a large block of stone. There the stela was created and stood for many years until Alexander the Great conquered the Persians in Egypt and it was brought to Alexandria. \n\nFor over two thousand years, the stela was missing until it was discovered in a wall that was excavated in a Franciscan monastery. The stela was then presented to Austrian statesman, Prince Metternich in 1828 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, the ruler of Egypt, and Metternich had stored it in his Kyn≈ævart Castle (in Bohemia) where the stela remained until 1950, being then purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (where it was known for many years as the Metternich Stela).\n\nThe stela is a large block below, (a plinth) connected to a thinner block with a curved top. The dimensions are a height of 35 12/16 inch and a width of 13 ¬º inch. The piece was made from one huge block of fine grained, hard, gray-green stone made from greywacke. The stela is well preserved with only a few small visible chips. It seems to have been created with exact precision and care therefore making it a most intriguing and valuable addition to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \n\nThe top portion of the stela portrays a disk of the sun that identifies Ra, the sun god of the ancient Egyptian religion. On each side of Ra are four baboons. On the far left of the baboons is the messenger god Thoth. On the far right of the baboons is the reigning pharaoh Nectanebo II bowing towards Ra. \n\nThe main portion of the relief is separated by the top portion with five lines of hieroglyphics. The center of the stela portrays Horus as a child standing on crocodiles. Above his head is the face of Bes, who is the guardian of the newborn and childbirth. Horus is holding in each hand a serpent and scorpion, along with a lion and oryx in either hand. \n\nOn the near left of Horus is Re'Horakhty, which is the combination of the two sky gods Horus and Re, standing on a serpent and surrounding both of them are two divine symbols. On the far left of the relief is Isis standing upon a serpent and on her left is the standard of the vulture goddess of the south. On the far right is again the god Thoth standing on a serpent and on his right is the standard of the serpent goddess of the north. Above the gods are the eyes of Horus, the sun and the moon. \n\nThe rest of the stela is covered with hieroglyphics from top to bottom and also on both sides. These hieroglyphics document the stories of the gods and their experiences with poisonous animals. There are also many curses and spells for different types of sickness caused by these animals. \n\nAnother point of interest with the stela is on the upper portion of the reverse side. There is a winged man who represents the demonic solar god Harmeti. He is standing upon his enemies, which are evil animals enclosed in a circle to prevent their escape.\n\nThe main function of the Metternich Stela was for the magical healing of poisons, mostly caused by animals. Water was poured over the Stela and collected. The water from the Stela was then drunk by the person suffering from the poisonous ailment. That person would identify with the child Horus who had also suffered such tragedies. During the entire process religious rites from the Stela were recited by local priests. \n\nThe first few spells on the stela are related to reptiles and other harmful creatures. The most prominent was the serpent demon Apophis who was the enemy of Ra for he is the equivalent of the devil. The spell forced the serpent to decapitate and burn into pieces. The second half of the spell would force the serpent to vomit and while the priest recited this spell the person inflicted would also vomit freeing their body of the poison. \n\nThe next spell was directed towards a cat. The cat contained a bit of a god or goddess and would be able to destroy any sort of poison. The spell asks for Ra to aid the cat in her time of need. \n\nMost of the Stela has inscriptions that describe stories such as the ones above in relation to being poisoned and spells to be cured. The most famous is the story of Isis and the Seven Scorpions. The story takes up the majority of the stela and is most referenced when it came to ailments dealing with poisons. \n\nIsis was the mother of Horus, along with his father Osiris who was the ruler of the living world. Osiris was killed by his brother Set who was incredibly jealous of his power. When Isis and Nephthys discovered this, they brought Osiris back to life with the use of magic. Set was enraged and so he killed Osiris once again, but this time he chopped up his body into many parts and scattered them throughout Egypt. Osiris then became the pharaoh of the dead and the underworld, while the land of the living was ruled by no one. \n\nSet was content thinking he would become the pharaoh of the living, but what he didn't know was that Isis was pregnant with Osiris's child. He would become pharaoh of the living because of his birthright. After Isis gave birth to Horus, it was thought that he would become the new pharaoh of the living, but once Set found out he became very angry. \n\nAt this point the actual spell starts on the Magical Stela. Set had the child poisoned by a scorpion, which is often associated with the serpent demon, Apophis. Isis was outraged with grief at the death of her child. She called out to Ra and asked him for his aid. He sent Thoth who restored the child to life. From that point Ra would act as an advocate to Horus, just as his father Osiris would've done if alive.\n\nHorus lived but later fought Set to see who would become the pharaoh of the living. During the fight Set ripped out Horus's eye and won the battle. This is where the symbol 'the Eye of Horus' is from. Set then became the pharaoh of the living once again. \n\nIsis could not stand by and let this happen because her son was the rightful ruler. She went into the underworld disguised and sought out Set. She told him how an evil man took something from her son that was rightfully his. Set ordered to have this corrected, not knowing who she was referring to. Isis revealed herself to Set and he tried to recant, but Ra witnessed the event and made Horus the pharaoh of the living. \n\nThe majority of the stela relates to how Horus was poisoned and cured. The ancient Egyptians would also use this cure for their own people who suffered from poisons. The sick would have the spirit of Horus within them and they would be cured just as Horus was. (Egyptian Art) The stories inscribed on this stela, especially the one regarding Isis and Horus are the most comprehensive found on any monument. \n\n\n"}

Like other species in the genus, the plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid aporphine (not to be confused with apomorphine). It was known to the Ancient Egyptian civilizations.\n\nIts original habitat may have been along the Nile and other parts of East Africa. It spread more widely in ancient times, including to the Indian subcontinent and Thailand.\n\nThe leaves are broadly rounded, across, with a notch at the leaf stem. The flowers are in diameter.\n\nReports in the literature by persons unfamiliar with its actual growth and blooming cycle have suggested that the flowers open in the morning, rising to the surface of the water, then close and sink at dusk. In fact, the flower buds rise to the surface over a period of two to three days, and when ready, open around 9:30¬†am and close about 3:00¬†pm. The flowers and buds do not rise above the water in the morning, nor do they submerge at night. The flowers have pale bluish-white to sky-blue or mauve petals, smoothly changing to a pale yellow in the centre of the flower.\n\nAlong with the white lotus, \"Nymphaea lotus are\" also native to Egypt. The plant and flower are very frequently depicted in Egyptian art. They have been depicted in numerous stone carvings and paintings, including the walls of the famous temple of Karnak, and are frequently depicted in connection with \"party scenes\", dancing or in significant spiritual or magical rites such as the rite of passage into the afterlife. \"N. caerulea\" was considered extremely significant in Egyptian mythology, regarded as a symbol of the sun, since the flowers are closed at night and open again in the morning. At Heliopolis, the origin of the world was taught to have been when the sun god Ra emerged from a lotus flower growing in \"primordial waters\". At night, he was believed to retreat into the flower again. Due to its colour, it was identified, in some beliefs, as having been the original container, in a similar manner to an egg, of Atum, and in similar beliefs Ra, both solar deities. As such, its properties form the origin of the \"lotus variant\" of the Ogdoad cosmogeny. It was the symbol of the Egyptian deity Nefertem.\n\nSome evidence indicates the medicinal effects of plants including \"N. caerulea\" that contain the psychoactive alkaloid aporphine were known to both the Mayans and the Ancient Egyptians.\n\nThe mildly sedating effects of \"N. caerulea\" makes it a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical Lotophagi in Homer's \"Odyssey\".\n\nThis lotus has been used to produce perfumes since ancient times; it is also used in aromatherapy.\n\n\"N. caerulea\" is illegal in Latvia since November 2009. It is a schedule 1 drug. Possession of quantities up to 1 gram are fined up to 280 euros, for second offences within a year period criminal charges are applied. Possession of larger quantities can be punished by up to 15 years in prison.\n\n\"N. caerulea\" was banned in Poland in March 2009. Possession and distribution lead to a criminal charge.\n\n\"N. caerulea\" is illegal in Russia since April 2009 along with spice and related products, \"Salvia divinorum, Argyreia nervosa\", and others.\n\n"}
{"id": "411888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411888", "title": "Premarital sex", "text": "Premarital sex\n\nPremarital sex is sexual activity practiced by people before they are married. Historically, premarital sex was considered a moral issue which was taboo in many cultures and considered a sin by a number of religions, but since about the 1960s, it has become more widely accepted, especially in Western countries. A 2014 Pew study on global morality found that premarital sex was considered particularly unacceptable in \"predominantly Muslim nations\", such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan and Egypt, each having over 90% disapproval, while people in Western European countries were the most accepting, with Spain, Germany and France expressing less than 10% disapproval. Within Christianity, the Roman Catholic Church calls premarital sex a sin that must be forgiven through confession.\n\nUntil the 1950s, \"premarital sex\" referred to sexual relations between two people prior to marrying each other. During that period, it was the norm in Western societies for men and women to marry by the age of 21 or 22, and there was no considerations that one who had sex would not marry. The term was used instead of fornication, which had negative connotations, and was closely related to the concept and approval of virginity, which is sexual abstinence until marriage.\n\nThe meaning has since shifted to refer to any sexual relations a person has prior to marriage and removing the emphasis on the relationship of the people involved. The definition has a degree of ambiguity. It is not clear whether sex between individuals legally forbidden from marrying, or the sexual relations of one uninterested in marrying would be considered premarital.\n\nAlternative terms for premarital sex have been suggested, including \"non-marital sex\" (which overlaps with adultery), \"youthful sex\", \"adolescent sex\", and \"young-adult sex\". These terms also suffer from a degree of ambiguity, as the definition of \"having sex\" differs from person to person.\n\nIn some cultures, for example in many modern Western cultures, many people do not hold value in sexual abstinence before marriage.\n\nHistorically, at least a significant portion of people have engaged in premarital sex, although the number willing to admit to having done so was not always high. In a study conducted in the United States, 61 percent of men and 12 percent of women born prior to 1910 admitted to having premarital sex; the gender disparity may have been caused by cultural double standards regarding the admission of sexual activity or by men frequenting prostitutes.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, and especially after World War II, premarital sex became more common; this was especially prevalent among women. By the end of the 20th century, between 75 and 80 percent of Americans had vaginal intercourse before the age of 19. This has been attributed to numerous causes, including the increasing median age at marriage and the widespread availability of efficient contraceptives.\n\nAccording to a 2001 UNICEF survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two-thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, the proportion is over 80%. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, approximately 25% of 15-year-olds and 50% of 17-year-olds have sex. In a 2005 Kaiser Family Foundation study of US teenagers, 29% of teens reported feeling pressure to have sex, 33% of sexually active teens reported \"being in a relationship where they felt things were moving too fast sexually\", and 24% had \"done something sexual they didn‚Äôt really want to do\". Several polls have indicated peer pressure as a factor in encouraging both girls and boys to have sex.\n\nA majority of Americans have had premarital sex, according to a 2007 article in Public Health Reports. This fact is true for current young adults and also young adults in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Data from the National Survey of Family Growth indicate that in 2002, 77% of Americans had sex by age 20, and of that percent, 75% had premarital sex. In comparison, of women who turned 15 between 1964 and 1993, approximately 91% had premarital sex by age 30. Of women who turned 15 between 1954 and 1963, 82% of them had had premarital sex by age 30. Additionally, when comparing the General Social Survey of 1988‚Äì1996 to the one of 2004‚Äì2012, researchers found that participants of 2004‚Äì2012 did not report more sexual partners since the age of 18, nor more frequent sex or sex partners during the past year than those respondents of the 1988-1996 survey. Furthermore, there appears to be no substantial change in sexual behavior contrasting the earlier era to the current one. However, one of the differences included sexually active respondents of the current era were more likely to report having sex with a casual date or friend than reporting having sex with a spouse or regular partner. From 1943 to 1999, attitudes toward premarital sex changed such that young women‚Äôs approval increased from 12% to 73% and from 40% to 79% among young men. People‚Äôs feelings of sexual guilt also decreased during this period. Nowadays, less than 25% of people believe premarital sex is ‚Äúalways or almost always‚Äù wrong.\n\nWithin the United States, a cohort study of young adults in university found men self-report more permissive attitudes about casual sex than women. Another study found university students can be grouped by their ideal relationships‚Äîthose who express a desire for sex exclusively in a committed partnership have fewer hookups and friends with benefits partners than those categorised as desiring \"flexible\" relationships and recreational sex.\n\nOne 2006 study that analysed the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study found that more boys report having non-dating sexual partners than girls. Of this sample, a third of boys only have had sex with their romantic partner, another third of boys who have had sex with a partner they are not dating within the past year are believed to wish for the girl to be their girlfriend.<ref name=\"pmiddoi: 10.1177/0743558406291692\"></ref> Many young adults are more likely to engage in sex with romantic partners than with casual acquaintances or friends with benefits.\n\nOne 2011 study surveyed young adults about their emotional reactions after sexual encounters, finding that men reported more positive and fewer negative emotional reactions, and both men and women reported that the experience was largely more positive than negative. Women reported that condom use was associated with fewer positive and more negative emotional reactions, and for men condom use was associated with fewer negative emotional reactions. A 23-year study in a Human Sexuality class investigated gender differences in men and women‚Äôs reactions to their first sexual experience. In the earlier years of the study, men reported more pleasure and greater anxiety than women, while women reported more feelings of guilt than men. Cohort studies carried out over 23 years found that in later years, women expressed greater pleasure and less guilt. The differences between emotional reactions among men and women decreased slightly during the 23 years. Such decreases in differences to first sexual intercourse may be a result of the increasing normality of premarital sex in America. An international online sex survey compared responses of residents of 37 countries against World Economic Forum figures for gender equality in those countries, finding that countries with high gender equality had respondents report more casual sex, a greater number of sex partners, younger ages for first sex, and greater tolerance of premarital sex.\n\nDifferent ethnic and cultural groups in America have varied religiosity and sexual attitudes. Researchers conducted a study with college participants and they found Asians had more conservative sexual attitudes compared to Hispanics and Euro-Americans. Hispanics reported sexual attitudes similar to that of Euro-Americans. Asian, Hispanic, and Euro-American women with high levels of spirituality were found to have a correlation between conservative sexual attitudes and perceived religiosity. Religiosity and religious fundamentalism predicted conservative sexual attitudes most strongly in Euro-Americans and Asians.\n\nIn the Indian city of Mumbai, research showed that among college-age students, 3% of females affirmed having premarital sex and 26% of college-aged men affirmed having premarital sex. Population Council, an international NGO, released a working report showing similar statistics nationally in India, with fewer than ten percent of young females reporting having had premarital sex, compared with 15% to 30% of young males. In Pakistan, 11% of men were reported as having participated in pre-marital sex, although a greater percentage, 29% reported having participated in non-marital sex.\n\nPeople who have premarital sex are recommended by health professionals to take precautions to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV/AIDS. There is also a risk of an unplanned pregnancy in heterosexual relationships. Around the world, sex education programs are run to teach school students about reproductive health, safer sex practices, sexual abstinence and birth control.\n\nSexual activity among unmarried people who do not have access to information about reproductive health and birth control can increase the rate of teenage pregnancies and contraction of sexually transmitted infections. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary and range from 143 per 1000 girls in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 in South Korea. The rate for the United States is 52.1 per 1000, the highest in the developed world ‚Äì and about four times the European Union average. The teenage pregnancy rates between countries must take into account the level of general sex education available and access to contraceptive options.\n\nThe cultural acceptability of premarital sex varies between individuals, cultures and time periods. Western cultures have traditionally been disapproving of it, on occasions forbidding it. In other cultures, such as the Muria people of Madhya Pradesh, sexuality prior to marriage is accepted and at times expected.\n\nIndividual views within a given society can vary greatly, with expectations ranging from total abstinence to frequent casual sex. These views are dependent on the holders' value system, as formed by his or her parents, religion, friends, experiences, and in many cases the media. Unmarried cohabitation and births outside marriage have increased in many Western countries during the past few decades.\n\nSex before the public marriage ceremony was normal in the Anglican Church until the Hardwicke Marriage Act of 1753, which for the first time required all marriages in England and Wales occur in their parish church. (The law also applied to Catholics, but Jews and Quakers were exempt.) Before its enactment couples lived and slept together after their betrothal or \"the spousals\", considered a legal marriage. Until the mid-1700s it was normal and acceptable for the bride to be pregnant at the nuptials, the later public ceremony for the marriage. The Marriage Act combined the spousals and nuptials, and by the start of the 19th century social convention prescribed that brides be virgins at marriage. Illegitimacy became more socially discouraged, with first pregnancies outside marriage declining from 40% to 20% during the Victorian era. At the start of the 21st Century, the figure was back up to 40%.\n\nIn Britain, births outside marriage were up to 47.6% by 2012. In 2014, only 13% of the population found premarital sex unacceptable.\n\nDuring the colonial period, premarital sex was publicly frowned upon but privately condoned to an extent. Unmarried teenagers were often allowed to spend the night in bed together, though some measures such as bundling were sometimes attempted to prevent sexual intercourse. Even though premarital sex was somewhat condoned, having a child outside wedlock was not. If a pregnancy resulted from premarital sex, the young couple were expected to marry. Marriage and birth records from the late 1700s reveal that between 30 and 40 percent of New England brides were pregnant before marriage.\n\nThe growing popularity of the automobile, and corresponding changes in dating practices, caused premarital sex to become more prevalent. Alfred Kinsey found that American women who became sexually mature during the 1920s were much less likely to be virgins at marriage than those who became mature before World War I. A majority of women during the 1920s under the age of 30 were nonetheless virgins at marriage, however, and half of those who were not only had sex with their fianc√©s. A 1938 survey of American college students found that 52% of men and 24% of women had had sex. 37% of women were virgins but believed sex outside marriage was acceptable. Prior to the middle of the 20th century, sexuality was generally constrained. Sexual interactions between people without plans to marry was considered unacceptable, with betrothal slightly lessening the stigma. However, premarital sex was still frowned upon.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, as premarital sex became more common, the stigma attached to it lessened for many people. In 1969, 70% of Americans disapproved of premarital sex, but by 1973 this number had dropped to 50%. By 2000, roughly a third of couples in the United States had lived together prior to marriage.\n\nHowever, premarital sex was still considered unacceptable by 30% of the population in a 2014 study, while 29% found it acceptable and 36% considered it not a moral issue.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

Known from Arizona, Colorado, central Mexico, India and Costa Rica, the fungus grows on decomposing woody debris and is found in mountainous areas at elevations of , typically in meadows or open, grassy conifer forests. The mushrooms have convex to bell-shaped caps in diameter, atop slender cylindrical stems that are up to long. The color of the caps changes with variations in hydration, ranging from dark chestnut brown to straw yellow or whitish when dry. The base of the stem is densely covered with conspicuous white rhizomorphs, a characteristic uncommon amongst \"Psilocybe\" species.\n\nThe species was first reported by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 as a variety of \"Psilocybe mexicana\" before he officially described it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the Nahua people also called Aztecs, \"P.¬†aztecorum\" may have been one of the sacred mushroom species, or \"teonan√°catl\" (A Nahuatl word translated variously as \"sacred mushroom\" or \"flesh of the gods\"), reported in the codices of 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahag√∫n. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the Popocat√©petl region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety \"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"bonetii\" has smaller spores than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with Montezuma pine (\"Pinus montezumae\") and sacred fir (\"Abies religiosa\"). \"P.¬†aztecorum\" may be distinguished from similar temperate species such as \"P.¬†baeocystis\" and \"P.¬†quebecensis\" by their ranges, and by differences in the morphology of microscopic structures like cystidia.\n\nThe species was first mentioned by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 based on material collected by American ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson in Paso de Cort√©s, on the slopes of Popocat√©petl mountain in Mexico. Heim originally named the species as a variety of \"Psilocybe mexicana\"; limited to dried mushroom material for analysis, he only described the spores, which he explained were \"relatively longer and narrower than that of \"Psilocybe mexicana\"\". A year later, Heim renamed the fungus \"Psilocybe aztecorum\" and officially described it, in addition to several other Mexican \"Psilocybe\" taxa. Some of these mushrooms, including \"P.¬†aztecorum\", were illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine \"Life\" (\"Seeking the Magic Mushroom\"), in which Wasson recounted the psychedelic visions that he experienced during the divinatory rituals of the Mazatec people, thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture.\n\nIn 1978, Mexican mycologist and \"Psilocybe\" specialist Gast√≥n Guzm√°n emended the description of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" to include the color variation of the cap resulting from its strongly hygrophanous nature, the mycenoid form, the rhizoids at the base of the stem, the lignicolous habitat, and the size of the spores‚Äîall features that he thought were either confused, or not sufficiently detailed, in Heim's original description. In the same publication, Guzm√°n also characterized the variety \"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"bonetii\", distinguished from the main variety by its smaller spores. He had originally described this variant as a separate species, \"Psilocybe bonetii\", in 1970. Further, Guzm√°n later published \"Psilocybe natarajanii\", originally described by him from Tamil Nadu in southern India, as a synonym of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"bonetii\"; this putative synonymy, however, is confirmed by neither MycoBank nor Index Fungorum. Guzm√°n called the main variety \"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"aztecorum\"; for this reason, the species authority is often cited as \"\"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"aztecorum\" R. Heim emend. Guzm√°n\".\n\n\"Psilocybe aztecorum\" is the type species of Guzm√°n's section \"Aztecorum\", a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) \"Psilocybe\" mushrooms characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section \"Aztecorum\" are \"P.¬†baeocystis\" and \"P.¬†quebecensis\".\n\nThe specific epithet \"aztecorum\" refers to the Aztec Indians of central Mexico, who used this mushroom in traditional ceremonies long before the Spanish came to America. The variety \"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"bonneti\" is named after Dr. Federico Bonet (died 1980), emeritus professor of the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biol√≥gicas, who assisted Guzm√°n with his doctoral studies. The popular names of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" are \"ni√±os\" or \"ni√±itos\" (children or little children), or in the Nahuatl language \"apipiltzin\" which means \"ni√±os del agua\" (\"children of the water\"), alluding to their habitat along ravines.\n\nThe cap is convex to bell-shaped, sometimes developing a broad umbo before expanding and flattening in age; it reaches a diameter of . In maturity, the cap eventually forms a central depression, and, in some old specimens, opens into the hollow stem. The cap surface is slimy to the touch, and has translucent striations along the margin when moist. The cap is strongly hygrophanous, meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration. The color ranges from yellowish brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish gray in age, with greenish-gray tints on the margin. The color later changes to whitish from the center to the margin, finally remaining completely white; dried specimens are straw-colored to pale brownish. In contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms, the cap of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" does not have a strong bluing reaction upon injury‚Äîonly the margin stains slightly green-blue.\n\nThe gills are adnate (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill) or adnexed (reaching the stem, but not attached to it), and are light violet gray to dark violet brown. They are either uniform in color, or have whitish edges. The hollow stem is by thick, equal in width throughout or thicker at the top, cylindric or sometimes flattened, and either straight or with turns and windings. Its surface is smooth, silky-fibrillose, whitish to greyish, and stains blue-green irregularly when touched or in age. The base of the stem is densely covered with well-developed white rhizomorphs. Young mushrooms have a white cobweb-like partial veil that does not last long before it disappears, although it sometimes remains as a non-permanent ring on the upper part of the stem. The flesh is whitish to yellowish or reddish yellow in the cap, or reddish brown in the stem, and shows little or no bluing reaction to injury. Like most of the bluing \"Psilocybe\" mushrooms, the odor and taste of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" is slightly farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour) in fresh specimens; dried specimens have a more intense odor. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) stains the cap, stem, and flesh reddish brown; sometimes, the stem does not stain or stains slightly yellowish red. The spore print is blackish violet.\n\nThe spores are elongated-ellipsoid in face view, roughly terete (more or less cylindrical but usually tapering at both ends), slightly inequilateral or asymmetrical in side view‚Äîthe so-called \"mango\" form. They typically have dimensions of 12‚Äì14 by 6.6‚Äì7.7 by 6‚Äì7.5¬†Œºm, although some spores have irregular shapes and are strongly elongated, up to 23¬†Œºm. Spores are thick-walled (generally between 1‚Äì1.5¬†Œºm), dark yellowish brown, and have a broad germ pore. The variety \"bonetii\" has smaller spores measuring 10‚Äì13 by 6‚Äì7.5 by 6‚Äì7¬†Œºm.\n\nThe basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24‚Äì33 by 6.6‚Äì8.8¬†Œºm, and may be attached to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20‚Äì45 by 5‚Äì8.2¬†Œºm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6‚Äì11 by 1.6‚Äì2.5¬†Œºm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.\n\nThe subhymenium (a layer of cells immediately below the hymenium) consists of spherical cells that are interwoven with hyphae; this layer is hyaline to yellowish or brownish, and does not have pigment crusted on the walls of the hyphae. The epicutis (the upper of two layers of the cap cuticle) is made of a thin gelatinous layer of hyaline or brownish hyphae measuring 1.5‚Äì2.5¬†Œºm in diameter. The hypodermium (the cuticle tissue layer under the epicutis) is hyaline, and has elongated to roughly spherical hyphae that are 10‚Äì18¬†Œºm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of \"P.¬†aztecorum\".\n\n\"Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum\", found in India, differs from \"P.¬†aztecorum\" in the morphology of the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia. The characteristic filamentous neck present in the cystidia of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" is absent in \"P.¬†pseudoaztecorum\". \"P.¬†pseudoaztecorum\" had been previously described by K.¬†Natarajan and N.¬†Raman as \"P.¬†aztecorum\", but they published the taxon with a new name after consultation with Guzm√°n. Fresh specimens of \"P.¬†aztecorum\" resemble \"P.¬†pelliculosa\", but this latter species is found only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. Like \"P.¬†aztecorum\", the caps of the South African species \"P.¬†natalensis\" also bleach to nearly white when dried. The closely related \"P.¬†baeocystis\" also bleaches in color to white when dry. Found in northwest North America from British Columbia to Washington and Oregon, \"P.¬†baeocystis\" has thinner cheilocystidia than \"P.¬†aztecorum\" (typically measuring 20‚Äì32 by 4.4‚Äì6¬†Œºm) and its pleurocystidia, when present, are found only near the gill edge. \"P.¬†quebecensis\", known only from Quebec, Canada, has pleurocystidia measuring 12‚Äì25 by 5‚Äì10¬†Œºm. Although the phylogeny of the species comprising section \"Aztecorum\" is not known with certainty, Guzm√°n has suggested that \"P.¬†aztecorum\" was the ancestor of \"P.¬†baeocystis\" in northwestern North America and of \"P.¬†quebecensis\" in northeastern North America.\n\nA lignicolous species, \"Psilocybe aztecorum\" lives in and decays dead wood, leaves, sticks, or other similar organic debris. Mushrooms typically fruit in groups of 5 to 20, sometimes in bundles. Usual substrates include wood debris buried in soil, twigs or very rotten logs, and, rarely, pine cones. The mushroom is found in woodlands (a low-density forest or wooded area that allows sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor) containing Hartweg's pine (\"Pinus hartwegii\") in addition to grasses such as \"Festuca tolucensis\" and \"Muhlenbergia quadridentata\", and the herbaceous plant \"Alchemilla procumbens\", at elevations of . Heim found the type specimens at an altitude of in an alpine pine forest. \"P.¬†aztecorum\" fruits from August to October.\n\n\"Psilocybe aztecorum\" is known only from the high mountains of central Mexico, such as Sierra Nevada, Nevado de Toluca, and La Malinche in the States of Mexico, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. According to Guzm√°n, it is likely that the species also grows in other areas with high mountains, such as the States of Nuevo Leon, Veracruz, Colima, and Chiapas, which have ecological conditions similar to those of the known localities. Variety \"bonetii\" grows in the same substrata as the type variety, mainly on humus, but only in forests with Montezuma pine (\"Pinus montezumae\") and sacred fir (\"Abies religiosa\"), between elevation; it has not been recorded from Hartweg's pine forests. Also known only from Mexico, in the states of Mexico and Morelos, and in the Federal District, \"P.¬†aztecorum\" var. \"bonetii\" usually fruits from August to November. According to Guzm√°n, \"P.¬†aztecorum\" should be of conservation concern owing to loss of its natural habitat.\n\n\"Psilocybe aztecorum\" contains the psychoactive compound psilocybin. In 1958, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann reported a relatively low concentration of 0.02% psilocybin, but this analysis was performed on two-year-old specimens. Jonathan Ott and Guzm√°n indicated the presence of psilocybin in the variety \"bonartii\". In terms of psychoactive potency, Paul Stamets rates \"P.¬†aztecorum\" as \"moderately to highly active\".\n\nThe statue of the Aztec \"god of flowers\", Xochipilli, a 16th-century stone effigy unearthed on the side of the volcano Popocat√©petl, depicts a single figure seated cross-legged upon a temple-like base; his body is covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms. Circular patterns on his kneecaps, right forearm, and headdress have been interpreted by R. Gordon Wasson as stylized fruit bodies of \"Psilocybe aztecorum\". Wasson says that the convex shape and incurved margins depicted in these images show the mushroom caps just before maturity. \"P.¬†aztecorum\" is, in addition to \"P.¬†caerulescens\", one of two mushrooms thought to be the species described by 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahag√∫n as the \"teonan√°catl\". The word \"teonan√°catl\" () has been variously translated as \"sacred or divine mushroom\" or as \"flesh of the gods\". These mushrooms, considered holy sacraments by the Aztecs, were consumed during spiritual and divinatory rituals to induce hallucinatory visions.\n\n\"Psilocybe aztecorum\" is still used ceremonially by the indigenous people of Oaxaca, and by Nahua people in the Popocat√©petl region, although this usage is gradually diminishing. Traditional folk healers, or \"curanderos\", maintain familiarity with psychoactive mushrooms (and other mind-altering plants used in ceremonial rituals), and diagnose illnesses by having the client ingest the mushrooms. One Mixe \"curandero\" initiation ritual involves ingestion of mushrooms following a period of \"abstinence from talking, sexual intercourse, and all foods except nuts for three days, whereupon the individual goes up to a mountain, subsists on nothing but a little honey, and prays to God for the power to heal.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "571809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571809", "title": "Sadhu", "text": "Sadhu\n\nA sadhu (IAST: ' (male), \"sƒÅdhvƒ´\" or \"sƒÅdhvƒ´ne\" (female)), also spelled saddhu\"', is a religious ascetic, mendicant (monk) or any holy person in Hinduism and Jainism who has renounced the worldly life. They are sometimes alternatively referred to as \" jogi\", \"sannyasi\" or \"vairagi\".\n\nIt literally means one who practises a ‚Ä≥sadhana‚Ä≥ or keenly follows a path of spiritual discipline. Although the vast majority of sƒÅdhus are yogƒ´s, not all yogƒ´s are sƒÅdhus. The sƒÅdhu is solely dedicated to achieving mok·π£a (liberation), the fourth and final a≈õrama (stage of life), through meditation and contemplation of Brahman. SƒÅdhus often wear simple clothing, such saffron-coloured clothing in Hinduism, white or nothing in Jainism, symbolising their sannyƒÅsa (renunciation of worldly possessions). A female mendicant in Hinduism and Jainism is often called a sadhvi, or in some texts as aryika.\n\nThe term \"sadhu\" (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å) appears in \"Rigveda\" and \"Atharvaveda\" where it means \"straight, right, leading straight to goal\", according to Monier Monier-Williams. In the Brahmanas layer of Vedic literature, the term connotes someone who is \"well disposed, kind, willing, effective or efficient, peaceful, secure, good, virtuous, honourable, righteous, noble\" depending on the context. In the Hindu Epics, the term implies someone who is a \"saint, sage, seer, holy man, virtuous, chaste, honest or right\".\n\nThe Sanskrit terms \"sƒÅdhu\" (\"good man\") and \"sƒÅdhvƒ´\" (\"good woman\") refer to renouncers who have chosen to live lives apart from or on the edges of society to focus on their own spiritual practices.\n\nThe words come from the root \"sƒÅdh\", which means \"reach one's goal\", \"make straight\", or \"gain power over\". The same root is used in the word sƒÅdhanƒÅ, which means \"spiritual practice\". It literally means one who practises a ‚Ä≥sadhana‚Ä≥ or a path of spiritual discipline.\n\nThere are 4 to 5 million sadhus in India today and they are widely respected for their holiness. It is also thought that the austere practices of the sadhus help to burn off their karma and that of the community at large. Thus seen as benefiting society, sadhus are supported by donations from many people. However, reverence of sadhus is by no means universal in India. For example, Nath yogi sadhus have been viewed with a certain degree of suspicion particularly amongst the urban populations of India, but they have been revered and are popular in rural India.\n\nThere are naked (digambara, or \"sky-clad\") sadhus who wear their hair in thick dreadlocks called \"jata\". Sadhus engage in a wide variety of religious practices. Some practice asceticism and solitary meditation, while others prefer group praying, chanting or meditating. They typically live a simple lifestyle, have very few or no possessions, survive by food and drinks from leftovers that they beg for or is donated by others. Many sadhus have rules for alms collection, and do not visit the same place twice on different days to avoid bothering the residents. They generally walk or travel over distant places, homeless, visiting temples and pilgrimage centers as a part of their spiritual practice. Celibacy is common, but some sects experiment with consensual tantric sex as a part of their practice. Sex is viewed by them as a transcendence from a personal, intimate act to something impersonal and ascetic.\n\nShaiva sadhus are renunciates devoted to Shiva, and Vaishnava sadhus are renouncers devoted to Vishnu (or his avatar like Rama or Krishna). The Vaishnava sadhus are sometimes referred to as \"vairagis\". Less numerous are Shakta sadhus, who are devoted to Shakti. Within these general divisions are numerous sects and subsects, reflecting different lineages and philosophical schools and traditions (often referred to as \"sampradayas\").\n\nWithin the Shaiva sadhus are many subgroups. Most Shaiva sadhus wear a Tripundra mark on their forehead, dress in saffron, red or orange color clothes, and live a monastic life. Some sadhus such as the Aghori share the practices of ancient Kapalikas, where they beg with a skull, smeared their body with ashes from the cremation ground, and experiment with substances or practices that are generally abhorred by society.\n\nThe Dashanami Sampradaya sadhus belong to the Smarta Tradition. They are said to have been formed by the philosopher and renunciant Adi Shankara, believed to have lived in the 8th century CE, though the full history of the sect's formation is not clear. Among them are the Naga subgroups, naked sadhu known for carrying weapons like tridents, swords, canes, and spears. Said to have once functioned as an armed order to protect Hindus from the Mughal rulers, they were involved in a number of military defence campaigns. Generally in the ambit of non-violence at present, some sections are known to practice wrestling and martial arts. Their retreats are still called \"chhaavni\" or armed camps, and mock duels are still sometimes held between them.\n\nFemale sadhus (\"sadhvi\"s) exist in many sects. In many cases, the women that take to the life of renunciation are widows, and these types of sadhvis often live secluded lives in ascetic compounds. Sadhvis are sometimes regarded by some as manifestations or forms of the Goddess, or Devi, and are honoured as such. There have been a number of charismatic sadhvis that have risen to fame as religious teachers in contemporary India‚Äîe.g.,¬†Anandamayi Ma, Sarada Devi, Mata Amritanandamayi, and Karunamayi.\n\nThe Jain community is traditionally discussed in its texts with four terms: \"sadhu\" (monks), \"sadhvi or aryika\" (nuns), \"sravaka\" (laymen householders) and \"sravika\" (laywomen householders). As in Hinduism and Buddhism, the Jain householders support the monastic community. The \"sadhus\" and \"sadhvis\" are intertwined with the Jain lay society, perform \"Murtipuja\" (Jina idol worship) and lead festive rituals, and they are organized in a strongly hierarchical monastic structure.\n\nThere are differences between the Digambara and Svetambara sadhus and sadhvi traditions. The Digambara sadhus own no clothes as a part of their interpretation of Five vows, and they live their ascetic austere lives in nakedness. The Digambara sadhvis wear white clothes. The Svetambara sadhus and sadhvis both wear white clothes. According to a 2009 publication by Harvey J. Sindima, Jain monastic community had 6,000 sadhvis of which less than 100 belong to the Digambara tradition and rest to Svetambara.\n\nThe processes and rituals of becoming a sadhu vary with sect; in almost all sects, a sadhu is initiated by a guru, who bestows upon the initiate a new name, as well as a mantra, (or sacred sound or phrase), which is generally known only to the sadhu and the guru and may be repeated by the initiate as part of meditative practice.\n\nBecoming a sadhu is a path followed by millions. It is supposed to be the fourth phase in a Hindu's life, after studies, being a father and a pilgrim, but for most it is not a practical option. For a person to become sadhu needs vairagya. Vairagya means desire to achieve something by leaving the world (cutting familial, societal and earthly attachments).\n\nA person who wants to become sadhu must first seek a guru. There, he or she must perform 'guruseva' which means service. The guru decides whether the person is eligible to take sannyasa by observing the sisya (the person who wants to become a sadhu or sanyasi). If the person is eligible, \"guru upadesa\" (which means teachings) is done. Only then, the person transforms into sanyasi or sadhu. There are different types of sanyasis in India who follow different sampradya. But, all sadhus have a common goal: attaining moksha (liberation).\n\nKumbh Mela, a mass-gathering of sadhus from all parts of India, takes place every three years at one of four points along sacred rivers in India, including the holy River Ganges. In 2007 it was held in Nasik, Maharashtra. Peter Owen-Jones filmed one episode of \"Extreme Pilgrim\" there during this event. It took place again in Haridwar in 2010. Sadhus of all sects join in this reunion. Millions of non-sadhu pilgrims also attend the festivals, and the Kumbh Mela is the largest gathering of human beings for a single religious purpose on the planet; the most recent Kumbh Mela started on 14 January 2013, at Allahabad. At the festival, sadhus appear in large numbers, including those \"completely naked with ash-smeared bodies, [who] sprint into the chilly waters for a dip at the crack of dawn\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "69308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69308", "title": "Second Temple", "text": "Second Temple\n\nThe Second Temple (, \"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\") was the Jewish holy temple which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and part of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile to Babylon.\n\nThe Second Temple was originally a rather modest structure constructed by a number of Jewish exile groups returning to the Levant from Babylon under the Achaemenid-appointed governor Zerubbabel. However, during the reign of Herod the Great, the Second Temple was completely refurbished, and the original structure was totally overhauled into the large and magnificent edifices and facades that are more recognizable. Much like the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, the Romans destroyed the Second Temple and Jerusalem in 70 CE as retaliation for an ongoing Jewish revolt.\n\nJewish eschatology includes a belief that the Second Temple will be replaced by a future Third Temple.\n\nThe accession of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible. According to the closing verses of the second book of Chronicles and the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem following a decree from Cyrus the Great (, ), construction started at the original site of Solomon's Temple. After a relatively brief halt due to opposition from peoples who had filled the vacuum during the Jewish captivity (), work resumed c. 521 BCE under Darius I () and was completed during the sixth year of his reign (c. 516 BCE), with the temple dedication taking place the following year.\n\nThese events represent the final section in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe original core of the book of Nehemiah, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the Book of Ezra around 400 BCE. Further editing probably continued into the Hellenistic era.\n\nThe book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in Susa, is informed that Jerusalem is without walls and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of the province Yehud Medinata and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the law of Moses. After 12 years in Jerusalem, he returns to Susa but subsequently revisits Jerusalem. He finds that the Israelites have been backsliding and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem to enforce the Law.\n\nBased on the biblical account, after the return from Babylonian captivity, arrangements were immediately made to reorganize the desolated Yehud Province after the demise of the Kingdom of Judah seventy years earlier. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceedings by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first concerns was to restore their ancient house of worship by rebuilding their destroyed Temple and reinstituting the sacrificial rituals known as the \"korbanot\".\n\nOn the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics, besides other gifts, the people poured their gifts into the sacred treasury with great enthusiasm. First they erected and dedicated the altar of God on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (535 BCE), amid great public excitement and rejoicing, the foundations of the Second Temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mixed feelings by the spectators (, ).\n\nThe Samaritans wanted to help with this work but Zerubbabel and the elders declined such cooperation, feeling that the Jews must build the Temple unaided. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. According to , the Samaritans sought to \"frustrate their purpose\" and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.\n\nSeven years later, Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, died () and was succeeded by his son Cambyses. On his death, the \"false Smerdis\", an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius became king (522 BCE). In the second year of his rule the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion (), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516 BCE, more than twenty years after the return from captivity. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people (), although it was evident that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power. The Book of Haggai includes a prediction that the glory of the second temple would be greater than that of the first ().\n\nSome of the original artifacts from the Temple of Solomon are not mentioned in the sources after its destruction in 597 BCE, and are presumed lost. The Second Temple lacked the following holy articles:\n\nIn the Second Temple, the Kodesh Hakodashim (Holy of Holies) was separated by curtains rather than a wall as in the First Temple. Still, as in the Tabernacle, the Second Temple included:\n\nAccording to the Mishnah (\"Middot\" iii. 6), the \"Foundation Stone\" stood where the Ark used to be, and the High Priest put his censer on it on Yom Kippur.\n\nThe Second Temple also included many of the original vessels of gold that had been taken by the Babylonians but restored by Cyrus the Great. According to the Babylonian Talmud (\"Yoma\" 22b), however, the Temple lacked the \"Shekinah\", the dwelling or settling divine presence of God, and the \"Ruach HaKodesh\", the Spirit of Holiness, present in the first.\n\nTraditional rabbinic literature state that the Second Temple stood for 420 years and based on the 2nd-century work \"Seder Olam Rabbah\", placed construction in 350 BCE (3408 AM), 166 years later than secular estimates, and destruction in 70 CE (3829 AM).\n\nThe fifth order, or division, of the Mishnah, known as Kodashim, provides detailed descriptions and discussions of the religious laws connected with Temple service including the sacrifices, the Temple and its furnishings, as well as the priests who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service. Tractates of the order deal with the sacrifices of animals, birds, and meal offerings, the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple (tractate Middot), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple (tractate Tamid).\n\nFollowing the conquest of Judea by Alexander the Great, it became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Paneion. Judea became at that moment part of the Seleucid empire of Syria. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and its religious services stopped, Judaism was effectively outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He also banned circumcision and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the Temple.\n\nFollowing the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid empire, the Second Temple was rededicated and became the religious pillar of the Jewish Hasmonean kingdom, as well as culturally associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.\n\nThere is some evidence from archaeology that further changes to the structure of the Temple and its surroundings were made during the Hasmonean rule. Salome Alexandra, the queen of Hasmonean Kingdom appointed her elder son Hyrcanus II as the high priest of Judaea. Her younger son Aristobulus II was determined to have the throne, and as soon as she died he seized the throne. Hyrcanus, who was in line to be the king, agreed to be contented with being the high priest. Antipater, the governor of Idum√¶a, encouraged Hyrcanus not to give up his throne. Eventually Hyrcanus fled to Aretas III, king of the Nabateans, and returned with an army to take back the throne. He defeated Aristobulus and besieged Jerusalem. The Roman general Pompey, who was in Syria fighting against the Armenians in the Third Mithridatic War, sent his lieutenant to investigate the conflict in Judaea. Both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus appealed to him for support. Pompey was not diligent in making a decision about this which caused Aristobulus to march off. He was pursued by Pompey and surrendered but his followers closed Jerusalem to Pompey's forces. The Romans besieged and took the city in 63 BCE. The priests continued with the religious practices inside the Temple during the siege. The temple was not looted or harmed by the Romans. Pompey himself, perhaps inadvertently, went into the Holy of Holies and the next day ordered the priests to repurify the Temple and resume the religious practices.\n\nReconstruction of the temple under Herod began with a massive expansion of the Temple Mount. Religious worship and temple rituals continued during the construction process. When the Roman emperor Caligula planned to place his own statue inside the temple, Herod's grandson Agrippa I was able to intervene and convince him against this.\n\nHerod's Temple was one of the larger construction projects of the 1st century BCE. Josephus records that Herod was interested in perpetuating his name through building projects, that his construction programs were extensive and paid for by heavy taxes, but that his masterpiece was the Temple of Jerusalem.\n\nThe old temple built by Zerubbabel was replaced by a magnificent edifice. An agreement was made between Herod and the Jewish religious authorities: the sacrificial rituals, called offerings, were to be continued unabated for the entire time of construction, and the Temple itself would be constructed by the priests. Later the Exodus 30:13 sanctuary shekel was reinstituted to support the temple as the temple tax.\n\nMt. Moriah had a plateau at the northern end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain be turned into a giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be 1600 feet wide by 900 feet broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to 16 feet thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone \"bricks\" were laid. Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, the largest measuring 44.6 feet by 11 feet by 16.5 feet and weighing approximately 567 to 628 tons, while most were in the range of 2.5 by 3.5 by 15 feet (approximately 28 tons). King Herod had architects from Greece, Rome and Egypt plan the construction. The blocks were presumably quarried by using pickaxes to create channels. Then they hammered in wooden beams and flushed them with water to force them out. Once they were removed, they were carved into precise squares and numbered at the quarry to show where they would be installed. The final carving would have been done by using harder stones to grind or chisel them to create precise joints. They would have been transported using oxen and specialized carts. Since the quarry was uphill from the temple they had gravity on their side but care needed to be taken to control the descent. Final installation would have been done using pulleys or cranes. Roman pulleys and cranes weren't strong enough to lift the blocks alone so they may have used multiple cranes and levers to position them. As the mountainside began to rise, the western side was carved away to a vertical wall and bricks were carved to create a virtual continuation of the brick face, which was continued for a while until the northern slope reached ground level. Part of the Antonian hill to the north of Moriah was annexed to the complex and the area between was filled up with landfill.\n\nThe project began with the building of giant underground vaults upon which the temple would be built so it could be larger than the small flat area on top of Mount Moriah. Ground level at the time was at least 20¬†ft. (6m) below the current level, as can be seen by walking the Western Wall tunnels. Legend has it that the construction of the entire complex lasted only three years, but other sources such as Josephus say that it took far longer, although the Temple itself may have taken that long. During a Passover visit by Jesus the Jews replied that it had been under construction for 46 years. It is possible that the complex was only a few years completed when the future Emperor Titus destroyed the Temple in 70 CE.\n\nThis area was primarily a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food, as well as currency changers, exchanging Roman for Tyrian money because the Jews were not allowed to coin their own money and they viewed Roman currency as an abomination to the Lord, as also mentioned in the New Testament account of Jesus and the Money Changers when Jerusalem was packed with Jews who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000 pilgrims. Guides that provided tours of the premises were also available. Jewish males had the unique opportunity to be shown inside the temple itself.\n\nThe priests, in their white linen robes and tubular hats, were everywhere, directing pilgrims and advising them on what kinds of sacrifices were to be performed.\n\nBehind them, as they entered the Court of the Gentiles from the south through the Huldah Gates, was the Royal Porch, which contained a marketplace, administrative quarters, and a synagogue. On the upper floors, the great Jewish sages held court, priests and Levites performed various chores, and from there, tourists were able to observe the events. The Royal Porch is widely accepted to be part of Herod's work; however, recent archaeological finds in the Western Wall tunnels suggest that it was built in the first century during the reign of Agripas, as opposed to the first century BCE, while the theory that Herod began the extension and the Royal Porch is based mainly on Josephus's possibly politically motivated claim. During Herod's reign the porch was not yet open to the public.\n\nTo the east of the court was Solomon's Porch, and to the north, the \"soreg\", the \"middle wall of separation\", a stone wall separating the public area from the inner sanctuary where only Jews could enter, described as being 3 cubits high by Josephus (Wars 5.5.2 [3b] 6.2.4).\n\nThe accounts of Jesus's temptations in Matthew's and Luke's gospels both suggest that the Second Temple had one or more pinnacles ():\n\nThe Greek word used here is pterugion, which literally means a little wing, or by extension anything like a wing such as a battlement or parapet. The archaeologist Benjamin Mazar thought it referred to the southeast corner of the Temple overlooking the Kidron Valley.\n\nAccording to Josephus, there were ten entrances into the inner courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women to the court of the Israelites, named the Nicanor Gate. The gates were: On the south side (going from west to east) the Fuel Gate, the Firstling Gate, the Water Gate. On the north side, from west to east, are the Jeconiah Gate, the Offering Gate, the Women's Gate and the Song Gate. On the Eastern side, the Nicanor gate, which is where most Jewish visitors entered. A few pieces of the Soreg have survived to the present day.\n\nWithin this area was the Court of the Women, open to all Jews, male and female. Even a ritually unclean Cohen could enter to perform various housekeeping duties. There was also a place for lepers (considered ritually unclean), as well as a ritual barbershop for Nazirites. In this, the largest of the temple courts, one could see constant dancing, singing and music.\n\nOnly men were allowed to enter the Court of the Israelites, where they could observe sacrifices of the high priest in the Court of the Priests. The Court of the Priests was reserved for Levite priests.\n\nBetween the entrance of the building and the curtain veiling the Holy of Holies were the famous vessels of the temple: the menorah, the incense-burning altar, and various other implements.\n\nJews from distant parts of the Roman Empire would arrive by boat at the port of Jaffa (now part of Tel Aviv), where they would join a caravan for the three-day trek to the Holy City and would then find lodgings in one of the many hotels or hostelries. Then they changed some of their money from the profane standard Greek and Roman currency for Jewish and Tyrian money, the latter two considered religious. The pilgrims would purchase sacrificial animals, usually a pigeon or a lamb, in preparation for the following day's events.\n\nThe first thing pilgrims would do would be to approach the public entrance on the south side of the Temple Mount complex. They would check their animals, then visit a mikveh, where they would ritually cleanse and purify themselves. The pilgrims would then retrieve their sacrificial animals, and head to the Huldah gates. After ascending a staircase three stories in height, and passing through the gate, the pilgrims would find themselves in the Court of the Gentiles.\n\nIn 66 CE the Jewish population rebelled against the Roman Empire. Four years later, on 4 August 70 CE (Tisha B'Av - 9th Day of Av) or 30 August 70 CE, Roman legions under Titus retook and destroyed much of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. The Arch of Titus, in Rome and built to commemorate Titus's victory in Judea, depicts a Roman victory procession with soldiers carrying spoils from the Temple, including the Menorah. According to an inscription on the Colosseum, Emperor Vespasian built the Colosseum with war spoils in 79 CE‚Äîpossibly from the spoils of the Second Temple.\n\nThe sects of Judaism that had their base in the Temple dwindled in importance, including the priesthood and the Sadducees.\n\nThe destruction date according to the Hebrew calendar was the 9th of Av, also known as Tisha B'Av. The Temple was on the site of what today is the Dome of the Rock. The gates let out close to Al-Aqsa Mosque (which came much later). Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor Hadrian established a new city called Aelia Capitolina. At the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred and Jews were banned from living inside Jerusalem. A pagan Roman temple was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple.\n\nIn 1871, a hewn stone measuring 60 √ó 90¬†cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau as being the Temple Warning inscription. The stone inscription outlined the prohibition extended unto those who were not of the Jewish nation to proceed beyond the \"soreg\" separating the larger Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts. The inscription read in seven lines:\n\nTranslation: \"Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death.\" Today, the stone is preserved in Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities.\n\nIn 1936 a fragment of a similar Temple warning inscription was found.\n\nAfter 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended all the way around the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the Temple Mount. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through colonnades to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of \"mikvehs\" (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, and a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist and whose current renovation by the \"Waqf\" is extremely controversial. The temple was constructed of imported white marble that gleamed in the daylight.\n\nOn September 25, 2007, Yuval Baruch, archaeologist with the Israeli Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of a quarry compound which may have provided King Herod with the stones to build his Temple on the Temple Mount. Coins, pottery and an iron stake found proved the date of the quarrying to be about 19 BCE. Archaeologist Ehud Netzer confirmed that the large outlines of the stone cuts is evidence that it was a massive public project worked by hundreds of slaves.\n\nThe Magdala stone is thought to be a representation of the Second Temple carved before its destruction in the year 70.\n\nThe period between the construction of the Second Temple in 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE witnessed major historical upheavals and significant religious changes that would affect most subsequent Abrahamic religions. The origins of the authority of scripture, of the centrality of law and morality in religion, of the synagogue and of apocalyptic expectations for the future all developed in the Judaism of this period.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4877967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877967", "title": "Shankha", "text": "Shankha\n\nA Shankha is a conch shell of ritual and religious importance in Hinduism and Buddhism. It is the shell of a large predatory sea snail, \"Turbinella pyrum\", found in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, the shankha is a sacred emblem of the Hindu preserver god Vishnu. It is still used as a trumpet in Hindu ritual, and in the past was used as a war trumpet. The shankha is praised in Hindu scriptures as a giver of fame, longevity and prosperity, the cleanser of sin and the abode of goddess Lakshmi, who is the goddess of wealth and consort of Vishnu.\n\nThe shankha is displayed in Hindu art in association with Vishnu. As a symbol of water, it is associated with female fertility and serpents (NƒÅgas). The shankha is the state emblem of the Indian state of Kerala and was also the national emblems of the Indian princely state of Travancore, and the Kingdom of Cochin.\n\nThe shankha is one of the eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism, the Ashtamangala, and represents the pervasive sound of Buddhism.\n\nA powder made from the shell material is used in ayurveda as a treatment for stomach ailments.\n\nIn the Western world, in the English language, the shell of this species is known as the \"divine conch\" or the \"sacred chank\". It may also be simply called a \"chank\" or conch. The more common form of this shell is known as \"left-turning\" in a religious context, although scientists would call it \"dextral\". A very rarely encountered form has reverse coiling which is called \"right-turning\" in a religious context, but is known as \"sinistral\" or left-coiling in a scientific context.\n\nThis shell is from a sea snail species \"Turbinella pyrum\" in the family Turbinellidae. This species is found living in the Indian Ocean and surrounding seas. The shell is porcelaneous (i.e. the surface of the shell is strong, hard, shiny, and somewhat translucent, like porcelain).\n\nThe overall shape of the main body of the shell is oblong or conical. In the oblong form, it has a protuberance in the middle, but tapers at each end. The upper portion (the siphonal canal) is corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end (the spire) is twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull, and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent. Like all snail shells, the interior is hollow. The inner surfaces of the shell are very shiny, but the outer surface exhibits high tuberculation. In Hinduism, the shiny, white, soft shankha with pointed ends and heavy is the most sought after.\n\nBased on its direction of coiling, the shankha has two varieties:\n\n\nThe \"Dakshinavarta shankha\" is believed to be the abode of the wealth goddess Lakshmi - the consort of Vishnu, and hence this type of shankha is considered ideal for medicinal use. It is a very rare variety from the Indian Ocean. This type of shankha has three to seven ridges visible on the edge of the aperture and on the columella and has a special internal structure. The right spiral of this type reflects the motion of the planets. It is also compared with the hair whorls on the Buddha's head that spiral to the right. The long white curl between Buddha's eyebrows and the conch-like swirl of his navel are also akin to this shankha.\n\nThe \"Varaha Purana\" tells that bathing with the \"Dakshinavarta shankha\" frees one from sin. Skanda Purana narrates that bathing Vishnu with this shankha grants freedom from sins of seven previous lives. A \"Dakshinavarta shankha \"is considered to be a rare \"jewel\" or \"ratna\" and is adorned with great virtues. It is also believed to grant longevity, fame and wealth proportional to its shine, whiteness and largeness. Even if such a shankha has a defect, mounting it in gold is believed to restore the virtues of the shankha.\n\nIn its earliest references, shankha is mentioned as a trumpet and in this form it became an emblem of Vishnu. Simultaneously, it was used as a votive offering and as a charm to keep away the dangers of the sea. It was the earliest known sound-producing agency as manifestation of sound, and the other elements came later, hence it is regarded as the original of the elements. It is identified with the elements themselves.\nTo make a trumpet or wind instrument, one drills a hole near the tip of the apex of the shankha. When air is blown through this hole, it travels through the whorls of the shankha, producing a loud, sharp, shrill sound. This sound is the reason the shankha was used as a war trumpet, to summon helpers and friends. Shanka continued to be used in battles for a long time. The sound it produced was called \"shankanad\".\n\nNowadays, the shankha is blown at the time of worship in Hindu temples and homes, especially in the ritual of the Hindu \"aarti\", when light is offered to the deities. The shankha is also used to bathe images of deities, especially Vishnu, and for ritual purification. No hole is drilled for these purposes, though the aperture is cut clean or rarely the whorls are cut to represent five consecutive shells with five mouths.\n\nShankha is used as a material for making bangles, bracelets and other objects. Because of its aquatic origin and resemblance to the vulva, it has become an integral part of the Tantric rites. In view of this, its symbolism is also said to represent female fertility. Since water itself is a fertility symbol, shankha, which is an aquatic product, is recognised as symbolic of female fertility. In ancient Greece, shells, along with pearls, are mentioned as denoting sexual love and marriage, and also mother goddesses.\n\nDifferent magic and sorcery items are also closely connected with this trumpet. This type of device existed long before the Buddhist era.\n\n<br>\nSouthwestern conch\n\" Southwestern conch \" 'The expanse of this conch that makes it very valuable too.\nIdentification of conch - 1- Spinning on the near-ear, 2- Bubble bamboo on the right and arms of the conch on the water when placed on the water, 3- Do not burn the fire on the face of the conch with a camouflaged fire 4- Touching a sick man and fixing it, 5- If the moon or sun is eclipsed on the day of full moon, then once in a month and a half months, once in a cow's place, after harvesting the conch, the cow's place Milk itself coming out, 6 - cho Decrease of injury or pain due to touching the conch for a few seconds at the closed locations.\nThe conclusion of which is only southwards is also very rare, the great scientist of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and the Monsoon of the Discovery Channel, believes that drinking water from this conch ending with a disease like AIDS-AIDS It is done, this conch is used to claim the diseases like cancer - AIDS. \"An interesting fact that makes it more fickle\" \"\" The scientists of the Harvard University of America believe that if a person who has gone into coma or has lost his mental balance, he sleeps By packing the time in the forehead, the person gets well soon. Some of the things that make it worth millions of rupees. India's Shankaracharya Roopnand Saraswati believes that such a conch is also known as greedy by tracing gold, diamonds and treasures like diamonds. Some such conch shells were stolen from the Mahakalal temple in Ujjain in 2014, which was bought by a German company for 12 crores, which, when it was found, the Indian government brought the conch into India by having a case on that company. The main way of identifying this conch is also its weight. The weight of this conch is less than 1 kilogram, and the five strips of its side part are small and thin. The shape of the furor of the next part of this conch is 1 to one side and from one side to the other 4, and on the second layer of furrow, on the other hand half c of the natural small and lower pore is found, due to which this conch natural energy He assumes that, the conch, who has it, the glory and riches kissing the same verse.\n\nSome superstitions spread over this conch\n1- Some people try to put it in rice to test it, so that the conch should come out of its own, when nothing is done like that, it is a science tread, a chemical called Xavolan is placed in the conch and the conch under the rice If the beans are kept then the conch is reacting with rice itself, it is because this chemical reacts with carbohydrate present in the rice and makes a gas in the center of the conch, and it Thunder is pushing the shell upwards and come out of the shell of rice. It is made to develop Radar at Chemical Bhabha's Research Center, which people also consider buying it as a southern conch, and afterwards there is nothing else to repent. <br>\n2- Some people also say that the conch floral flower gives flowering flowers within 5‚Äì10 minutes, which is also found in this flower carbohydrate and this chemical reacts in the inner part of this flower , And the gas flows out, causing the flower to bloom immediately.\n\nShankha is used in Ayurveda medicinal formulations to treat many ailments. It is prepared as conch shell ash, known in Sanskrit as \"shankha bhasma\", which is prepared by soaking the shell in lime juice and calcinating in covered crucibles, 10 to 12 times, and finally reducing it to powder ash. Shankha bhasma contains calcium, iron and magnesium and is considered to possess antacid and digestive properties.\n\nA compound pill called \"shankavati\" is also prepared for use in dyspepsia. In this case, the procedure followed is to mix \"shankha bhasma\" with tamarind seed ash, five salts (panchlavana), asafoetida, ammonium chloride, pepper, carui, caraway, ginger, long pepper, purified mercury and aconite in specified proportions. It is then triturated in juices of lemon and made into a pill-mass. It is prescribed for \"vata\" (wind/air) and \"pitta\" (bile) ailments, as well as for beauty and strength.\n\nThe sound of the shankha symbolises the sacred \"Om\" sound. Vishnu holding the conch represents him as the god of sound. Brahma Vaivarta Purana declares that shankha is the residence of both Lakshmi and Vishnu, bathing by the waters led through a shankha is considered as like bathing with all holy waters at once. Sankha Sadma Purana declares that bathing an image of Vishnu with cow milk is as virtuous as performing a million \"yajnas\" (fire sacrifices), and bathing Vishnu with Ganges river water frees one from the cycle of births. It further says \"while the mere sight of the conch (shankha) dispels all sins as the Sun dispels the fog, why talk of its worship?\" Padma Purana asserts the same effect of bathing Vishnu by Ganges water and milk and further adds doing so avoids evil, pouring water from a shankha on one's own head before a Vishnu image is equivalent to bathing in the pious Ganges river.\n\nIn Buddhism, the conch shell has been incorporated as one of the eight auspicious symbols, also called \"Ashtamangala\". The right-turning white conch shell (), represents the elegant, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of Buddhism, which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others.\n\nShankha was the Royal State Emblem of Travancore and also figured on the Royal Flag of the Jaffna kingdom. It is also the election symbol of the Indian political party Biju Janata Dal.\n\nShankha is one of the main attributes of Vishnu. Vishnu's images, either in sitting or standing posture, show him holding the shankha usually in his left upper hand, while \"Sudarshana Chakra\" (\"chakra\" - discus), \"gada\" (mace) and \"padma\" (lotus flower) decorate his upper right, the lower left and lower right hands, respectively.\nAvatars of Vishnu like Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Narasimha are also depicted holding the shankha, along with the other attributes of Vishnu. Krishna - avatar of Vishnu is described possessing a shankha called Panchajanya. Regional Vishnu forms like Jagannath and Vithoba may be also pictured holding the shankha. Besides Vishnu, other deities are also pictured holding the shankha. These include the sun god Surya, Indra - the king of heaven and god of rain the war god Kartikeya, the goddess Vaishnavi and the warrior goddess Durga. Similarly, Gaja Lakshmi statues show Lakshmi holding a shankha in the right hand and lotus on the other.\n\nSometimes, the shankha of Vishnu is personified as \"Ayudhapurusha\" \"weapon-man\" in the sculpture and depicted as a man standing beside Vishnu or his avatars. This subordinate figure is called the Shankhapurusha who is depicted holding a shankha in both the hands. Temple pillars, walls, gopuras (towers), basements and elsewhere in the temple, sculpted depictions of the shankha and chakra - the emblems of Vishnu - are seen. The city of Puri also known as Shankha-kshetra is sometimes pictured as a shankha or conch in art with the Jagannath temple at its centre.\n\nShaligrams are iconographic fossil stones particularly found in the Gandaki River in Nepal which are worshipped by Hindus as representative of Vishnu. The shaligrama - which has the marks of a shanka, chakra, gada and padma arranged in this particular order ‚Äì is worshipped as Keshava. Twenty-four orders of the four symbols defined for Shaligrama are also followed in worship of images of Vishnu with different names. Out of these, besides Keshava the four names of images worshipped starting with Shankha on the upper hand, are: Madhusudanah, Damodara, Balarama and Vamana.\n\nA Hindu legend in the \"Brahma Vaivarta Purana\" recalls the creation of conchs: Shiva flung a trident towards the asuras, burning them instantaneously. Their ashes flew in the sea creating conchs. Shankha is believed to be a brother of Lakshmi as both of them were born from the sea. A legend describes an asura named Shankhasura, who was killed by Vishnu's fish avatar, Matsya.\nIn the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata, the symbol of Shankha is widely adopted. In the Ramayana epic, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna are considered as part-incarnations of Sheshanaga, Sudarshana Chakra and Shankha, respectively, while Rama, their eldest brother, is considered as one of the ten Avatars of shri Vishnu.\n\nDuring the great Mahabharata war, Krishna, as the charioteer of the Pandava prince and a protagonist of the epic - Arjuna - resounds the Panchajanya to declare war. Panchajanya in Sanskrit means 'having control over the five classes of beings'. All five Pandava brothers are described having their own shankhas. Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva are described to possess shankhas named Ananta-Vijaya, Poundra-Khadga, Devadatta, Sughosha and Mani-pushpaka, respectively.\n\nBecause of the association of the shankha with water, nƒÅgas are often named after the shankha. The list of NƒÅgas in the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Harivamsha\" and the \"Bhagavat Purana\" includes names like Shankha, Mahashankha, Shankhapala and Shankachuda. The last two are also mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka Tales and the \"Jimutavahana\". A legend states that while using Shankha as part of meditative ritual, a sadhu blew his shankha in the forest of village Keoli and a snake crept out of it. The snake directed the sadhu that he should be worshipped as NƒÅga Devata (Serpent God) and since then it has been known as Shanku Naga. Similar legends are narrated at many other places in Kullu district in Himachal Pradesh.\n\n\n"}

Rinpoche eventually traveled to Darjeeling where the 16th Karmapa (1924-1981) found him and arranged for him to be taken to Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim.\n\nThe Third Bardor Tulku Rinpoche is mentioned among the prominent lamas of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.\nHe underwent his training as a \"tulku\" (reincarnate lama) under the tutelage of the 16th Karmapa at Rumtek Monastery. He remained close to the Karmapa throughout his life, serving as his attendant and traveling with him overseas. At his request, he stayed in the United States to help Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche and Mr. Tenzin Chonyi establish the Karmapa‚Äôs Seat in North America, Karma Triyana Dharmachakra.\nRinpoche started teaching in the West in 1980s. He has taught at KTD and its affiliates, at other Buddhist centers in the United States and abroad, as well lectured at universities and other venues. Some of his teachings have been published as books and DVDs.\n\nIn 2000, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche established the Raktrul Foundation and in 2003 a Tibetan Buddhist center, Kunzang Palchen Ling (KPL), in Red Hook, New York. A ceremony of a symbolic breaking of the ground for the new building at KPL was held in 2006.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche resigned from his responsibilities at KTD and is now focusing fully on the activities of KPL. In February 2012, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche‚Äôs vision for the new center became reality as KPL received the Certificate of Occupancy for the first floor of its new building.\n\nKPL is a Buddhist center that offers teachings from the rich and diverse Tibetan Buddhist tradition. One of the significant traits of KPL's activity is providing access to and the preservation of the treasure (\"terma\") teachings of Terchen Barway Dorje and the teachings of the Barom Kagyu lineage. In addition to overseeing translations of Terchen Barway Dorje's treasure teachings into English, Bardor Tulku Rinpoche himself composes liturgies and songs (\"dohas\"). Rinpoche also guides the activities of Kunzang Ch√∂ling centers affiliated with KPL and Palchen Study Groups in the U.S.\n\nBardor Tulku Rinpoche travels and teaches across the U.S. His teaching schedule can be found on the KPL website.\n\n\n\n"}

C. Balfour in the Folklore Society journal \"Folk-Lore\". In the article she recalls a story, collected in the Ancholme Valley, told to her by an older person who spoke of a curse of pestilence that had been cast upon his village by the Tiddy Mun, who was angered at the draining of the Fens by the Dutch, led by Cornelius Vermuyden, in the seventeenth century. According to the story the Tiddy Mun was eventually placated after the villagers gathered at twilight at the time of the new moon, poured buckets of water into the dyke and apologised for the damage caused.\n\nHe was not exclusively malevolent; if the Fens flooded and the waters reached the villages, people would go out at night and call \"Tiddy Mun wi'out a name, tha watters thruff!\" (\"Tiddy Mun without a name, the water's through!\") until they heard the cry of a peewit, and the next morning the waters would have receded.\n\nIn his 1987 \"Folklore\" paper \"Tiddy Mun's Curse and the Ecological Consequences of Land Reclamation\", Darwin Horn argues that all but one of Tiddy Mun's specific curses may be connected to misfortune and disease brought about by the effect of draining the fenland.\n\nThe Tiddy Mun was described, by folklorist M.C. Balfour in 1891, as being no bigger than a three-year-old child, but looking like an old man with long, tangled white hair and a matted white beard. He is said to have worn a grey gown so that at dusk he was difficult to see. His laughter was said to resemble the call of the peewit.\n\nWriting in 1955, folklorist E. H. Rudkin also records another Ancholme Valley belief of an imp-like race of beings who were generally considered mischievous but benevolent. They were 'called the Tiddy people', but also \"the Strangers\", \"Greencoaties\" and \"Yarthin\". The 'Tiddy' name related to their size and Rudkin quotes a source describing them: 'They be tiddy critturs, no more than a span high, wi' arms an' legs as thin as thread, but great big feet an' hands, an' heads rollin' aboot on their shoulders'.\n\nThe Tiddy people would dance, by moonlight, on large flat stones, known as \"Strangers Stones\", found in the area. Rudkin records a local tradition of smearing the stones with blood and lighting fires on them, but was unable to determine a meaning, or specific belief, behind the practice. The first of the crops would also be left on the \"Strangers Stones\", as well as bread and salt, to keep the Tiddy people happy and ensure a good harvest.\n\n"}
