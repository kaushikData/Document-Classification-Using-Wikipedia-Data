She was particularly associated with Imperial cult as a virtue of the deified emperor \"(divus)\". The religious maintenance of abstract deities such as Aeternitas was characteristic of official Roman cult from the time of the Julio-Claudians to the Severans.\n\nLike the more familiar anthropomorphic deities, Aeternitas and other abstractions were cultivated with sacrifices and temples, both in Rome and in the provinces. The temple of \"Aeternitas Augusta\" at Tarraco in Roman Spain was pictured on a coin.\n\nThe divinity sometimes appears as \"Aeternitas Imperii\" (the \"Eternity of Roman rule\"), where the Latin word \"imperium\" (\"command, power\") points toward the meaning \"empire,\" the English word derived from it. \"Aeternitas Imperii\" was among the deities who received sacrifices from the Arval Brethren in a thanksgiving when Nero survived conspiracy and attempted assassination. New bronze coinage was issued at this time, on which various virtues were represented.\n\nAeternitas was among the many virtues depicted on coinage issued under Vespasian, Titus, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Septimius Severus. The coins issued 75–79 AD under Vespasian show Aeternitas holding a head in each hand representing Sol and Luna. On the coins of Titus (80–81 AD), Aeternitas holds a cornucopia, leans on a scepter, and has one foot placed on a globe, imagery that links the concepts of eternity, prosperity, and world dominion. From the 2nd to the mid-3rd century, the iconography of Aeternitas includes the globe, celestial bodies (stars, or sun and moon), and the phoenix, a symbol of cyclical time, since the phoenix was reborn in flames every 500 years. Aeternitas sometimes holds the globe on which the phoenix perches.\n\nIn \"The Marriage of Philology and Mercury\", Martianus Capella says that Aeternitas is among the more honored of Jupiter's daughters. He mentions her diadem, the circular shape of which represents eternity.\n\nThe male equivalent of Aeternitas is Aion, the god of unbound time, the celestial spheres, and the Zodiac.\n"}
{"id": "84987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84987", "title": "Aius Locutius", "text": "Aius Locutius\n\nAius Locutius (, spoken affirmation) or Aius Loquens (, speaking affirmation), was a Roman deity or numen associated with the Gallic invasions of Rome during the early 4th century BC.\n\nAccording to legend, a Roman plebeian named M. Caedicius heard a supernatural, nocturnal voice that issued from Vesta's sacred grove, at the base of the Palatine hill. It warned him of an imminent Gaulish attack, recommended that the walls of Rome be fortified and instructed him to pass these messages on to the tribune of the plebs; but because of the messenger's humble station, the message was ignored. In consequence, the Gauls entered and burned the city (c. 391 BC). Once the Gauls were repelled, the senate built a temple and altar (known as \"Ara Aius Locutius\" or \"Ara Saepta\") to propitiate the unknown deity who had offered the warning. This was said to have been set up where Caedicius had heard the divine voice. Later Roman historians disputed its exact location and no trace remains of the temple or altar; the latter has been historically misidentified with the Palatine altar inscribed \"si deus si dea\" (\"whether god or goddess\"), in cautious dedication to some unknown deity..\n\nIn the broad context of official Roman religion, Aius Locutius is exceptional. Officially, the gods might speak through the cryptic writings and utterances of specialised oracles, or through a complex system of signs in answer to the specific questions of State augurs. They might also grant signs of fortune to their most favoured protégés, or speak privately to them in dreams. Aius Locutius gave clear, urgent instructions of great importance to the State, in a voice \"clearer than human\", but in everyday Latin, to an ordinary plebeian passer-by. Thereafter, according to Cicero, \"having acquired a temple, an altar, and a name, 'Speaker' never spoke again\". As a trained augur, Cicero was obliged to successfully identify and expiate any prodigies, including such \"divine noise\" that might signal imminent disaster or divine discontent. Beard (2012) places Aius Locutius at the \"extraordinary limit\" of such sounds, for the unequivocal clarity of the warning, and the consequences of its rejection by Roman authorities; a god \"defined by his voice alone\".\n\nThe epithet \"Locutius\" was also used to invoke one of the deities concerned with child development.\n"}

She is considered the first prominent woman Punjabi poet, novelist, and essayist, and the leading 20th-century poet of the Punjabi language, who is equally loved on both sides of the India-Pakistan border. With a career spanning over six decades, she produced over 100 books of poetry, fiction, biographies, essays, a collection of Punjabi folk songs and an autobiography that were translated into several Indian and foreign languages.\n\nShe is most remembered for her poignant poem, \"Ajj aakhaan Waris Shah nu\" (Today I invoke Waris Shah – \"Ode to Waris Shah\"), an elegy to the 18th-century Punjabi poet, an expression of her anguish over massacres during the partition of India. As a novelist, her most noted work was \"Pinjar\" (The Skeleton) (1950), in which she created her memorable character, \"Puro\", an epitome of violence against women, loss of humanity and ultimate surrender to existential fate; the novel was made into an award-winning film, \"Pinjar\" in 2003.\n\nWhen the former British India was partitioned into the independent states of India and Pakistan in 1947, she migrated from Lahore, to India, though she remained equally popular in Pakistan throughout her life, as compared to her contemporaries like Mohan Singh and Shiv Kumar Batalvi.\n\nKnown as the most important voice for the women in Punjabi literature, in 1956, she became the first woman to win the Sahitya Akademi Award for her magnum opus, a long poem, \"Sunehade\" (Messages), later she received the Bharatiya Jnanpith, one of India's highest literary awards, in 1982 for \"Kagaz Te Canvas\" (The Paper and the Canvas). The Padma Shri came her way in 1969 and finally, Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, in 2004, and in the same year she was honoured with India's highest literary award, given by the Sahitya Akademi (India's Academy of Letters), the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship given to \"the \"immortals of literature\"\" for lifetime achievement.\n\nAmrita Pritam was born as Amrit Kaur in 1919 in Gujranwala, Punjab, in present-day Pakistan, the only child of Raj Bibi, who was a school teacher and Kartar Singh Hitkari, who was a poet, a scholar of Braj Bhasha, and the editor edited a literary journal. Besides this, he was a \"pracharak\" – a preacher of the Sikh faith. Amrita's mother died when she was eleven. Soon after, she and her father moved to Lahore, where she lived till her migration to India in 1947. Confronting adult responsibilities, and besieged by loneliness following her mother's death, she began to write at an early age. Her first anthology of poems, \"Amrit Lehran\" (Immortal Waves) was published in 1936, at age sixteen, the year she married Pritam Singh, an editor to whom she was engaged in early childhood, and changed her name from Amrita Kaur to Amrita Pritam. Half a dozen collections of poems were to follow between 1936 and 1943.\n\nThough she began her journey as romantic poet, soon she shifted gears, and became part of the Progressive Writers' Movement and its effect was seen in her collection, \"Lok Peed\" (People's Anguish) (1944), which openly criticized the war-torn economy, after the Bengal famine of 1943. She was also involved in social work to certain extent and participated in such activities wholeheartedly, after Independence when social activist Guru Radha Kishan took the initiative to bring the first Janta Library in Delhi, which was inaugurated by Balraj Sahni and Aruna Asaf Ali and contributed to the occasion accordingly. This study centre cum library is still running at Clock Tower, Delhi. She also worked at Lahore Radio Station for a while, before the partition of India\n\nRenowned theatre person and the director of the immortal partition movie 'Garam Hava', MS Sathyu paid a theatrical tribute to her through the rare theatrical performance 'Ek Thee Amrita'.\n\nSome one million people, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs died from communal violence that followed the partition of British India in 1947, and left Amrita Pritam a Punjabi refugee at age 28, when she left Lahore and moved to New Delhi. Subsequently, in 1948, while she was pregnant with her son, and travelling from Dehradun to Delhi, she expressed anguish on a piece of paper as the poem, \"Ajj akhaan Waris Shah nu\" (I ask Waris Shah Today); this poem was to later immortalise her and become the most poignant reminder of the horrors of Partition. The poem addressed to the Sufi poet Waris Shah, author of the tragic saga of Heer and Ranjah and with whom she shares her birthplace.\n\nAmrita Pritam worked until 1961 in the Punjabi service of All India Radio, Delhi. After her divorce in 1960, her work became more clearly feminist. Many of her stories and poems drew on the unhappy experience of her marriage. A number of her works have been translated into English, French, Danish, Japanese, Mandarin and other languages from Punjabi and Urdu, including her autobiographical works \"Black Rose\" and \"Rasidi Ticket\" (Revenue Stamp).\n\nThe first of Amrita Pritam's books to be filmed was Dharti Sagar te Sippiyan, as ‘Kadambari’ (1965), followed by ‘Unah Di Kahani’, as \"Daaku\" (Dacoit, 1976), directed by Basu Bhattacharya. Her novel \"Pinjar\" (The Skeleton, 1970) narrates the story of partition riots along with the crisis of women who suffered during the times. It was made into an award-winning Hindi movie by Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, because of its humanism: \"Amritaji has portrayed the suffering of people of both the countries.\" \"Pinjar\" was shot in a border region of Rajasthan and in Punjab.\n\nShe edited \"Nagmani\", a monthly literary magazine in Punjabi for several years, which she ran together with Imroz, for 33 years; though after Partition she wrote prolifically in Hindi as well. Later in life, she turned to Osho and wrote introductions for several books of Osho, including \"Ek Onkar Satnam\", and also started writing on spiritual themes and dreams, producing works like \"Kaal Chetna\" (Time Consciousness) and \"Agyat Ka Nimantran\" (Call of the Unknown). She had also published autobiographies, titled, \"Kala Gulab\" (Black Rose) (1968), \"Rasidi Ticket\" (The Revenue Stamp) (1976), and \"Aksharon kay Saayee\" (Shadows of Words).\n\nAmrita is the first recipient of Punjab Rattan Award conferred upon her by Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh. She is first woman recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1956 for \"Sunehadey\" (poetic diminutive of the word sunehe i,e.\"Messages\"), Amrita Pritam received the Bhartiya Jnanpith Award, India's highest literary award, in 1982 for \"Kagaj te Canvas (Paper and Canvas).\" She received the Padma Shri (1969) and Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, and Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, India's highest literary award, also in 2004. She received D.Litt. honorary degrees, from many universities including, Delhi University (1973), Jabalpur University (1973) and Vishwa Bharati (1987)\n\nShe also received International Vaptsarov Award from the Republic of Bulgaria (1979) and Degree of Officer dens, Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Officier) by the French Government (1987). She was nominated as a member of Rajya Sabha 1986–92. Towards the end of her life, she was awarded by Pakistan's Punjabi Academy, to which she had remarked, \"Bade dino baad mere maike ko meri yaad aayi..\" (My motherland has remembered me after a long time); and also Punjabi poets of Pakistan, sent her a chaddar, from the tombs of Waris Shah, and fellow Sufi mystic poets Bulle Shah and Sultan Bahu.\n\nIn 1935, Amrita married Pritam Singh, son of a leading hosiery merchant of Lahore's Anarkali bazaar. In 1960, Amrita Pritam left her husband. She is also said to have an unrequited affection for poet Sahir Ludhianvi. The story of this love is depicted in her autobiography, \"Rasidi Ticket\" (Revenue Stamp). When another woman, singer Sudha Malhotra came into Sahir's life, Amrita found solace in the companionship of the renowned artist and writer Imroz. She spent the last forty years of her life with Imroz, who also designed most of her book covers and made her the subject of his several paintings. Their life together is also the subject of a book, \"Amrita Imroz: A Love Story\".\n\nShe died in her sleep on 31 October 2005 at the age of 86 in New Delhi, after a long illness. She was survived by her partner Imroz, daughter Kandala, son Navraj Kwatra, daughter-in-law Alka, and her grandchildren, Taurus, Noor, Aman and Shilpi. Navraj Kwatra was killed in 2012.\n\nIn 2007, an audio album titled, 'Amrita recited by Gulzar' was released by noted lyricist Gulzar, with poems of Amrita Pritam recited by him. A film on her life is also on the anvil.\n\nIn her career spanning over six decades, she penned 28 novels, 18 anthologies of prose, five short stories and 16 miscellaneous prose volumes.\n\n\nShort stories\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48557", "title": "Archbishop", "text": "Archbishop\n\nIn Christianity, an archbishop (, via Latin \"archiepiscopus\", from Greek , from -, 'chief', and , 'bishop') is a bishop of higher rank or office. In some cases, such as the Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Church of England, the title is borne by the leader of the denomination. Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests (also called presbyters), and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached.\n\nEpiscopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which one see's bishop has certain powers and duties of oversight over the others. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Rite metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\"sui iuris\") Eastern Catholic Churches are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.\n\nAs well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank. In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as Luxembourg or Monaco, too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province. In others, the title of archdiocese is for historical reasons attributed to a see that was once of greater importance.\n\nSome of these archdioceses are suffragans of a metropolitan archdiocese; examples are the Archdiocese of Avignon, which is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Marseille, and the Archdiocese of Trnava, Slovakia. Others are immediately subject to the Holy See and not to any metropolitan archdiocese. These are usually \"aggregated\" to an ecclesiastical province. An example is the Archdiocese of Hobart in Australia, with the Metropolitan ecclesiastical province of Melbourne, but not of it.\n\nThe ordinary of such an archdiocese is an archbishop; however, especially in the Anglican Communion, not all archbishops' dioceses are called archdioceses.\n\nUntil 1970, a coadjutor archbishop, one who has special faculties and the right to succeed to the leadership of a see on the death or resignation of the incumbent, was assigned also to a titular see, which he held until the moment of succession. Since then, the title of Coadjutor Archbishop of the see is considered sufficient and more appropriate.\n\nThe rank of archbishop is conferred on some bishops who are not ordinaries of an archdiocese. They hold the rank not because of the see that they head but because it has been granted to them personally (\"ad personam\"). Such a grant can be given when someone who already holds the rank of archbishop is transferred to a see that, though its present-day importance may be greater than the person's former see, is not archiepiscopal. The bishop transferred is then known as the Archbishop-Bishop of his new see. An example is Gianfranco Gardin, appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Treviso on 21 December 2009. The title borne by the successor of such an archbishop-bishop is merely that of Bishop of the see, unless he also is granted the personal title of Archbishop.\n\nThe distinction between metropolitan sees and non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees exists for titular sees as well as for residential ones. The \"Annuario Pontificio\" marks titular sees of the former class with the abbreviation \"Metr.\" and the others with \"Arciv.\"\n\nMany of the titular sees to which nuncios and heads of departments of the Roman Curia who are not cardinals are assigned are not of archiepiscopal rank. In that case the person who is appointed to such a position is given the personal title of archbishop (\"ad personam\"). They are usually referred to as Archbishop of the see, not as its Archbishop-Bishop.\n\nIf an archbishop resigns his see without being transferred to another, as in the case of retirement or assignment to head a department of the Roman Curia, the word \"emeritus\" is added to his former title, and he is called Archbishop Emeritus of his former see. Until 1970, such archbishops were transferred to a titular see.\n\nThere can be several Archbishops Emeriti of the same see: The 2008 \"Annuario Pontificio\" listed three living Archbishops Emeriti of Taipei.\n\nThere is no Archbishop Emeritus of a titular see: An archbishop who holds a titular see keeps it until death or until transferred to another see. \n\nIn the Anglican Communion, retired archbishops formally revert to being addressed as \"bishop\" and styled \"The Right Reverend\", although they may be appointed \"archbishop emeritus\" by their province on retirement, in which case they retain the title \"archbishop\" and the style \"The Most Reverend\", as a right. Archbishop Desmond Tutu is a prominent example, as Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town. Former archbishops who have not received the status of archbishop emeritus may still be informally addressed as \"archbishop\" as a courtesy, unless they are subsequently appointed to a bishopric (not an bishopric), in which case, the courtesy ceases.\n\nWhile there is no difference between the official dress of archbishops, as such, and that of other bishops, Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishops are distinguished by the use in liturgical ceremonies of the pallium, but only within the province over which they have oversight.\n\nRoman Catholic bishops and archbishops are styled \"The Most Reverend\" and addressed as \"Your Excellency\" in most cases. In English-speaking countries (except the United States), a Catholic archbishop is addressed as \"Your Grace\", while a Catholic bishop is addressed as \"Your Lordship\". Before December 12, 1930, the title \"Most Reverend\" was only for archbishops, while bishops were styled as \"Right Reverend\". This practice is still followed by Catholic bishops in the United Kingdom to mirror that of the Church of England.\n\nIn Roman Catholic heraldry, an archbishop has an ecclesiastical hat with ten tassels on each side of his coat of arms, while a bishop has only six. The archiepiscopal cross behind the shield has two bars instead of one. Such a cross may be borne before him in liturgical processions.\n\nIn processions and other occasions where strict protocol is observed, archbishops are ranked higher than diocesan bishops in the order of precedence.\n\nIn the Anglican Communion, archbishops are styled \"The Most Reverend\" and addressed as \"Your Grace\", while bishops are styled \"The Right Reverend\" and addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"Your Lordship\". (In some countries, this usage is followed also by the Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and \"The Most Reverend\" and \"Your Excellency\" are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an archiepiscopal processional cross (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions. The Archbishop of Canterbury's metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient primatial cross of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church of Greek tradition, the title of archbishop usually indicates some form of leadership of the other bishops of the local church (who may be metropolitans), as in the Church of Greece and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. In the Russian Orthodox tradition, metropolitans outrank archbishops.\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox custom generally agrees with the Slavic rather than the Greek with respect to the archbishop/metropolitan distinction.\n\nInstead of the term \"archbishop\", Eastern Catholic Churches sometimes use the word \"archeparch\" by analogy with \"eparch\", the term used for a diocesan (or eparchial) bishop. However, the word \"archeparch\" is not found in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.\n"}

Bava Pyara caves contains artworks of both Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nThese caves are arranged in three lines; the first line on the north facing southwards, the second line on the south from the east end of the first line and the third line runs back of the second line in west-north-west. The second line has primitive flat-roofed \"chaitya\" cave having simple cells on the either side of it with extra cells on the north and east of it.\n\nThe Bava Pyara caves were visited by James Burgess, an English archaeologist and founder of The Indian Antiquary. He concluded that they were affiliated with both Buddhism and Jainism. According to Burgess these caves were initially built for Buddhists bhikkhus and were in a later period occupied by Jain ascetics. He was not certain about the exact age of the ancient caves. One fragmentary inscription was found in Bava Pyara cave that affirms its affiliation to Jainism, because one term in that inscription is exclusively used by Jains. The inscription was read as \"केवलज्ञान संप्राप्तानां जीतजरामरणानां \".\n\nThe term \"kevalgyan\" was used exclusively by Jains. Scholar H. D. Sankalia attributes these caves to Jainism because of some auspicious symbols typical of Jainism that are depicted above the door's frame. Sankalia recorded about eleven auspicious symbols, \"Nandhyavarta\", \"Swastika\", \"Darpan\", \"Bhadrasana\", \"Meen Yugal\" and \"Purna Ghata\". Such symbols were also found on Ayagpattas from Kankali Teela Mathura. About five such symbols are found in another cave of Bava pyara Caves.

On a small entrance of one of the caves in the second row at the south end are two symbols depicting Vyala figures. Burgess and Sanklia failed to notice them. According to Madhusudan Dhaky, on the basis of the Vyala figure, the Bava pyara cave is from the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Sankalia claimed that the Chaityagruh containing cave should be at least from the 2nd century BC, and caves with symbols carving should be hailed from 2nd or 3rd century AD.\n\n"}

According to the synoptic Gospels, Jesus emphasized the permanence of marriage, (see Mark 10 at verses 1 to 9, Matthew 19; Luke 16 v. 18) but also its integrity. In the book of Matthew Jesus says \"Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery\". \n\nBoth in the Gospel of Matthew and of Mark, Jesus remembers and quotes Genesis 1:27 (\"male and female created He them\"), and Genesis 2:24 (\"shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twaine shall be one flesh.\").\nPaul the Apostle concurred but added an exception, known as the Pauline privilege. \n\nThe Catholic Church prohibits divorce, and permits annulment (a finding that the marriage was like it has been never celebrated and so was never valid) under a narrow set of circumstances. The Eastern Orthodox Church permits divorce and remarriage in church in certain circumstances, though its rules are generally more restrictive than the civil divorce rules of most countries. Most Protestant churches discourage divorce except as a last resort, but do not actually prohibit it through church doctrine.\n\nThe Christian emperors Constantine and Theodosius restricted the grounds for divorce to grave cause, but this was relaxed by Justinian in the 6th century. After the fall of the empire, familial life was regulated more by ecclesiastical authority than civil authority.\n\nAlthough marriage was not yet a declared, defined sacrament, by the ninth or tenth century, the divorce rate had been greatly reduced under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which considered marriage to be instituted by God and Christ indissoluble by mere human action. Marriage was later defined as a sacrament, beginning in 1208, when Pope Innocent III required members of another religious movement to recognize that marriage was a sacrament as a condition for being received back into the Catholic Church. In 1254, Catholics accused Waldensians of condemning the sacrament of marriage, \"saying that married persons sin mortally if they come together without the hope of offspring\". In 1439 the Council of Florence defined marriage as a sacrament, solidifying the development of doctrine from the previous twelve centuries and described marriage as 'indisoluble' \"since it signifies the indivisible union of Christ and the church.\" The passage follows, \"Although the separation of bed is lawful on account of fornication, it is not lawful to contract another marriage since the bond of a legitimately contracted marriage is perpetual.\"\n\nAlthough divorce, as known today, was generally allowed in Western Europe after the 10th century, separation of husband and wife and the annulment of marriage were also well-known. What is today referred to as “separate maintenance” (or \"legal separation\") was termed \"divorce a mensa et thoro\" (\"divorce from bed-and-board\"). The husband and wife physically separated and were forbidden to live or cohabit together; but their marital relationship did not fully terminate. Civil courts had no power over marriage or divorce.\n\nThe Catholic Church historically opposed the legalization of civil divorce in Catholic countries. For example, when Republican Spain legalized divorce in Spain for the first time, Pope Pius XI wrote: 'the new Spanish legislation, with the deleterious introduction of divorce, dares to profane the sanctuary of the family, thus implanting, with the attempted dissolution of domestic society, the germs of saddest ruin for civil well-being.'\n\nCanon law makes no provision for divorce, but a declaration of nullity may be granted when proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent — ie., that the sacrament did not take place due to some impediment. The grounds for annulment are determined by Church authority and applied in ecclesiastical courts. Annulment was known as “divorce a vinculo matrimonii,” or “divorce from all the bonds of marriage,” for canonical causes of impediment existing at the time of the marriage. “For in cases of total divorce, the marriage is declared null, as having been absolutely unlawful \"ab initio\".” The Church holds that the sacrament of marriage produces one person from two, inseparable from each other: \"Holy Scripture affirms that man and woman were created for one another: 'It is not good that the man should be alone.' The woman, 'flesh of his flesh,' his equal, his nearest in all things, is given to him by God as a 'helpmate'; she thus represents God from whom comes our help. 'Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.' The Lord himself shows that this signifies an unbreakable union of their two lives by recalling what the plan of the Creator had been 'in the beginning': 'So they are no longer two, but one flesh.'\" Since husband and wife became one person upon marriage, that oneness can only be seen as null if the parties improperly entered into the marriage initially, in which case the marriage does not validly exist.\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis published \"Amoris laetitia\". However, there have been no updates to Roman Catholic Canon Law as a result of this apostolic exhortation that pertain to the reception of Holy Communion by the divorced and remarried who live together \"more uxorio\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church does recognize that there are occasions when it is better that couples do separate, and permits remarriage in Church, though its divorce rules are stricter than civil divorce in most countries. For the Eastern Orthodox, the marriage is \"indissoluble\" as in it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offence resulted from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man. A very low rate of divorce among Orthodox Christians in Greece may suggest that the same may be said for Orthodox Christians in the U.S. However, U.S. rates are inconclusive. The actual divorce rate is probably somewhat higher due to civil divorces obtained without an accompanying ecclesiastical divorce. Divorced individuals are usually allowed to remarry though there is usually imposed on them a penance by their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more penitential than joyful. The Orthodox Church traditionally states that \"it blesses the first marriage, performs the second, tolerates the third, and forbids the fourth\". Widowed spouses are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as blessed as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is expected that his widow will not remarry. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry and frequently end up in monasteries.\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox Churches are more severe than the Eastern Orthodox Church in terms of divorce and adopt an intermediate position between Rome and Constantinople, allowing it only in the case of adultery. This position is true for both Copts and Armenians.\n\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF), which is a secondary standard of the Presbyterian Church, allows for divorce under certain circumstances. In chapter 24, section 5, it states that the contract of marriage may be dissolved in the case of adultery or abandonment, citing Matthew 5.31 as proof.\n\nThe Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:\nMany conservative evangelical and Protestant churches, such as some Baptists, strongly oppose divorce, viewing it as a sin, pointing out Malachi 2:16 – For I hate divorce,' says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'and him who covers his garment with violence!' says Yahweh of Armies. 'Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don't deal treacherously (WEB). However interfaith marriages are handled differently in Ezra 9–10 and 1 Corinthians 7 (the Pauline privilege). Protestant scholar Bill Heth states that this is the majority view.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) officially discourages divorce. The LDS Church encourages its members to work around marital problems before they lead to annulment or divorce, yet allows both practices in circumstances of infidelity or other serious cases. Divorce is regarded with heavy social stigma, and Church authorities maintain that “Latter-day Saints need not divorce—there are solutions to marriage problems.” LDS Church policy allows members to seek civil divorce independent of ecclesiastical authority, but cancellation of a temple sealing may only be performed with special permission from the First Presidency of the Church. \n\nThe LDS Church discourages divorce largely on account of its theology of the family. Early church leaders taught that God himself lives in a family and with a wife. Tim B. Heaton, a sociologist from Brigham Young University, explains, “The key tenet in the Mormon Theology of the family is that, given the proper circumstances, family relationships will be perpetuated in heaven.”\n\nLatter-day Saint culture places an extreme emphasis on success in family life, leading to high expectations for marital success. David O. McKay, former President of the Church, stated that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home.” Church publications often publish articles instructing members on means to improve married life, and, on rare occasions, will become involved politically when it feels the institution of marriage is threatened by proposed public policy. General Authority of the Church have repeatedly warned against an impermanent view of marriage. \"[The view of marriage] as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure … and severed at the first difficulty … is an evil meriting severe condemnation, especially where children are made to suffer.\" In 2007 Dallin H. Oaks, a senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and a former judge on the Utah Supreme Court, has counseled church members that \"the weakening of the concept that marriages are permanent and precious has far-reaching consequences.\" \n\nLatter-day Saint couples (both with and without temple sealings) are found to have slightly lower rates of divorce when compared with Protestants and Catholics, and significantly lower rates when compared with those who state no religious preference. The following is a chart showing the rate of divorce among various religions with data copied from the study “Religion and Family Formation,” conducted by Tim B. Heaton and Kristen L. Goodman. \nA lower divorce rate among Latter-day Saints may be due to a strong family culture, the difficulty of securing a cancellation of sealing, and other religious influences. Al Thornton, from the University of Michigan, comments that, \"With its unique theology and heritage concerning marriage, family, and children, it should not be surprising to find that Mormon behavior differs from that of the larger society.\" Certain doctrines which are unique to Latter-Day Saint theology may help account for the lower divorce rate among active members. These doctrines include the literal parenthood of God the Father, the eternal nature of families, and the requirement of a successful temple marriage in order to gain salvation. For Latter-day Saints, divorce is \"a very serious undertaking\", both socially and religiously.\n\nVarious factors have been shown to lower incidence of divorce among church members, including church activity. Heaton says that, “Overall, church attendance is associated with lower rates of nonmarriage and divorce, [and] higher probabilities of remarriage after divorce.” Studies suggest that the most important statistical variable affecting marital dissolution rates of Latter-day Saints is marriage in the temple, with some studies finding that non-temple marriages entered into by Latter-day Saints are almost five times more likely to result in divorce than are temple marriages. \n\nThe Encyclopedia of Mormonism states that “[t]he Church distinguishes between (1) civil marriages, which are valid for \"time\" (until divorce or the death of one spouse), and (2) temple marriages, or sealings, solemnized by proper ecclesiastical authority, which are binding for \"time and all eternity.\" In order for a marriage to be considered eternally binding, it must be performed in a Latter-Day Saint temple by properly authorized temple workers. Marriage in the temple is strongly encouraged by church leaders, as Latter-day Saint marriages performed in the temple have less than a 7% chance of dissolution.\n\nThere is some debate over the validity of these figures. The LDS Church itself notes that \"In reporting their findings, the two researchers noted that if there were some measure of religious commitment comparable to temple marriage among other religions, statistics for those groups might also be more favorable.\" The accuracy of this statistic is also disputed on the grounds that the process required to obtain a temple recommend artificially limits the test group to those who are already less likely to divorce. For example, the temple recommend requires Church members to abstain from pre-marital sex, a behavior associated with a higher divorce rate. This statistic also fails to take into account couples who enter into a temple marriage and subsequently obtain a civil divorce, yet fail to apply for a cancellation of temple sealings. Nevertheless, numerous studies show a strong link in the Latter-day Saint culture between marriage in the temple and a lower divorce rate, and that among members \"the temple marriage [is] the most resistant to divorce.\" \n\nIn order to obtain a cancellation of temple sealings, permission from the First Presidency is required. Applicants for divorce are required to submit a request for a cancellation of sealings through their local ecclesiastical authorities, including information about the couple, and a personal appeal. The resulting cultural impact of a divorce upon an LDS couple is significant. Church leaders have stated that “every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or both,” and that selfishness is a leading cause of marital stress and divorce. Divorced Latter-day Saints may report feelings of alienation from fellow church-members and some Latter-day Saints may see divorce as “a sign of failure”.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31555063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31555063", "title": "Devasthanam", "text": "Devasthanam\n\nThe Devasthanam means Abode of Devas. Devas are generally Hindu deities. Thus a Devasthanam can be commonly termed as a Hindu temple, which is the place dedicated to the worship of Hindu deities. In these places of worship offerings are made to the worshiping idol, rituals are performed and there will be a priest who maintains and operates the smooth functioning of the temple. The underlying spiritual principles in Hindu temples are taken from old Sanskrit Vedas, Upanishads and the structural principles are taken from Sanskrit literature like Brihat Samhitha, Vasthu Sasthras etc. In Indian context a Devasthanam is referred to as the place in which Hindu Gods and Goddesses resides. Devasthanams were built in India as a dedication to the Gods who once lived there. Devasthanams welcome devotees and aids them obtaining a hopeful and successful life.\n\nThe famous Devasthanams in India are located to the southern part of the country and are situated in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu and Kerala. The renowned Devasthanam in India is Thirumala Thirupati Devasthanam which is dedicated to Lord Vishnu who lived there as Lord Srinivasa and later married Lady Padmavati. Another popular Devasthanam located in the state of Tamilnadu is the Palani Dandayudhapani Swamy Devasthanam. It is one of the richest temples in India. This Devasthanam is considered to be one of the Abodes of Lord Muruga. Kerala, God’s own country is famous for upholding religious and cultural values. There are lots of Devasthanams in Kerala. Peringottukara Devasthanam is the most famous Devasthanams among the many Abode of Devas in Kerala,Peringottukara Devasthanam is the oldest Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan Devasthanam in India. \nThe Vaishnava temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The Devasthanam lies in the Thirumala hills of Andhra Pradesh. The legend says, once Sage Brighu wanted to find out who is the Supreme one among the Trimurtis (Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Siva). The Sage was not satisfied with the hospitality given by Lord Brahma and Lord Siva; the sage went to Vaikunta (residing place of Lord Vishnu) and kicked Lord Vishnu on the chest to grab his attention. It is believed that Lady Lakshmi was residing in the chest of the Lord Vishnu. The act of Sage Bhrigu insulted Lady Lakshmi and she left Vaikunta to the earth. Lord Vishnu came to the earth in search of her who had taken birth in the family of a king in the name Padmavati and married her on the Tirupati hills and got enshrined there forever to save the people.\n\nFrom history it is evident that the construction of Tirupati temple began in AD 300. The golden period of the temple was the reigning period of Vijayanagara rules that filled the treasury of the temple with gold and diamonds. The Tirupati temple operations are now managed now by a trust called Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. The temple is the richest temple in India and each day thousands of devotees seek blessings from lord Venkateshwara. \nThe idol worshiped in the Palani temple is Lord Muruga, son of Lord Siva and Lady Parvathy. The Devasthanam is located in the town of Palani in Dindigul District in the state of Tamilnadu. The temple legend says, Lord Muruga was defeated by his brother Lord Ganesha in contest given by their father Lord Siva. Feeling irritated Lord Muruga left his parents and came to Tiru Avinankudi which means the foot of the Sivagiri. Siva appeased the situation by telling Lord Muruga that he (Lord Muruga) himself was the fruit (Pazham). Hence the place was called Pazham-nee (You are the fruit) or Palani. Lord Muruga later settled in Palani as a hermit in peace and solitude. Lord Muruga, thus became Lord Dandayudhapani, who stands for repudiation by ditching all worldly possessions in order to save his subjects.\n\nThe temple was believed to be constructed by a Chera King called Cheraman Perumal. Later on Kings from different dynasties contributed to the growth of the temple of Lord Dandayudhapani. The edicts on the walls of the Palani temple stand as proof of the gifts for conducting poojas and constructions made by several Kings. The temple now stands as a proud example of the cultural and religious beauty of India. Tonsuring of devotees is a famous tradition.\n\nThe Peringottukara Devasthanam is known for its deity Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan. It is situated in the state of Kerala in a place called Peringottukara, Thrissur. Peringottukara village is blessed by the divine presence of famous social reformer and preacher of spiritual freedom and social equality Sree Narayana Guru. Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan is the son of Lord Siva and Lady Parvathy who disguised herself as a tribal woman Koolivaka. The Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan shunned all her heavenly possessions and lived with the common folks. Legends say, Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan had killed demons like Bhringa and Jalandhara. Peringottukara Devasthanam has a tradition of 5 centuries in Kuttichathan Seva.\n\nLater the founder priest of the Devasthanam Sree Velumuthappan Swamy to pacify the land prayed to the Goddess of the entire world, Lady Bhuvaneshwary who in turn asked the founder priest to build a temple for Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan. The shrine built by Sree Velumuthappan Swamy is now worshipped by thousands as Peringottukara Devasthanam. The Devasthanam is famous for its 51 feet height terracotta Stupa of Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan. Maharoopakalam is the famous festival in Perigottukara Devasthanam.\n"}
{"id": "10067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10067", "title": "Episcopal polity", "text": "Episcopal polity\n\nAn episcopal polity is a hierarchical form of church governance (\"ecclesiastical polity\") in which the chief local authorities are called bishops. (The word \"bishop\" derives, via the British Latin and Vulgar Latin term \"*ebiscopus\"/\"*biscopus\", from the Ancient Greek \"epískopos\" meaning \"overseer\".) It is the structure used by many of the major Christian Churches and denominations, such as the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anglican, and Lutheran churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages.\n\nChurches with an episcopal polity are governed by bishops, practicing their authorities in the dioceses and conferences or synods. Their leadership is both sacramental and constitutional; as well as performing ordinations, confirmations, and consecrations, the bishop supervises the clergy within a local jurisdiction and is the representative both to secular structures and within the hierarchy of the church. Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal apostolic succession from the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the historical episcopate or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see 1 Timothy 3 and 2 Timothy 1). In some systems, bishops may be subject to bishops holding a higher office (variously called archbishops, metropolitans, or patriarchs, depending upon the tradition). They also meet in councils or synods. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the synod or council may also be purely advisory.\n\nFor much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Roman Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther.\n\nThe definition of the word \"episcopal\" has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in ecclesiology, that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, \"episcopal churches\" are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops that regard themselves as being in an unbroken, personal apostolic succession.\n\n\"Episcopal\" is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of denominations. For instance, \"Presbyterian\" (, presbítes) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected elders, referred to as Presbyterian polity. Similarly, \"episcopal\" is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as \"congregational\".\n\nMore specifically, the capitalized appellation \"Episcopal\" is applied to several churches historically based within Anglicanism (\"Episcopalianism\"), including those still in communion with the Church of England.\n\nUsing these definitions, examples of specific episcopal churches include:\n\nSome Lutheran churches practice congregational polity or a form of presbyterian polity. Others, including the Church of Sweden, practice episcopal polity; the Church of Sweden also counts its bishops among the historic episcopate as do some American Lutheran churches like the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, Lutheran Orthodox Church, Lutheran Church - International, and the Lutheran Episcopal Communion.\n\nMany Methodist churches (see The United Methodist Church, among others) retain the form and function of episcopal polity, although in a modified form, called connexionalism. Since all trace their ordinations to an Anglican priest, John Wesley, it is generally considered that their bishops do not share in apostolic succession, though United Methodists still affirm that their bishops share in the historic episcopate.\n\nAll orthodox Christians were in churches with an episcopal government, that is, one Church under local bishops and regional Patriarchs. Writing between ca. 85 and 110, St. Ignatius of Antioch, Patriarch of Antioch, was the earliest of the Church fathers to define the importance of episcopal government. Assuming Ignatius' view was the Apostolic teaching and practice, the line of succession was unbroken and passed through the four ancient Patriarchal sees (those local churches known to be founded by apostles), Rome, Jerusalem, Antioch and Alexandria. Rome was the leading Patriarchate of the ancient four by virtue of its founding by Saints Peter and Paul and their martyrdom there, not to mention being the political center of the Roman empire at the time. Some organizations (e.g. the Assyrian Church of the East), though aloof from the political wranglings of imperial Christianity, nevertheless also practiced episcopal polity.\n\nShortly after the Roman Emperor Constantine I legalized Christianity in 321, he also constructed an elaborate second capital of the Roman Empire located at Byzantium and renamed it Constantinople, in 324. The single Roman Empire was divided between these two autonomous administrative centers, Roman and Constantinopolitan, West and East, Latin speaking and Greek speaking. This remained the status quo through the fourth century. A deep chasm developed between the East and West, becoming critical around 350, known as the Arian, or Nicene controversy. The Eastern Christian Churches were thought by Constantine to believe against the Trinity; that Christ was lesser than God. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers, France, believed that the Eastern Church should be given the opportunity to, at least, be educated on the subject. Constantine, in his wisdom, and upset by disagreement, banished Hilary to the East. Hilary perfected his Greek language skills while in exile, and determined the great divide between Rome and the East was actually not a disagreement at all, and was merely a linguistic ignorance on the part of his Latin speaking contemporaries. This truth became known in the West, though some differences lingered. Hilary of Poitiers later became St. Hilary, Doctor of the Church, for exposing the true Christian beliefs of the Eastern Church. Many of Hilary's writings were lost to time.\n\nIn the fifth century, Pope Dioscorus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, rejected certain Christological dogmas promulgated by the Council of Chalcedon, and as a result, the Oriental Orthodox churches split from the rest; however they continued the episcopal tradition, and today in fact there is dialog between the various orthodox churches over whether the schism was due to real differences or simply translation failures. \n\nAlso during the fifth century, the Western Roman Empire declined and was overrun by German and Frankish peoples. Although the city of Rome was in ruins, distant from the seat of secular power, and constantly harassed by invaders, the Roman Patriarchate remained the center of the Western or Latin Church. Claiming the ancient primacy of Peter and the title of \"Apostolic See\", it remained the last court of episcopal appeal in serious matters for the whole Church, East and West. However, the center of the civilized Roman world had shifted definitively to Constantinople, or New Rome, the capital of the Greek speaking Empire. Along with this shift, the effective administration of the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire also shifted. This practical eminence of Constantinople in the East is evident, first at the First Council of Constantinople 381, and then ecumenically at the Council of Chalcedon in 451.\n\nBeginning with John the Faster (John IV, 582-595), the Bishop of Constantinople adopted as a formal title for himself the by then customary honorific Ecumenical Patriarch (\"pre-eminent father for the civilized world\") over the strong objections of Rome, a title based on the political prestige of Constantinople and its economic and cultural centrality in the Empire. In the following years, Rome's appeals to the East were based on the unique authority of the Apostolic See and the primacy of Peter, over the powers of councils as defended by the East (councils, for example, had endorsed that lofty title which Rome contested).\n\nThe sometimes subtle differences between Eastern and Western conceptions of authority and its exercise produced a gradually widening rift between the Churches which continued with some occasional relief throughout the following centuries until the final rupture of the Great Schism (marked by two dates: 16 July 1054 and the Council of Florence in 1439).\n\nThe Catholic Church has an episcopate, with the Pope, who is the Bishop of Rome, at the top. The Catholic Church considers that juridical oversight over the Church is not a power that derives from human beings, but strictly from the authority of Christ, which was given to his twelve apostles. The See of Rome, as the unbroken line of apostolic authority descending from St. Peter (the \"prince and head of the apostles\"), is a visible sign and instrument of communion among the college of bishops and therefore also of the local churches around the world. In communion with the worldwide college of bishops, the Pope has all legitimate juridical and teaching authority over the whole Church. This authority given by Christ to St. Peter and the apostles is transmitted from one generation to the next by the power of the Holy Spirit, through the laying on of hands from the Apostles to the bishops, in unbroken succession.\n\nThe conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all autocephalous primates are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth, in a model called \"conciliar hierarchy\". This is based in part on the vision in the book of Revelation of the 24 elders gathered around the throne of Christ, who are believed to represent the 12 patriarchs of Israel and the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ. There is no single Patriarch with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the \"primus inter pares\", the \"first among equals\" of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox Churches affirm the ideas of apostolic succession and episcopal government. Within each national Church, the bishops form a holy synod to which even the Patriarch is subject. The Syriac Orthodox Church traces its apostolic succession to St. Peter and recognises Antioch as the original See of St. Peter. The Armenian Apostolic Church traces its lineage to the Apostle Bartholomew. The Indian Orthodox Church traces its lineage to the Apostle Thomas. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church received its lines of succession through the Coptic Orthodox Church in the fifth century.\n\nBoth the Greek and Coptic Orthodox Churches each recognise their own Pope of Alexandria (Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa, and Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria respectively), both of whom trace their apostolic succession back to the Mark the Evangelist. There are official ongoing efforts in recent times to heal this ancient breach. Already, the two recognize each other's baptisms, chrismations, and marriages, making intermarriage much easier.\n\nHistorically, the Church of the East has traced its episcopal succession to St. Thomas the Apostle. Currently the bishops of the Assyrian Church of the East continue to maintain its apostolic succession.\n\nAnglicanism is the most prominent of the Reformation traditions to lay claim to the historic episcopate through apostolic succession in terms comparable to the various Roman Catholic and Orthodox Communions. Anglicans assert unbroken episcopal succession in and through the Church of England back to St. Augustine of Canterbury and to the first century Roman province of Britannia. While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the Synod of Whitby, the church in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.\n\nThe legislation of Henry VIII effectively establishing the independence from Rome of the Church of England, did not alter its constitutional or pastoral structures. Royal supremacy was exercised through the extant legal structures of the church, whose leaders were bishops. Episcopacy was thus seen as a given of the Reformed \"Ecclesia Anglicana\", and a foundation in the institution's appeal to ancient and apostolic legitimacy. What did change was that bishops were now seen to be ministers of the Crown for the spiritual government of its subjects. The influence of Richard Hooker was crucial to an evolution in this understanding in which bishops came to be seen in their more traditional role as ones who delegate to the presbyterate inherited powers, act as pastors to presbyters, and holding a particular teaching office with respect to the wider church.\nAnglican opinion has differed as to the way in which episcopal government is \"de jure divino\" (by the Divine Right of Kings). On the one hand, the seventeenth century divine, John Cosin, held that episcopal authority is \"jure divino\", but that it stemmed from \"apostolic practice and the customs of the Church...[not] absolute precept that either Christ or His Apostles gave about it\" (a view maintained also by Hooker). In contrast, Lancelot Andrewes and others held that episcopal government is derived from Christ via the apostles. Regardless, both parties viewed the episcopacy as bearing the apostolic function of oversight, which both includes, and derives from the power of ordination, and is normative for the governance of the church. The practice of apostolic succession both ensures the legitimacy of the church's mission and establishes the unity, communion, and continuity of the local church with the universal church. This formulation, in turn, laid the groundwork for an independent view of the church as a \"sacred society\" distinct from civil society, which was so crucial for the development of local churches as non-established entities outside England, and gave direct rise to the Catholic Revival and disestablishmentarianism within England.\n\nFunctionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed synodically, although individual provinces may accord their primate with more or less authority to act independently. Called variously \"synods,\" \"councils,\" or \"conventions,\" they meet under episcopal chairmanship. In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force. Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of \"the bishop-in-synod\" as the force and authority of episcopal governance. Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, discipline, and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism's tradition of the limits of authority. Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the Council of Trent was drawing to a close), which held that \"General Councils...may err, and sometimes have erred...wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.\" Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see lex orandi, lex credendi).\n\nAnglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the Anglican Communion, their ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the presbyterate and laity. The spread of increasingly democratic forms of representative governance has its origin in the formation of the first General Conventions of the American Episcopal Church in the 1780s, which established a \"House of Bishops\" and a \"House of Deputies\". In many jurisdictions, there is also a third, clerical House. Resolutions may be voted on jointly or by each House, in the latter case requiring passage in all Houses to be adopted by the particular council.\n\nThere is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the See of Canterbury, along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions are to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions—not direction. The Conferences also express the function of the episcopate to demonstrate the ecumenical and Catholic nature of the church.\n\nThe Scottish Episcopal Church traces its history back to the origins of Christianity in Scotland, and during the 16th century Scottish Reformation became a distinct church from the presbyterian Church of Scotland which rejected episcopal government. The Scottish Episcopal Church was formally incorporated in 1712, and it more recently became part of the Anglican Communion.\n\nChurches that are members of the Anglican Communion are episcopal churches in polity, and some are named \"Episcopal\". However, some churches that self-identify as Anglican do not belong to the Anglican Communion, and not all episcopally-governed churches are Anglican. The Roman Catholic Church, the Old Catholic Churches (in full communion with, but not members of, the Anglican Communion), and the Eastern Orthodox churches are recognized, and also their bishops, by Anglicans.\n\nAs an offshoot of Anglicanism, Methodist churches often use episcopal polity for historical as well as practical reasons, albeit to limited use. Methodists often use the term \"connexionalism\" or \"connexional polity\" in addition to \"episcopal\". Nevertheless, the powers of the Methodist episcopacy can be relatively strong and wide-reaching compared to traditional conceptions of episcopal polity. For example, in the United Methodist Church, bishops are elected for life, can serve up to two terms in a specific conference (three if special permission is given), are responsible for ordaining and appointing clergy to pastor churches, perform many administrative duties, preside at the annual sessions of the regional Conferences and at the quadrennial meeting of the worldwide General Conference, have authority for teaching and leading the church on matters of social and doctrinal import, and serve to represent the denomination in ecumenical gatherings. United Methodist bishops in the United States serve in their appointed conferences, being moved to a new \"Episcopal Area\" after 8 (or 12) years, until their mandated retirement at the end of the quadrenium following their sixty-sixth birthday.\nBritish Methodism holds that all ordained ministers are equal in terms of spirituality. However, for practical management lines are drawn into President of Conference, Chair of District, Superintendent Minister, Minister. However, all are ministers.\n\nThe Reformed Church of Hungary, and the Lutheran churches in continental Europe may sometimes be called \"episcopal\". In these latter cases, the form of government is not radically different from the presbyterian form, except that their councils of bishops have hierarchical jurisdiction over the local ruling bodies to a greater extent than in most Presbyterian and other Reformed churches. As mentioned, the Lutheran Church in Sweden and Finland are exceptions, claiming apostolic succession in a pattern somewhat like the Anglican churches. Otherwise, forms of polity are not mandated in the Lutheran churches, as it is not regarded as having doctrinal significance. Old World Lutheranism, for historical reasons, has tended to adopt Erastian theories of episcopal authority (by which church authority is to a limited extent sanctioned by secular government). In the United States, the Lutheran churches tend to adopt a form of government more comparable to congregationalism. A small minority of Episcopal Baptists exists. \n\nMost Anabaptist churches of the plain dress tradition follow an episcopal system, at least in name. Congregational governance is strongly emphasized, and each congregation elects its pastor. Bishops enforce inter-congregational unity and may discipline pastors for breaking from traditional norms.\n\nAlthough it never uses the term, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is episcopal, rather than presbyterian or congregational, in the sense that it has a strict hierarchy of leadership from the local bishop/branch president up to a single prophet/president, believed to be personally authorized and guided by Jesus Christ. Local congregations (branches, wards, and stakes) have \"de jure\" boundaries by which members are allocated, and membership records are centralized. This system developed gradually from a more presbyterian polity (Joseph Smith's original title in 1830 was \"First Elder\") for pragmatic and doctrinal reasons, reaching a full episcopacy during the Nauvoo period (1839–1846).\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1889. The total population of the community is estimated to be between 10–15 million, with main concentrations in South Asia. For a history timeline see Timeline of Ahmadiyya history.\n\nAfter he rose to fame by debating with Hindu and Christian priesthood. He was revealed to take the covenant. The first one was Hakeem Noor-ud-Din who became the first Caliph of the community. On this day, 40 followers had taken the covenant.\n\nAfter the taking of covenant, a meal was eaten and a prayer was held by all of the companions of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. It was the first gathering of the community.\n\nMirza Ghulam Ahmad had travelled in India and the number of Ahmadis increased.\n\nWhen Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to be the Promised Messiah for whom the Muslims were waiting, Maulvi Muhammad Hussein of Batala, who was his colleague was the first one to reject him. After his claim, he and his followers were the subject of the Muslim majority in India. The persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community started from that day.\n\nHussein indulged other clerics to prepare a fatwa against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his followers. A Fatwa of 150 or 250 pages were prepared by him which contained fatwas from all of the Islamic clerics from all of India.\n\nThe split in 1914 resulted in the formation of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, also known as Anjuman Isha`at-e-Islam. The primary reason for the split was differences over the suitability of the elected Khalifa (2nd successor) Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad (the son of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) and also ideological differences on key theological issues.\n\nThe key ideological differences leading to the split pertained to the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad being a prophet or simply a mujadid, and the status of Muslims not accepting Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claims.\n\nThe Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement believes Muhammad to be the last of the prophets, and that after him no prophet can appear—neither a past one like Jesus, nor a new one. They believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is referred to as a Prophet in the metaphorical sense only (as other saints have been referred to as well), and not in the real and technical meaning of the word as used in Islamic terminology. In contrast, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community hold that Muhammad was the last law-bearing prophet and new non-law bearing prophets can come after him. They hold Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a Prophet (with all the qualities of a prophet like Jesus) but subordinate and deputy to Muhammad.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has established centres in 200 countries and states that its membership is in the tens of millions, while the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement states it is established in 17 countries of the world.\n\nThe larger body of Ahmadi Muslims belonging in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community however contend that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad himself received a revelation by God concerning a future split in his Community and that it would be concerning his Promised Son:\n"}

Jezrel had published three books known as \"Extracts from the Flying Roll\". While the preachers were in Richmond, Benjamin and Mary joined their group, known as \"the Visitation Movement\", which was started by a woman named Joanna Southcott, the First Messenger (Angel), in 1792. While studying the writings of Jezreel they noticed that the Seventh and last Messenger was soon to be on the scene, which is mentioned in Revelation 10:7. On March 12, 1895, the Purnells announced that the spirit of Shiloh had bonded with them to become the seventh and last messenger.\n\nThe House of David was formed by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in 1903 after settling in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Prior to that, the Purnells lived in Fostoria, Ohio and had two children, one of whom died in a firework factory explosion at the age of 17. The Purnells were looked down upon by residents of the city when they decided to forego the funeral due to their beliefs of not having anything to do with the dead. \n\nThe House of David colony soon had several hundred members. In 1907, the House owned about 1,000 acres, on which the colony harvested fruit from a dozen orchards and cultivated grain. The commune had its own cannery, carpenter shop, coach factory, tailor shop, and steam laundry. They also owned and operated their own electricity plant, providing lighting to the community. It had three brass bands and two orchestras, and a zoological garden.\n\nAccusations arose in the 1920s towards Benjamin F. Purnell by 13 young women confessing, under oath to the courts, that they had sexual relations with the patriarch while still minors. As soon as this became public knowledge, the \"Detroit Free Press\" and other newspapers ran critical articles about Purnell. He died in 1927.\n\nOne group, headed by Mary Purnell, remained together and in 1930 purchased a small plot of land. There they rebuilt and reorganized the New Israelite House of David, better known as Mary's City of David; it remained in existence until her death at the age of 90.\n\nA second faction, the Old House of David led by Judge T. H. Dewhirst, had 350 members in 1935, 24 of whom were clergy, and in 1955 had 150 members with 10 clergy. (As of 2010, the group was reported to have three surviving members.) Dewhirst's faction believed that Mary Purnell had no right to usurp authority over the community, as it was led by his own self-appointed council of elders.\n\nPurnell was a sports enthusiast and encouraged the members of the Israelite Community to play sports, especially baseball, to build physical and spiritual discipline.\n\nIn 1913, the Israelite House of David began to play competitive baseball and by 1915, they were following a grueling schedule. The House of David became famous as a barnstorming baseball team which toured rural America from the 1920s through the 1950s, playing amateur and semi-pro teams in exhibition games. They were motivated by the need to make money for their families and colony back home and by the opportunity to share their beliefs. The team members wore long hair and beards as they played.\n\nBy the late 1920s, needing more skilled players, the House began hiring professionals, the most notable being Grover Cleveland Alexander, Satchel Paige, and Mordecai Brown. Some professional players grew their beards out to show respect towards the God of Israel, while others wore false beards. They were known for their skill and played against some of the greatest teams in the country. The House of David played against Major League, Minor League, independent and Negro League teams, with all the same spirit of competition and fair play. At one point, the community had three separate barnstorming teams touring the country, playing and evangelizing wherever they went. The House of David teams were famous for inventing \"pepper\" baseball tricks, along the lines of the fancy basketball moves of the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nThe House of David continued to sponsor barnstorming teams well into the 1930s and then sponsored weekend semi-professional teams until the 1940s. Mary's City of David sent out barnstorming teams from 1930 until 1940 and then again from 1946 until 1955. Throughout this period, there were numerous teams which bore the House of David name and wore beards. The most famous was probably the Black House of David, an all African-American \"Barn-storming\" team that played solely against teams of the Negro Leagues.\n\nThe House of David was the inspiration behind the James Sturm graphic novel, \"The Golem's Mighty Swing\" (in which the team was called the \"Stars of David\") as well as Harry Turtledove's fantasy novel \"The House of Daniel\". The House of David was also featured in a segment of Ken Burns' \"Baseball\" and in the movie \"The Winning Team\" (1952) about the life of pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander.\n\nA vintage base ball club (the \"House of David Echoes BBC\") has been honoring the legacy of the House of David teams since 2001, playing vintage base ball under the 1858 rules while growing their beards and playing at historic Eastman Field near Benton Harbor, Michigan. For the 2016 season, the Echoes moved to the original 1914 baseball field at Eden Springs Park, and will continue to use the field for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe organization also fielded nationally known musical bands between 1906 and 1927. These bands toured the country almost non-stop on the three top vaudeville circuits: the Pantages, the Keith and the Orpheum.\n\nThe House of David operated a world-famous zoo and amusement park in Benton Harbor, Michigan. It also established \"The Springs of Eden Park\" which became a popular Michigan vacation spot in the 1930s. A revamped version opened in late 2011, making it - as of 2015 - one of only a few known American amusement parks to have been successfully reopened.\n\nOne of the main attractions at The Springs of Eden Park was the coal powered miniature locomotives, purchased in 1908. Members of the commune originally observed similar locomotives at the 1904 Worlds Fair in St. Louis. The trains were used to carry people to the amusement park from the main entrance to the commune on Britain Avenue. Additional amusement at the park included miniature racing cars, restaurant, penny arcade, pony rides, and dances and shows at the amphitheater. \n\nThe park closed in the 1970s and the land lay fallow. In 2000, one of the trains was purchased by the Northwest Ohio Railroad Preservation Group, refurbished and in use at a railway museum in Findlay, Ohio.\n\n"}

{"id": "37769865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37769865", "title": "Irreligion in China", "text": "Irreligion in China\n\nChina has the world's greatest irreligious population. The Chinese government is officially atheist. Despite limitations on certain forms of religious expression and assembly, religion is not banned, and religious freedom is nominally protected under the Chinese constitution. Among the general Chinese population, there are a wide variety of religious practices. The Chinese government's attitude to religion is one of skepticism and non-promotion. According to a 2012 Gallup poll, 47% of Chinese people were convinced atheists, and a further 30% were not religious. In comparison, only 14% considered themselves to be religious. More recently, a 2015 Gallup poll found the number of convinced atheists in China to be 61%, with a further 29% saying that they are not religious compared to just 7% who are religious. Since 1978, the constitution provides for religious freedom: \"No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens because they do, or do not believe in religion\" (article 36). The Chinese state officially recognizes five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism. In order to be a member of the Communist Party of China an individual must not have religious affiliation.\n\nWhile in modern history, the Taiping Rebellion, Boxer Rebellion, Communist Revolution, and the Cultural Revolution contributed significantly to the rise of irreligion and distrust of organized religion among the general populace; irreligion in its various forms, especially rationalism, secularism, and antitheism, has had a long history in China dating back millennia. The Zhou Dynasty \"Classic of Poetry\" contains several catechistic poems in the \"Decade of Dang\" questioning the authority or existence of \"Shangdi\". Later philosophers such as Xun Zi, Fan Zhen, Han Fei, Zhang Zai, Wang Fuzhi also criticized the religious practices prevalent during their times. Buddhism flourished in China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties Period. It was during this period that Fan Zhen wrote \"Shen Mie Lun\" (Simplified Chinese 神灭论, Traditional Chinese 神滅論, \"On the Annihilation of the Shen\") in reaction to Buddhist concepts of body-soul dualism, \"samsara\" and \"karma\". He wrote that the soul is merely an effect or function of the body, and that there is no soul without the body (i.e., after the destruction and death of the body). Further, he considered that cause-and-effect relationships claimed to be evidence of \"karma\" were merely the result of coincidence and bias. For this, he was exiled by the Emperor.\n\nConfucianism as a state-instituted philosophy has flourished in China since the Han Dynasty, and the opportunities it offered was another fundamental origin of atheism in China. While there were periods in which Taoism and Buddhism may have been officially promoted, the status of Confucianism in Chinese society has rarely been challenged during imperial times. Extensive study of the Confucian Classics was required to pass the Imperial Civil Service Examinations, and this was the major (and often sole) means by which one may achieve prominence in society. Confucianism places particular emphasis on humanistic and this-worldly social relations, rather than on an otherworldly soteriology. This produced a cultural tendency that facilitated acceptance of modern forms of irreligion such as humanism, secularism, and atheism.\n\nChina is considered to be a nation with a long history of humanism, secularism, and this-worldly thought since the time of Confucius, who stressed \"shisu\" (世俗 \"being in the world\"). Hu Shih stated in the 1920s that \"China is a country without religion and the Chinese are a people who are not bound by religious superstitions.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, after China's defeat in the First Opium War and in successive wars, the country succumbed to increasing domination by foreign imperialist powers. The Boxers (or the \"Yihetuan\") considered Christian missionaries as promoting foreign influence in China and held deep anti-Christian views. Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant missionaries and church members were massacred.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, a radical policy of anti-religion and anti-tradition was instituted. In the ensuing decade, the five major religions in China were severely suppressed. Many religious organizations were disbanded, property was confiscated or damaged, monks and nuns were sent home (or killed in violent struggle sessions).\n\nSince the reforms of 1979, the government has liberalized religious policies to a degree, and the religious population has experienced some growth. Nevertheless, the irreligious remain the majority among all age groups in China. Local governments may even support certain local religious institutions and festivals in a bid to promote tourism. However, atheism, characterization of religions as superstition, the promotion of scientific rationalization remain core tenets of the ruling Communist Party.\n\n"}
{"id": "16043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16043", "title": "Jerusalem", "text": "Jerusalem\n\nJerusalem (; ; ) is a city in the Middle East, located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital, as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however, neither claim is widely recognized internationally.\n\nDuring its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David was settled in the 4th millennium BCE. Jerusalem was named as \"Urusalim\" on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity, during the Canaanite period (14th century BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538, the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent. Today those walls define the Old City, which has been traditionally divided into four quarters—known since the early 19th century as the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2015, Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents, comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis, 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians. In 2011, the population numbered 801,000, of which Jews comprised 497,000 (62%), Muslims 281,000 (35%), Christians 14,000 (around 2%) and 9,000 (1%) were not classified by religion.\n\nAccording to the Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the united kingdom of Israel, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First Temple. These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (\"עיר הקודש\", transliterated \"'ir haqodesh\") was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Septuagint which Christians adopted as their own authority, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion there. In Sunni Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. In Islamic tradition, in 610 CE it became the first qibla, the focal point for Muslim prayer (salat), and Muhammad made his Night Journey there ten years later, ascending to heaven where he speaks to God, according to the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only , the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Outside the Old City stands the Garden Tomb.\n\nToday, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into Jerusalem, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the Prime Minister (Beit Aghion) and President (Beit HaNassi), and the Supreme Court. While the international community rejected the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel, Israel has a stronger claim to sovereignty over West Jerusalem.\n\nA city called \"Rušalim\" in the execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE) is widely, but not universally, identified as Jerusalem. Jerusalem is called \"Urušalim\" in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE).\n\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologized to mean \"foundation (Sumerian \"yeru\", 'settlement'/Semitic \"yry\"' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\n\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (\"Salam\" or \"Shalom\" in modern Arabic and Hebrew).\nThe name thus offered itself to etymologizations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"dwelling of peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), alternately \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\n\nThe ending \"-ayim\" indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name \"Yerushalayim\" refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills. However, the pronunciation of the last syllable as \"-ayim\" appears to be a late development, which had not yet appeared at the time of the Septuagint.\n\nThe form \"Yerushalem\" or \"Yerushalayim\" (Jerusalem) first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of \"Yireh\" (\"The abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he began to sacrifice his son) and \"Shalem\" (\"Place of Peace\", given by high priest Shem), then the two names were united by God.\n\nThe earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\".\n\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was according to the Bible named Jebus (\"e.g.\", Judges 19:10:יְב֔וּס הִ֖יא יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם: \"Jebus, it [is] Jerusalem\"). Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (\"metsudat Zion\"), it was renamed by David as the City of David, and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole and to represent the biblical Land of Israel.\n\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated \"Hierosolyma\" (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek \"hieròs\", \"ἱερός\", means holy), although the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina for part of the Roman period of its history.\n\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14:18. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and \"targumim\", however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (or Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nIn Arabic, Jerusalem is most commonly known as , transliterated as \"al-Quds\" and meaning \"The Holy\" or \"The Holy Sanctuary\". Official Israeli government policy mandates that , transliterated as \"Ūršalīm\", which is the cognate of the Hebrew and English names, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with . . Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"\"Qudsi\" or \"Maqdisi\"\", while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nGiven the city's central position in both Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and Palestinian nationalism, the selectivity required to summarize some 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background (see Historiography and nationalism). Israeli/Jewish nationalists (Zionists) claim a right to the city based on Jewish indigeneity to the land, particularly their origins in and descent from the Israelites (see History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel), for whom Jerusalem is their capital, and their yearning for return. In contrast, Palestinian nationalists claim the right to the city based on modern Palestinians' longstanding presence and descent from many different peoples who have settled or lived in the region over the centuries. Both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city, and that this is borne out by the different focuses the different writers place on the various events and eras in the city's history.\n\nAny city, Jerusalem included, can be defined either in current administrative terms, as the area declared by legal means to be part of a municipality; or in historical terms, as the city which resulted from a process of urban development, united into one entity by a common territory, history and by virtue of its natural and social characteristics. The administrative inclusion of several outlying towns and villages after 1967, which are not fully and organically included in the social, economic, and political fabric of Jerusalem proper, creates confusion regarding any definition of the city of Jerusalem. This spreads to any related issue, such as defining the age of the city.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War in 1967, Shuafat and other places defined as East Jerusalem were incorporated into the Jerusalem municipal district, in a move not internationally recognized. Shuafat lies about 6 kilometres north of Jerusalem's oldest historical part, the so-called City of David, and about 5 kilometres north of the walled Old City. What is today Shuafat laid outside the settlement area of its neighbour, Jerusalem, throughout the Bronze Age and until Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE, and even outside Jerusalem's main Second Temple period northern necropolis. Shuafat is officially described in archaeological terms as being \"in the vicinity of Jerusalem\". It has an intermittent settlement history, in part from periods other than Jerusalem's, with architectural findings from the Chalcolithic, the Second Temple period (2nd-1st century BCE, a fortified agricultural settlement) and the short period between the end of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135), being re-inhabited on a smaller scale during the 2nd–4th centuries CE.\n\nThe South-Eastern Hill, also known as the City of David, is the initial nucleus of historical Jerusalem. There, the Gihon Spring attracted shepherds who camped near the water between 6 and 7000 years ago, leaving behind ceramics and flint artifacts during the Chalcolithic, or Copper Age (c. 4500-3500 BCE).\n\nPermanent houses only appeared several centuries later, with a small village emerging around 3000-2800 BCE, during the Early Bronze Age I or II. The first settlement lay on what some call the Ophel ridge. The city's inhabitants at this time were Canaanites, who are believed by scholars to have evolved into the Israelites via the development of a distinct Yahweh-centric monotheistic belief system.\n\nThe Execration Texts (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called \"rwš3lmm\", variously transcribed as \"Rušalimum\"/\"Urušalimum\"/\"Rôsh-ramen\" and the Amarna letters (c. 14th century BCE) may be the earliest mention of the city. Nadav Na'aman argues its fortification as the centre of a kingdom dates to around the 18th century BCE.\n\nIn the Late Bronze Age, Jerusalem was the capital of an Egyptian vassal city-state, a modest settlement governing a few outlying villages and pastoral areas, with a small Egyptian garrison and ruled by appointees such as king Abdi-Heba, At the time of Seti I (r. 1290–1279 BCE) and Ramesses II (r. 1279–1213 BCE), major construction took place as prosperity increased.\n\nArchaeological remains from the ancient Israelite period include the Siloam Tunnel, an aqueduct built by Judahite king Hezekiah and once containing an ancient Hebrew inscription, known as the Siloam Inscription; the so-called Broad Wall, a defensive fortification built in the 8th century BCE, also by Hezekiah; the Silwan necropolis with the Monolith of Silwan and the Tomb of the Royal Steward, which were decorated with monumental Hebrew inscriptions; and the so-called Israelite Tower, remnants of ancient fortifications, built from large, sturdy rocks with carved cornerstones. A huge water reservoir dating from this period was discovered in 2012 near Robinson's Arch, indicating the existence of a densely built-up quarter across the area west of the Temple Mount during the Kingdom of Judah.\n\nWhen the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, Jerusalem was strengthened by a great influx of refugees from the northern kingdom. The First Temple period ended around 586 BCE, as the Babylonians conquered Judah and Jerusalem, and laid waste to Solomon's Temple and the city.\n\nThis period, when Canaan formed part of the Egyptian empire, corresponds in biblical accounts to Joshua's invasion, but almost all scholars agree that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value for early Israel.\n\nIn the Bible, Jerusalem is defined as lying within territory allocated to the tribe of Benjamin though occupied by Jebusites. David is said to have conquered these in the Siege of Jebus, and transferred his capital from Hebron to Jerusalem which then became the capital of a united Kingdom of Israel, and one of its several religious centres. The choice was perhaps dictated by the fact that Jerusalem did not form part of Israel's tribal system, and was thus suited to serve as the centre of its federation. Opinion is divided over whether the so-called Large Stone Structure and the nearby Stepped Stone Structure may be identified with King David's palace, or dates to a later period.\nAccording to the Bible, King David reigned for 40 years and was succeeded by his son Solomon, who built\nthe Holy Temple on Mount Moriah. Solomon's Temple (later known as the \"First Temple\"), went on to play a pivotal role in Jewish religion as the repository of the Ark of the Covenant. On Solomon's death, ten of the northern Tribes of Israel broke with the United Monarchy to form their own nation, with its kings, prophets, priests, traditions relating to religion, capitals and temples in northern Israel. The southern tribes, together with the Aaronid priesthood, remained in Jerusalem, with the city becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.\n\nIn 538 BCE, the Persian King Cyrus the Great invited the Jews of Babylon to return to Judah to rebuild the Temple. Construction of the Second Temple was completed in 516 BCE, during the reign of Darius the Great, 70 years after the destruction of the First Temple.\n\nSometime soon after 485 BCE Jerusalem was besieged, conquered and largely destroyed by a coalition of neighbouring states. In about 445 BCE, King Artaxerxes I of Persia issued a decree allowing the city (including its walls) to be rebuilt. Jerusalem resumed its role as capital of Judah and center of Jewish worship.\n\nMany Jewish tombs from the Second Temple period have been rediscovered in Jerusalem. One example, discovered north of the Old City, contains human remains in an ossuary decorated with the Aramaic inscription \"Simon the Temple Builder.\" The Tomb of Abba, also located north of the Old City, bears an Aramaic inscription with Paleo-Hebrew letters reading: \"I, Abba, son of the priest Eleaz(ar), son of Aaron the high (priest), Abba, the oppressed and the persecuted, who was born in Jerusalem, and went into exile into Babylonia and brought (back to Jerusalem) Mattathi(ah), son of Jud(ah), and buried him in a cave which I bought by deed.\" The Tomb of Benei Hezir located in Kidron Valley is decorated by monumental Doric columns and Hebrew inscription, identifying it as the burial site of Second Temple priests.\nThe Tombs of the Sanhedrin, an underground complex of 63 rock-cut tombs, is located in a public park in the northern Jerusalem neighborhood of Sanhedria. These tombs, probably reserved for members of the Sanhedrin and inscribed by ancient Hebrew and Aramaic writings, are dated to between 100 BCE and 100 CE.\n\nWhen Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, Jerusalem and Judea came under Macedonian control, eventually falling to the Ptolemaic dynasty under Ptolemy I. In 198 BCE, Ptolemy V Epiphanes lost Jerusalem and Judea to the Seleucids under Antiochus III. The Seleucid attempt to recast Jerusalem as a Hellenized city-state came to a head in 168 BCE with the successful Maccabean revolt of Mattathias and his five sons against Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and their establishment of the Hasmonean Kingdom in 152 BCE with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nIn 63 BCE, Pompey the Great intervened in a struggle for the Hasmonean throne and captured Jerusalem, extending the influence of the Roman Republic over Judea. Following a short invasion by Parthians, backing the rival Hasmonean rulers, Judea became a scene of struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian forces, eventually leading to the emergence of an Edomite named Herod.\nAs Rome became stronger, it installed Herod as a Jewish client king. Herod the Great, as he was known, devoted himself to developing and beautifying the city. He built walls, towers and palaces, and expanded the Temple Mount, buttressing the courtyard with blocks of stone weighing up to 100 tons. Under Herod, the area of the Temple Mount doubled in size. Shortly after Herod's death, in 6 CE Judea came under direct Roman rule as the Iudaea Province, although the Herodian dynasty through Agrippa II remained client kings of neighbouring territories until 96 CE. Roman rule over Jerusalem and the region was challenged in the First Jewish–Roman War, which ended with a Roman victory. The Second Temple was destroyed in 70 CE, and the entire city was destroyed in the war. The contemporary Jewish historian Josephus wrote that the city \"was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation.\" Roman rule was again challenged during the Bar Kokhba revolt, beginning in 132 CE and suppressed by the Romans in 135 CE.\nFollowing the Bar Kokhba revolt, Emperor Hadrian combined Iudaea Province with neighboring provinces under the new name of \"Syria Palaestina\", replacing the name of Judea. The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina, and rebuilt it in the style of a typical Roman town. Jews were prohibited from entering the city on pain of death, except for one day each year, during the holiday of Tisha B'Av. Taken together, these measures (which also affected Jewish Christians) essentially \"secularized\" the city. The ban was maintained until the 7th century, though Christians would soon be granted an exemption: during the 4th century, the Roman Emperor Constantine I ordered the construction of Christian holy sites in the city, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Burial remains from the Byzantine period are exclusively Christian, suggesting that the population of Jerusalem in Byzantine times probably consisted only of Christians.\n\nIn the 5th century, the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire, ruled from the recently renamed Constantinople, maintained control of the city. Within the span of a few decades, Jerusalem shifted from Byzantine to Persian rule, then back to Roman-Byzantine dominion. Following Sassanid Khosrau II's early 7th century push through Syria, his generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin attacked Jerusalem () aided by the Jews of Palaestina Prima, who had risen up against the Byzantines.\n\nIn the Siege of Jerusalem of 614, after 21 days of relentless siege warfare, Jerusalem was captured. Byzantine chronicles relate that the Sassanids and Jews slaughtered tens of thousands of Christians in the city, many at the Mamilla Pool, and destroyed their monuments and churches, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This episode has been the subject of much debate between historians. The conquered city would remain in Sassanid hands for some fifteen years until the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius reconquered it in 629.\n\nJerusalem reached a peak in size and population at the end of the Second Temple Period, when the city covered and had a population of 200,000.\n\nByzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab in 638 CE. Among Muslims of Islam's earliest era it was referred to as \"Madinat bayt al-Maqdis\" (\"City of the Temple\") which was restricted to the Temple Mount. The rest of the city \"... was called Iliya, reflecting the Roman name given the city following the destruction of 70 CE: \"Aelia Capitolina\"\". Later the Temple Mount became known as \"al-Haram al-Sharif\", \"The Noble Sanctuary\", while the city around it became known as \"Bayt al-Maqdis\", and later still, \"al-Quds al-Sharif\" \"The Holy, Noble\". The Islamization of Jerusalem began in the first year A.H. (623 CE), when Muslims were instructed to face the city while performing their daily prostrations and, according to Muslim religious tradition, Muhammad's night journey and ascension to heaven took place. After 13 years, the direction of prayer was changed to Mecca. In 638 CE the Islamic Caliphate extended its dominion to Jerusalem. With the Arab conquest, Jews were allowed back into the city. The Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab signed a treaty with Christian Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius, assuring him that Jerusalem's Christian holy places and population would be protected under Muslim rule. Christian-Arab tradition records that, when led to pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the holiest sites for Christians, the caliph Umar refused to pray in the church so that Muslims would not request conversion of the church to a mosque. He prayed outside the church, where the Mosque of Umar (Omar) stands to this day, opposite the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. According to the Gaullic bishop Arculf, who lived in Jerusalem from 679 to 688, the Mosque of Umar was a rectangular wooden structure built over ruins which could accommodate 3,000 worshipers.\n\nWhen the Arab armies under Umar went to \"Bayt Al-Maqdes\" in 637 CE, they searched for the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque (\"The Farthest Mosque\") that was mentioned in Quran and Hadith according to Islamic beliefs. Contemporary Arabic and Hebrew sources say the site was full of rubbish, and that Arabs and Jews cleaned it. The Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik commissioned the construction of a shrine on the Temple Mount, now known as the Dome of the Rock, in the late 7th century. Two of the city's most-distinguished Arab citizens of the 10th-century were Al-Muqaddasi, the geographer, and Al-Tamimi, the physician. Al-Muqaddasi writes that Abd al-Malik built the edifice on the Temple Mount in order to compete in grandeur with Jerusalem's monumental churches.\n\nOver the next four hundred years Jerusalem's prominence diminished as Arab powers in the region jockeyed for control. Jerusalem was captured in 1073 by the Seljuk Turkish commander Atsız. After Atsız was killed, the Seljuk prince Tutush I granted the city to Artuk Bey, another Seljuk commander. After Artuk's death in 1091 his sons Sökmen and Ilghazi governed in the city up to 1098 when the Fatimids recaptured the city.\nA messianic Karaite movement to gather in Jerusalem took place at the turn of the millennium, leading to a \"Golden Age\" of Karaite scholarship there, which was only terminated by the Crusades. In 1099, the Fatimid ruler expelled the native Christian population before Jerusalem was besieged by the soldiers of the First Crusade. After taking the solidly defended city by assault, the Crusaders massacred most of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, and made it the capital of their Kingdom of Jerusalem. The city, which had been virtually emptied, was recolonized by a variegated inflow of Greeks, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Georgians, Armenians, Syrians, Egyptians, Nestorians, Maronites, Jacobite Miaphysites, Copts and others, to block the return of the surviving Muslims and Jews. The north-eastern quarter was repopulated with Eastern Christians from the Transjordan. As a result, by 1099 Jerusalem's population had climbed back to some 30,000.\n\nIn 1187, the city was wrested from the Crusaders by Saladin who permitted Jews and Muslims to return and settle in the city. Under the terms of surrender, once ransomed, 60,000 Franks were expelled. The Eastern Christian populace was permitted to stay. Under the Ayyubid dynasty of Saladin, a period of huge investment began in the construction of houses, markets, public baths, and pilgrim hostels as well as the establishment of religious endowments. However, for most of the 13th century, Jerusalem declined to the status of a village due to city's fall of strategic value and Ayyubid internecine struggles.\n\nFrom 1229 to 1244, Jerusalem peacefully reverted to Christian control as a result of a 1229 treaty agreed between the crusading Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and al-Kamil, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, that ended the Sixth Crusade. The Ayyubids retained control of the Muslim holy places, and Arab sources suggest that Frederick was not permitted to restore Jerusalem's fortifications.\n\nIn 1244, Jerusalem was sacked by the Khwarezmian Tatars, who decimated the city's Christian population and drove out the Jews. The Khwarezmian Tatars were driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. When Nachmanides visited in 1267 he found only two Jewish families, in a population of 2,000, 300 of whom were Christians, in the city. From 1260 to 1517, Jerusalem was ruled by the Mamluks. In the wider region and until around 1300, many clashes occurred between the Mamluks on one side, and the crusaders and the Mongols, on the other side. The area also suffered from many earthquakes and black plague.\n\nIn 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the Ottoman Turks, who generally remained in control until 1917. Jerusalem enjoyed a prosperous period of renewal and peace under Suleiman the Magnificent—including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the Old City. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between Damascus and Cairo. The English reference book \"Modern history or the present state of all nations\", written in 1744, stated that \"Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine, though much fallen from its ancient grandeaur\".\n\nThe Ottomans brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates and regular stagecoach and carriage services were among the first signs of modernization in the city. In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.\n\nWith the annexation of Jerusalem by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In 1836, Ibrahim Pasha allowed Jerusalem's Jewish residents to restore four major synagogues, among them the Hurva. In the countrywide Peasants' Revolt, Qasim al-Ahmad led his forces from Nablus and attacked Jerusalem, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and entered the city on 31 May 1834. The Christians and Jews of Jerusalem were subjected to attacks. Ibrahim's Egyptian army routed Qasim's forces in Jerusalem the following month.\n\nOttoman rule was reinstated in 1840, but many Egyptian Muslims remained in Jerusalem and Jews from Algiers and North Africa began to settle in the city in growing numbers. In the 1840s and 1850s, the international powers began a tug-of-war in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the region's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through consular representatives in Jerusalem. According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans. The volume of Christian pilgrims increased under the Ottomans, doubling the city's population around Easter time.\n\nIn the 1860s, new neighborhoods began to develop outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city. The Russian Compound and Mishkenot Sha'ananim were founded in 1860, followed by many others that included Mahane Israel (1868), Nahalat Shiv'a (1869), German Colony (1872), Beit David (1873), Mea Shearim (1874), Shimon HaZadiq (1876), Beit Ya'aqov (1877), Abu Tor (1880s), American-Swedish Colony (1882), Yemin Moshe (1891), and Mamilla, Wadi al-Joz around the turn of the century. In 1867 an American Missionary reports an estimated population of Jerusalem of 'above' 15,000, with 4,000 to 5,000 Jews and 6,000 Muslims. Every year there were 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Christian Pilgrims. In 1872 Jerusalem became the center of a special administrative district, independent of the Syria Vilayet and under the direct authority of Istanbul called the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem.\n\nUntil the 1880s there were no formal orphanages in Jerusalem, as families generally took care of each other. In 1881 the Diskin Orphanage was founded in Jerusalem with the arrival of Jewish children orphaned by a Russian pogrom. Other orphanages founded in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 20th century were Zion Blumenthal Orphanage (1900) and General Israel Orphan's Home for Girls (1902).\n\nIn 1917 after the Battle of Jerusalem, the British Army, led by General Edmund Allenby, captured the city. In 1922, the League of Nations at the Conference of Lausanne entrusted the United Kingdom to administer Palestine, neighbouring Transjordan, and Iraq beyond it.\n\nThe British had to deal with a conflicting demand that was rooted in Ottoman rule. Agreements for the supply of water, electricity, and the construction of a tramway system—all under concessions granted by the Ottoman authorities—had been signed by the city of Jerusalem and a Greek citizen, Euripides Mavromatis, on 27 January 1914. Work under these concessions had not begun and, by the end of the war the British occupying forces refused to recognize their validity. Mavromatis claimed that his concessions overlapped with the Auja Concession that the government had awarded to Rutenberg in 1921 and that he had been deprived of his legal rights. The Mavromatis concession, in effect despite earlier British attempts to abolish it, covered Jerusalem and other localities (e.g., Bethlehem) within a radius of around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1948 the total population of the city rose from 52,000 to 165,000, comprised two-thirds of Jews and one-third of Arabs (Muslims and Christians). Relations between Arab Christians and Muslims and the growing Jewish population in Jerusalem deteriorated, resulting in recurring unrest. In Jerusalem, in particular, Arab riots occurred in 1920 and in 1929. Under the British, new garden suburbs were built in the western and northern parts of the city and institutions of higher learning such as the Hebrew University were founded.\n\nAs the British Mandate for Palestine was expiring, the 1947 UN Partition Plan recommended \"the creation of a special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a \"corpus separatum\" under the administration of the UN.\" The international regime (which also included the city of Bethlehem) was to remain in force for a period of ten years, whereupon a referendum was to be held in which the residents were to decide the future regime of their city. However, this plan was not implemented, as the 1948 war erupted, while the British withdrew from Palestine and Israel declared its independence.\n\nIn contradiction to the Partition Plan, which envisioned a city separated from the Arab state and the Jewish state, Israel took control of the area which later would become West Jerusalem, along with major parts of the Arab territory allotted to the future Arab State; Jordan took control of East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank. The war led to displacement of Arab and Jewish populations in the city. The 1,500 residents of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City were expelled and a few hundred taken prisoner when the Arab Legion captured the quarter on 28 May. Arab residents of Katamon, Talbiya, and the German Colony were driven from their homes. By the time of the armistice that ended active fighting, Israel had control of 12 of Jerusalem's 15 Arab residential quarters. An estimated minimum of 30,000 people had become refugees.\nThe war of 1948 resulted in the division of Jerusalem, so that the old walled city lay entirely on the Jordanian side of the line. A no-man's land between East and West Jerusalem came into being in November 1948: Moshe Dayan, commander of the Israeli forces in Jerusalem, met with his Jordanian counterpart Abdullah el-Tell in a deserted house in Jerusalem's Musrara neighborhood and marked out their respective positions: Israel's position in red and Jordan's in green. This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final line in the 1949 Armistice Agreements, which divided the city and left Mount Scopus as an Israeli exclave inside East Jerusalem. Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the center of the city, passing close by Jaffa Gate on the western side of the old walled city, and a crossing point was established at Mandelbaum Gate slightly to the north of the old walled city. Military skirmishes frequently threatened the ceasefire.\n\nAfter the establishment of the state of Israel, Jerusalem was declared its capital city. Jordan formally annexed East Jerusalem in 1950, subjecting it to Jordanian law, and in 1953 declared it the \"second capital\" of Jordan. Only the United Kingdom and Pakistan formally recognized such annexation, which, in regard to Jerusalem, was on a \"de facto\" basis. Some scholars argue that the view that Pakistan recognized Jordan's annexation is dubious.\nAfter 1948, since the old walled city in its entirety was to the east of the armistice line, Jordan was able to take control of all the holy places therein. While Muslim holy sites were maintained and renovated, contrary to the terms of the armistice agreement, Jews were denied access to Jewish holy sites, many of which were destroyed or desecrated. Jordan allowed only very limited access to Christian holy sites, and restrictions were imposed on the Christian population that led many to leave the city. Of the 58 synagogues in the Old City, half were either razed or converted to stables and hen-houses over the course of the next 19 years, including the Hurva and the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue. The 3,000-year-old Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery was desecrated, with gravestones used to build roads, latrines and Jordanian army fortifications. 38,000 graves in the Jewish Cemetery were destroyed, and Jews were forbidden from being buried there. The Western Wall was transformed into an exclusively Muslim holy site associated with \"al-Buraq\". Israeli authorities neglected to protect the tombs in the Muslim Mamilla Cemetery in West Jerusalem, which contains the remains of figures from the early Islamic period, facilitating the creation of a parking lot and public lavatories in 1964. Many other historic and religiously significant buildings were demolished and replaced by modern structures during the Jordanian occupation. During this period, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque underwent major renovations.\n\nDuring the 1948 war, the Jewish residents of Eastern Jerusalem were expelled by Jordan's Arab Legion. Jordan allowed Arab Palestinian refugees from the war to settle in the vacated Jewish Quarter, which became known as \"Harat al-Sharaf\". In 1966 the Jordanian authorities relocated 500 of them to the Shua'fat refugee camp as part of plans to turn the Jewish quarter into a public park.\n\nIn 1967, despite Israeli pleas that Jordan remain neutral during the Six-Day War, Jordan, which had concluded a defense agreement with Egypt on May 30, 1967, attacked Israeli-held West Jerusalem on the war's second day. After hand-to-hand fighting between Israeli and Jordanian soldiers on the Temple Mount, the Israel Defense Forces captured East Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank. On 27 June 1967, three weeks after the war ended, in the reunification of Jerusalem, Israel extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, including the city's Christian and Muslim holy sites, along with some nearby West Bank territory which comprised 28 Palestinian villages, incorporating it into the Jerusalem Municipality, although it carefully avoided using the term annexation. On 10 July, Foreign Minister Abba Eban explained to the UN Secretary General: \"The term 'annexation' which was used by supporters of the vote is not accurate. The steps that were taken [by Israel] relate to the integration of Jerusalem in administrative and municipal areas, and served as a legal basis for the protection of the holy places of Jerusalem.\" Israel conducted a census of Arab residents in the areas annexed. Residents were given permanent residency status and the option of applying for Israeli citizenship. Since 1967, new Jewish residential areas have mushroomed in the eastern sector, while no new Palestinian neighbourhoods have been created.\n\nJewish and Christian access to the holy sites inside the old walled city was restored. Israel left the Temple Mount under the jurisdiction of an Islamic \"waqf\", but opened the Western Wall to Jewish access. The Moroccan Quarter, which was located adjacent to the Western Wall, was evacuated and razed to make way for a plaza for those visiting the wall. On 18 April 1968, an expropriation order by the Israeli Ministry of Finance more than doubled the size of the Jewish Quarter, evicting its Arab residents and seizing over 700 buildings of which 105 belonged to Jewish inhabitants prior to the Jordanian occupation of the city. The order designated these areas for public use, but they were intended for Jews alone. The government offered 200 Jordanian dinars to each displaced Arab family.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War the population of Jerusalem increased by 196%. The Jewish population grew by 155%, while the Arab population grew by 314%. The proportion of the Jewish population fell from 74% in 1967 to 72% in 1980, to 68% in 2000, and to 64% in 2010. Israeli Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon proposed building a ring of Jewish neighborhoods around the city's eastern edges. The plan was intended to make East Jerusalem more Jewish and prevent it from becoming part of an urban Palestinian bloc stretching from Bethlehem to Ramallah. On 2 October 1977, the Israeli cabinet approved the plan, and seven neighborhoods were subsequently built on the city's eastern edges. They became known as the Ring Neighborhoods. Other Jewish neighborhoods were built within East Jerusalem, and Israeli Jews also settled in Arab neighborhoods.\n\nThe annexation of East Jerusalem was met with international criticism. The Israeli Foreign Ministry disputes that the annexation of Jerusalem was a violation of international law. The final status of Jerusalem has been one of the most important areas of discord between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators for peace. Areas of discord have included whether the Palestinian flag can be raised over areas of Palestinian custodianship and the specificity of Israeli and Palestinian territorial borders.\n\nPrior to the creation of the State of Israel, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine, which included present-day Israel and Jordan.\n\nFrom 1949 until 1967, West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognized as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\n\nIn 1988, Israel ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. President Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city.\n\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\n\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by Palestinian Center for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations, among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship contrary to 31% who opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll, 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighborhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\nOn 5 December 1949, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only - Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial, and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\n\nIn July 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem. Following the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006.\nCurrently, there are two embassies—United States and Guatemala—and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem, and two Latin American states maintain embassies in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion (Bolivia and Paraguay). There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\n\nIn 1995, the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticized by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017, and a subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018, the United States officially moved the location of its embassy to Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\n\nIn April 2017, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state.\n\nMany national institutions of Israel are located in Kiryat HaMemshala in Givat Ram in Jerusalem as a part of the Kiryat HaLeom project which is intended to create a large district that will house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the President and Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\n\nThe PLO's current position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint \"development council\" would be responsible for coordinated development.\n\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognize the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat came out as the winner and is now the mayor. Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years—-six consecutive terms-—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (\"Kikar Safra\") on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 moved from the Jerusalem Historical City Hall Building. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but only 10% of tax revenues are allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land is excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which is already built on.\n\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately . The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (\"wadis\"). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell. The Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the center of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west (the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus). Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries.\nIn biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\n\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\n\nJerusalem is east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighboring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\n\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\n\nThe city is characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: \"Csa \"), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\n\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of ; July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of , and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around , with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralyzed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was on 25 January 1907.\n\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nJerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000 year history. Since medieval times, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters.\n\nMost population data pre-1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nIn December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—64% were Jewish, 32% Muslim, and 2% Christian. At the end of 2005, the population density was . According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\n\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\n\nIn 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%. This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population. Many move to the suburbs and coastal cities in search of cheaper housing and a more secular lifestyle.\nIn 2009, the percentage of Haredim in the city was increasing. , out of 150,100 schoolchildren, 59,900 or 40% are in state-run secular and National Religious schools, while 90,200 or 60% are in Haredi schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\n\nWhile some Israelis avoid Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, the city has attracted Palestinians, offering more jobs and opportunity than any city in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. Palestinian officials have encouraged Arabs over the years to stay in the city to maintain their claim. Palestinians are attracted to the access to jobs, healthcare, social security, other benefits, and quality of life Israel provides to Jerusalem residents. Arab residents of Jerusalem who choose not to have Israeli citizenship are granted an Israeli identity card that allows them to pass through checkpoints with relative ease and to travel throughout Israel, making it easier to find work. Residents also are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighborhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Center are available to residents.\n\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\n\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012, it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. Currently, the city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted three percent of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighborhood, Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.\n\nAt the end of 2008, the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these, 195,500 (43%) are Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), 260,800 (57%) are Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\n\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 21% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 30% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish men who work, 47%, is exceeded by the percentage of Jewish women who work, 50%. The young and less religious continue to leave according to a 2016 Central Bureau of Statistics report which noted 6,740 people left. The opening of high speed rail transit to Tel Aviv next year and the New Jerusalem Gateway Business District currently under construction is designed to alter business, tourism, and hopefully reverse the population exodus.\n\nJerusalem had a population of 801,000 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 497,000 (62%), Muslims 281,000 (35%), Christians 14,000 (around 2%) and 9,000 (1%) were not classified by religion.\n\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighborhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological park in the 60% Arab neighborhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy.\n\nJerusalem has been sacred to the Jews since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Jerusalem was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple. Although not mentioned in the Torah / Pentateuch, it is mentioned in the Bible 632 times. Today, the Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, is a Jewish holy site second only to the \"Holy of Holies\" on the Temple Mount itself. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the \"Shulchan Aruch\", daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer.\n\nChristianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land currently occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years.\n\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. For approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the \"qibla\" (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night of Ascension (c. CE 620). Muslims believe Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's \"Surat al-Isra\" notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as \"al-Aqsa\" (the farthest) mosque, in reference to the location in Jerusalem. The hadith, the recorded sayings of the Prophet Mohammad, name Jerusalem as the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The al-Aqsa Mosque, derived from the name mentioned in the Qur'an, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe Muhammad ascended to Heaven.\n\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was located far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City, In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by \"Travel + Leisure magazine\".\nin 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centered in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial center, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centers of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more . In April 2015, Time Magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing center for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure.\" By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\n\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labor force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\n\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\n\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and underground tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it is set to break ground by 2019.\n\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\n\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit, and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate. The Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city center to Mt. Herzl in the south.\nAnother work in progress is a new high-speed rail line from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017. Its terminus will be a new underground station ( deep) serving the International Convention Center and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operates train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh.\n\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north-south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the center of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualized decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nJerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. In the past it was also served by the local Atarot Airport. Atarot ceased operation in 2000.\n\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English. Founded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. the Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents house.\n\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". New York Bard College and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a Abu Dis campus. Other institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies program. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and \"Yeshivot\", including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (\"Bagrut\") and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardized tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\n\nSchools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of Israel have been criticized for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is currently building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighborhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007, the Israeli government approved a 5-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the \"Bagrut\" matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education program, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and a scale-model of the Second Temple. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Center is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Center is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis.\n\nThe national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honors the Righteous among the Nations.\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Center (\"Binyanei HaUma\") near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Center (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Center in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Center in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theater has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organizer of this event. The Jerusalem Theater in the Talbiya neighborhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theater and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theater, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theater. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of \"Shav'ua Hasefer\" (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\n\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra\nwhich toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artifacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009, a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\n\nThe Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Center (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Center for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008, the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\n\nJerusalem is the state broadcasting center of Israel. The Israel Broadcasting Authority's main office is located in Jerusalem, as well as the TV and radio studios for Israel Radio, Channel 2, Channel 10, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include Kol Ha'Ir and The Jerusalem Times. God TV, an international Christian television network is also based in the city.\n\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733. The most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\n\nIn basketball, Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division. The club has won Israel's championship in 2015, the State Cup four times, and the ULEB Cup in 2004.\n\nThe Jerusalem Marathon, established in 2011, is an international marathon race held annually in Jerusalem in the month of March. The full 42-kilometer race begins at the Knesset, passes through Mount Scopus and the Old City's Armenian Quarter, and concludes at Sacher Park. In 2012, the Jerusalem Marathon drew 15,000 runners, including 1,500 from fifty countries outside Israel.\n\nA popular non-competitive sports event is the Jerusalem March, held annually during the Sukkot festival.\n\n\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard described Scientology as \"the Western Anglicized continuance of many earlier forms of wisdom\", and cites the teachings of Jesus Christ among belief systems of those \"earlier forms\". Jesus is recognized in Scientology as part of its \"religious heritage,\" and \"is seen as only one of many good teachers.\"\n\nContradicting the Christian concept of Jesus' \"atonement of mankind's sins\" through his death on the cross, Hubbard states in the \"Volunteer Ministers Handbook\" that \"Man is basically good, but he could not attain expression of this until now. Nobody but the individual could die for his own sins – to arrange things otherwise was to keep man in chains.\"\n\nIn Scientology, Jesus is classified as below the level of Operating Thetan, and described by L. Ron Hubbard as being a \"shade above\" the condition of \"Clear,\"similar to the group’s view of Buddha. According to R. Philip Roberts in \"The Apologetics Study Bible\", \"Scientology's upper-level materials tout the concept of Jesus as God as being a fiction that ought to be removed by 'auditing'\".\n\nAccording to Scientology, as written by Walter Martin in \"The Kingdom of the Cults\", there is a possibility that Jesus believed in reincarnation: \"There is much speculation on the part on the part of religious historians as to the early education of Jesus of Nazareth. It is believed by many authorities that Jesus was a member of the cult of Essenes, who believed in reincarnation.\" Hubbard also linked Hindu teachings to Jesus. Walter Martin also mentions that the apostle Peter has, long ago, denied mythologies and fables attributed to Christ. \"We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty\" (2 Peter 1:16)\n\nIn the 2008 book \"Vintage Jesus: Timeless Answers to Timely Questions\", authors Mark Driscoll and Gerry Breshears write: \"According to Scientology, Jesus is an 'implant' forced upon a thetan about a million years ago\". In \"A Piece of Blue Sky\", Jon Atack writes \"In confidential issues, Hubbard dismissed Christian teaching as an 'implant.' ... In confidential materials Hubbard attacked Christianity as an 'implant,' and said that Christ was a fiction.\"\n\nHubbard is quoted as stating that Christianity evolved from the \"R6 Implant\": \"The man on the cross. There was no Christ! The Roman Catholic Church, through watching the dramatizations of people picked up some little fragments of R6.\"\n\nHubbard described the belief that the Christian heaven is “the product of two implants dating back more than 43 trillion years.” He said further that heaven is a “false dream” that leads thetans to a goal that does not exist, and persuades them of the singularity of this life.\n\nOperating Thetan level VIII is highest level of auditing level in Scientology. It is known as \"The Truth Revealed\". It was initially released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988.\n\nIn OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death. Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work. Hubbard explains that the reader has \"undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth\" but \"the story was never written, nor spoken... It is only now that I feel it safe to release the information\".\n\nIn the document, Hubbard teaches that \"the historic Jesus was not nearly the sainted figure [he] has been made out to be. In addition to being a lover of young boys and men, he was given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred\". Hubbard mentions the Book of Revelation and its prophecy of a time when \"an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the anti-Christ, will reign\". According to Hubbard, the \"anti-Christ represents the forces of Lucifer\". Hubbard writes \"My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"The Sacramento Bee\", actress Mimi Rogers explained how her identity as a Scientologist helped her with the character Sharon in the 1991 psychological/religious drama film \"The Rapture\". \"I don't, for example, have a Jesus Christ definition of God ... And I have no views on heaven or hell. To me they're alien concepts. If I were a practicing Christian or a Jew, with all the hang-ups of those religions, I don't think I could have done Sharon justice\" said Rogers.\n\nIn 1997, celebrity Scientologist Lisa Marie Presley hosted a Christmas party at a Church of Scientology mission in Memphis, Tennessee. Approximately 100 children attended the event, which Scientology officials stated was Presley's idea. Church of Scientology administrator Peggy Crawford asserted to \"The Commercial Appeal\": \"Some Scientologists are Christians and believe Jesus was divine. Some don't. We believe Christianity is not the only way.\n\nScientology minister-in-training and professed Christian, Craig Gehring, was quoted in 2007 in \"The Advocate\" as saying he thought that his belief in Jesus as the son of God did not conflict with his being a Scientologist: \"Personally, I believe [Jesus is] the son of God - son of man, but like I said, that is not a Scientology doctrine. There isn't a doctrine about [Jesus] in Scientology.\" I believe very much in the Christian message. Jesus says time and time again, 'The kingdom of God is at hand.' ... And that is a message you will find any Scientologist working toward.\" Gehring said that during his time studying Scientology at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana mission, he had not encountered teachings of Scientology space opera as had been reported in 2006 in \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nHubbard discounted the Christian belief of the Holy Trinity. According to his Phoenix Lectures, “The Christian god is actually much better characterized in the Vedic Hymns [Hinduism] than in any subsequent publication, including the Old Testament.” He goes on to say that the Christian god is much more like the Hindu Veda than the Hebrew god.\n\nIn the book \"New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America\" (1995) by Mary Farrell Bednarowski, the author comments that \"In the game of life as Scientology understands it, sin does not call for repentance as much as it does the eradication of error, and that must come through the technology, the auditing process, sometimes referred to as pastoral counseling. In fact, in regard to getting rid of sin, Scientology sees parallels between the goals of its technology and Jesus's saving action.\" Bednarowski quotes from the Scientology publication \"The Scientology Catechism\" in noting these parallels between the stated mission of Scientologists and the teachings imparted by Christ to his disciples. She notes that Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard is not regarded in Scientology as a \"divine savior\", but rather a \"loved friend and teacher\". Writing in \"Signs of the Times: The New Religious Movements in Theological Perspective\" (1996), John A. Saliba cites Mary Bednarowski, and goes on to note \"Helle Medgaard asserts that Scientology also misunderstands Jesus and repudiates the key Christian doctrine of the forgiveness of sins.\" In his book \"The Sociology of Religious Movements\" (1996), William Sims Bainbridge cites the research of Roy Wallis, in noting \"Scientology ... has no discernible connection to Christianity\".\n\nIn 1997, Scientology administrator Peggy Crawford said in a statement to \"The Commercial Appeal\": \"We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings.\" Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying \"They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and I could see how they could say that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop.\"\n\nReverend Raymond Guterman of the Northwood Presbyterian Church in Clearwater, Florida, gave a sermon in 2001 titled: \"Why Scientology Isn't a Church\". \"I'm not anti-Scientology; I'm not pro-Scientology. I just don't exactly understand individually why it's called the Church of Scientology and why there would be a cross, even if it's a different cross. When I see the cross, I think of Christ. If Christ is not the center of Scientology, then why would an organization use the cross and call itself a church? I'm just wondering, but I don't really plan to say any of that Sunday,\" said Reverend Guterman. He explained that in his view Scientology was not a \"church\" because it did not follow the words of Jesus Christ and accept him as savior, and for this reason said \"in my opinion, it's not a church.\" Scientology representative Pat Harney contacted Reverend Guterman, and told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" she thought he was using Scientology in order to generate interest. \"There's a definition of 'church' in the dictionary. It's called a congregation. There's a definition of the word 'church' that applies. I understand his Christian perspective. In truth, the derivation of the word 'church' predates Christianity,\" said Harney. The \"St. Petersburg Times\" noted Reverend Guterman's public discussion of Scientology in such a manner was \"virtually unheard of\" in Clearwater, Florida, due to the large presence of Scientology in the area.\n\nCalvin Miller comments in \"Miracles and Wonders\" (2003) that L. Ron Hubbard \"held to such odd notions, blending his Jesus with 'spacey theology.'\" Writing in \"Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality\" (2004), Bob Larson points out that \"In his 1952 book entitled \"\" Hubbard even adapted the words of Jesus as found in Matthew 11:5 to describe his new teaching.\" Author Steven Hutson writes in \"What They Never Taught You in Sunday School\" (2006) that \"The Church of Scientology recognizes Jesus as \"one part\" of its 'religious heritage.' And this same 'heritage' also includes Zoroaster (an ancient Persian prophet), Socrates (the Greek sage), and a wide assortment of other philosophies and \nreligions.\"\n\nWhile Hubbard put into question where the Bible originated from, Scientology claims that “it does not conflict with other religions or religious practices, as it clarifies them and brings understanding of the spiritual nature of Man.” Martin and Zacharias write in \"The Kingdom of the Cults (2003),\" differentiating the truth in Scientology and in Jesus’ teachings. While Jesus gave “an objective standard of truth: himself,” Hubbard said “Know thyself and the truth shall set you free,” expressing the subjectivity and existentiality of truth in Scientology, compared to the centrality of Jesus in the pursuit of truth in Christianity. Martin and Zacharias further note that there are significant contradictions between the Bible and the writings of Scientology and that Jesus \"gave no credence to other scriptures or distorted views of God.\"\n\nR. Philip Roberts writes in \"The Apologetics Study Bible\" (2007): \"Scientology makes occasional reference to Jesus Christ in its writings and uses as its symbol a cross with starbursts at each end. But even though it refers to itself as a church and may at times use Christian terminology and symbolism, it is clearly nonbiblical in its view of God, Jesus, Scripture, salvation, and other important doctrines.\" Roberts goes on to note that \"Scientology does not accept the biblical concepts of Jesus as God the Word incarnate. It also places no emphasis on the substitutionary death and resurrection of Jesus. Rather, it views Jesus as a proponent of reincarnation and other Eastern mystical concepts.\" In his 2007 book \"The Bible Answer Book for Students\", author Hank Hanegraaff writes: \"Although the church claims to be compatible with Christianity, the two belief structures – one rooted in science fiction, the other in soteriological fact – are contradictory and can't be harmonized.\" Hanegraaff explains the nature of the Scientology concepts of auditing, engrams, and thetans, and concludes: \"Scientology is a rejection of the biblical doctrines of creation, original sin, and exclusive salvation through Jesus Christ.\"\n\nThe Church of Scientology claims that their belief system is different from Christianity because it is based “solely on reason” and that its members “possess a practical system of ethics and justice.” The church likewise claims that “anything religious teachers said or Buddha promised, even the visions of Christianity, are attained in Scientology as a result.” Muck, Netland and McDermott emphasize that this clearly shows that Scientology is incompatible with Christianity.\n\n\n"}

He struggled all his life with health problems. In 1938 he lost one lung due to tuberculosis. Still he studied electrical and wireless engineering.\n\nJinēndra Varṇī left home in 1957 and during his wanderings he joined the well-known Ganesh Varni, who ordained him a kṣullaka or junior monk. However, he was unable to follow the vratas of a \"kṣullaka\" due to his health problems and returned to being a Śrāvaka.\n\nIn 1983, approaching death, Jinēndra Varṇī began Sallekhana on 12 April 1983 and was ordained again a \"kṣullaka\" by Acharya Vidyasagar. He died in samādhi on 24 May 1983.\n\nSaman Suttam is the religious text created in 1974 by a committee consisting of representatives of each of the major sects of Jainism to reconcile the teachings of the sects. After a gap of about nearly two thousand years following composition of Tattvartha Sutra by Acharya Umasvati this was the first text to be recognized by all Jain sects. At Umaswati's time, although multiple orders existed, there was no clear sectarian division. By the 21st century however, Jainism had gradually been divided into several sects. For someone to compile a text at this time, and for it to be approved by all sects, was an exceptional event.\n\nJinendra Varni compiled a book, drawing from the original prakrit (ardha-magadhi etc.) texts. It was critically examined by several monks of different orders including Muni (now Acharya) Vidyanandaji, Muni (later Acharya) Sushil Kumarji, Muni Janakavijaya, Muni Nathamal (now Acharya Mahaprajna), as well as scholars like A.N. Upadhye, Darbari Lal Kothia, Agarachand Nahta etc. Finally in an assembly on 12 December 1974 it was approved by all.\n\nThe text includes 44 chapters with topics such as Mangal Sutra (on auspiciousness), Atma Sutra (on the soul), Moksha Marga Sutra (on the path to liberation) etc.\n\nThe following verse is taken from section 37 \"Anekanta-Sutra\".

Richard was also a documentary filmmaker who owned a film production company and was a friend of activist Philip Berrigan. Cusack graduated from Evanston Township High School in 1984, where he met Jeremy Piven, and spent a year at New York University before dropping out, saying that he had \"too much fire in his belly\".\n\nCusack began acting in films in the early 1980s. He made his breakout role in Rob Reiner's \"The Sure Thing\" (1985). He also starred in Cameron Crowe's directorial debut film, \"Say Anything...\" (1989). Cusack played a con artist in Stephen Frears' 1990 neo-noir film \"The Grifters\". After establishing New Crime Productions, Cusack co-wrote the screenplay for and starred in George Armitage's crime film \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" (1997).\n\nIn Spike Jonze's fantasy film \"Being John Malkovich\" (1999), Cusack played a puppeteer who finds a portal leading into the mind of the eponymous actor, John Malkovich.

He blogged on his opposition to the war in Iraq and his hatred for the Bush administration, calling its worldview \"depressing, corrupt, unlawful, and tragically absurd\". He also appeared in a June 2008 MoveOn.org advertisement, where he made the claim that George W. Bush and John McCain have the same governing priorities.\n\nCusack criticized the Obama administration for its drone policy in the Middle East and its support of the National Defense Authorization Act, and became one of the initial supporters of the Freedom of the Press Foundation in 2012. In June 2015, he stated in an interview with \"The Daily Beast\" that \"when you talk about drones, the American Empire, the NSA, civil liberties, attacks on journalism and whistleblowers, (Obama) is as bad or worse than Bush\". However, he later scolded the publication for misquoting him in order to make an interesting headline.\n\nIn 2015, Cusack, Daniel Ellsberg and Arundhati Roy met Edward Snowden, a fugitive from the US because of his leaks of classified information, at a Moscow hotel room. This meeting was converted into a book co-authored with Roy titled \"Things That Can and Cannot Be Said\".

{"id": "37492775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37492775", "title": "Misin tapa undong", "text": "Misin tapa undong\n\nThe movement to overthrow the worship of gods (Hangul: 미신 타파 운동 \"misin tapa undong\"), also described as movement to overthrow superstition, as 미신 \"misin\" is also translated after the movement, was a series of waves of demonisation and attempted violent uprooting of Korean shamanism and folk religion that took place in the period between the late 19th century and the 1980s. In modern Korean language, \"misin\" has the meaning of \"illusory\" or \"false spiritual beliefs\", and implies that gods and ancestors do not exist. This term was adopted from Japanese in the late 19th century, and largely emphasised by Christian missionaries to target Korean indigenous religion.\n\nWaves of \"misin tapa undong\" started in the 1890s with the rise of influence of Protestant preachers in Korea, and culminated during the New Community Movement of the 20th century, in South Korea. These movements destroyed most of the indigenous cults and shrines of folk religion, which were largely replaced by Christianity.\n\nProtestantism sunk deep roots in Korea in the 1890s, establishing a network of schools and hospitals. Protestant missionaries labeled indigenous religious practices and shamans as \"devil worship\". The missionaries led campaigns for the burning of idols, ancestral tablets, shamans' tools and clothes, and shrines. According to missionary reports, they were \"destroyed as were the books in Ephesus\". The missionaries also circulated stories about shamans who had converted to Christianity becoming themselves advocates of the destruction of the indigenous religion. The exorcistic struggle between a shaman and a Christian was made into a literary motif with Kim Tongni's colonial-period novella \"Portrait of a Shaman\".\n\nMissionaries found allies among Korean intellectuals in the final years of the Joseon kingdom. Together, they produced \"The Independent\" (\"Tongnip Sinmun\"), the first newspaper published in Korean language. The newspaper promoted iconoclasm and addressed government officials on the necessity to eradicate the indigenous religion.\n\nIn 1896, the police began to arrest shamans, destroy shrines and burn ritual tools. These events were acclaimed by \"The Independent\". At one point, the newspaper even came to criticise Buddhist monks.\n\nCampaigns against Korean indigenous religious traditions also accompanied Japan's annexation of the Korean peninsula. The Japanese had already equated secularisation with modernity in their own country. The colonial police harassed and sometimes arrested shamans, though official policies against Korean shamanism were neither monolithic nor consistent.\n\nFollowing the rhetoric of \"The Independent\" of the foregoing generation, the colonial government portrayed the indigenous religion and the shamans as irrational and wasteful, adding the notion that they were also unhygienic. Urban people adopted this rhetoric, seeking to distinguish themselves from their own rural origins. Migrants to the cities rejected \"gut\" healing and traditional medicine.\n\nThis paradigm would have become central to the projects for countryside development enacted in the independent South Korea.\n\nUnder Yi Seungman's government, shamans were routinely harassed and arrested by the police. Protestants in Jeju Island led a \"campaign against gods\", through which they tried to exterminate Jeju's religious tradition and its pantheon of 18,000 deities.\n\nIn the 1970s, the president Park Chung-hee started the New Community Movement (\"Saemaul Undong\"), a mass mobilisation intended to transform rural society in both form and spirit. Local communities were involved in a variety of public works.\n\nUnder the banner of such reform, a formal \"Movement to Overthrow Superstition\" (\"Misin Tapa Undong\") was started. With official encouragement, police and local leaders suppressed \"gut\" rites and local cults. They poured gasoline on village shrines and torched them, destroyed sacred trees, totem poles, and cairns, raided \"gut\" and arrested shamans. Contemporary commenters criticise the movement for having damaged the indigenous religious tradition and having caused much of the South Korean population to adopt the foreign Christian religion.\n\nIn the aftermath of the wave of \"anti-superstition movements\", Korean indigenous religion was severely weakened. Since the 1980s, however, traditional religion and shamanism have experienced a revival in South Korea. Since the 1990s, shamans started to be regarded as \"bearers of culture\". Today, Korean shamanism is recognised as a legitimate \"religion\" in South Korea, and there is widespread acknowledgement of \"Muism\" or \"Sindo\"—how shamanism is called—as the natural religion of the Koreans.\n\n\n"}

According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion. Freud discusses the feeling in his \"Future of an Illusion\" (1927) and \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.\n\nOn December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a letter to Freud:\n\nIn strict translation:\n\nFreud ends \"The Future of an Illusion\" with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of \"Civilization and Its Discontents\", answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.\n\nFreud argues that the \"oceanic feeling\", if it exists, is the preserved \"primitive ego-feeling\" from infancy. The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it. Therefore, the infant has no concept of a \"self\" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist. Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the \"oceanic feeling\" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.\n\n\"Neurotheology\" is a neologism that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like \"spiritual neuroscience\" or \"neuroscience of religion\". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as: the perception that time, fear or self-consciousness have dissolved; spiritual awe; oneness with the universe; ecstatic trance; sudden enlightenment; and altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhat Andrew B. Newberg and others \"discovered is that intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that Buddhists call \"oneness with the universe\".\"\n\n"}

Supporting the chief judge and the current order were the \"freemen\". The people voted, and the freemen won (). The king-men were unwilling to defend their country against the attacks from Amalickiah, which angered Moroni. Moroni requested Pahoran to give him the right to conscript the king-men or to have them executed for treason. Pahoran approved the request ().\n\nSeveral years later, Moroni writes to Pahoran to request reinforcements but with no success. Moroni complained to Pahoran and questioned his loyalty to his country. Pahoran responded that the capital, Zarahemla, was controlled by the king-men and that he had been exiled. He assures Moroni that he is not a traitor but wants only to preserve the liberty of his people (,). Moroni and Pahoran gathered an army against Pachus, the leader of the king-men. Pachus was slain, the king-men are executed, and Pahoran was restored to the judgement seat. Moroni and Pahoran work to drive the Lamanites from their land ().\n\nFinally, in around 53 BC, in the 39th year of the judgea, Pahoran dies, apparently while still the chief-judge ().\n\nPahoran was also the name of the previous Pahoran's son. When the aforementioned Pahoran had died, he left no one to fill in his place in the judgement-seat. Three of Pahoran's sons, by the names of \"Pahoran\", Paanchi, and Pacumeni, were left to contend for it, but the matter was settled in the 40th year of the reign of the judges, or around 52 BC, by a vote: Pahoran, the son of Pahoran, won it. Pacumeni, when he saw that he lost, accepted the outcome and supported his brother, but Paanchi, the third brother, would not. He tried to rebel but was executed according to law. His followers were so angry at that that one of them, a man named Kishkumen, went to the judgement-seat and murdered Pahoran. He then escaped the clutches of Pahoran's servants and fled.\n\nPahoran was succeeded by his brother, Pacumeni.\n\nThe king-men were a group of Nephites who sought to overthrow Judge Pahoran and install a king to rule the land. Some Nephites dissented from the current government and believed Chief-Judge Pahoran should change some laws, but Pahoran refused. The dissenters, called king-men, then wanted a king to be appointed to govern instead of a chief-judge. However a public vote overruled them, and the rest of the people called themselves \"freemen\" to distinguish their position and their desire to retain their religious freedoms. Pahoran kept his position and there was no bloodshed.\n\nMeanwhile, Amalickiah gathered an army of Lamanites to attack the Nephites. The freemen prepared to battle, but the king-men refused to defend their country. Captain Moroni, the leader of the Nephite armies, was angry from the king-men's stubbornness and petitioned Pahoran for legal authority to compel the king-men to defend their country or be executed. By popular consent and the approval of Pahoran, Moroni and his armies quashed the king-men's rebellion, killing about 4000 men; the remainder of the king-men yielded to Moroni and took up arms in their country's defense.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52874", "title": "People of the Book", "text": "People of the Book\n\nPeople of the Book/Scripture ( ′Ahl al-Kitāb) is an Islamic term referring to Jews, Christians, and Sabians and sometimes applied to members of other religions such as Zoroastrians. It is also used in Judaism to refer to the Jewish people and by members of some Christian denominations to refer to themselves.\nThe Quran uses the term in reference to Jews, Christians and Sabians in a variety of contexts, from religious polemics to passages emphasizing community of faith between those who possess monotheistic scriptures. The term was later extended to other religious communities that fell under Muslim rule, including even polytheistic Indians. Historically, these communities were subject to the dhimma contract in an Islamic state.\n\nIn Judaism the term \"People of the Book\" (Hebrew: עם הספר, \"Am HaSefer\") has come to refer to the Jewish people and the Torah.\n\nMembers of some Christian denominations, such as the Baptists, Methodists, Seventh-day Adventist Church, as well as Puritans and Shakers, have embraced the term \"People of the Book\" in reference to themselves.\n\nIn the Quran the term \"people of the book\" refers to Jews, Christians, and Sabians. The scriptures referred to in the Quran are the Torah (\"at-tawraat\"), the Psalms (\"al-zabur\") and the Gospel (\"al-injiil\").\n\nThe Quran emphasizes the community of faith between possessors of monotheistic scriptures, and occasionally pays tribute to the religious and moral virtues of communities that have received earlier revelations, calling on Muhammad to ask them for information. More often, reflecting the refusal of Jews and Christians in Muhammad's environment to accept his message, the Quran stresses their inability to comprehend the message they possess but do not put into practice and to appreciate that Muhammad's teaching fulfills that message. The People of the Book are also referenced in the \"jizya\" verse (9:29), which has received varied interpretations.\n\nThe use of the term was later extended to Zoroastrians, Samaritans, Mandeans, and even polytheistic Indians.\n\nIslamic scholars differ on whether Hindus are People of the Book. The Islamic conquest of India necessitated that the definition be revised, as most India's inhabitants were followers of the Indian religions. Many of the Muslim clergy of India considered Hindus as people of the book, and from Muhammad bin Qasim to Aurangzeb, Muslim rulers were willing to consider Hindus as people of the book. Many Muslims did not treat Hindus as pagans or idol-worshipers, although Hinduism does not include Adam, Eve, nor the various prophets of Abrahamic religions.\n\nBuddhism does not explicitly recognize a monotheistic God or the concept of prophet-hood. Muslims however had at one point accorded them the status of \"people of the Book\", and Al-Biruni wrote of Buddha as the prophet \"Burxan\".\n\n\"Dhimmi\" is a historical term referring to the status accorded to People of the Book living in an Islamic state. The word literally means \"protected person.\" According to scholars, dhimmis had their rights fully protected in their communities, but as citizens in the Islamic state, had certain restrictions, and it was obligatory for them to pay the jizya tax, which complemented the zakat, or alms, paid by the Muslim subjects. Dhimmis were excluded from specific duties assigned to Muslims, and did not enjoy certain political rights reserved for Muslims, but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.\n\nUnder sharia, the dhimmi communities were usually subjected to their own special laws, rather than some of the laws which were applicable only to the Muslim community. For example, the Jewish community in Medina was allowed to have its own Halakhic courts, and the Ottoman millet system allowed its various dhimmi communities to rule themselves under separate legal courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved religious groups outside of their own community, or capital offences. Dhimmi communities were also allowed to engage in certain practices that were usually forbidden for the Muslim community, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork.\n\nHistorically, dhimmi status was originally applied to Jews, Christians, and Sabians. This status later also came to be applied to Zoroastrians, Hindus, Jains and Buddhists. Moderate Muslims generally reject the dhimma system as inappropriate for the age of nation-states and democracies.\n\nThirty-one times in the Koran Jews are referred to as \"people of the book.\" However before the rise of Islam, during Biblical times, Levitical scribes redacted and canonized the book of books. In the transition from what has been called \"text to tradition,\" Efforts are made to try to reconstruct the archival repositories for these ancient textual collections in addition to sifrei Yichusin (genealogical texts). The Babylonian Talmud Baba Batra 14b-14b describes the order of biblical books. Indeed Rashi himself comments on the mishnaic statement, \"Moses received the Torah from Sinai\" by noting since the text does not say \"ha-torah\" (the written torah) but Torah (in general) this refers to both the written torah (24 books of the Old Testament) and the oral torah, which in Rabbinic theology are co-terminous, as suggested by Soloveitchik who notes a recent trend in the Artscroll generation to eclipse oral transmission with written translations. Scholars of antiquity and the early middle ages do know about the canonization process of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and the redaction processes of the Talmudim and Midrashim. Thus the interplay between written text and orality is essential in trying to reconstruct the textual collections of Jewish texts in the middle ages and modernity.\n\nRabbinic tradition has demonstrated a reverence, respect, and love for sacred divinely revealed \"text,\" both written and oral in the process of the chain of transmission (the masorah). Indeed the metaphor of the book is marshaled in Talmudic Tractate Rosh Hashanah, that on Rosh Hashanah the fate of each person for the year is written, on Yom Kippur sealed, and on Hoshanah Rabbah the angels of the heavenly court deliver the verdict to God's archive.\n\nThe Hai Gaon in 998 in Pumbeditah comments, \"Three possessions should you prize- a field, a friend, and a book.\" However the Hai Gaon mentions that a book is more reliable than even friends for sacred books span across time, indeed can express external ideas, that transcend time itself.\n\nThe Spanish philosopher, physician, and poet Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi writes of the importance of books by commenting, \"My pen is my harp and my lyre, my library is my garden and orchard.\"\n\nThe Provencal scholar Rabbi Yehudah ibn Tibbon (Adler recension) further elaborates on the importance of his library by commenting, \"Make books your companions; let your bookshelves be your gardens: bask in their beauty, gather their fruit, pluck their roses, take their spices and myrrh. And when your soul be wary, change form one garden to garden, and from one prospect to prospect.\"\n\nThe Spanish statesman Rabbi Shmuel ha-Nagid writes, \"the wise of heart will abandon ease and pleasures for in his library he will find treasures.\" Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud writes in his sefer ha-qabbala about rabbi Shmuel ha-Nagid that he had sofrim who copied Mishnah and Talmudim, and he used to donated these commissioned core texts to students who could not afford to purchase them.\"\n\nRabbi Yitzchak ben Yosef of Corbeil (ca 1280, France) in his Sefer Mitzvot Qatan composed in 1276 outlines a detailed strategy for the dissemination of his texts by asserting that every community should finance a copy of his halkhic code and keep it for public consultation.\n\nRabbi Shimon ben Zemach Duran (Tashbaz) in his introduction to his halakhic code, Zohar HaRakiah, writes, \"When the wise man lies down with his fathers he leaves behind him a treasured and organized blessing: books that enlighten like the brilliance of the firmament (Daniel 12:3) and that extend peace like an eternal flowing river (ISa 66:12).\"\n\nThe love and reverence for Jewish books is seen in Jewish law. It is not permissible for a sacred Jewish text to lie on the ground and if by accident a book is dropped to the floor it should be picked up and given a kiss. A Jewish book is not to be left open unless it is being read, nor is it to be held upside down. It is not permitted to place a book of lesser sanctity on top of a book of higher holiness, so for example one must never place any book on top of the Tanakh. If one says to someone, \"Please hand me this book,\" the book should be given with the right hand and not with the left hand.\" If two men are walking and one who is carrying a sacred books should be given the courtesy of entering and leaving the room first, as the second is enjoined to pursue knowledge.\" Rabbi David ibn Zimra of the 16th century comments that \"if one buys a new book he should recite the benediction of the She-Heheyanu.\"\n\nIn the early Christian experience the New Testament was added to the whole Old Testament, which after Jerome's translation tended more and more to be bound up as a single volume, and was accepted as a unified \"locus\" of authority: \"\"the\" Book\", as some contemporary authors refer to it. Many Christian missionaries in Africa, Asia and in the New World, developed writing systems for indigenous people and then provided them with a written translation of the Bible. As a result of this work, \"People of the Book\" became the usual vernacular locution to refer to Christians among many African, Asian, and Native American people of both hemispheres. The work of organizations such as the Wycliffe Bible Translators and the United Bible Societies has resulted in Bibles being available in 2,100 languages. This fact has further promoted an identification with the phrase among Christians themselves. Christian converts among evangelized cultures, in particular, have the strongest identification with the term \"People of the Book\". This arises because the first written text produced in their native language, as with the English-speaking peoples, has often been the Bible. Many denominations, such as Baptists and the Methodist Church, which are notable for their mission work, have therefore embraced the term \"People of the Book\".\n\nAs stated on its official world website, the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA) also embraces the term People of the Book. As also noted in its official flagship publication \"Adventist World\" (February 2010 edition), it is claimed that prominent Islamic leaders have endorsed Seventh-day Adventists as the Qur'an's true People of the Book.\n\n\n\n"}

Spatika Lingam is called sphatika Sivalingam(Tamil - படிகக்கல் லிங்கம்) () in Sanskrit. Sphatikam () in Sanskrit means \"made of crystal, crystalline\", referring to quartz and alum.\n\nSphatikam is a semi-precious gemstone. There are many different varieties of sphatikam. High quality quartz crystals are single-crystal silica with optical or electronic properties that make them suitable for hardstone carvings. The Hindu temples in South India use this semi-precious mineral for making Shiva Lingams. Sphatikam beads are made from translucent rose quartz are cut and polished as beads. Each bead is about ten millimeters in diameter. It is good conductor of heat. Hence people wear sphatikam jewelry (mala) to keep their body cool. Some other people claim that these beads have healing properties.\n\nIn Hindu Shiva temples, Saiva Agamas(Shaivism's Agamas) allows worshiping Lord Shiva in the form of Sphatika Lingam or Crystal Lingam. The Saiva Agamas says \"one can worship this Great God Shiva in the form of a Lingam made of mud or sand, of cow dung or wood, of bronze or black granite stone. But the purest and most sought-after form is the quartz crystal (Sphatika), a natural stone not carved by man but made by nature, gathered molecule by molecule over hundreds, thousands or millions of years, grown as a living body grows, but infinitely more slowly. Such a creation of nature is itself a miracle worthy of worship.\"\n\nSphatika Lingam is representing the icon of Lord Nataraja. The Sphatika Lingams are protected in the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Shiva. Hindu priests offer milk, water, or vibhuti abhisheka to the Sphatika Lingam.

He was embroiled in a scandal in 1996 and accused of swindling US$7 million from his followers. He was convicted of fraud in 1997 and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. His verdict was later overturned in 2003 by the high court which cited freedom of religion was protected under Taiwan's constitution. Sung claims to have supernatural powers such as the ability to appear anywhere at anytime (fēnshēn body-double manifestations) ), possessing divine healing powers and calls himself \"Yuzhou Guangmingti\" (宇宙光明體; lit. Cosmic Luminous Body).\n\nSung was born in Xiaogang village, Kaohsiung County in the Taiwan Province on 17 September 1948. He is the oldest of six children; four sisters and one brother. His father was very adept at making money and worked at a wholesale fish market. His family were the first in their village to own a television and telephone.\n\nHis eldest younger sister Sung Pao-lien (宋寶蓮) recalls Sung had developed mysophobia at the age of three and would eat in the corner and wash his own bowl and chopsticks. Their father had high expectations of Sung but Sung didn't like to study so their father would get angry and beat Sung with a wooden stick but Sung was very gentle, a boy of few words and didn't get upset nor talked back. Sung recalls it was at the age of seven that he saw a beam of light follow him. When he told his classmate, they'd laugh at him. When he told his father, his father said he is crazy. Sung became a social outcast due to poor grades and being abnormal.\n\nAfter highschool, Sung left home and studied at Tung Fang Design Institute, from that moment, he tried to seek answers and started to read Plato but couldn't comprehend it, then he read Socrates and Aristotle but still couldn't find an explanation for the beam of light he saw as a child.\n\nAfter finishing military conscription service, Sung's father gave him NT$1 million to start a shipping business at Taichung harbor. Sung worked there for nine and a half years. His sister, Pao-lien, said she always worried about Sung because he was too kind and not cut out for business so she was taken by surprise when he became a religious master.\n\nSung went into hiding for two years after writing a bad check and was later imprisoned for two years.\n\nDuring Sung's time in jail he saw that beam of light outside the windows and says when he was being released from jail at the age of 39 he saw the three Chinese characters Sung Chi-li (宋七力) written in the skies and changed his name to it. It was during this time that Sung says he possessed the \"fenshen\" ability. In 1987 when martial law was lifted in Taiwan, Sung, who was 39 at the time and out of prison, saw an opportunity and began to hang around tea houses, talking and demonstrating his skills. As word spread about his abilities, he was noticed by someone who then spent large amounts of money to support Sung and helped him take photos. In 1990, Sung founded the Academy of the Union of Humans and Nature and began recruiting members in Taipei. A year later he founded the Sung Chi-li Miracle Association () and members believed Sung was greater than Buddha in his past life. In the nine years leading up to 1996, Sung had amassed followers and supporters numbering in the tens of thousands in nine years, including financiers and politicians. At his prime, Sung would draw large numbers of followers who came and went in groups of cars. Sung would tip them tens of thousands of NTD. He recalls giving one elderly flower seller NT$50,000. He said when he was on the run for bouncing a check, his friend refused to lend him NT$500 and he vowed he would not to become a miser himself. The first time a Next Digital reporter, 賀照縈 (He Chao-ying), did an interview, Sung handed the interviewer an envelop containing NT$10,000 cash, telling him it was a gesture of good will that the reporter's boss need not know, to which the interviewer declined to accept the gift. At the last interview, Sung tried to give the interview and his three colleagues an iPhone 6 which they also declined. The interviewer noted Sung seemed desolate so he consoled Sung.\n\nThe scandal, known locally in Taiwan as the Sung Chi-li Incident (), was first uncovered by Melody Chu Mei-fong, then Taipei city councillor who accused Sung of conning disciples by selling them high-priced photos of him demonstrating his supernatural powers and that by worshiping the pictures, his followers could become a buddha. She also accused Frank Hsieh, who was legal consultant of Sung, of taking NT$16 million in political donations from Sung and that Hsieh's wife helped with compiling and publishing books for Sung. Sung and 16 defendants were then sued by former followers and he was indicted on charges of deception for obtaining NT$3 billion in donations by claiming to have supernatural powers by which he could help people. Sung was arrested on 13 October 1996 \n\nDue to a string of religious cult scandals making news headlines such as Sung Chi-li swindling NT$3 billion and Master Miao Tien swindling NT$2 billion, the Executive Yuan organized for the first time a forum to discuss the role and regulation of religion in Taiwan. The forum was held in Taipei on 8 November 1996 and attended by 110 senior government officials, religious leaders and scholars from 12 religious communities. The forum blamed the public's ignorance that allowed cult swindling to thrive.\n\nOn 23 October 1997, Sung and two assistants Chen Cheng-tung (鄭振冬) and Lo Cheng-hung (羅正弘) were convicted of fraud. Sung and Chen were sentenced to seven years, while Lo was sentenced to two years prison. Frank Hsieh's wife and 13 others were acquitted of deception. During police investigations, Sung insisted he had supernatural powers and could make anyone do as he willed. Police challenged him by inviting him to demonstrate his powers in public but Sung failed to make a standing police offer to sit down. Sung's divine photos were proven to be doctored using basic computer graphic skills.\n\nThe case gained public notoriety when Frank Hsieh, who was a lawyer and legal consultant to Sung at the time, and his wife Yu Fang-chih (游芳枝), were reportd to be long time followers of Sung. Yu went so far as to profess personally witnessing Sung's spirit leave his body at will. In 2005, Sung told TVBS cable news that in 2004 at a gathering in a follower's home, he had taken Hsieh on an outer body tour of Paris with a stopover at the Eifel Tower where they could touch the cast iron. Hsieh temporarily disappeared from the political scene after it was alleged he had taken inappropriate political donations from Sung and faced fierce criticism from the public over his membership in Sung's cult \n\nSung admitted to police in charge of the investigation that he lied about having supernatural powers and police demolished the Miracle Association Memorial Hall, his Transmogrification Society's main shrine, on the grounds that it was built illegally. The shine contained faked photos of Sung in various states of \"fenshen\" which were used by his associates to fool followers into believing Sung's divinity. Sung also made donations to political parties.\n\nIn 1998, Sung founded a new religion, the Great Sun Sect whose members are believed to be in the hundreds but an accurate number has not been determined () \n\nAlthough the scandal had almost hurt Hsieh's political career, he surprised everyone by winning the 1998 Kaohsiung City mayoral election despite being ridiculed and criticized for his link to Sung. The high court trial was reopened a few days after Hsieh's election victory.\n\nOn 28 January 2003, the High Court overturned Sung's fraud conviction citing that the constitution protected Sung's practices under the freedom of religion which banned the law from defining and intervening in people's beliefs. This despite prosecutors pointing out Sung had admitted to lying about his mystic powers. Under the protection of freedom of religion, the High Court decided that faith was more important than authenticity and that not only would it be difficult to prove Sung did not have supernatural abilities but that also accusers' testimonies were not sufficient to prove that Sung had defrauded them of money. Frank Hsieh was quoted as saying \"\"Religion cannot be analysed by reason.\" \n\nIn 2004, with the financial support of his followers in Australia, Sung opened a US$3 million \"divine photo shop\" to display his divine photos.\n\nIn an interview with Next Media in 2008, Sung says he is a mysophobe and has never had any sexual relations.\n\nIn 2015, SET News interviewed Sung regarding his supernatural powers, the reporter asked Sung if he could demonstrate his powers especially his \"fenshen\" ability. Sung objected and insisted that only followers who have awakened their third eye could see the supernatural. He also demonstrated his abilities of being able to control his followers' bodies with his mind, to which his followers played along, but it had no effect on the reporter and cameraman. Next Digital also followed up and Sung admitted he is a controversial figure but that he was not afraid of punishment because he has no family and no children to worry about.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42567340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42567340", "title": "Take Me to Church", "text": "Take Me to Church\n\n\"Take Me to Church\" is a song by Irish musician Hozier from his debut extended play (EP) \"Take Me to Church\" (2013) –– originally released as a free download in September 2013, featuring original recordings & mixes of songs \"Take Me To Church\", \"Like Real People Do\", \"Angel Of Small Death And The Codeine Scene\" and \"Cherry Wine\" –– as well as his later self-titled debut album (2014). The song was released as his debut single 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier's frustration with the Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. The song first caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track: Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.\n\nThe song's music video has contributed to its widespread popularity. The clip, directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of small production company Feel Good Lost, follows the relationship between two men and the subsequent violent homophobic backlash. Upon its YouTube release in September 2013, the video quickly began to go viral, leading to Hozier's subsequent license with Columbia Records US and Island Records UK.\n\nIn 2014, the song achieved widespread global popularity, topping the charts in 12 countries and reaching the top 10 in 21 other territories. Aided by music platforms Shazam and Spotify to become a rock radio hit in the US, the song spent 23 consecutive weeks at the top of the Hot Rock Songs chart, tied with Imagine Dragons \"Radioactive\" as the longest-running #1 in its chart-history (at the time), later crossing over to the all-genre \"Billboard\" Hot 100, where it peaked at #2 in December 2014. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. The song has been certified five times platinum in the US.\n\nOn 16 April 2016, Hozier released the original \"Take Me Church EP\" on special edition 12-inch vinyl picture disc for Record Store Day UK; this was the first time the EP was available as a physical release.\n\nIn 2013, Hozier was a struggling musician, often seen in Dublin-area open mic nights. During this period, he penned \"Take Me to Church\" at his parents' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland, and recorded a rough demo in their attic with a programmed backing track. He wrote the song after a bad breakup. \"The vocals were recorded in my attic at 2 o'clock in the morning. So it's a real homemade job\", he later remarked.\n\nIt caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, who paired him with producer Rob Kirwan. The song was overdubbed with live instrumentation, but the original demo vocals remained, as Kirwan found them \"powerful\" enough to remain.\n\nFor the Grammys, Hozier performed the song with Annie Lennox, along with Annie's cover of I Put A Spell On You.\n\nLyrically, \"Take Me to Church\" is a metaphor, with the protagonist comparing his lover to religion. The song grew out of Hozier's frustration with the Catholic Church's teachings which, although he himself was raised in the Protestant Quaker faith, dominated the social and political outlook of the Irish state. \"Growing up, I always saw the hypocrisy of the Catholic church\", Hozier said in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\". \"The history speaks for itself and I grew incredibly frustrated and angry. I essentially just put that into my words.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"The Irish Times\", Hozier stated,\n\nI found the experience of falling in love or being in love was a death, a death of everything. You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment–if you see yourself for a moment through their eyes–everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense.\n\nIn an interview with \"New York\" magazine, he elaborated:\n\nSexuality, and sexual orientation – regardless of orientation – is just natural. An act of sex is one of the most human things. But an organization like the church, say, through its doctrine, would undermine humanity by successfully teaching shame about sexual orientation – that it is sinful, or that it offends God. The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.\n\nThe song draws inspiration from atheist author Christopher Hitchens and paraphrases the poet Fulke Greville's verse \"Created sick, commanded to be sound\".\n\nThe song rose in prominence alongside its viral music video, attracting A&R representatives from major labels in a bidding war to sign Hozier. He was signed by Justin Eshak of Columbia Records, who later opined that the song became a hit due to a shift on pop radio, spearheaded by Sam Smith: \"The music is connecting because when it gets on the air it's such a sharp juxtaposition to the existing material on top 40 radio.\" The song first experienced chart success in his native Ireland, climbing the charts in October 2013 and eventually reached number 2 on Irish Singles Chart.\n\nIn May 2014, Hozier performed the song on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". It was sent to US modern rock radio on 24 June 2014 by Columbia Records. It eventually reached number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks in December 2014 and January 2015, behind Taylor Swift's \"Blank Space\", while becoming his first top-five single there. As of July 2015, the song has sold 4,270,000 copies in the US. The track has since reached top 5 in many other countries including peaking at number 2 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe song initially attracted US attention in Nashville via an adult album alternative radio station. From there, it became the top song for the area on music identification application Shazam, which led to its appearance on a local top 40 station. \"Take Me to Church\" achieved widespread popularity in the United States between the summer and fall of 2014.\n\nDespite the song's popularity on YouTube, the song achieved more listens on Spotify, becoming the service's most-streamed song of 2014, achieving 87 million listens.\n\nThe concept for the \"Take Me to Church\" music video was the result of a collaboration between Hozier, Brendan Canty and his writing partner Emmet O'Brien. It was directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of Feel Good Lost and was released on 25 September 2013. The video, shot in grayscale on location at Inniscarra Dam in Cork, Ireland, follows a same-sex relationship in Russia and the violently homophobic backlash that ensues when the community learns of one of the men's sexuality. The video had a budget of 500 Euros. The song went viral following its release. \"I remember someone texting me to say it was getting 10,000 views an hour\", he recalled. The song achieved 230,000 YouTube views within two weeks.\n\nHozier stated, \"The song was always about humanity at its most natural, and how that is undermined ceaselessly by religious organizations and those who would have us believe they act in its interests. What has been seen growing in Russia is no less than nightmarish. I proposed bringing these themes into the story and Brendan liked the idea.\"\n\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Streaming\n\n"}

{"id": "5940160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5940160", "title": "Teancum", "text": "Teancum\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Teancum () was a Nephite military leader. He is described in the Book of Alma between Alma 50:35 and Alma 62:40 (inclusive). According to LDS teachings, he is known for the assassinations of King Amalickiah and the subsequent assassination of Amalickiah's brother, Ammoron, seven years later. The Book of Mormon states that in time he proved to be a great chief captain in the Nephite army. He also appears as a major character in the Tennis Shoes Adventure Series, a series of LDS fiction novels.\n\nThe Book of Mormon narrative states that between the years between 71 and 68 BC, there was much peace in the land of the Nephites. The exception was a dispute that began to grow in the land of Lehi and the land of Morianton, which were neighboring lands. The inhabitants of the land of Morianton claimed ownership of a part of the land of Lehi. The dispute grew and eventually led to the inhabitants of Morianton attacking the inhabitants of Lehi, led by a man called Morianton. The people of Lehi fled from the attack to the camp of Captain Moroni.\n\nMorianton's forces were afraid that Captain Moroni and his army would attack, so they changed their course and attempted to take the land in the North. Captain Moroni caught hold of the plan when one of Morianton's maid servants, whom he had physically abused, escaped from him and allied herself with Captain Moroni. As a preventative measure, Captain Moroni dispatched a contingent of soldiers led by Teancum in order to stop Morianton and his people from fleeing to the North. In the battle which ensued, Teancum killed Morianton and defeated his army, afterward taking prisoners. He then made an oath with the prisoners, allowing them to go back to their homes if they would \"keep the peace. \"\n\nLater in the narrative, the leader of the Lamanite army, a military leader called Amalickiah had been taking possession of many Nephite cities which were located on the eastern borders by the seashore. As his army was moving North and capturing Nephite cities, Teancum was marching south with his army attempting to take back those cities. The two armies came to a head on the seashore.\n\nThe soldiers of Teancum, skilled and well trained in the ways of warfare, quickly gained the upper hand on Amalickiah's armies during the day and drove them back toward the beaches. Amalickiah's army then pitched their tents on the beach and slept for the night. During the night, Teancum and his servant secretly infiltrated the camps of the Lamanites. After a brief search for the tent of the Lamanite king, Tenacum threw a javelin at Amalickiah, which struck him in the heart, killing him instantly. Teancum then successfully fled back to his camp without being detected.\n\nUpon returning to his camp, the victorious Teancum awakened his armies and caused them to prepare for battle with the Lamanite forces. When the Lamanite army awoke that morning, they found their leader dead, which caused the army to retreat back to the city of Mulek for protection.\n\nTeancum was next sent to attack the city of Mulek, a Nephite city located south of Bountiful that was captured by the Lamanites. Mulek had been fortified by Captain Moroni before falling into the hands of Amalickiah and thus was a stronghold for the Lamanite forces. Immediately following the demise of Amalickiah, the Lamanite army that was contending with Teancum's army abandoned their attempt to capture Bountiful and retreated to the city of Mulek.\n\nWhile Teancum was employed in preparing for war, he received orders from Captain Moroni to attempt a retake of the city of Mulek. However, upon marching with his armies into Mulek, he observed that his army was not prepared to contend with the Lamanites in their fortified city. He then returned to Bountiful and awaited the arrival of Captain Moroni and his forces.\n\nWhen Captain Moroni later arrived with his armies, he called many chief captains of the Nephite forces together for a war council. A strategy was then devised that would cause Teancum to take a small force and march near the city as a decoy while Captain Moroni and his forces would retake Mulek. The operation was successful and the leader of this Zoramite-Lamanite army was killed. The city of Mulek was again in the possession of the Nephites.\n\nThe Book of Mormon states that a large battle occurred after the retaking of the city of Nephihah from the Lamanites. In the narrative, Teancum's forces marched to meet the Lamanites with the armies of Lehi and Captain Moroni. Both sides were greatly fatigued because of the long march. Teancum was angered by Amalickiah and Ammoron for starting the war. He believed if he were to kill Ammoron, the Lamanite army would accept defeat. He, in striking similarity with his previous encounter with Amalickiah, went out into the night and let himself over the wall using a rope. He crept into Ammoron's tent, threw a javelin at him, and struck him near the heart. The blow, however, was not immediately fatal and Ammoron cried out, awakening his servants. Teancum fled, but the servants of the king chased him and killed him. His death was greatly mourned by Captain Moroni and Lehi.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Teancum is also the name of a Nephite town that played an important role during the war in Mormon's time. The narrative states that the Lamanites drove the Nephites out of Teancum and took possession of it.\n\n\n"}

Grace was a medium who claimed to have received the teachings from a spirit in the higher realms named White Eagle. The Lodge is a present-day school that teaches their beliefs in a manner suited to the modern world. Its work is to help humanity develop its true spiritual nature, and uses the symbol of the six pointed Christ Star to radiate Peace and Healing to those in need. Healing, both absent and contact, meditation, yoga and astrology are taught and practised. The White Eagle Publishing Trust distributes the teachings of White Eagle worldwide in many languages.

Lone absent healers work from home on their own, and tuning into the Angels of Healing they call on the patients' names and pray for them. Following a set form of service, they envisage colours being gently applied to psychic centres or \"chakras\" by healing angels. Thousands of people and animals are on such lists worldwide at any given time. A description of the method used by the Lodge in its healing is found in \"A Healers Journey Into Light\"\nby Lorna Todd.\nMembers can also work in absent healing groups led by an experienced Healer. There are specific groups working to heal animals.\n\nTeaching astrology has long been an important aspect of the Lodge work. Joan Hodgson (née Cooke) developed a beginners’ correspondence course in 1941, and wrote a series of articles for the early Lodge journal \"Angelus.\" These were published by the White Eagle Publ. Trust as \"Wisdom in the Stars\". Since then she wrote several other books over several decades, was on the UK Faculty of Astrological Studies at its foundation (a non-Lodge group) and she had many clients. Her daughter, Rose Elliot subsequently also became an astrologer.\n\nIn 1976 the Lodge expanded Joan's work into a \"School\" and she was active until her death in 1995. The school now has Simon Bentley as its Principal, he had worked closely with her for over a decade. Based at the main centre in \"New Lands\" it holds an annual conference, publishes a journal \"Altair\", conducts other day events, still runs correspondence courses, and does horoscope readings for clients, in all these using a spiritual focus, not identical with the various forms of \"Esoteric\" astrology.\n\nJean Le Fevre, who had been active in the Crowborough Daughter Lodge (U.K.) moved to the United States and was a key figure in enabling the construction of the Temple of the Golden Rose in Montgomery, Texas, where the organisation is registered as the \"Church of the White Eagle Lodge.\" The Lodge work there is open to liaison with Native spiritual teachings.\n\nWhite Eagle's teaching is set out in around sixty published books, of which a great many are in print. Best known is \"The Quiet Mind\", first published in 1972. \nFor a lavishly illustrated account of seven decades, the most detailed work is \"The White Eagle Lodge story : seventy-five years of work with the light,\" told by friends of White Eagle across the years (Liss, Hampshire, 2008; previous edition, \"The Story of the White Eagle Lodge\" Liss, Hampshire, 1986).\nAn account of the White Eagle Lodge in some detail is given by Ingrid Lind in 'The White Eagle Inheritance' (London, Thorsons, 1984) and by Colum Hayward in 'Eyes of the Spirit: working with a Spiritual Teacher' (Liss, Hampshire, 2008)\nSee John Bowker, \"White Eagle Lodge,\" in \"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\", 1997.\n\n"}
{"id": "38244892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38244892", "title": "UrbanPromise", "text": "UrbanPromise\n\nUrbanPromise is an organization in Camden, New Jersey, born out of the community's need to address the problems of intergenerational poverty and the incarceration of youth.\n\nThe mission of UrbanPromise is to equip children and young adults with the skills necessary for academic achievement, life management, personal growth and success. Founded in 1988 by Bruce Main and his wife Pamela in the basement of an unused Baptist church, UrbanPromise began with just one adult staff, 12 college-aged volunteers, and an annual budget of only $12,000.\n\nUrbanPromise began as a spin-off of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education (EAPE), and was directly inspired by EAPE founder Dr. Tony Campolo, renowned speaker, author, and sociologist known for his call for Christians to seek justice for the poor and liberation for the oppressed.\n\nToday, the organization has grown to offer myriad youth educational and developmental programming, including an alternative high school, an elementary/middle school, after-school programs, summer camps, teen job training, boat building, environmental and experiential learning, and a host of other enrichment activities.\n\nUrbanPromise challenges Camden youth to develop their academic, social, creative, and leadership potential. From humble beginnings, the organization now boasts a budget of $3.6 million — primarily generated from individual donors who give $500 to $10,000/year — employs more than 50 full-time staff, and serves 600 local youth and families annually. UrbanPromise also engages 500 volunteers annually: 50 college interns, 350 work group individuals, and around 100 local residents.\n\nThe goal of each UrbanPromise program relates to the development of healthy and positive relationships. Many of the organization's employees and volunteers are UrbanPromise graduates who have returned to Camden to serve their community. Staff work with a group of 50 college-aged interns who commit one to two years to community service in the city of Camden. These interns work with local teens in UrbanPromise's AfterSchool Programs and Summer Camps; teens are employed as counselors, tutors, and mentors through the organization's StreetLeader program.\n\nThe majority of children in Camden, New Jersey qualify as \"at-risk,\" which —as defined by the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention — means they are exposed to high levels of risk in their families, homes, communities, and social environments to such a degree that it could lead to educational failure, school dropout, or involvement in juvenile delinquency.\n\nProgramming at UrbanPromise is scheduled during the time when youth are most at risk of involvement in crime and violence — between 3 and 9 PM. Through a variety of activities, children and teens are encouraged to avoid negative influences and focus on school through mentoring; community service; life skills classes; tutoring; SAT/ACT prep courses; classes in reading, writing, and math; groups focused on social development; and performing and visual arts.\n\nUrbanPromise's two schools — particularly its UrbanPromise Academy high school — serve some of the highest risk youth in the city. Many come to the organization after dropping out of public school or involvement in the juvenile justice system. Nevertheless, in 2011, UrbanPromise's elementary and middle school saw 98% attendance; and 100% percent of UrbanPromise Academy 2011 and 2012 seniors graduated on time. Of UrbanPromise's 2012 graduating class, 98% have gone on to pursue post-secondary education. Historically, UrbanPromise graduates have had an 85% college completion rate.\n\nUrbanPromise also offers experiential learning activities through its UrbanTrekkers program. Through hands-on learning and outdoor experiences, UrbanTrekkers connects children and teens to the natural world and diverse communities throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nThe UrbanPromise Camden model has inspired replications around the country and across the globe. UrbanPromise sites within the United States are located in Charlotte, NC, Wilmington, DE, Miami, FL, Trenton, NJ, Little Rock, AR, and Birmingham, AL. These sites minister annually to 457 children and youth in after school programs. There were 827 in attendance among 14 summer camps offered by the various other cities' programs in 2016.\n\nSites have also been launched and sustained in Canada, Honduras, Malawi, Uganda, the Dominican Republic, and Liberia. Each location uses its own local resources, donors, and staff to replicate the Camden-based UrbanPromise. Approximately 2,000 children and youth currently participate in these sites' after school programs, summer camps, feeding programs, and girls' empowerment initiatives. Three private high schools, so far serving approximately 275 students, as well as two homes for orphaned children have been launched in Malawi.\n\nOver the last decade, UrbanPromise has received support from several notable individuals, including ABC News' Diane Sawyer. Since her 2007 20/20 special \"Waiting on the World to Change,\" which focused on poverty in Camden and highlighted UrbanPromise, Diane has continued to stay connected to the organization. In September 2012, she was the keynote speaker at UrbanPromise's 25th Anniversary Banquet held at the Scottish Rite Theatre in Collingswood, New Jersey. Her relationship with UrbanPromise was featured as the cover story in the November 2012 edition of SJ Magazine.\n\nAdditional supporters include: David Kim, concertmaster of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company, and authors Shane Claiborne, Philip Yancey and Brian McLaren.\n\nDiane Sawyer <br>\nTony Campolo<br>\nDavid Kim<br>\nShane Claiborne<br>\nPhilip Yancey<br>\nBrian McLaren <br>\nDenise Morrison<br>\nFabolous<br>\nCharles Tillman \n\nEAPE\n\n"}
{"id": "1564994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1564994", "title": "Zamindawar", "text": "Zamindawar\n\nZamindawar is an historical region of Afghanistan and Pakistan ,it is very large and fertile valley the main sources for irrigation is Helmand River and karizes Helmand borders the road that leads from Kandahar to Herat via Farah. It corresponds to the PakistanI region of Zhob. Zamindawar is located in the greater territory of northern Helmand and encompasses the approximate area of modern day Baghran, Musa Qala, Naw Zad, Kajaki and Sangin districts. It was a district of hills, and of wide, well populated, and fertile valleys watered by important tributaries of the Helmand. The principal town was Musa Qala, which stands on the banks of a river of the same name, about 60 m, north of Girishk.\n\nThis region was headquarters to the Durrani Pashtun tribe of the Alizai. The region is also home to Nurzai, Barakzai and Alakozai tribes, as well as other Durrani tribes and Kuchis. It was from Zamindawar that much of the strength of the force which besieged Kandahar under Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1880 was derived; and it was the Zamindawar contingent of tribesmen who so nearly defeated Sir Donald Stewart's force at the Battle of Ahmed Khel previously. The control of Zamindawar was regarded by the British-Indian forces as the key to the position for safeguarding the route between Herat and Kandahar during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.\n\nZunbils ruled Zamindawar before Islamization of the area. The title Zunbil can be traced back to the Middle-Persian original Zūn-dātbar, \"Zun the Justice-giver\". The geographical name Zamindawar would also reflect this, from Middle-Persian \"Zamin-i dātbar\" (Land of the Justice-giver).\n\nAccording to author André Wink,\n\nSouth of the Pamisus was ruled by the Zunbils, offspring of the southern-Hephthalite. The east was controlled by the Kabul Shahis. The Zunbil and Kabul Shahis were connected by culture with the neighboring Panjab. The Zunbil kings worshipped a sun god by the name of \"Zun\" from which they derived their name. For example, André Wink writes that \"the cult of Zun was primarily Scythio-Bactrian, not Buddhist or Zoroastrian.\"\n\nIn 643 AD the non-Muslim Zunbils assembled a large army and attempted to invade Persia, which had just been Islamized, but were defeated by the Muslims. About ten years later, in 653-4 AD, Abdur Rahman bin Samara along with 6,000 Arab Muslims penetrated the Zunbil territory and made their way to the shrine of \"Zun\" in Zamindawar, which was believed to be located about three miles south of Musa Qala in today's Helmand Province of Afghanistan. The General of the Arab army \"broke of a hand of the idol and plucked out the rubies which were its eyes in order to persuade the Marzbān of Sīstān of the god's worthlessness.\"\n\nThe Kabul Shahi ruled north of the Zunbil territory, which included Kabulistan and Gandahara. The Arabs reached Kabul with the message of Islam but were not able to rule for long. The Kabul Shahis decided to build a giant wall around the city to prevent more Arab invasions, this wall is still visible today.\n\nWillem Vogelsang in his 2002 book writes: \"During the eighth and ninth centuries AD the eastern parts of modern Afghanistan were still in the hands of non-Muslim rulers. The Muslims tended to regard them as \"Afghan\", although many of the local rulers were apparently of Hunnic or Turkic descent. Yet, the Muslims were right in so far as the non Muslim population of Eastern Afghanistan was, culturally, strongly linked to the coterminous Pakistan. Most of them were either Bactreo-Zoroastrian, Animist, or Buddhists.\" In 870 AD the Saffarids from Zaranj conquered most of Afghanistan, establishing Muslim governors throughout the land. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side before the arrival of the Ghaznavids in the 10th century.\n\nIf the Hepthalites were basically Indo- European, politically and culturally the realms of Zabul and Kabul were considered as a part of Al- Hind on the eve of Muslim conquest. The Chachnama for example contains numerous references to Zabul under the corrupt form of ‘Ramal’ or ‘Ranmal’ showing close contacts and marriage relationships between the rulers and subordinate chiefs of Sind and Kashmir and the King of Zabul in the seventh century. The relationships between these Indian rulers on the north- western frontier appear to have been in constant flux but it seems a safe conclusion that the King of Kashmir had established a claim of suzerainty over Zabul -as he had over other Bactrian Kings.\n\n"}
