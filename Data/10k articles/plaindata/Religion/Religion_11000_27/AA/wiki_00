It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. In Shulgin's book \"PiHKAL\", the dosage range is listed as 12–24 mg. As a recreational drug, 2C-B is sold as a white powder sometimes pressed in tablets or gel caps and is also referred to by a number of other names. The drug is usually taken orally, but can also be snorted (insufflated) or vaporized.\n\n2C-B was synthesized from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. It first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy. 2C-B was first sold commercially as a purported aphrodisiac under the trade name \"Erox\", which was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company Drittewelle. For several years, it was available as tablets in Dutch smart shops under the name \"Nexus\".\n\n2C-B first became popularized in the United States as a short-lived substitute for the street drug Ecstasy when MDMA became illegal in 1985. Many 2C-B users are young adults who attend raves. Though 2C-B is still used in the rave subculture, commonly mistaken for and/or sold as Ecstasy, its intentional use has become more common in the 2000s. Since 2013, 2C-B has emerged as the drug of choice for club drug users in Colombia.\n\nStreet prices range between $10 and $30 per tablet in the United States in 2011 when purchased in small quantities. Larger retail purchases cost between $200 and $500 per gram. Wholesale purchases of 2C-B can lower the price ($100 to $300 per gram in 2001).\n\nThe September 1998 issue of \"Journal of Analytical Toxicology\" reported that very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-B. The relationship between its use and death are unknown. The common oral recreational dose is around 15–25 mg,<ref name=\"urlErowid 2C-B Vault : Dose/Dosage\"></ref> at which visual and auditory effects are experienced. Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, but use of 2C-B has been linked to significant brain injury in one case where the dosage was unknown, and the purity of the chemical was not verified.\n\nThe lethal dosage is unknown. It was reported in \"PiHKAL\", by Alexander Shulgin, that a psychologist had accidentally taken a 100 mg dose orally without apparent harm.\n\nWhen sold as \"Ecstasy\", tablets containing 2C-B often contain about 5 mg of the drug, an amount which produces stimulatory effects that mimic the effects of MDMA; in contrast, tablets marketed as 2C-B have larger quantities of the drug (10–20 mg) which cause hallucinogenic effects. Street purity of 2C-B, when tested, has been found to be relatively high. Researchers in Spain found that 2C-B samples in the country doubled between 2006 and 2009, switched from primarily powder form to tablets, and exhibited \"low falsification rates\". An analysis of street samples in the Netherlands found impurities \"in small percentages\"; only one of the impurities, the N-acetyl derivative of 2C-B, could be identified, and comprised 1.3% of the sample. The authors suggested that this compound was a by-product of 2C-B synthesis.\n\nLittle or no academic research has been conducted on the effects of 2C-B in humans. The information available is largely anecdotal and limited. Effects are often described as being more easily managed than other psychedelics; it is often compared to a mixture of a serotonergic psychedelic and MDMA. At 5–10 mg, experiments with young chickens have shown it to produce effects similar to a low dosage of amphetamines.\n\nThe anecdotal effects of 2C-B that have been reported by users on online discussion forums include:\n\n\"The following effects are highly dose-dependent.\"\n\n\nWhen orally consumed, 2C-B has a much longer delay before the onset of effects than when it is insufflated. Oral ingestion generally takes roughly 45–75 minutes for the effects to be felt, plateau lasts 2–4 hours, and coming down lasts 1–2 hours. Rectal administration onset varies from 5–20 minutes. Insufflated onset takes 1–10 minutes for effects to be felt. The duration can last from 4 to 12 hours depending on route of administration, dose, and other factors.\n\nWith insufflation, the effects are more abrupt and intense but have a significantly shorter duration, while oral usage results in a milder, longer experience. When insufflated, the onset happens very rapidly, usually reaching the peak at about 20–40 minutes and plateauing for 2–3 hours. 2C-B is also considered one of the most painful drugs to insufflate, with users reporting intense nasal burning. The sudden intensity of the experience combined with the pain can often start the experience with a negative imprint and nausea is also increased with insufflation, compounding the issue.\n\nUnlike most hallucinogens, 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy serotonin 5-HT receptor partial agonist or even full antagonist. This suggests that the 5-HT receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the effects experienced by users of 2C-B, although functional antagonism of 5-HT or activation of the 5-HT-coupled phospholipase D pathway may also play a role. The rank order of 5-HT receptor antagonist potency for this family of drugs is 2C-I > 2C-B > 2C-D > 2C-H.\n\nResearch suggests that 2C-B increases dopamine levels in the brains of rats, which may contribute to its psychoactivity.\n\n2C-B has been shown to be metabolized by liver hepatocytes, resulting in deamination and demethylation that produces several products. Oxidative deamination results in the 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-ethanol (BDMPE) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (BDMPAA) metabolites. Additionally, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (BDMBA) can also be produced by oxidative deamination. Further metabolism of BDMPE and BDMPAA may occur by demethylation. Alternatively, the later metabolites can be generated by demethylation of 2C-B followed by oxidative deamination.\n\nThere is species differentiation in the metabolism of 2C-B. Mice hepatocytes produce 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-phenol (BDMP), a previously unknown metabolite. Meanwhile, human, monkey and rabbit hepatocytes produce 2-(4-bromo-2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-ethanol (B-2-HMPE), but dog, rat and mouse hepatocytes do not. 2C-B also reduces aggressive responses in drugged rats.\n\nA variety of N-substituted derivatives of 2C-B have been tested, including N-methyl-2CB, N,N-dimethyl-2CB, N-ethyl-2CB and N-benzyl-2CB. Most simple alkyl derivatives were considerably less potent than 2C-B, with N-ethyl-2CB for instance having a 40 times lower affinity for the 5-HT receptor. The N-benzyl derivative however was found to have higher binding affinity than 2C-B itself, with N-(4-bromobenzyl)-2CB binding even more tightly. This initial research did not include functional assays of activity, but later led to the development of potent substituted N-benzyl derivatives such as 25B-NBOMe, and 25B-NBOH.\n\n2C-B is used as entheogen by the Sangoma, Nyanga, and Amagqirha people in place of their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as \"Ubulawu Nomathotholo\", which roughly translates to \"Medicine of the Singing Ancestors\".\n\nThe UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs added 2C-B to Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in March 2001.\n\n2C-B was mislabelled \"2 C-B\" in the \"Green List 26th edition, 2015\". However, this was corrected in \"Green List 27th edition, 2016\".\n\n2C-B is a scheduled drug in most jurisdictions. The following is a partial list of territories where the substance has been scheduled.\n\n2C-B is controlled under the List 1, as well as similar substances like 2C-I or 2C-T-2.\n\n2C-B is controlled in Australia and on the list of substances subject to import and export controls (Appendix B). It was placed on Schedule One of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act when it first came to notice in 1994, when in a showcase legal battle chemist R. Simpson was charged with manufacturing the substance in Sydney. Alexander Shulgin came to Australia to testify on behalf of the defense, to no avail.\n\n2C-B is not specifically listed in the Australia Poisons Standard (October 2015), however similar drugs such as 2C-T-2 and 2C-I are making 2C-B fall under the Australian analogue act.\n\nIn Brazil, 2C-B is a controlled substance making production, distribution, and possession illegal.\n\nIn Belgium, 2C-B is a controlled substance making production, distribution, and possession illegal.\n\nIn Canada, 2C-B is classified under Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as Schedule III as \"4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzeneethanamine and any salt, isomer or salt of isomer thereof\".\n\n2C-B has been rescheduled (Schedule III), in a new amendment, taking effect on October 31, 2016. This is to include the other 2C-x analogues.\n\nIn August 2007, 2C-B (4-bromo-2,5-dimetoxifenetilamina), along with many other psychologically active substances, was added to Ley 20.000, known as the .\n\nPossession of more than 200 mg of 2C-B is punishable with a two years jail sentence.\n\nIn Denmark, 2C-B is listed as a category B drug.\n\nIn Estonia, 2C-B is classified as Schedule I.\n\nIn Germany, 2C-B is controlled in the Betäubungsmittelgesetz (BtMG) Anlage I as \"Bromdimethoxyphenethylamin\" (BDMPEA).\n\n2C-B is schedule I (tabella I).\n\nIn Japan, 2C-B was scheduled in 1998. It was previously marketed as \"Performax\".\n\nIn the Netherlands, 2C-B was scheduled on July 9, 1997.\n\nIn the Netherlands, 2C-B became a list I substance of the Opium Law despite no health incidents occurring. Following the ban, other phenethylamines were sold in place of 2C-B until the Netherlands became the first country in the world to ban 2C-I, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 alongside 2C-B.\n\nIn Norway, 2C-B was classified as Schedule II on March 22, 2004, listed as 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.\n\n2C-B is schedule I (I-P group) in Poland.\n\nBanned as a narcotic drug with a criminal penalty for possession of at least 10 mg.\n\nIn Spain, 2C-B was added to Category 2 prohibited substances in 2002.\n\n2C-B is currently classified as Schedule I in Sweden.\n\n2C-B was first classified as \"health hazard\" under the act (translated: \"Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health\") as of April 1, 1999, under SFS 1999:58 that made it illegal to sell or possess. Then it became schedule I as of June 1, 2002, published in LVFS 2002:4 but mislabeled \"2-CB\" in the document. However, this was corrected in a new document, LVFS 2009:22 effective December 9, 2009.\n\nIn Switzerland, 2C-B is listed in Anhang D of the DetMV and is illegal to possess.\n\nAll drugs in the 2C family are Class A under the Misuse of Drugs Act which means they are illegal to produce, supply or possess. Possession carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment while supply is punishable by life imprisonment and an unlimited fine.\n\nIn the United States, 2C-B is classified as CSA Schedule I Section (d) Subsection (3) 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.\n\nIn the United States, a notice of proposed rulemaking published on December 20, 1994, in the \"Federal Register\" and after a review of relevant data, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed to place 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA into Schedule I, making 2C-B illegal in the United States. This became permanent law on July 2, 1995.\n\n"}

In Buddhist nunneries, the nun who holds the equivalent position is known in English as the abbess.\n\nThe English word \"abbot\" is used instead of all the various words that exist in the languages of the countries where Buddhism is, or was historically, well established.\n\nThe administrative duties of an abbot or abbess include overseeing the day-to-day running of the monastery. The Abbot or Abbess also has spiritual responsibility for the monastics under their care, and is required to interact with the abbots or abbesses of other monasteries.\n\nAsian countries where Buddhism is still widely practiced have words in their own languages for the abbot of a Buddhist monastery or large temple:\n\nin Chinese Chan Buddhist monasteries, one word for abbot is \"Fangzhang\" meaning \"ten feet square\", a reference to the size of Vimalakirti's stone room. Another Chinese word for abbot is \"Zhuchi\"(住持), meaning dweller and upholder.\n\nIn Zen Buddhism, the most commonly used Japanese words for the abbot of a large Zen temple or Zen monastery are \"juji\"(住持) and \"choro\".\n\nThe abbot of a Tibetan Buddhist monastery is known as the \"Khenpo\". This means \"the one who gives the monks vows\". The abbot is addressed as, and referred to, as \"Khen Rinpoche\".

{"id": "1858503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858503", "title": "Bahya ben Asher", "text": "Bahya ben Asher\n\nBahya ben Asher ibn Halawa, also known as Rabbeinu Behaye (רבינו בחיי, 1340 – 1255), was a rabbi and scholar of Judaism. He was a commentator on the Hebrew Bible.\n\nHe is considered by Jewish scholars to be one of the most distinguished of the Biblical exegetes of Spain. He was a pupil of Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet (the \"Rashba\"). Unlike the latter, R' Bahya did not publish a Talmud commentary. In his biblical exegesis, R' Bahya took as his model Rabbi Moses ben Nahman who is known as Nahmanides or Ramban, the teacher of Rabbi Solomon ben Aderet, who was the first major commentator to make extensive use of the Kabbalah as a means of interpreting the Torah. He discharged with zeal the duties of a \"darshan\" (\"preacher\") in his native city of Zaragoza, sharing this position with several others, and on this account received a small salary, which was scarcely enough to support him and his family; but neither his struggle for daily bread nor the reverses that he suffered (to which he referred in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah) diminished his interest in Torah study in general, and in Biblical exegesis in particular.\n\nAmong R Bahya's principal works was his commentary on the Torah (the five books of Moses), in the preparation of which he thoroughly investigated the works of former Biblical exegetes, using all the methods employed by them in his interpretations.\n\nHe enumerates the following four methods, all of which in his opinion are indispensable to the exegete:\n\nGenerally speaking Rabbi Bahya does not reveal any of his Kabbalistic sources, other than generally referring to \"Sefer ha-Bahir\" and the works of Nahmanides. He only mentions the Zohar twice.\n\nR' Bahya's commentary is considered to derive a particular charm from its form. Each parashah, or weekly lesson, is prefaced by an introduction preparing the reader for the fundamental ideas to be discussed; and this introduction bears a motto in the form of some verse selected from the Book of Mishlei / Proverbs. Furthermore, by the questions that are frequently raised the reader is compelled to take part in the author's mental processes; the danger of monotony being also thereby removed.\n\nThe commentary was first printed at Naples in 1492; and the favor which it enjoyed is attested by the numerous supercommentaries published on it. Owing to the large space devoted to the Kabbalah, the work was particularly valuable to Kabbalists, although Rabbi Bahya also availed himself of non-Jewish sources. Later editions of the commentary appeared at Pesaro, 1507, 1514, and 1517; Constantinople, 1517; Rimini, 1524; Venice, 1544, 1546, 1559, 1566, and later. Not less than ten super-commentaries are enumerated by Bernstein (\"Monatsschrift\" xviii. 194-196), which give further evidence of the popularity of the work.\n\nHis next most famous work was his \"Kad ha-Kemah\" (\"Receptacle of the Flour\") (Constantinople, 1515.) It consists of sixty chapters, alphabetically arranged, containing discourses and dissertations on the requirements of religion and morality, as well as Jewish ritual practices. \"Kad ha-Kemah\" is a work of Musar literature, the purpose of which is to promote a moral life. In it Bahye discusses the following subjects: belief and faith in God; the divine attributes and the nature of providence; the duty of loving God, and of walking before God in simplicity and humility of heart; the fear of God; Jewish prayer; benevolence, and the love of mankind; peace; the administration of justice, and the sacredness of the oath; the duty of respecting the property and honor of one's fellow man; the Jewish holidays, and halakha (loosely translated as \"Jewish law\".)\n\nAnother work of R Bahya, also published frequently, and in the first Mantua edition of 1514 erroneously ascribed to Rabbi Moses ben Nahman, Nahmanides, bears the title of \"Shulkhan Arba\" (\"Table [of] Four\"). It consists of four chapters, the first three of which contain religious rules of conduct regarding the various meals, while the fourth chapter treats of the banquet of the righteous in the world to come.\n\nA work might have been written by Rabbi Bahye under the title of \"Hoshen ha-Mishpat\" (\"Breastplate of Judgment\".) Reference to this work is made only once by him, and it is unknown if this work was actually written or not.\n\nA number of works whose author is simply \"Bahya\", or whose authors are unknown, have been attributed to Rabbi Bahye ben Asher. Many modern day authorities on Rabbi Bahya's writings have shown that many of these attributions are spurious.\n\n\nOne book ostensibly written by R' Bahya, edited by M. Homburg under the title of \"Soba Semakhot\" (\"Fulness of Joy\"), as being a commentary on the Book of Job, is actually a compilation made by a later editor from two of Bahye's actual works, \"Kad ha-Kemah\" (Constantinople, 1515) and \"Shulhan shel Arba\" (Mantua, 1514).\n\nRabbeinu Behaye's works possess especial value both for the student of Jewish literature, owing to the author's copious and extensive quotations from Midrashic and exegetical works which have since been lost, and for the student of modern languages on account of the frequent use of words from the vernacular (Arabic, Spanish, and French) in explanation of Biblical terms. They also contain interesting material for the study of the social life as well as for the history of the Kabalah, the demonology and eschatology of the Jews in Spain. \n"}

Rainbow first became a church chorister when his family moved to Clapham, and he was intrigued by watching the organist play. \n\nAfter another move he attended Rutlish School in Merton. Even though he still at school, Bernarr was appointed the organist and choirmaster at St James's, Merton, later holding similar posts at St Mary's, East Molesey and St Andrew's, Wimbledon.\n\nAfter his family moved to Hampton Court, Bernarr attended Trinity College of Music between 1933–1939, where he was a pupil of Dr William Lovelock. His 21st birthday was marked by a reception and dance at Hampton Court attended by 80 guests. While studying at Trinity he earned a living in the Map Branch of the Land Registry near Lincoln's Inn. Rainbow's studies were interrupted by World War II and he served with the Army in North Africa and Italy, until he was invalided out in 1944. In 1941 Rainbow married Olive Grace Still (1915–1996), at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Merton; composing the music for the service himself.\n\nIn September 1944 he became Organist of the Parish Church of All Saints, High Wycombe and, a few months later, the Senior Music Master at Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. He made a considerable public impact at High Wycombe. He produced Gilbert and Sullivan operettas at the Royal Grammar School, put on concerts at the Parish Church, and started a week-long annual Festival there in 1946. Bernarr's pupils won awards and scholarships and in 1947 representatives from 30 local choirs joined in Handel's Messiah. Bernarr conducted the High Wycombe String Orchestra and was the soloist in his own Piano Concerto. In 1951 the High Wycombe Parish Church Choir was chosen to sing Evensong in the Festival Church on the new South Bank site. He turned the Royal Grammar School at High Wycombe into a singing school. Bemarr realised that the quality of music teaching in schools was paramount. This meant focussing on the teachers themselves. So in 1952 he became Director of Music at The College of St. Mark and St. John, Chelsea, the Church of England College for teachers, a remarkable community whose members have stayed friends. Later he became Head of Music at Gypsy Hill College, now Kingston University, and retired in 1978.\n\nHis distinguished record was acknowledged when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College in the following year. He was President of the Campaign for the Defence of the Traditional Cathedral Choir and in 1996 he established the Bernarr Rainbow Award for School Music Teachers.\n\nBernarr Rainbow died in Esher, Surrey on 17 March 1998 at the age of 83.\n\nDLitt, PhD, MEd, ARCM, LGSM, LRAM, FTCL, HonFTCL, FRSA\n\nThe Bernarr Rainbow Trust was set up by Rainbow and Professor Peter Dickinson in 1996 to support projects connected with music education. The Trust now runs an annual award for school music teachers in conjunction with the Institute of Education, University of London; has presented five Bernarr Rainbow Lectures in London [published as Music Education in Crisis - the Bernarr Rainbow Lectures and other Assessments, Boydell, 2013]; and supports the publication of Rainbow's books and his series of Classic Texts in Music Education.\n\n\nThe personal papers of Bernarr Rainbow are held in the Archives of the Institute of Education, University of London , and the catalogue of his papers can be accessed through the online catalogue.\n\n\n"}

He began his career in the Moving Sidewalks, who recorded \"Flash\" (1968) and opened four dates for the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969 and released \"ZZ Top's First Album\" in 1971. \n\nGibbons has made appearances with other artists and acted on television shows, most notably \"Bones\". He was ranked at number 32 on the 2011 \"Rolling Stone\" list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\n\nGibbons was born to Frederick Royal (\"Freddie\") and Lorraine (née Duffy) Gibbons in the Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston, Texas. His father was an entertainer, orchestra conductor, and concert pianist who worked alongside his second cousin, art director Cedric Gibbons, for Samuel Goldwyn at MGM Studios. A percussionist as a youth, Gibbons was sent by his father to New York City to study with Tito Puente In 1963, Gibbons received his first electric guitar following his 13th birthday, a sunburst Gibson Melody Maker, accompanied by a Fender Champ amplifier, and was influenced by guitarists such as Jimmy Reed.\n\nWhile attending Warner Brothers' art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including The Saints, Billy G & the Blueflames, and The Coachmen. By 18, Gibbons went forward forming an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician, Roky Erickson and The 13th Floor Elevators, naming the group the Moving Sidewalks, penning the hit single \"99th Floor\", and engaging in a friendship with Jimi Hendrix.\n\nGibbons founded the Texas psychedelic group The Moving Sidewalks, which recorded several singles and one full-length album, \"Flash\". Gibbons and The Moving Sidewalks came to prominence opening for The Jimi Hendrix Experience during Hendrix's first American tour as a headliner. Also notable was the Gibbons-penned song, \"99th Floor,\" its title a nod to the influence on Gibbons of fellow Texans and pioneering psychedelic band The 13th Floor Elevators. He has also commented during live performances while playing the string-bending intro to \"Foxy Lady\" that Hendrix taught him how to play when Gibbons was \"about 17\" in Dallas.\n\nGibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969, and quickly settled on bassist/vocalist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank \"Rube\" Beard, both being members of the band American Blues. After honing their trademark blues-rock style, they released the aptly-titled \"ZZ Top's First Album\" on London Records in 1971.\n\nGibbons played the first slide guitar lead on the song \"Dead End Streets\" on Al Jourgensen of Ministry's side project Revolting Cocks album \"Cocked and Loaded\". \n\nHe wrote, played guitar on and sang \"Willin' For Satisfaction\" from Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell's 2005 solo album \"Two Sides Of If.\"\n\nGibbons collaborated with the Queens of the Stone Age on the song \"Burn the Witch\" from the album \"Lullabies to Paralyze\". ZZ Top's \"Precious and Grace\" was recorded with lead vocals provided by Mark Lanegan as a bonus track for the album. Gibbons has claimed this was one of his favorite collaborations and \"Precious and Grace\" was later added back into ZZ Top's set lists. Gibbons was selected to guest the follow-up album \"Era Vulgaris\" but was unable due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nTogether with The Raconteurs Gibbons performed at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. Gibbons was part of an ensemble chosen to play with the band, which included Lou Reed and Jim Jarmusch. The performance was heavily edited and cut short by MTV for broadcast. \n\nGibbons was one of several artists to join B.B. King on the song \"Tired Of Your Jive,\" from the \"B.B. King & Friends\" album. \n\nGibbons appeared on Nickelback's album \"All the Right Reasons\" on the songs \"Follow You Home,\" \"Fight for All the Wrong Reasons\" and \"Rockstar.\" \n\nGibbons performed with Hank Williams III on the song \"Trashville,\" from his album \"Lovesick, Broke and Driftin'.\"\n\nGibbons collaborated with Les Paul with his Les Paul & Friends \"American Made, World Played\" track \"Bad Case of Loving You.\" Gibbons also performed guitar with John Mayall & Friends' track \"Put It Right Back\" from the album \"Along for the Ride.\" He was the first artist to appear on stage at Cleveland's State theater in November 2008 at the American Music Master Tribute to Les Paul, honoring the guitar and recording innovator, who died a few months later.\n\nGibbons was a guest vocalist on Kid Rock's \"Hillbilly Stomp\" from the album \"Kid Rock\".\n\nHe was the guitarist during singer Luis Fonsi's presentation at the 7th Latin Grammy awards held in Madison Square Garden, New York, on November 2, 2006. \n\nLately Gibbons sang background vocals on Sammy Hagar's 2008 CD \"Cosmic Universal Fashion\" during the song \"Switch on the Light.\" \n\nGibbons collaborated with Ronnie Dunn, of Brooks & Dunn fame, for Dunn's first solo work, playing guitar and singing along on the song, \"Honky Tonk Stomp\". \n\nGibbons played guitar on \"Broke Down On the Brazos\", the opening track of Gov't Mule's 2009 album \"By a Thread\". \n\nGibbons played guitar on \"Run Rudolph Run\", the third track of \"We Wish you a Metal Xmas and a Headbanging New Year\" compilation. \n\nGibbons joined Jeff Beck onstage at the 2009 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert with a version of Jimi Hendrix's \"Foxy Lady\". \n\nGibbons made a special guest appearance behind Roky Erickson on \"Austin City Limits\" taped on November 12, 2007 and originally aired January 12, 2008. (\"ACL\" Season 33, Episode 12). \n\nGibbons plays lead guitar on two songs from the 2008 Everlast album \"Love, War and the Ghost of Whitey Ford\": \"Stone in My Hand\" and \"Anyone\".\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Gibbons joined Ben Harper, Jeff Beck, Conan O'Brien and others on the final episode of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" playing a Will Ferrell-led rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\".\n\nOn February 19, 2011, Gibbons appeared as a guest judge at the 5th Annual Misprint Beard and Moustache Contest at the Mohawk Club in Austin, Texas.\n\nOn December 15, 2012, Gibbons made a guest appearance at Social Distortion's concert at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. Frontman Mike Ness brought him out for two songs, \"Drug Train\" and \"Black Magic\". On November 19, 2014, Gibbons performed \"Baby Please Don't Go\" at the Vaclav Havel bust dedication ceremony in the US capitol.\n\nOn July 31, 2015 it was announced that Gibbons' solo project will be named Billy Gibbons and the BFG's featuring musicians Mike Flanigin, GG Maartine (née Martine GuiGui), Joe Hardy and Greg Morrow. Their debut album, \"Perfectamundo\", was released on November 6, 2015.\n\nGibbons' second solo album, The Big Bad Blues was released on September 21, 2018 via Concord Records \n\nGibbons had a recurring role on the Fox network TV series \"Bones\", appearing in seven episodes over nine years. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, as the father of Michaela Conlin's character, Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro. He is never referred to by name on the show, though; every mention is limited to \"Angela's father\". Conlin's character's middle name is the same as Gibbons' Les Paul guitar. Gibbons's character is extremely protective of his daughter, and he often \"threatens\" or \"haunts\" Angela's husband and colleague Dr. Jack Hodgins, telling him that if he hurts Angela, he will pay. When Angela and Hodgins first broke up, he drugged and kidnapped Hodgins, during which time he also gave him a tattoo of Angela's face on his left deltoid area. After Angela discovers the tattoo, she informs Hodgins she wants it removed (he never removed it) and angrily exclaimed when she discovered it was her dad's doing, \"I am so going to kick his Texan bad ass\".\n\nHe has appeared in several other episodes of \"Bones\", including one where he asks Hodgins to help him recover his car from some \"biker hoods\". In his next appearance, he argued with Hodgins over baby names. He wanted the child to be named \"Staccato Mamba\", which came to him in a song, while Angela and Hodgins wanted to name him \"Michael Joseph\". (Parents and grandfather compromised on \"Michael Staccato\".) At the end of the episode, Hodgins discovers he has yet another tattoo on his right biceps, this time of his father-in-law with the word \"Daddy\" across Gibbons' beard (at which point Gibbons told Hodgins that celebratory tequila and he do not seem to mix). In a later episode, he asks to babysit his grandson Michael, pointing out that Angela had spent many nights when she was a baby sleeping soundly backstage while he played to sold-out stadiums. After initial reluctance of Angela and Hodgins, they agree due to the need to get some sleep, as Michael will not stop crying and go to sleep. Gibbons solves the problem by discovering the music Michael likes, including blues and boogie rock, such as ZZ Top's \"Hi Fi Mama\".\n\nGibbons voiced a character in episode 60 of \"Metalocalypse\".\n\nGibbons also voiced a fictionalised version of himself in Fox's animated show \"King of the Hill\" which is set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas. ZZ Top's appearance on the show was due to Dusty Hill being given the role as the cousin of the show's main character Hank Hill. Frank Beard also voiced himself for the band's appearances on the show.\n\nGibbons appeared as a dining room guest in the season-13 episode of \"Hell's Kitchen\".\n\nIn 2011, Gibbons joined with Texas-based Mojo Products, LLC, to launch a line of hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and other products with his own personal branding, \"BFG Brand\". The sauces were sold as BFG No. 44 via his personal website.\n\nIn late 2012, Gibbons was featured in a series of television commercials for Fiesta Mart, a Texas supermarket chain. Some of the BFG Brand sauces were seen in these commercials.\n\nIn 2018 Billy Gibbons has teamed up with John Fogerty, the two guitar players are planning a summer tour under the \"Holy Grail\" title. John Fogerty wrote a song with the title \"Holy Grail\" which Gibbons has appeared on, adding his vocals and some guitar, Billy had this to say to 'Billboard Magazine': \" \"It's not an overstatement to say that writing a song with John Fogerty is a genuine bonus. It's fair to say that John and I are both pumped about our collaboration and we think this new one called 'Holy Grail' holds true with some great storytelling and some solid guitarist movin' the number right along. It begs a shout of, 'Turn it up!'\" Fogerty is releasing a new album, and the collaboration is attracting some attention from the classic rock community. The new single \"Holy Grail\" is due for worldwide release on June 8th 2018.\n\nOn December 14, 2005, Gibbons married long-time girlfriend Gilligan Stillwater (born Ellen J. Oetjen).\n\nGibbons is an avid car collector and custom car enthusiast with an extensive collection that includes a 1948 Cadillac Series 62 (known as CadZZilla), a 1962 Chevrolet Impala (known as \"Slampala\"), a 1950 Ford Business Coupe, and a 1958 Ford Thunderbird. One of his earliest custom cars, a 1933 Ford Coupe (known as \"Eliminator\"), was featured in three of ZZ Top's music videos and is also on the cover of their 1983 album, also titled \"Eliminator\". Gibbons also published a book in 2011 about his love of cars and guitars titled \"Billy F Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead\". The November 2014 issue of \"Guitar World\" magazine featured an interview with Gibbons and fellow guitarist Jeff Beck about their mutual appreciation of \"cars, guitars, and everything in between\".\n\nFor several years, Gibbons has appeared wearing a braided-cloth cap rather than his familiar Stetson hat. During a visit to Vienna, he met the chief of the Bamileke people from Camaroon, with whom he traded the hat for the cap.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The terms kaiyan (), kaiguang (), and dianyan () and their derivative forms are used in the Chinese, Korean (where is it known as jeom-an or 점안), Japanese (where it is known as kaigen) and Vietnamese languages (where it is known as khai quang điểm nhãn), while buddhābhiseka (; ; ) is used in predominantly Theravada Buddhist countries.\n\nKaiguang () is the Chinese term for consecration of a statue of a deity. In Chinese, the literal meaning of Kaiguang is \"opening of light\". While it is often performed in the Buddhist and Taoist faiths, it is also well known as the act of consecrating new lion costumes used for the traditional lion dance.\n\nA kaiguang ritual varies amongst traditions, but it is essentially the act of formal consecration for proper usage by dotting the eyes of a statue or lion costume using an calligraphy brush coated with cinnabar. In Taoism and Buddhism, the ritual is performed by senior clerics and is done by inviting a specific deity, buddha or bodhisattva to empower an \"empty\" effigy of themselves and to fill it with a divine essence. The usage of a mirror (to reflect the sunlight) and a dry towel (to symbolically clean the statue of filth) is also employed. \n\nIt is believed that if a statue or lion costume has not gone through kaiguang, it cannot be worshiped or used for performance, as the eyes are still \"closed\".\n\nBurmese Buddhists perform consecration rituals for images of the Buddha used for veneration both at home and at public places of worship, such as monasteries and pagodas. Before a Buddha statue is used for veneration, it must be formally consecrated in the buddhābhiseka maṅgala ritual. The Burmese language verb for consecrating a Buddha image is \"anegaza tin\" (). This consecration ritual is led by a Buddhist monk, who recites \"aneka jāti saṃsāraṃ\" (translated as 'through the round of many births I roamed'), the 153rd verse of the Dhammapada (found in the 11th chapter), which are believed to be the first words uttered by the Buddha upon attaining Buddhahood. The consecration rite, which can last a few hours, is held in the morning and consists of four primary parts:\n\nThe consecration rituals are believed to imbue the Buddha image with a sacred quality that can protect the home and surroundings from misfortune and symbolically embody the powers of the Buddha.\n\n"}

This belief is thought to be held by certain American Protestant Churches and Christian- or Bible-based cults. It is has been called the \"Evangelical\", \"American Christian\" or \"\"Christian Right\" \"Persecution Complex.\"\"\n\nAccording to Candida Moss the Christian \"persecution complex\" appeared during the era of early Christianity due to internal Christian identity politics. Moss suggested that the idea of persecution is cardinal to the worldview of Christianity, noting that it creates the impression that Christians are a minority that are facing a war - even though they are numerically superior. This perception is grounded in the manichaeistic belief that the world is divided into two factions, one led by God and the other by Satan. In this view there can be no compromise between the two, and even attempting to dialogue or engage with \"the other\" is seen as a form of collaboration with it. Paul Cavill claims that the New Testament teaches that persecutions are inherent to Christianity.\n\nMany find it difficult to define the origin of the Christian persecution complex. According to Elizabeth Castelli, some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century, following a series of court rulings that declared public places to be out of bounds for religious activity (e.g. morning prayer in schools). However, it became apparent in the United States in the 1990s with the adoption of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 as the official foreign policy. A few years later, the September 11 attacks boosted its development. This complex \"mobilizes the language of religious persecution to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of anti-religious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority\".\n\nAmerican sociologist George Yancey finds that the perception of some Christians that they are persecuted is not unfounded, and that anti-Christian hostility is real. Yancey, in a 2017 publication, suggests that levels of anti-Christian hostility have not significantly risen over the past few decades (in the United States), however those with this hostility have gained economic power and thus \"... Christian activists may be correct in that they now pay a stiffer price for that animosity.” \n\nSome Christian journalists point out that \"American Christians have a persecution complex\" while noting that the persecution of Christians is real in the Middle East.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4667572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4667572", "title": "Church and School of Wicca", "text": "Church and School of Wicca\n\nThe Church and School of Wicca was founded by Gavin Frost and Yvonne Frost in 1968. It was the first federally recognized Church of the religion known as Wicca in the United States. It is well known for its correspondence courses on the Frosts' unique interpretation of Wicca. The Church and School are located in Hinton, West Virginia.\n\nThe Church of Wicca was founded in 1968. Gavin Frost was a British-born aerospace engineer. While working for an aerospace company in southern England's Salisbury Plain—an area replete with prehistoric monuments—he became interested in the druids. His wife Yvonne was an American with a background in Spiritualism. He then claimed to have been initiated into a Wiccan group in St. Louis, Missouri. When living in St. Louis they developed a correspondence course through which to teach others about Wicca, advertising these courses as the \"School of Wicca\".\nThey argued that by spreading their religious teaching in the form of a correspondence course, they were reaching a wider range of people than initiatory-based forms of Wicca, and that this would be necessary in order for the religion to become a \"strong religious force\". They believed strongly that Wicca should be presented publicly, believing that the secrecy observed by some Wiccan group brought mistrust and persecution from wider society.\n\nThe Frosts had adopted the term \"Wicca\" in the late 1960s, when it was gaining increasing usage within the Pagan Witchcraft community as a name for their religion.\nThe pair resisted using the term \"Pagan\" until the late 1970s. In 1975, Yvonne stated that \"I do not consider myself a Pagan. I do not worship any nature deity. I reach upward to the unnameable which has no gender\".\n\nIn conjunction with his lawyers, Gavin secured religious recognition for his School from the Internal Revenue Service in 1972; this resulted in his Church becoming the first recognised church of Wicca in the United States. Later that year they began working on their Church and School full time. Gavin appointed himself as its archbishop, and Yvonne as a bishop, and they awarded themselves doctorates of divinity through the Church. The couple moved first to Salem, Missouri—where they ran a pig farm—and then to New Bern, North Carolina in 1974. There they tried to establish a survival community, but it failed to materialise. In he late 1970s they began holding an annual \"Samhain Seminar\", in which workshops, rituals, and lectures took place, primarily for students of their correspondence course. In 1996 they relocated to Hinton, West Virginia.\n\nIn 1985 the Church of Wicca were involved in the \"Dettmer v. Landon\" case, during which the District Court of Virginia ruled that Wicca constituted a legitimate religion under U.S. law. The Virginia prison authorities appealed the case, and in 1986 Judge J. Butzner of the Federal Appeals Court upheld the original decision. This made the Church of Wicca the only federally recognised Wiccan church to have its status as a religion upheld in a federal appeals court.\n\nWithin the American Wiccan and wider modern Pagan community, the Frosts have been at the centre of various disputes, particularly surrounding issues such as homosexuality and theology. The Wiccan Margot Adler suggested that much of this controversy stemmed from Gavin's \"wry and rather bizarre sense of humor, and his tendency to say anything to get a rise out of someone\", something which she thought had resulted in the Frosts often being \"misunderstood\". In person, she thought, the Frosts \"have always been delightful\", with Gavin being \"kind and humorous\" and Yvonne being \"forthright and even a bit prim\".\n\nThey published a book titled \"The Witch's Bible\", which generated outrage within the Wiccan community. Many critics referred to it as a \"Witchcrap book\". Many of the central teachings featured in the book—such as its emphasis on the existence of an asexual monotheistic deity—were at total odds with mainstream Wiccan belief. Many Wiccans were angered at the word \"The\" as it appeared in the title, presupposing that it carried some form of authority within the Wiccan community. Its comments on race and sex also caused controversy.\n\nThe Church of Wicca defines Wicca as a monotheistic religion. Gavin expressed the view that there was one God, which was abstract, unknowable, and beyond the need for any worship. This is one of the teachings which distinguishes it from other Wiccan traditions. Unlike many other Wiccan groups, there was no particular emphasis on female divinity or the feminine, with Gavin calling beliefs about ancient matriarchies \"a Marxist heresy\".\n\nHe also expressed belief in \"stone gods\", \"idols\" which are created by humans as a storage for energy which can then be utilised for magical purposes.\n\nThe Church taught that the astral realm, which they called the \"Side\", is structured into ten levels. They taught that each human has a soul which undergoes a progressive system of reincarnation though which it can learn. The Frosts' view was that overpopulation had resulted in \"inferior souls\" incarnating on the earth. \n\nThe Church taught kundalini sex practices. These included \"introitus\", in which sex without orgasm was held as a form of surrender to God.\n\nTens of thousands of students have begun the School's twelve-lesson course in Wicca, although only several hundred have finished it.\nIn 2006, the Wiccan journalist Margot Adler suggested that the School of Wicca may have been responsible for the formation of as many as one hundred covens.\n\nThe School's curriculum includes classes on a variety of subjects associated both with Wicca as a religion and with occult and metaphysical studies and practices in general. These classes begin with an \"Essential Witchcraft\" course, which lasts \"a year and a day\". Other topics include: Advanced Celtic Witchcraft and Shamanism, Astral Travel, Astrology, Graphology, Mystical Awareness, a Natural Wicca Survey Course, Practical Sorcery, Prediction, Psychic and Herbal Healing, and Tantric Yoga. Much of the course of study is available to the student on video.\n\nThe Church and School chartered several other churches and groups. In the early years of the Church, ordination to individuals and sometimes even charters to churches had at times been offered solely on the basis of the Church's correspondence courses. However, due to a few incidents of fraudulent use of Church credentials, misconduct by these individuals, and/or the use of course material to defame the Church and the religion of Wicca, along with public controversy about these instances, this practice was abandoned as of 1976. In some cases, charters have been revoked.\n\n\n"}

Its members communicate and enforce policies of the Religious Technology Center.\n\nThe first Commodore's Messengers were appointed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1968 while he was living aboard the Sea Organization ship called the \"Apollo\". These messengers were his personal administrative assistants and operated solely under his direction, ensuring that Scientology management was following Hubbard’s policies.\n\nThe original four messengers were Janis Gillham (aged 11), Terri Gillham (12), Annie Tidman (12) and Suzette Hubbard (13), who was later replaced by Claire Popham (13). In 1975 while sailing in the Caribbean, due to the heat and humidity, the Messengers devised their uniforms themselves: white shorts, tie tops and platform shoes with knee high socks. Messengers conveyed messages from Hubbard and they were trained to mimic Hubbard's exact tone and mannerisms.\n\nOne Sea Org member recalled inquiring why Hubbard chose young girls for the role of messenger. Hubbard reported that \"Hitler was a madman, but nevertheless a genius in his own right and the Nazi Youth was one of the smartest ideas he ever had. With young people you had a blank slate.\" Hubbard further argued that he picked girls because women were more loyal than men.'\n\nIn April 1979, Hubbard created the Watchdog Committee (WDC). In 1981, the All Clear Unit of the CMO was set up with the purpose of ensuring an \"All Clear\" for Hubbard to emerge from hiding. As head of the unit, David Miscavige took orders only from Pat Broeker, who was accountable only to Hubbard.\n\nJanis Gillham, age 11, joined the Sea Organization in January 1968. She regularly attended to Hubbard for the next 11 years, until he went into hiding in 1979. In 2017, she authored \"Commodore’s Messenger: A Child Adrift in the Scientology Sea Organization\".\n\nAnnie Tidman became a Messenger at age 12. She married fellow messenger Pat Broeker and they were among the few people in direct contact with L. Ron Hubbard during his final years. In November 1992, Tidman made an unannounced departure from the group, but returned after church members intercepted her at the Boston airport. She died in 2011.\n\nIn 1967, Sharone Stainforth, age 10, joined the Sea Org and became one of Hubbard's original Messengers on the \"Apollo\". After leaving Scientology, she became a critic of the organization.\n\nMichelle \"Shelly\" Barnett became a Messenger at age 12. She later married fellow Messenger and future Scientology leader David Miscavige. She has made no public appearances since August 2007. The Church of Scientology denies that she is missing.\n\nMike Rinder joined the Sea Org and worked under Hubbard on his ship the \"Apollo\" in 1973. He joined the CMO in 1978, later becoming the church's international spokesperson. Rinder left the church in 2007 and has since spoken out against it.\n\nPat Broeker was aboard the Apollo and, along with his wife Anne, were taking care of Hubbard at the time of his death. An order was issued promoting Broeker and his wife to the rank of \"Loyal Officer\", but that order was later cancelled. \n\nMarc Yager joined the Sea Org in 1974 and sailed with Hubbard on \"Apollo\". Yager became a messenger and assisted Hubbard in video production. Yager was appointed Commanding Officer of the Commodore's Messenger Organization, Chairman of the Watchdog Committee, and later, Inspector General for Administration in the Religious Technology Center (RTC). Ex-members of the Church have alleged that Yager was sent to \"The Hole\", a Rehabilitation Project Force facility.\n\nIn 1977, David Miscavige, then aged 16, joined the Messengers. After Hubbard's death, Miscavige emerged as the leader of the Church of Scientology.\n"}

This is the shell of a large sea snail from the Indian Ocean (a shell of the species \"Turbinella pyrum\"), but one that has the very rare reverse-turning spiral.\n\nIn other words, when it is held with the spout (siphonal canal) pointed up, this conch's spiral twists rightwards (dakshinavarti) rather than very much more common form, which twists leftwards (vamavarti).\n\nThe genuine Lakshmi Shank is a sinistral conch shell from the Indian Ocean, and certainly not a (superficially similar) Sinistral Whelk (Lightning Whelk) species from Florida, USA. A true Valampuri shell is a species in the gastropod genus \"Turbinella\" L. The most common species is \"Turbinella pyrum\" L. It is important to note that only the rare sinistral variety of \"Turbinella\" species is a true Lakshmi Shankh. This kind of shell is very rare in its occurrence.\n\nOther right-turning sea snail shells of a similar shape, such as the lightning whelk (\"Sinistrofulgur perversum\"), are often mistakenly sold and worshiped in place of the genuine Shank. However, the real Lakshmi Shank has 3 to 7 ridges or plaits on its columella, whereas whelk shells does not show the presence of such plaits on its columella. The so-called \"flower-bud opening test\", and the \"rice pulling test\" (Valampuri said to rise up through a rice heap) are non scientific. The best authenticity test is to take an X-ray image of the Valampuri. Valampuries do show some morphological variation depending on origin, and shells with mixed characters of two adjacent localities are also seen.\n\nIn South India, people trust only the Rameshwaram type of Valampuries, and do not trust other varieties from West Coast and Bay of Bengal, though these are also the true Valampuries.\n\nIn South India, people specifically worship 'Gauri Valampuri'. This Valampuri shows presence of small dark spots on its body whrol, near the conch cavity. However, this type of Valampuri is very rare in its occurrence and is much expensive as compared to other types.\n\nGenuine Dakshinavarti Lakshmi Conches are only found in the Indian Ocean, between Myanmar (Burma) all the way to Sri Lanka. There are three main localities of this shankh in India. Shells from all the localities show definite morphological variations. The three localities are the Indian Ocean near Ram Setu, Sri Lanka, Ramishwaram to Tuticorin. Shells from this region are rare in occurrence. The second locality is Arabian Sea or Western India. The third locality is Bay of Bengal. Varieties showing mixed characters have also been observed. The imitation (Lightning Whelks) mostly come from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. This imitation is also known as African Valampuri. It is also important to note that other than busyconid species, few other species showing presence of folds in the cavity are wrongly mentioned as Dakshinavarti. These species though sinistral are different species. Having folds does not mean that they are all species under the genus Turbinella Linn.\n\nThere are different varieties of Valampuri shells based on their locality. The three main localities are Rameshwar, Ram Setu, Sri Lanka. The second one is West Coast of India or Arabian Sea and third one is Bay of Bengal. All the three types show variation.\n\nReal Lakshmi Conch (right side spinning) are estimated to occur only one per 100,000 conch shells. The shell of the lightning whelk on the other hand almost always opens on the right (when viewed with the siphonal canal pointing upwards). Valampuries with five plaits or folds in its cavity are known as 'Panchajanya' and are very rare. Completely snow-white Valampuries are also very rare and expensive. Giant Valampuries more than 5 kg are extremely rare in occurrence. Valampuries more than 3 feet in length are reported.\n\nThe Lakshmi Conch is said to bring all manner of blessing, but particularly material wealth, upon the owner. Ritual use may include bathing deities, drinking from the conch, or the use of mantras oriented to goddess Lakshmi. It is a wonderful object for Vastu purpose giving high positive energy.\n\nA true Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy shell may be sold on weight basis, but at the same times it can also be sold per piece. The present market cost in India falls in the range of Rs. 1100/- to Rs. 5000/- per gram. However, there have been some reports that pure milky white Ast Laxmi shell with 8 valeys and pink lines, is also sold up to Rs. 5000/- per gram. Based upon a market search, price was average of Indian Valampuri/ Dakshinavarthy depending on size, type, quality and Ignorance of Indian Buyers price can be much higher. Tiny dwarf Valampuries / Dakshinavarthy small enough to wear as a pendant are very rare and price is negotiable when available. Tiny Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy are practically not available and people are often being cheated by selling Sinistral Land Snail in the name of Tiny Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy.\n\nIt may be noted certain cartels working in Tamil Nadu and South India are creating an artificial shortage of Valampuri / Dakshinavarti Shells and are fooling common people by charging exorbitant prices, Customers are advised to lodge a complaints against them under MRTPC (Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission) Act-1966.\n\nMost of the sellers are also selling Lightning Welk or Busicon Contarium i.e. a shell from Florida and Bahamas, which is readily available in India for Rs. 100/- to Rs. 2000/- per piece in much much higher prices. Complains of forgery can also be initiated against them.\n\nIt is observed that many of the so-called dealers do not have the actual Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy pieces in hand. One can see pictures of the same Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy on different websites. Nobody knows, who has the actual piece available.\n"}
{"id": "2182999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182999", "title": "Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)", "text": "Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)\n\nDivine Service is the term used in the Eastern Orthodox Church to describe the daily cycle of public services celebrated in the temple (church building).\n\nThe word may be used also of the Divine Liturgy, though its normal connotation is the Daily Office. For Orthodox Christians, the serving of God in divine worship is an obligation of every Christian. This obligation involves both private and public worship. \n\nIn Orthodox theology, the first divine service was offered by Adam and Eve together in the Garden of Eden. In Paradise, divine worship consisted of freely glorifying God, which came naturally to them as a result of their unimpeded \"theoria\" (vision of God in his Divine Energies). After the Fall of man, this theoria became clouded, and worship required effort on the part of man. Now divine service was accomplished in the form of sacrificial offerings, penance and prayer. These sacrifices were later codified in the Law of Moses. Thence forward, only specific offerings were made, by specific persons (priests), in a specific manner, and at a specific place (eventually, the Temple in Jerusalem), and specific liturgical days and feasts were instituted. In Orthodox theology, any efficacy in these Old Testament sacrifices is dependent upon the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.\n\nAfter the Resurrection of Jesus and Pentecost, the Early Church originally continued to participate in the rites of the Jewish Temple (; ; , etc.), in addition to their own celebrations of the Eucharist and agape feasts. But after the Second Destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 AD, Christians began to develop their own distinct forms of worship. They did retain, however, some elements of Old Testament worship (chanting of the Psalms, use of incense, etc.) and the setting aside of specific times of the day for worship (; ). \n\nThese periods of prayer eventually developed into seven distinct services, held (a) during the three major periods of the day (evening, morning, and noonday) and (b) during the night watches.\n\nThe daily cycle begins with vespers and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:\n\nThe typica is used whenever the divine liturgy is not celebrated at its usual time, \"i.e.\", when there is a vesperal liturgy or no liturgy at all. On days when the liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the typica follows the sixth hour (or matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein; otherwise, on aliturgical days or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.\n\nAlso, there are Inter-Hours for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces \"God is the Lord\" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the ecclesiarch when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.\n\nIn addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, canons) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the Eucharist.\n\nThe full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other Katholika (sobors). In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation); otherwise, the Prothesis is served during matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the Liturgy of the Catechumens commencing straightway after the troparion following the Great Doxology.\n\nThe Midnight Office is seldom served in parishes churches except at the Paschal Vigil as the essential office wherein the burial shroud is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.\n\nThe sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.\n\nThe Divine Liturgy is not technically a part of the daily cycle of services, since theologically, the celebration of the Eucharist takes place in eternity. It is also not served daily in most parishes and smaller monasteries. However, when it is served, it is usually scheduled into the noonday aggregate.\n\n\n"}

His current endeavor is creating spiritually uplifting piano arrangements of popular LDS Hymns. He resides in Oceanside, California and is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there.\n\nGarth was born in Brigham City, Utah, the son of a senior executive chemical engineer working at Thiokol, G. Ray and JoAnne (Petty) Smith. After taking a short break to serve a mission to the Navajo people of Northern Arizona, Garth completed a college degree in Design Engineering Technology from Brigham Young University, graduating in the class of 1988. Afterwards, Garth accepted a position at Intergraph Corporation in Huntsville, Alabama. Later he moved to Carlsbad, California to accept a design position with Callaway Golf.\n\nGarth began his classical musical training on the piano at the age of 5. As a missionary and college student he would entertain many with his piano skills, including a special performance of a Beethoven sonata to over 15,000 people in the BYU Marriott Center at his college graduation.\n\nHe has been a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and the Nashville Songwriters Association International. In 1999 he was the recipient of the California Country Music Association (CCMA) \"Song of the Year\" award for the song \"Last Call.\" He has also performed as a keyboardist in jazz, rock, and country bands.\n\nWhile living in Alabama, Garth was introduced \"Writers in the Round\" at the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, Tennessee, a club famous for intimate, acoustic music performed by its composers. Soon, Garth was active participant there, performing his own original compositions.\n\nGarth also participated as both a rehearsal and performance pianist in the local community theaters of Huntsville. He also joined in various local bands touring throughout Northern Alabama and Southern Tennessee. They also participated in local music festivals including Huntsville's annual Panoply Arts Festival.\n\nRelocating to Southern California in 1996, Garth continued playing in country bands, as well as developing his songwriting abilities. His bands have played at many popular venues such as the Viejas Casino and the San Diego County Fair.\n\nBy 2014, Garth had turned his music to creating artistic arrangements of popular gospel hymns of LDS Church, producing several albums, music videos and other related works. His work is available through Deseret Books.\nRecently Garth has turned his attention to recording original arrangements of popular LDS Hymns, releasing this first album in 2014 titled \"Sacred Hymns Arranged and Performed on the Piano\". This has received great acclaim and wide national distribution within the LDS music genre.\n\nFor his second full-length album, \"How Beautiful Thy Temples, Sacred Hymns, Vol. II\" (released in 2015), Garth brings his masterful, reverent signature style to bear on hymns and sacred songs that focus on the beauty and eternal significance of temples. This has been his most successful release yet, having charted nationally at #21 on the iTunes Gospel new music chart.\n\nCrawford Gates, famous LDS composer, has called \"How Beautiful Thy Temples\" a \"fabulous recording.\" Smith's arrangement of Gates' beloved Easter hymn \"He is Not Here\" (from \"The Choirbook\") is included as track 8 on the album.\n\nFrom \"An Angel From on High,\" an arrangement inspired by the statue of the Angel Moroni that sits atop many temples, to the children's songbook classic \"I Love To See the Temple\". It's the perfect music to set the tone around your home on the Sabbath or to invite the Spirit more fully into your life day-to-day.\nOn 01-Sept-2016, Garth released his third album of LDS Hymn arrangements, a collection of fresh, new arrangements of about the Saviour, Jesus Christ, titled \"Behold the Great Redeemer, Sacred Hymns, Vol. III.\" A new addition is the release of his original sheet music so that now other experienced pianists can perform this genre music in church worship services and other religious settings. Selections include \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" \"In Humility our Saviour,\" and another Crawford Gates masterpiece, \"Our Saviour's Love\".\n\"The bottom line is this—Smith’s music takes you to a place of serenity, an escape from the world for a moment, and provides the listener with beautiful arrangements that point to the Savior.\"\nReleased in time for the 2017 Christmas season, \"A Sacred Christmas\", this album features a variety of his favorite hymns that commemorate the birth of the Saviour. This album features several guest artists, Calee Reed, Michael Dowdle, One Voice Children's Choir, Sun Valley Carolers and others that add an extra layer of inspiration.\n\nHe frequently travels the country performing free, inspirational music firesides. His 60 minute presentation explores gospel principles found in 8 hymns that includes the restoration, prayer, sacrament, forgiveness, and most importantly, the atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe multimedia presentation features a Christ-centered narrative, live piano, video clips from prophets and apostles, and artwork from other LDS artists.\n\nGarth's piano is a backdrop featured in many gospel music videos produced directly by or for the LDS Church, including the church's recent #LIGHTtheWORLD Christmas season service message. The most popular of these videos is the Heaven's Hallelujah arrangement featuring vocalist Lauren Sullivan. Many of these are accessible for free on their YouTube Channel. \n\nAnother first ever event occurred for Garth on 09-Sept-2016, with the production of his online concert on Facebook Live on the Moroni Channel.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Breton artistic movement Seiz Breur. \n\nBerthou was born in Paimpol, Côtes-d'Armor. He trained as a chemical engineer, then worked full-time as a pharmacist at Guipavas. In 1929 he suggested to fellow chemist and Breton nationalist Célestin Lainé that a militant group dedicated to direct action against the French state and its symbols should be formed. This was to be called \"Kentoc'h Mervel\" (Rather Death). As Lainé sought his own recruits, Berthou brought the staff of the nationalist journal Breiz da Zont to join \"en masse\". When Lainé discovered this he distanced himself from Berthou, believing that a public journal could not create an effective support for a secret organization, as it would be too easily infiltrated. Lainé went on to form the terrorist faction \"Gwenn ha du\". Lainé later wrote \"I don't know what became of Kentoc'h Mervel after that, except that it never grew beyond fancy words.\"\n\nHowever when \"Gwenn ha du\" launched their first attack in 1932, bombing a sculpture, four informants claimed that Berthou had provided the nitroglycerin.\n\nBerthou became closely associated with neo-Druidic and Celticist movements, writing poetry in the Breton language. As part of the Aryanist ideologies of the era, he studied the links between ancient Celtic (Brythonic and Gaelic) culture and Hinduism. His esoterism linked him with various Masonic and Aryanist groups. Along with Morvan Marchal and others he participated in the Kredenn Geltiek (Celtic Creed) Druidic group, adopting the bardic name Kerverziou, though also using the pseudonym \"Iaktimagos Vissurix\". He contributed to the Celticist journals \"Gwalarn\" and \"Kad\". He also founded the periodical \"Ogam\" and was president of \"Les Amis de la Tradition Celtique\" (Friends of the Celtic Tradition).\n\nIn his metaphysical poetry written in \"ancient Gallic\", he predicted the end of the \"white race\" in the year 2018, a date which corresponded to 3888 in his own personal calendar, which he created based on the cycles of the moon and sun, starting with the supposed date of the legendary Irish Battle of Mag Tuired.\n\nBerthou's mystical Aryanist ideas were closely linked to aspects of Nazi ideology. He contributed to the openly pro-Nazi review \"Stur\", edited by Olier Mordrel, and also contributed to other pro-Nazi periodicals. During the war he was involved with the \"Institut Celtique\", created by the Occupation government. Nevertheless, Berthou's involvement remained purely literary.\n"}

{"id": "1962530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962530", "title": "Holy anointing oil", "text": "Holy anointing oil\n\nThe holy anointing oil (Hebrew: שמן המשחה \"shemen ha-mishchah\", \"oil of anointing\") formed an integral part of the ordination of the priesthood and the High Priest as well as in the consecration of the articles of the Tabernacle () and subsequent temples in Jerusalem. The primary purpose of anointing with the holy anointing oil was to sanctify, to set the anointed person or object apart as \"qodesh\", or \"holy\" ().\n\nOriginally, the oil was used exclusively for the priests and the Tabernacle articles, but its use was later extended to include prophets and kings (). It was forbidden to be used on an outsider () or to be used on the body of any common person () and the Israelites were forbidden to duplicate any like it for themselves ().\n\nChristianity has continued the practice of using holy anointing oil as a devotional practice, as well as in various liturgies.\n\nThe holy anointing oil described in Exodus was created from:\n\n\nThe Bible teaches us about the use of holy anointing oil as a symbol of GOD’s ability to bring about a number of essentials for our wellbeing and salvation, including healing (Mark 6:13), consecration (Exodus 30; Leviticus 8:10-13), breaking bonds (Isaiah 10:27) and deliverance (Mark 6:12-13), to name a few.\n\nThe Hebrew term \"Messiah\" (in Greek \"Christos\") means \"the anointed one\", and relates to anyone anointed (dedicated to God). The person thus anointed might be a king, a priest, or a prophet.\n\nCustoms varied in the cultures of the Middle East. However, anointing with special oil in Israel was either a strictly priestly or kingly right. When a prophet was anointed, it was because he was first a priest. When a non-king was anointed, such as Elijah's anointing of Hazael and Jehu, it was a sign that Hazael was to become king of Aram (Syria) and Jehu was to become king of Israel. Extra-biblical sources show that it was common to anoint kings in many ancient Near Eastern monarchies. Therefore, in Israel, anointing was not only a sacred act but also a socio-political one.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the Israelite way of life and cultural environment put great importance on the sense of smell for survival and was highly esteemed. It contributed to the ability of man to orient himself and to find his way in a world where life and death were permanently struggling. Where stench arose, he diagnosed the presence of disease, decay, rotting processes and death (Exodus 7:18) and where pleasant aromas existed were places biologically clean and conducive to habitation and/or food production and harvesting. Spices and oils were chosen which assisted man in orienting himself and in creating a sense of safety as well as a sense of elevation above the physical world of decay. The sense of smell was also considered highly esteemed by deity. In Deuteronomy 4:28 and Psalms 115:5-6 the sense of smell is included in connection with the polemics against idols. In the Hebrew Bible God takes pleasure in inhaling the \"soothing odor\" (\"reah hannihoah\") of offerings (Genesis 8:21 etc.).\n\nTo the ancient Israelite there was no oil or fat with more symbolic meaning than olive oil. It was used as an emollient, a fuel for lighting lamps, for nutrition, and for many other purposes. It was scented olive oil that was chosen to be a holy anointing oil for the Israelites.\n\nSome believe in the continuity factor relative to the holy anointing oil.\nCustoms utilizing the continuity factor is found in many of the world’s religions. For example, early Jewish rabbis stressed the importance of the succession of classical semikhah and the Catholic Church emphasized the importance of apostolic succession, the continuity of laying on of hands for ordination, in an unbroken chain. The continuity factor relative to the holy anointing oil can be found in rabbinical judaism, in the Armenian Church, in the Assyrian Church of the East in the Coptic Church, in the Nazrani and Saint Thomas churches, and others.\n\nAs mentioned above, the continuity factor can be found in Rabbinic Judaism, including that of the holy anointing oil.\n\nOne Jewish tradition teaches that the ashes of the last red heifer sacrificed were always mixed with the ashes of each new red heifer The Temple Institute states, \"Some opinions maintain that the newer ashes were always mixed together with a combination of the previous ashes. One way of understanding this, is to the view this mixture of old and new ashes as being yet another precautionary measure... Additionally, mixing in the newer ashes we have produced now with those from olden times is a way of connecting through time with the original heifer that was slaughtered and prepared by Moses. As such, in a sense, it is a way of connecting with the level of Moses himself.\" Since the last succession of ashes of the red heifer were either hidden or lost after 70 AD Vendyl Jones searched for the original ashes by following the map on the Copper Scroll that purports to tell the location, so that the old ashes can be added to the new, which serves to continue the \"continuity factor.\"\n\nThere is a traditional Jewish \"mitzvah\" that when making \"challah\" one should separate and set aside part of the dough. Some Jewish people remove a small piece of the \"challah\" dough (the word \"challah\" means to remove) and give it away to someone else as a challah starter, although according to traditional Jewish law, this piece may not be eaten under any modern day conditions, and must thus be destroyed in a dignified manner. In one Jewish custom a portion of the \"challah\" is set aside (refrigerated) until the making of new \"challah\" when the old is added to the new. It is recorded in Exodus 30:31 \"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\" (Exodus 30:31). Commenting on this verse Rashi quotes a teaching of the Sages [Horiyos 11b] that the original Shemen HaMishcha that Moses made, to anoint the priesthood and the tabernacle furnishings, would remain intact in its entirety into the distant future (\"l'asid lavoh\"). When the Temple was to be rebuilt they would then need that very same holy anointing oil to anoint the priests prior to their service in the Third Temple as well as to anoint the furnishings of the mishkan. Vendyl Jones claimed that such a small quantity of oil (around a gallon) would not last that long. It is claimed that one juglet of oil lasted over 800 years. To explain this discrepancy it is claimed that one of two things occurred: Either the container of holy anointing oil miraculously multiplied when supply became low (as did the of oil mentioned in the story of Elijah and the widow woman or the oil that lasted for eight days without being consumed during the Jewish Chanukka) or, following ancient customs, new oil was added to the old thus continuing the original oil for all time.\n\nAnointing oil is used in Christianity. A passage in the New Testament says,\nThe holy anointing oil of the Armenian Church is called the holy muron ('muron' means myrrh). The church holds a special reverence for the continuity factor of the oil. According to tradition, a portion of the holy anointing oil of Exodus 30, which Moses and Aaron had blessed, still remained in Jesus' time. Jesus Christ blessed this oil and then gave some of it to Thaddeus, who took the holy oil to Armenia and healed King Abkar of a terrible skin disease by anointing him with the holy oil. Saint Thaddeus is said to have buried a bottle of the holy anointing oil in Daron under an evergreen tree. Saint Gregory the Illuminator discovered the hidden treasure and mixed it with muron that he had blessed. It is said that \"To this day, whenever a new batch of muron is prepared and blessed, a few drops of the old one go into it, so that the Armenian muron always contains a small amount of the original oil blessed by Moses, Jesus Christ, and Gregory the Illuminator.\"\n\nThe holy muron is composed of olive oil and forty-eight aromas and flowers. The remaining portion of the previous blessed holy oil is poured into the newly prepared oil during the blessing ceremony and passes the blessing from generation to generation. It is said that this very procedure has been followed for nearly 1700 years. The Catholicos of all Armenians in Etchmiadzin combines a new mixture of holy muron in the cauldron every seven years using a portion of the holy muron from the previous blend. This is distributed to all of the Armenian churches throughout the world. Before Christianity, muron was reserved solely for the enthroning of royalty and for very special events. In later years, it was used with extreme unction and to heal the sick, and to anoint ordained clergy.\n\nIt is said by the Assyrian Church that the holy anointing oil \"was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Tuma.\" The holy anointing oil of the Assyrian Church is variously referred to as the Oil of the Holy Horn, the Oil of the Qarna, or the Oil of Unction. This holy oil is an apostolic tradition, believed to have originated from the oil consecrated by the apostles themselves, and which by succession has been handed down in the Church to this day. The original oil which the disciples blessed began to run low and more oil was added to it. The Assyrian Church believes that this has continued to this very day with new oil being added as the oil level lowers. This succession of holy oil is believed to be a continuity of the blessings placed upon the oil from the beginning.\n\nBoth the Oil of Unction and the Holy Leaven are referred to as \"leaven\" although there is no actual leavening agent, so the nomenclature Holy Leaven seems to be a bit misleading. Yohanan bar Abgareh referred to it in 905 as did Shlemon d-Basra in the 13th century. Yohanan bar Zo’bee in the 14th century integrated the Holy Oil of unction with baptism and other rites. Isaaq Eshbadhnaya in the 15th century wrote the Scholion which is a commentary on specific theological topics. It tells us that John the Baptist gave John the Evangelist a baptismal vessel of water from Christ’s baptism, which was collected by John the Baptist from water dripping from Christ after his baptism in Jordan River. Jesus gave each disciple a \"loaf,\" at the Last Supper, but the Scholion informs us that to John he gave two with the instructions to eat only one and to save the other. At the crucifixion John collected the water from the Lord's side in the vessel and the blood he collected on the loaf from the Last Supper. After the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost the disciples took the vessel and mixed it with oil and each took a horn of it. The loaf they ground up and added flour and salt to it. Each took a portion of the holy oil and the holy bread which were distributed in every land by the hand of those who missionized there.\n\nThe Assyrian Church has two types of holy oils; the one is ordinary olive oil, blessed or not blessed, the other is the oil of the Holy Horn which is believed to have been handed down from the apostles. The Holy Horn is constantly renewed by the addition of oil blessed by a bishop on Maundy Thursday. While most anyone can by tradition be anointed with the regular oil, the oil of the Holy Horn is restricted for ordination and sanctification purposes.\n\nThe holy anointing oil of the Coptic Church is referred to as the holy myron ('myron' means myrrh). The laying on of hands for the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is believed to have been a specific rite of the apostles and their successors the bishops, and as the regions of mission increased, consequently numbers of Christian believers and converts increased. It was not possible for the apostles to wander through all the countries and cities to lay hands on all of those baptized, so they established anointment by the holy myron as an alternative, it is believed, for the laying on of the hands for the Holy Spirit’s indwelling.\n\nThe first who made the myron were the apostles who had kept the fragrant oils which were on the body of Jesus Christ during his burial, and they added the spices which were brought by those women who prepared them to anoint Christ, but had discovered he had been resurrected. They melted all these spices in pure olive oil, prayed on it in the upper room in Zion, and made it a holy anointing oil. They decided that their successors, the bishops, must renew the making of the myron whenever it is nearly used up, by incorporating the original oil with the new. Today the Coptic Church uses it for ordination, in the sanctification of baptismal water, and in the consecration of churches and church altars and vessels.\n\nIt is said that when St. Mark went to Alexandria, he took with him some of the holy myron oil made by the apostles and that he used it in the sacrament of Chrism, as did the patriarchs who succeeded him. This continued until the era of Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th patriarch, who then decided to remake the myron in Alexandria. Hence, it is reported, he prepared all of the needed perfumes and spices, with pure olive oil, from which God ordered Moses to make the holy anointing oil as specified in the recipe in the thirtieth chapter of the book of Exodus. Then the sanctification of the holy myron was fulfilled in Alexandria, and Athanasius was entrusted with the holy oil, which contained spices which touched Jesus’s body while it was in the tomb, as well as the original oil which had been prepared by the apostles and brought to Egypt by St. Mark. He distributed the oil to the churches abroad: to the See of Rome, Antioch and Constantinople, together with a document of its authenticity, and all of the patriarchs are said to have rejoiced in receiving it.\n\nThe Coptic Church informs that the fathers of the Church and scholars like St. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, St. Hippolytus, Origen, St. Ambrose, and St. Cyril of Jerusalem, spoke about the holy myron and how they received its use in anointing by tradition. For example, St. Hippolytus in his Apostolic Tradition, speaks of the holy oil \"according to ancient custom\" Origen writes about the holy oil “according to the tradition of the church\" St. Cyril of Jerusalem goes into further detail in speaking about the grace of the Holy Spirit in the holy myron: \"this oil is not just any oil: after the epiclesis of the Spirit, it becomes charism of Christ and power of the Holy Spirit through the presence of the deity\" \n\nThe early fathers and scholars mention the use of the holy myron, as well as a documentation by Abu'l-Barakat Ibn Kabar, a 14th-century Coptic priest and scholar, in his book Misbah az-Zulmah fi idah al-khidmah (The Lamp of Darkness in Clarifying the Service). According to his account, the holy apostles took from the spices that were used to anoint the body of Jesus Christ when he was buried, added pure olive oil to it, and prayed over it in Upper Zion, the first church where the Holy Spirit fell in the upper room.\n\nThis holy oil was then distributed among all of the apostles so that wherever they preached, new converts would be anointed with it as a seal. They also commanded that whenever a new batch of Holy Myron was made, they add to it the old holy myron to keep the first holy myron continually with all that would ever be made afterwards.\n\nAccording to the available resources, the holy myron in the Church of Egypt has been made 34 times.\n\nAccording to tradition, St. Thomas laid the original foundation for Christianity in India. It is reported that Jewish communities already present in India enticed Thomas to make his missionary journey there. It is said that he brought holy anointing oil with him and that the St. Thomas Christians still have this oil to this day.\n\nPatriarch Ya`qub, of the Syrian Malabar Nasrani Church, is remembered for his celebration of the liturgy and his humble encouragement to accept the simple way of life. After he consecrated sacred myron in the Mor Gabriel monastery in 1964, holy myron flowed from the glass container the following day and many people were said to have been healed by it.\n\nWhile sources agree about the identity of four of the five ingredients of anointing oil, the identity of the fifth, \"kaneh bosem\", has been a matter of debate. The Bible indicates that it was an aromatic cane or grass, which was imported from a distant land by way of the spice routes, and that a related plant grows naturally in Israel. Several different plants have been named as possibly being the \"kaneh bosem\".\n\nMost lexicographers, botanists, and biblical commentators translate \"keneh bosem\" as \"cane balsam\". The Aramaic Targum Onkelos renders the Hebrew \"kaneh bosem\" in Aramaic as \"q'nei busma\". Ancient translations and sources identify this with the plant variously referred to as sweet cane, or sweet flag (nl. the Septuagint, the Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1, Saadia Gaon and Jonah ibn Janah). This plant is known to botanists as \"acorus calamus\". According to Aryeh Kaplan in \"The Living Torah\", \"It appears that a similar species grew in the Holy Land, in the Hula region in ancient times (Theophrastus, \"History of Plants\" 9:7).\"\n\nMaimonides (\"Yad, Kley HaMikdash\" 1:3), in contrast, indicates that it was the Indian plant, rosha grass (\"Cymbopogon martinii\"), which resembles red straw. Many standard reference works on Bible plants by Michael Zohary (University of Jerusalem, Cambridge, 1985), James A. Duke (2010), and Hans Arne Jensen (Danish 2004, English translation 2012) support this conclusion, arguing that the plant was a variety of Cymbopogon. James A. Duke, quoting Zohary, notes that it is \"hopeless to speculate\" about the exact species, but that \"Cymbopogon citratus\" (Indian lemon-grass) and \"Cymbopogon schoenanthus\" are also possibilities. Kaplan follows Maimonides in identifying it as the \"Cymbopogon martinii\" or palmarosa plant.\n\nOther possible identifications have also been made. Sula Benet in \"Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp\" (1967), identified it as \"cannabis\". Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan notes that \"On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek \"cannabis\", the hemp plant. There are, however, some authorities who identify the 'sweet cane' with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel).\" Benet in contrast argued that equating Keneh Bosem with sweet cane could be traced to a mistranslation in the Septuagint, which mistook Keneh Bosem, later referred to as \"cannabos\" in the Talmud, as \"kalabos\", a common Egyptian marsh cane plant.\n\n"}

The articles in question included a column by Mark Steyn titled \"The Future Belongs to Islam\", an excerpt from a book written by Steyn.\n\nThe Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint.

And we continue to have grave concerns about a system of complaint and adjudication that allows a media outlet to be pursued in multiple jurisdictions on the same complaint, brought by the same complainants, subjecting it to costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to say nothing of the inconvenience.

The co-complainant in this case is Naiyer Habib, the BC board director for the Canadian Islamic Congress, who filed the complaint on behalf of all Muslims in British Columbia.\n\nJoseph Faisal, legal counsel for the Canadian Islamic Congress opened his arguments by stating that the article \"Maclean's\" published presented Muslims as \"a violent people\" who hold traditional Canadian values \"in contempt,\" and depicted Islam as \"inhuman\" and \"violent.\" He also argued that the cover image that \"Maclean's\" chose to run, the image of two Muslim women, along with the magazine's cover line, \"could have been the picture of a horror cult movie.\" Faisal criticized 20 other articles that ran in \"Maclean's\", beginning in January 2005 that he claimed were offensive to Muslims and criticized \"Maclean's\" for publishing letters from readers praising the magazine and Steyn. Faisal added that \"We're prepared to deal with those articles piece by piece, paragraph by paragraph, and those things that we find objectionable.\"\n\nFaisal and Habib's complaint claims that \"Maclean's\" and Steyn, who wrote the article, violated Section 7-1 of British Columbia's Human Rights Code, which stipulates that a person must not publish or cause to be published anything that discriminates against a person or group, or exposes them to hatred or contempt. Under the BC Human Rights code, the complainants are not required to prove harm, or malicious intent; all that is required is a reasonable determination that the excerpt did express hatred and contempt toward Muslims, and likely caused it to spread.\n\nFaisal implored the BC Human Rights Tribunal to take action, arguing that it is \"the court of last resort. You are the only opportunity to right a terrible wrong to a clearly identifiable group numbering hundreds of thousands in this great country, and tens of thousands in the beautiful province of British Columbia. You are the only thing between racist, hateful, contemptuous Islamophobic and irresponsible journalism, and law-abiding Canadian citizens.\"\n\nMahmoud Ayoub, a historian of religion with a doctorate from Harvard University, testified that Steyn's claim in his article that Islam is \"an underground movement trying to take over the world\" has no basis in Islamic scripture or tradition. Ayoub disputed Steyn's interpretation of the word \"jihad,\" asserting that the word has a variety of meanings unrelated to violence. Ayoub also disputed Steyn's portrayal of Islamic extremism as mainstream saying that the extremist fringe represented less than one million of the total 1.5 billion Muslims.\n\nLawyers for \"Maclean's\" argued that publication of the article is part of free speech and open debate. Julian Porter, the lead counsel for the magazine, asserted that Steyn's article \"does not meet the standard of hatred or contempt, and that's what we'll argue later in the week\". The lawyers for \"Maclean's\" did not call any witnesses during the week of hearings and instead argued against the complaint on constitutional grounds.\n\nIn his closing arguments, Faisal stated that \"There has never been a case in this country that has had such clear, concise evidence, ever. There will never be any more demonstrable evidence of hatred that has been perpetrated by this article.\" Faisal also sharply criticized Julian Porter, one of Maclean's lawyers, stating that: \n\nIf [Mr. Porter] had his way, each and every Muslim in the country [would] also bear the additional albatross that, apparently, we as Muslims in the country are responsible, personally, for Osama Bin Laden. How ridiculous - this is the type of mindset that prevails in the media.\nThe Canadian Association of Journalists and the BC Civil Liberties Association presented a joint submission asking the tribunal to refine its interpretation of hate speech saying that previous rulings have been \"overly expansive\" and \"have consequently brought the institutional legitimacy of the (tribunal) into question.\"\n\nIf \"Maclean's\" is found to have violated BC's Human Rights Code, it could face sanctions, including payment to the complainant \"an amount that the member or panel considers appropriate to compensate that person for injury to dignity, feelings and self respect or to any of them.\" However, Faisal has stated that he only wants the Tribunal to order \"Maclean's\" to publish \"an appropriate response.\" The Tribunal's hearing concluded on June 8, 2008.\n\nSteyn told the media that he was hoping the tribunal would rule against \"Maclean's\". \"We want to lose so we can take it to a real court and if necessary up to the Supreme Court of Canada and we can get the ancient liberties of free-born Canadian citizens that have been taken away from them by tribunals like this,\" he said. Steyn was not called to testify at the hearing but was in attendance for several of the five days of the proceedings.\n\nThe day after the hearing ended, Khurrum Awan, one of the complainants in the BC case, spoke to a meeting of the Canadian Arab Federation and complained that since \"Maclean's\" is not a member of the Ontario Press Council or any similar body there is no authority within the profession of journalism, that can \"condemn the journalist, condemn the publication, direct them to publish a letter to the editor.\" He added that he would \"love\" to see the case appealed into the regular courts. Awan also stated that:\nAnd we have to tell them, you know what, if you're not going to allow us to do that, there will be consequences. You will be taken to the human rights commission, you will be taken to the press council, and you know what? If you manage to get rid of the human rights code provisions [on hate speech], we will then take you to the civil courts system. And you know what? Some judge out there might just think that perhaps it's time to have a tort of group defamation, and you might be liable for a few million dollars.\n\nAt the Niagara-on-the-Lake conference of the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies in June 2008, Wahida Valiante, national vice-president of the Canadian Islamic Congress, stated that the commissions are the only recourse available to minorities treated unfairly in the media since membership in press councils is optional and criminal hate speech charges require the consent of the federal Attorney-General.\n\nValiante compared Steyn to James Keegstra, an Alberta high school teacher who taught and tested his students on how Jews \"created the Holocaust to gain sympathy. They basically talk about the same theories. This is not a civil dialogue.\" She said that, in Germany, long before the Holocaust, \"it was the words that set the stage for what happened later on... We may end up with the same fate, and that is at the heart of why [the complainants] wanted to take this on.\"\n\nHaroon Siddiqui, a columnist for the \"Toronto Star\", wrote that \"Only genuine misunderstanding or deliberate distortion can explain the media's mostly one-sided discourse on the case of Maclean's before the federal, as well as the Ontario and British Columbia, human rights commissions.\" Siddiqui asserted that the Canadian media \"do not publish racist cartoons and anti-Semitic rants\" and \"that Maclean's published a series of virulent articles about Muslims itself speaks volumes.\" Siddiqui also wrote that Mark Steyn's article was \"a 4,800-word piece portraying Muslims as a menace to the West.\".\n\nOn October 10, 2008, the tribunal dismissed the complaint, stating that the Maclean's article did not violate the province's human rights law. The tribunal stated that the article contained historical, religious and factual inaccuracies, relied on common Muslim stereotypes and tried to \"rally public opinion by exaggeration and causing the reader to fear Muslims.\" However, they also ruled that the article was not likely to expose Muslims to hatred or contempt.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that \"With all its inaccuracies and hyperbole, [the article] has resulted in political debate which, in our view, [B. C.'s hate speech human rights law] was never intended to suppress. In fact, as the evidence in this case amply demonstrates, the debate has not been suppressed and the concerns about the impact of hate speech silencing a minority have not been borne out.\"\n\nFaisal Joseph, lawyer for the CIC, stated that he may appeal because the decision \"sends the wrong message.\" In a statement, Joseph wrote that \"it is now acceptable for some columnists and media in this country to cloak freedom to hate in the mantle of freedom of speech.\" However, Joseph also stated that:\nOur objective of exposing Maclean's and Mark Steyn for their falsehoods, and misrepresentation and stereotyping of Muslims has been achieved. We are delighted the tribunal has discredited the content of the articles that Maclean's and Mark Steyn have been publishing about Islam and Muslims. We also appreciate the tribunal's citing of the vitriolic blogs related to the Maclean's article as some evidence that the article exposes Muslims to hatred and contempt...On the whole, however, the case was a leap forward in the struggle against media-propagated Islamophobia. The fact that human rights commissions in Ontario and B. C. have recognized the role of Canada's national news magazine in promoting societal intolerance towards Muslim Canadians and in publishing false and exaggerated material highlights the urgent need for editors and newscasters to critically examine how they represent Muslims in their news and editorial coverage.\nMark Steyn, who wrote the offending article, stated that a lesser-known writer without a media conglomerate in his corner probably would have been convicted, adding that\nFor me the problem is not the book, the problem for me is Canada, and I will never think of the deranged dominion quite the same way again. It has made me understand just how easily and incrementally free societies, often for the most fluffy reasons, slip into a kind of soft, beguiling totalitarianism. I don't understand why they lack the cojones to find us guilty\n\nand that \"The only reason to go through all this nonsense is to get to the stage where you can appeal it to a real court, and if necessary up to the Supreme Court\". Steyn further criticized the Human Rights Commissions and Canadian politicians, stating that\nthey didn't like the heat they were getting under this case. Life was chugging along just fine, chastising non-entities nobody had ever heard about, piling up a lot of cockamamie jurisprudence that inverts the principles of common law, and nobody paid any attention to it. Once they got the glare of publicity from the Maclean's case, the kangaroos decided to jump for the exit. I've grown tired of the number of Canadian members of Parliament who've said to me over the last best part of a year now, \"Oh, well of course I fully support you, I'm fully behind you, but I'd just be grateful if you didn't mention my name in public\".\nJulian Porter, the lawyer for Rogers Publishing (which owns Maclean's) stated that the case illustrated how human rights commissions are neither trained nor equipped to rule on journalistic disputes, which require the delicate balancing of constitutional rights, stating that\nIt means that when you're making an editorial decision, you have to look over your shoulder at this grey, fuzzy monster of the human rights commission ...Suddenly, we're in a position where an immense group can, in effect, bring a libel action without the libel defences [of truth or fair comment].\nThe complaints prompted criticism of the CIC from various writers as well as a federal cabinet minister, Secretary of State for Multiculturalism Jason Kenney, who said \"attacking opinions expressed by a columnist in a major magazine is a pretty bold attack on the basic Canadian value of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.\"\n\nBrian Hutchinson, of the \"National Post\", criticized the BC Human Rights Tribunal for agreeing to hear testimony from Khurrum Awan, one of the student lawyers who helped with the human rights complaint in Ontario on how Muslims in British Columbia were affected by the article. \"Maclean's\" argued that because Awan is not a resident of British Columbia, he should not be allowed to give testimony about the harm the article allegedly caused to Muslims in BC. However, Heather MacNaughton, the Chairwoman of the Tribunal, allowed his testimony, justifying the decision by stating that \"strict rules of evidence do not apply\" in cases before the Tribunal.\n\nJason Gratl, a lawyer for the Canadian Association of Journalists and the BC Civil Liberties Association, criticized the hearing, stating that \"We're of the view in the first place that the human rights tribunal doesn't have any business deciding what appropriate expression in Canada might be. Its activities and jurisdictions undermine the ability of journalists and members of the public to discuss important public issues such as race and religion.\"\n\nEzra Levant, former publisher of the \"Western Standard\" Magazine, and the former target of a complaint to the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, opined that \"I think this strikes at press freedom and even the freedom of thought of all Canadians. I think it's really an embarrassment that this is happening.\"\n\nIn April, 2008 the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) stated that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint, launched by Elmasry, based on a gap in the legislation (the relevant portions of the Ontario Human Rights Code only address discrimination via signs or symbols, not printed material). Despite not having jurisdiction, the Commission published a statement saying that \"Maclean's\" media coverage \"has been identified as contributing to Islamophobia and promoting societal intolerance towards Muslim, Arab and South Asian Canadians\". The Commission indicated that more discussion on the topic of Islamophobia in the media was warranted.\n\nWhile it dismissed the complaint by the CIC against \"Maclean's\", the OHRC also issued a statement saying the article in question \"portray[ed] Muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics, including being a threat to ‘the West’,\" and thus promoted prejudice towards Muslims and others. In an interview, Chief Commissioner Barbara Hall stated that \"When the media writes, it should exercise great caution that it's not promoting stereotypes that will adversely impact on identifiable groups. I think one needs to be very careful when one speaks in generalities, that in fact one is speaking factually about all the people in a particular group.\"\n\nFaisal Joseph, a lawyer for the complainants, said he was \"delighted\" by the Commission's strong stance against the magazine, despite the failure of the complaint. He said he knew the complaint would probably be dismissed, \"but we thought this would be an excellent way to demonstrate the gaping hole in human rights legislation in Ontario, and the [Commission] has done exactly that.\" He also noted that other provincial human rights codes have provisions against published writings, and argued that it is \"ridiculous\" that Ontario does not. He said the inconsistency will require intervention by the Attorney-General to broaden the scope of the legislation.\"\n\nHall's statement drew criticism from a number of sources.\n\nTarek Fatah, a founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress stated that for the Commission \"to refer to Maclean's magazine and journalists as contributing to racism is bullshit, if you can use that word\" and that the Commission has unfairly taken sides against freedom of speech in a dispute within the Canadian Muslim community between moderates and fundamentalists. \"There are within the staff [of the Ontario Human Rights Commission], and among the commissioners, hardline Islamic supporters of Islamic extremism, and this [handling of the Maclean's case] reflects their presence over there\" and that \"In the eyes of the Ontario human rights commission, the only good Muslim is an Islamist Muslim. As long as we hate Canada, we will be cared for. As soon as we say Canada is our home and we have to defend her traditions, freedoms and secular democracy, we will be considered as the outside.\"\n\nAs reported by an article from Barbara Kay in the National Post, Fatah stated in a press conference (on October 2, 2008) that the OHRC has been \"infiltrated by Islamists\" and that some of its commissioners are closely linked to the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation, both of which, according to Fatah, have \"contempt for Canadian values.\"\n\nJonathan Kay, a columnist for the \"National Post\" also criticized Hall's leadership of the OHRC in the aftermath of the decision, writing that Hall was had been influenced by \"radicals\" in the OHRC bureaucracy. Kay also stating that the OHRC statement was \"a genuinely frightening manifesto written by people who have a thinly disguised contempt for press freedom and heterodox opinions.\" Kay argued that if a media outlet chooses \"to be \"unfair,\" or simply to have an opinion that some people, or even everyone, disagrees with, that's our right. We'll pay the price in lost readers and advertisers.\" Mark Steyn, who wrote the article in \"Maclean's\" that the complaint was based on, commented that \"Even though they (the OHRC) don't have the guts to hear the case, they might as well find us guilty. Ingenious!\"\n\nIn an interview, Hall defended her actions and her comments about \"Maclean's\", stating that:\nEvery day we comment on things that aren't [formal] cases. Part of our job is to identify discrimination and to work to address it, but more often it is putting out a statement, having a debate, meeting with people, discussing and understanding the impact. Whenever we comment on what someone has said or done, we comment because we want them to think about the Human Rights Code, and the implications of it, and to think seriously about what they're saying or doing does to other people. I think that's an important and legitimate part of our role... I think that part of freedom of speech is being able to say things and another part of it is being able to be critical of things that are said. I don't view it as a chill. I view it as responsibility.\nThe editors of \"Maclean's\" denounced the OHRC for its \"zealous condemnation of their journalism\" accusing them of \"morphing out of their conciliatory roles to become crusaders working to reshape journalistic discourse in Canada.\" \"Maclean's\" alleged that Hall's press release was \"a drive-by smear,\" and \"perhaps the greatest disappointment in this whole saga.\" The editors claimed that \"[Hall] cited no evidence, considered no counter-arguments, and appointed herself prosecutor, judge and jury in one fell swoop. If we weren't tolerant and charitable people, we'd be calling for her resignation.\"\n\nOn April 2008, OHRC Chief Commissioner Barbara Hall wrote a letter to \"Maclean's\", which the magazine subsequently published as a letter to the editor. Hall wrote that once that decision to dismiss the complaint was made, the OHRC was \"free to comment on the issues raised. We followed the correct process for both aspects of our mandate under section 29 of the Ontario Human Rights Code – protecting and promoting human rights in order to create \"… a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person…,\" as set out in the Preamble.\n\nHall further stated that:\n\"Maclean’s\" and its writers are free to express their opinions. The OHRC is mandated to express what it sees as unfair and harmful comment or conduct that may lead to discrimination. We need to keep in mind that freedom of expression is not the only right in the Charter. There is a full set of rights accorded to all members of our society, including freedom from discrimination. No single right is any more or less important than another. And the enjoyment of one depends on the enjoyment of the other. This means if you want to stand up and defend the right to freedom of expression then you must be willing to do the same for the right to freedom from discrimination. The human rights system exists in Canada, in part, to shine a light on prejudice and to provoke debate – and action. We called for debate and dialogue; we still do. We have taken controversial views before and no doubt will again. That is inevitable because we have a mandate to promote change – away from unfair stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour and towards a culture of human rights. We agree with the Editors of \"Maclean’s\": critics are entitled to their opinions. Sometimes we must be critical. We have that duty, enshrined in law, to speak up on human rights issues of the day – and we will continue to do so.\n\nElmasry stated that \"You should understand there is a difference between criticizing a religion, OK, comparing it to another religion, and to make a mockery of the symbol of that religion. This is up to the legal system to decide.\" Elmasry argued that Canadian law is deficient because it lacks the concept of \"group defamation,\" which he explained should be based on the principle that \"There is (sic) individual human rights and there is (sic) collective, group human rights, and both of them are very important.\"\n\nElmasry sharply criticized British Columbia MP Keith Martin, who proposed scrapping the hate speech provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Elmasry stated that Martin's proposal was \"obviously\" motivated by fear of Muslims.\"\n\nIn a subsequent interview with the \"Canadian Arab News\", Khurrum Awan stated that, although the all of the complaints were dismissed, \"We attained our strategic objective — to increase the cost of publishing anti-Islamic material\"; Awan claimed that Maclean's collective legal costs for the complaints was approximately $2 million.\"\n\nThe case has been cited as a motivating factor in the repeal of Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n"}
{"id": "498126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=498126", "title": "Inward light", "text": "Inward light\n\nLight of God, Light of Christ, Christ within, That of God, Spirit of God within us, Light within, inward light and inner light are related phrases commonly used within the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) as metaphors for Christ's light shining on or in them. It was propagated by the founder of the Quaker movement, George Fox, who \"preached faith in and reliance on 'inward light' (the presence of Christ in the heart)\". The first Quakers were known to sit in silence and meditate on the words of the Bible until they felt the inward light of God shining upon them and the Holy Spirit speaking.\n\n\"The Key to the Faith and Practice of the Religious Society of Friends\" states that the Inward Light is \"both the historical, living Jesus, and as the Grace of God extended to people that simultaneously makes us conscious of our sins, forgives them, and gives us the strength and the will to overcome them\" and \"teaches us the difference between right and wrong, truth and falseness, good and evil\". As such, the word \"light\" is commonly used by Christians (including Quakers) as a metaphor for Christ, derived from many Biblical passages including , which states:\n\nQuakers take this idea of walking in the Light of Christ to refer to God's presence within a person, and to a direct and personal experience of God, although this varies to some extent between Quakers in different yearly meetings. Quakers believe not only that individuals can be guided by this light, but that Friends might meet together and receive collective guidance from God by sharing the concerns and leadings that he gives to individuals. This is often done in meeting for worship; Pierre Lacout, a Swiss Quaker, describes a \"silence which is active\" causing the Inner Light to \"glow\", in his book \"God is silence\". In a Friends meeting it is usually called \"ministry\" when a person shares aloud what the Inner Light is saying to him or her. The term \"inward light\" was first used by early Friends to refer to Christ's light shining on them; the term \"inner light\" has also been used to since twentieth century to describe this Quaker doctrine. Rufus Jones, in 1904, wrote that: \"The Inner Light is the doctrine that there is something Divine, 'Something of God' in the human soul\". Jones argued that his interpretation of the Quaker doctrine of the inner light was something shared by George Fox and other early Quakers, but some Quaker theologians and historians, most notably Lewis Benson reject this viewpoint.\n\nRelated terms for Inner Light include \"Light of God\", \"Light of Christ\", \"Christ within\", \"That of God\", \"Spirit of God within us\", and \"Light within\". These are often used interchangeably by modern and arguably early Friends. Some people also identify it with the expression \"that of God in everyone\", which was first used by one of the co-founders of the Society of Friends, George Fox.\n\nThe related term \"Inward light\" appears in older Quaker writings, but is not used as often now. Originally, Inward Light was used much more often than \"Inner Light\". This term evokes an image of people being illuminated by the light of God or Christ, rather than having a light of their own inside them. Although the terms are now often used interchangeably, according to Quaker historian Pink Dandelion, not until incorrectly Rufus Jones used the terms interchangeably were the terms thought of as equivalents.\n\nThe Quaker belief that the Inward Light shines on each person is based in part on a passage from the New Testament, namely , which says, \"That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" Early Friends took this verse as one of their mottos and often referred to themselves as \"Children of the Light\". Moreover, Friends emphasize the part of the verse that indicates that the Light \"is extended to all people everywhere\", even \"people who have never heard of Christianity in a meaningful way or at all can share in the Light, if they sincerely respond to God's grace. \"For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or excuse them on the day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus\" (Romans 2:14–16).\"\n\nThe principal founder of what became the Religious Society of Friends, George Fox, claimed that he had a direct experience of God. Having explored various sects and listened to an assortment of preachers, he finally concluded that none of them were adequate to be his ultimate guide. At that point he reported hearing a voice that told him, \"There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition.\" He felt that God wanted him to teach others that they need not depend on human teachers or guides either, because each one of them could experience God directly and hear his voice within. He wrote in his journal, \"I was glad that I was commanded to turn people to that \"inward light\", spirit, and grace, by which all might know their salvation, and their way to God; even that divine Spirit which would lead them into all Truth, and which I infallibly knew would never deceive any.\" Fox taught: that Christ, the Light, had come to teach his people himself; that \"people had no need of any teacher but the Light that was in all men and women\" (the anointing they had received); if people would be silent, waiting on God, the Light would teach them how to conduct their lives, teach them about Christ, show them the condition of their hearts; they loving the Light, it would rid them of the \"cause of sin\"; and soon after, Christ would return in his glory to establish his Kingdom in their hearts. Fox called the Light destroying sin within as the Cross of Christ, the Power of God.\n\nRegarding this, Fox wrote, \"Now ye that know the power of God and are come to it—which is the Cross of Christ, that crucifies you to the state that Adam and Eve were in the fall, and so to the world—by this power of God ye come to see the state they were in before they fell, which power of God is the Cross, in which stands the everlasting glory; which brings up into the righteousness, holiness and image of God, and crucifies to the unrighteousness, unholiness and image of Satan.\" The Cross is no \"dead fact stranded on the shore of the oblivious years\", but is to be a living experience deep in the heart of the believer, and changing his whole life. \"You that know the power and feel the power, you feel the Cross of Christ, you feel the Gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.\" All real experience of the Cross must lead, he thought, to the same way of life that brought the Master there—to the way of humility and non-resistance, of overcoming evil by the sole force of love and goodness. To Fox it seemed that a high profession of Christianity often went with a way of life in flagrant opposition to this. He writes to the persecutors: \"Your fruits have manifested that you are not of this (wisdom from above); and so out of the power of God which is the Cross of Christ; for you are found in the world, out of the power of God, out of the Cross of Christ, persecuting.\"\n\nLater, Robert Barclay, an apologist for the Society of Friends, wrote: \"This most certain doctrine being then received, that there is an evangelical and saving \"Light\" and grace in all, the universality of the love and mercy of God towards mankind, both in the death of his beloved Son the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the manifestation of the \"Light\" in the heart, is established and confirmed, against all the objections of such as deny it.\"\n\nMany Friends consider this divine guidance (or \"promptings\" or \"leadings of the Spirit\") distinct both from impulses originating within oneself and from generally agreed-on moral guidelines. In fact, as Marianne McMullen pointed out, a person can be prompted to say something in meeting that is contrary to what he or she thinks. In other words, Friends do not usually consider the Inner Light the conscience or moral sensibility but something higher and deeper that informs and sometimes corrects these aspects of human nature.\n\nHistorically, Friends have been suspicious of formal creeds or religious philosophy that is not grounded in one's own experience. Instead one must be guided by the Inward Teacher, the Inner Light. This is not, however, a release for Friends to decide and do whatever they want; it is incumbent upon Friends to consider the wisdom of other Friends, as one must listen for the Inner Light of others as well as their own. Friends have various established procedures for collectively discerning and following the Spirit while making decisions.\n\nFriends procedure is to collect together their best advice in a book of \"Faith and Practice\", which is revised gradually over time. Many or most books of Faith and Practice contain the following, which was originally attached to a list of \"Advices\" published in 1656, and illustrates Friends' emphasis on the Inner Light:\n\nFriends are not in complete agreement on the importance of the Inner Light in relation to the Bible. Most Friends, especially in the past, have looked to the Bible as a source of wisdom and guidance. Many, if not most of them, have considered the Bible a book inspired by God. Early Quakers, like George Fox and Robert Barclay, as well as most modern Quakers (including the Conservative Friends, Evangelical Friends, Gurneyite Friends and Holiness Friends) believed that promptings which were truly from the Holy Spirit would not contradict the Bible. They did, furthermore, believe that to correctly understand the Bible, one needed the Inner Light to clarify it and guide one in applying its teachings to current situations. In the United States, in the nineteenth century, some Friends concluded that others of their faith, especially those of the Liberal Friends tradition, were using the concept of the Inner Light to justify unbiblical views. These Friends held that the Bible was more authoritative than the Inner Light and should be used to test personal leadings. Friends remain formally, but usually respectfully, divided on the matter.\n\n"}

The cemetery started to function in 1832 by Mr. Joseph Curiel and his wife, Debora Levy Maduro, who had bought a plot of land near the city to bury their daughter, Hana. In the cemetery beautiful tombs and mausoleums can be found, in an impressive amount for the size and wealth of the city, which have remained as reminders of a time when Jews flourished in the city, thanks to the rise of trade with the Netherlands Antilles. The cemetery is located in the Pantano Abajo area, between Roosevelt Avenue and Zamora street. The cemetery is also the grave of the Venezuelan poet of Sephardic Jewish origin Elias David Curiel.\n\nThe cemetery was restored in the 1970s, thanks to the support of the Israelite Association of Venezuela and the national government. Since 2005 Santa Ana de Coro has been on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to heavy rains affecting all historic constructions in the city. An agreement was signed in 2009 between the Caracas Center for Sephardic Studies, representing the IAV, and Constructora Sambil, which is a construction company owned by Salomon Cohen of famous Jewish family, to rebuild the cemetery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16853", "title": "Kitáb-i-Aqdas", "text": "Kitáb-i-Aqdas\n\nThe Kitáb-i-Aqdas or Aqdas is the central book of the Bahá'í Faith written by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the religion, in 1873. The work was written in Arabic under the Arabic title ( / \"al-Kitāb al-ʾaqdās\"), but it is commonly referred to by its Persian title, \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" ( / \"Ketâb Âqdas\"), which was given to the work by Bahá'u'lláh himself. It is sometimes also referred to as \"the Most Holy Book\", \"the Book of Laws\" or the Book of Aqdas. The word Aqdas has a significance in many languages as the superlative form of a word with its primary letters Q-D-Š.\n\nBahá'u'lláh had manuscript copies sent to Bahá'ís in Iran some years after the revelation of the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" in 1873, and in 1890–91 (1308 AH, 47 BE) he arranged for the publication of the original Arabic text of the book in Bombay, India.\n\nThe \"Aqdas\" is referred to as \"the Mother-Book\" of the Bahá'í teachings, and the \"Charter of the future world civilization\". It is not, however, only a 'book of laws': much of the content deals with other matters, notably ethical exhortations and addresses to various individuals, groups, and places. The \"Aqdas\" also discusses the establishment of Bahá'í administrative institutions, Bahá'í religious practices, mysticism, laws of personal status, criminal law, spiritual and ethical exhortations, social principles, miscellaneous laws and abrogations, and prophecies.\n\nBahá'u'lláh stated that the observance of the laws that he prescribed should be subject to \"tact and wisdom\", and that they do not cause \"disturbance and dissension.\" Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to Middle Eastern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide. Shoghi Effendi also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society. He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í lives the laws could not be practiced. Furthermore, some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice. Baha'is believe the Aqdas supersedes and succeeds previous revelations such as the Quran and the Bible.\n\nThe text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas consists of several hundred verses, which have been grouped in 189 numbered paragraphs in the English translation most of which are just a few sentences. The style combines elements of both poetry (\"shi'r\") and rhymed prose (\"saj\") and the text contains instances of literary devices like alliteration, assonance, repetition, onomatopoeia, juxtaposition and antithesis, metaphors, alternation of person and personification.\n\nRules and principles are interspersed and guide interpretation, and authority and limits for authorized interpretation are also specified. It defines a Bahá'í Administration as part of the Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh, and also speaks to the individual reader, as there are no clergy in the religion to rely on for guidance. The text also moves between statements said to be plain and statements suggesting the key to understanding the book is to look at the text for clues to itself. Some statements reflect on the teachings in the religion on various themes and underscore a relationship of the Aqdas as a 'motherhood' in relation to all the other scriptural works and they to it. It also relates to scriptures of other religions by abrogation, explanation, affirmation or reformation — an example of progressive revelation as a principle of the religion. While it is the core text on laws of the religion, it is not the exclusive source of laws in the religion, nor of Bahá'u'lláh's own writings, and complementarily the reader is told explicitly to not view the text as a \"mere code of laws\".\n\nThe Kitáb-i-Aqdas was completed by Bahá'u'lláh in 1873. It was published in the Arabic for circulation among Bahá'ís speaking the language circa 1890. A Russian translation was undertaken by Alexander Tumansky in 1899 and was his most important contribution to Bahá'í studies. Around 1900 an informal English translation was made by Bahá'í Anton Haddad, which circulated among the early American Bahá'í community in a typewritten form. In 1961, an English scholar of Arabic, Dr. Earl E. Elder, and William McElwee Miller, who (according to Laurence Elwell-Sutton) is an openly hostile Christian minister, published an English translation, \"Al-Kitab Al-Aqdas\", through the Royal Asiatic Society, however its translation of the notes section was problematic and overall lacked \"poetic sensibility, and skill in Arabic translation\". Indeed, Miller only ever used it to further his polemical agenda. In 1973 a \"Synopsis and Codification\" of the book was published in English by the Universal House of Justice, with 21 passages of the Aqdas that had already been translated into English by Shoghi Effendi with additional terse lists of laws and ordinances contained in the book outside of any contextual prose. Finally, in 1992, a full and authorized Bahá'í translation in English was published. This version is used as the basis of translation into many other languages highlighting the practice of an indirect translation and how the purpose of the translation affects the act of translation. The Bahá'í Library Online provides a side-by-side comparison of the authorized translation with earlier translations of Anton Haddad and Earl Elder.\n\nThe \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" is supplemented by the \n\nThe book was divided into six main themes in the \"Synopsis and Codification\" by Shoghi Effendi:\n\nFurther, the laws were divided into four categories:\n\nScholarly review finds the Aqdas has themes of laws of worship, societal relations and administrative organization, or governance, of the religion. Through the authority vested in 'Abdu'l-Bahá in the Aqdas there is an expanse of internationalism related to the law in works like \"The Secret of Divine Civilization\" and through his extended authority to Shoghi Effendi works like his \"World Order of Bahá'u'lláh\" further elaborates on the internationalism theme. This stands in some distinction from other scriptures by not using triumphal tones as the voice of God is given to be viewed but rather one of progressive development, social context, and outright delay in application until another day. Indeed, it insists that divine law is applicable only in situations with requisite conditions, where it is likely to have certain social effects. The goal of application of the law and its methods are not to cause disturbance and dissension and requires an appreciation for context and intention. Additionally one is to eschew emphasis in the development of textualist and intentionalist arguments about the law though some of this is visible in scholarship on the Aqdas. Such methods of application of law in a religious context are, in the opinion of Roshan Danish, common in Islam and Judaism.\n\nThe Aqdas is understood by Bahá'ís to be a factor in the process of ongoing developments in world order. This can be seen comparing the Bahá'í approach to history and the future to that of the theory of The Clash of Civilizations on the one hand and the development of a posthegemony system on the other (compared with work of Robert Cox, for example, in \"Approaches to World Order\", (Robert Cox & Timonthy Sinclair eds, Cambridge University Press, 1996).)\n\nCertain possible sources of law are specifically abrogated: laws of the Bábí religion, notably in the \"Persian Bayán\", oral traditions (linked with pilgrim notes, and natural law, (that is to say God's sovereign will through revelation is the independent authority.) Divine revelation's law-making is both unconditioned in terms of the divine right to choose, and conditioned in the sense of the progress of history from one revelation to the next.\n\nBaha'u'llah's statements about marriage in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" are brief. Marriage is highly recommended but is stated to not be obligatory. Bahá'u'lláh states that the maximum number of wives is two, but also states that having only one wife would add more tranquility to both partners. These statements were later interpreted by 'Abdu'l-Bahá that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy.\n\nThat Bahá'u'lláh had three wives, while his religion teaches monogamy, which has been the subject of criticism. The writing of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and Bahá'í teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Bahá'u'lláh's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Bahá'ís away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice.\n\nThe institutional status of the authority of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and a House of Justice are specifically delineated. On the basis of the authority granted 'Abdu'l-Bahá he extended forms of the authority vested in him to the Guardianship, whose sole member was Shoghi Effendi, and the Universal, or International, House of Justice through his Will and Testament. This was confirmed and amplified in other texts, notably the Kitáb-i-'Ahd. The Universal House of Justice is specifically empowered to write and rescind any laws it is felt necessary aside from those of the text of scripture and actual application of the laws of the Aqdas among Bahá'ís are dependent on the choice of the Universal House of Justice.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the last Dreamer of the Pomo people and a basket making prodigy.\n\nGreg Sarris published a biography of Mabel, called \"Weaving the Dream\" (University of California Press, 1997), which follows Mabel’s way of storytelling – a meandering one which describes her work as a dreamer, doctor, and basket weaver.\n\nMabel McKay was born on 12 January 1907 in Nice in Lake County, California. Her father was Yanta Boone (Potter Valley Pomo) and her mother was Daisy Hansen (Lolsel Cache Creek Pomo). Raised by her maternal grandmother, Sarah Taylor, Mabel was described as an unusually quiet little girl. She was considered a sickly child whom talked in her sleep and often woke screaming from dreams. Sarah, her grandmother, remembers hearing Mabel mumble in her sleep. Sarah knew what was happening to Mabel, she understood that she was Dreaming. As she grew older, Mabel would sometimes sleep for days and Sarah Taylor would have a hard time waking her up. Spirit would talk to Mabel in her dreams telling her necessary steps to take in order to fulfill her role as a doctor. Like a shaman, Mabel was a medium between the spiritual and the real world.\n\nMabel was taught by Spirit in her Dreaming to be a doctor and a basket weaver. Spirit taught Mabel how to suck sickness from the ill with her mouth and spit it out into her baskets. Spirit taught Mabel certain songs to put sicknesses to sleep, songs which Mabel would not remember after singing them. Mabel had to work with an interpreter who thoroughly understood her language and could translate to the people what she was saying in her songs.\n\nDuring her Dreaming she was told that her baskets would come from Spirit that she would be famous for them, and people would offer a lot of money for them. Spirit directed her on each basket she wove. Mabel used prayer as a way of communicating to Spirit, and in return Spirit showed Mabel what to make for each person. Each of her baskets had a purpose. Each had a rule. Many people could not understand her process but Mabel was successful in explaining that her baskets are living, not just pretty things to look at.\n\nMabel was a well-respected scholar. She spoke at universities and served as a cultural consultant for anthropologists. She spoke at the New School in New York with Essie Parrish on March 14, 1972. As a weaver her skill and attention to detail brought worldwide recognition to her basketry. Her baskets are shown in many museum collections in the U.S. and abroad. Weaving for Mabel was a spiritual path, not a craft. She was never 'taught' to weave a basket. Instead she was strictly instructed by Spirit as a Dreamer.\n\nMabel not only healed people but brought a whole community together. Through her dreaming and the resurgence of old traditions Mabel encouraged people living in the present to appreciate their culture, to embrace it and to celebrate their heritage. Dreamers renew a tribe’s history and culture, and Mabel was the last of the dreamers to pass on that legacy of Pomo Indian customs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "129211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129211", "title": "Mal Evans", "text": "Mal Evans\n\nMalcolm Frederick \"Mal\" Evans (27 May 1935 – 5 January 1976) was the roadie, the assistant, and a friend of the Beatles.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Evans was employed as a telephone engineer, and also worked part-time as a bouncer at the Cavern Club. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, later hired Evans as the group's assistant roadie, in tandem with Neil Aspinall. Peter Brown (one of Epstein's staff) later wrote that Evans was \"a kindly, but menacing-looking young man\". Evans contributed to recordings, and appeared in some of the films the group made. After The Beatles stopped touring in 1966, Evans carried on assisting them until their break-up in 1970. From 1969, Evans also found work as a record producer (most notably with Badfinger's top 10 hit \"No Matter What\").\n\nEvans was killed by police on 5 January 1976, at his home in Los Angeles. Officers were called when his girlfriend phoned the police and told them that Evans was confused and had a gun. The police mistook the air rifle Evans was holding for a rifle and shot him dead.\n\nDetails of Evans' early life are unknown, apart from his birth date. No book has been written about him, although he wrote his memoirs, \"Living The Beatles' Legend\", from which extracts were released on 20 March 2005. What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a funfair in New Brighton opposite Liverpool on the Wirral. Their first child, Gary, was born in the same year. The Beatles were the resident group at Liverpool's Cavern Club when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, Mossley Hill and working as a telephone engineer for the Post Office. He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was Elvis Presley.\n\nHe first befriended George Harrison, who put forward Evans' name to the Cavern Club's manager, Ray McFall, when he needed a doorman. The 27-year-old Evans was accepted, even though he wore thick-framed glasses, but mainly because of his burly 6 ft 6in frame (1.97 m), which was an asset when holding back unruly fans at the Cavern's door. He was later nicknamed the \"Gentle Giant\" and \"Big Mal\". In 1962, Evans wrote that it was \"a wonderful year\", as he had Lily (his wife), his son Gary, a house, a car, and he was working at the Cavern Club, which he wrote into a 1963 Post Office Engineering Union diary, which also had information concerning Ohm's law and Post Office pay rates.\n\nOn 11 August 1963, Evans began working for the Beatles in the combined role of roadie/bodyguard. Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and to set up and test the equipment. Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead. This was in winter, so the group had to lie one on top of the other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try to stay warm in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a \"Beatle sandwich\". \nEvans had many other duties: as well as acting as a bodyguard, he was sent to buy anything they needed, such as suits, boots, meals, or drinks. If Lennon said \"Socks, Mal\", Evans would have to rush to a local store and buy pairs of cotton socks for him. In 1967, Evans wrote in his diaries that he \"bought Ringo [Starr] some undies for his visit to the doctor\". Although Beatles' memorabilia are in continuous demand, a full set of autographs by all four could be forgeries: Evans and Aspinall used to sign many of them when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were too busy.\n\nThe Beatles started their first European tour in January 1964, and Evans was allowed to take his wife and son with him, but was involved in a \"big punch-up\" with photographers in Paris while protecting them.\nEpstein's associate, Alistair Taylor, once asked him why he was driving an Austin Princess limousine, rather than a Daimler, a Bentley, or a Rolls-Royce. Evans explained that The Beatles were forced to choose an Austin, because they had tested every car to see how wide the doors would open as they (literally) had to \"dive into the car\" to escape their fans.\n\nThe Beatles were introduced to cannabis by Bob Dylan in New York City in 1964. McCartney remembered asking Evans \"again and again\" to write down his newly found cannabis-influenced thoughts about life by repeating \"Get [write] it down, Mal, get it down!\" Evans was as affected by the drug as everybody else, so took a very long time to find a pencil and a piece of paper. The next morning Evans gave the sheet of paper to McCartney, which read that McCartney had dictated: \"There are seven levels!\" (of life, as he later explained). The Beatles attended \"The Night of 100 Stars\" at the London Palladium on 23 July 1964, and during the show Evans constantly supplied them with whisky and Coca-Cola, which he delivered to them balanced on a wooden oar he had found backstage.\n\nThe Beatles were always assisted by Evans on their American tours, and when they played two shows at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1965 Epstein arranged for them all to have a four-day rest in a luxurious horseshoe-shaped house on stilts in Benedict Canyon off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. They spent their time there smoking cannabis joints. Evans and Lennon swam in the large outdoor swimming pool with cigarettes in their mouths, to see who could keep them alight the longest. After recording sessions in London, Lennon, Harrison, and Starr would be chauffeured back to their houses in the \"stockbroker belt\" of southern England, but Evans, Aspinall, and McCartney would drive to a late-night club to eat steak, chips, and mushy peas. The Bag O'Nails nightclub was one of their favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. In his memoirs Evans wrote: 19 January and 20: \"Ended up smashed in Bag O'Nails with Paul [McCartney] and Neil [Aspinall]. Quite a number of people attached themselves, oh that it would happen to me... freak out time baby for Mal.\"\n\nIn July 1966, The Beatles toured the Philippines, and unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos. After the supposed snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to Manila airport on their own. At the airport, road manager Evans was beaten and kicked, and the group members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. Once the group boarded the plane, Tony Barrow and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, \"Tell Lil I love her,\" thinking he was about to be jailed or killed. Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the group had earned while they were there before being allowed on the plane.\n\nThe Beatles' last concert was at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans continued to work for them in the studio, and to run errands. After recording \"Revolver\" in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.\n\nThey spent their final night in Nairobi at a YMCA, before they returned to London. The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words to see if they could come up with something new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters \"S\" and \"P\" stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, which led to the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" name. They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966. Before the cover of \"Sgt. Pepper\" could be completed by Peter Blake, Evans and Aspinall were sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover.\nIn the spring of 1967—after the album was completed—Evans flew with McCartney to Los Angeles to see McCartney's then-girlfriend, Jane Asher, who was acting there with the Old Vic theatre company. The three of them went on a trip to the Rockies, returning to LA in Frank Sinatra's jet. Evans: \"We left Denver in Frank Sinatra's Lear Jet, which he very kindly loaned us. A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery and, to our delight, a well-stocked bar.\" When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from the Mamas & the Papas. Brian Wilson was also there, as he was working on the Beach Boys' \"Smile\" album. Evans wrote about singing \"On Top of Old Smokey\" with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: \"Brian [Wilson] then put a damper on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session.\"\n\nThe Beatles and Evans flew to Greece in late 1967, with encouragement from Greek-born \"Magic Alex\", the director of Apple Electronics, to buy an island or a group of islands. The general idea was that The Beatles would live on the islands in their own separate homes, but would be connected to each other by tunnels leading to a central dome. Evans and his family were included in the plan, but it was abandoned as being unworkable after McCartney refused to participate. As McCartney had no housekeeper in 1967, Evans moved in with him at 7 Cavendish Avenue, St John's Wood, which is near Abbey Road Studios. It was at Cavendish Avenue that McCartney bought his first Old English Sheepdog, Martha, although Evans often complained about the dog fouling the beds. Evans later bought a house in Sunbury-on-Thames, which was situated between McCartney's, Lennon's, Harrison's and Starr's houses.\n\nWhile working on the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film, Evans wrote about his work duties: \"I would get requests from the four of them to do six different things at one time, and it was always a case of relying on instinct and experience in awarding priorities. They used to be right sods for the first few days, until they realised that everything was going to go smoothly and they could get into the routine of recording. ... Then I would find time between numerous cups of tea and salad sandwiches and baked beans on toast to listen to the recording in the control room.\"\n\nAfter the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney to shoot \"The Fool on the Hill\" promotional film, although McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying \"You know who I am\", but he and Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they \"didn't look the part\", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: \"We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [McCartney] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when the manager of the club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like we were going to get thrown in jail. It was ironical, sitting in a club with a millionaire, unable to pay the bill.\"\n\nThe Beatles flew to India in February 1968, to visit the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India a few days earlier to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his inoculation shots were causing him pain. Evans: \"When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him [Starr], to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'.\" Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: \"The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me \"No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country\", I cooled it.\" Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: \"It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly,\" and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.\n\nWhen Apple was formed in 1968, Evans was promoted from road manager to personal assistant, although his weekly £38 salary remained the same.\nAfter Mal and Peter Asher (A&R head of Apple Records) saw the rock band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal constantly suggested that the Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: \"January 13, 1969: Paul [McCartney] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [Evans was made MD of Apple, but very briefly] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt like one of the family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?\" Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: \"April 24: \"Had to tell George [Harrison]—'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [his wife] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is.\"\n\nEvans was the only member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45 am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the register office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30 am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.\n\nEvans enjoyed an executive position at Apple until 1969, when Allen Klein was hired as a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were \"living like kings; like fucking emperors\". Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained. On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voorman, Alan White and Eric Clapton to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, for the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert. He later wrote: \"I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three years and I was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed. This was on top of it being video-taped by Dan Richter.\"\n\nEvans contributed to many recordings, including singing in the chorus of \"Yellow Submarine\". He played single organ notes on \"You Won't See Me\", and harmonica on \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\". McCartney explained that he showed Evans where the notes were on the organ, and then nodded his head when he wanted Evans to play, and shook it when he wanted him to stop.\n\nOn \"A Day in the Life\", Evans controlled an alarm clock; counting the measures in the original 24-bar pause, and was one of the five piano players simultaneously hitting the last chord of the song. He played tambourine on \"Dear Prudence\", and trumpet on \"Helter Skelter\", where he played a double solo with Lennon, even though neither was proficient on the instrument. Evans contributed background vocals, and stirred a bucket of gravel (as part of the rhythm), on \"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\". He also contributed to the \"White Album\" out-take, \"What's the New Mary Jane\", and hit an anvil on \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\", because Starr could not lift the hammer high enough to get the right sound and keep in time with the song.\n\nAccording to Evans' diaries, he helped to compose songs for the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album. He wrote, on 27 January 1967: \"Sgt Pepper. Started writing song with Paul [McCartney] upstairs in his room, he on piano\" and \"Did a lot more of \"where the rain comes in\" [a lyric from \"Fixing a Hole\"]. Hope people like it. Started Sergeant Pepper\". On 1 February: \"Sergeant Pepper sounds good. Paul tells me that I will get royalties on the song—great news, now perhaps a new home.\" On 2 February: \"Recording voices on Captain Pepper. All six of us doing the chorus in the middle, worked until about midnight.\"\n\nKeith Badman—author of \"The Beatles off the Record\"—referred to a tape recording of Evans speaking shortly before his death, on which Evans reiterated some of the statements made in the diary. According to Badman, Evans was asked at the time if it would be a problem that he was not credited as a writer, because the Lennon–McCartney writing name was \"a really hot item\". For reasons unclear, Evans did not receive any royalties and stayed at his £38-a-week pay (£ in modern currency).\n\nEvans appeared in four (out of five) Beatles' films. During the filming of the Beatles' first feature film, \"A Hard Day's Night\", Evans appeared in a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In \"Help!\", Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and on a beach in the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which they were told to paint the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.\n\nIn the \"Let It Be\" film, Evans can be seen playing the anvil during early versions of \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\", and can be seen talking to police officers on the Savile Row rooftop when they came to stop the performance. Before the concert, Evans placed a camera and a microphone in a corner of Apple's reception area, so that when the police came in to complain about the noise—which was expected—they could be filmed and recorded. The Beatles were often filmed by Evans during his time with them (without sound), and a collection of his own film recordings was later released on DVD.\n\nIn 1968, Evans had seen the group Badfinger (then known as The Iveys) play live, and suggested that they be signed to Apple. Evans then produced several of their songs in 1969 and 1970, the most notable of which was \"No Matter What\", which charted on Billboard's Top 10 in December 1970. Evans also discovered the group Splinter and brought them to the Apple label, although they would subsequently move to George Harrison's Dark Horse Records. Evans' other production credits include Jackie Lomax' 1969 single \"New Day\" (on Apple) and some of the tracks on Keith Moon's only solo album \"Two Sides of the Moon\" (1975).\n\nEvans separated from his wife in 1973 and moved to Los Angeles where Lennon had moved to live with May Pang after his own separation from Yoko Ono. Evans is credited on Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" and the \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" album as providing \"tea and sympathy\". Evans cowrote \"You and Me (Babe)\" with Harrison. The track appeared on Starr's 1973 solo album \"Ringo\". He also cowrote the Splinter song \"Lonely Man\", the musical centrepiece of \"Little Malcolm\", an Apple feature film produced by Harrison. A rare interview appearance by Evans was included in the 1975 ABC television special \"\".\n\nEvans was asked to produce the group Natural Gas, and was working on a book of memoirs called \"Living The Beatles' Legend\" which he was due to deliver to his publishers, Grosset & Dunlap, on 12 January 1976. Evans was depressed about the separation from his wife (who had asked for a divorce before Christmas) even though he was then living with his new girlfriend, Fran Hughes, in a rented motel apartment at 8122 West 4th Street in Los Angeles.\n\nOn 5 January 1976, Evans was so despondent that Hughes phoned Evans' cowriter for his biography, John Hoernie, and asked him to visit them. Hoernie saw Evans \"really doped-up and groggy\" but Evans told Hoernie to make sure he finished \"Living The Beatles' Legend\". Hoernie helped Evans up to an upstairs bedroom, but during an incoherent conversation, Evans picked up an air rifle. Hoernie struggled with Evans, but Evans, being much stronger, held onto the weapon.\n\nHughes then phoned the police and told them that Evans was confused, had a rifle, and was on valium. Four policemen arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Higbie, went up to the bedroom. They later reported that as soon as Evans saw the three policemen he pointed a rifle at them. The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the rifle (which they did not know at the time was an air rifle) but Evans constantly refused. The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him. Evans had previously been awarded the badge of \"Honorary Sheriff of Los Angeles County\", but in the \"Los Angeles Times\", he was referred to as a \"jobless former road manager for the Beatles\".\n\nEvans was cremated on 7 January 1976, in Los Angeles. None of the former Beatles attended his funeral, but Harry Nilsson and other friends did. George Harrison arranged for Evans' family to receive £5,000, as Evans had not maintained his life insurance premiums, and was not entitled to a pension. \nWhen Evans' ashes were sent by post back to England, they were misplaced and lost in the postal system but were eventually returned to his family. Upon learning of the lost remains, John Lennon reportedly joked by saying, \"They should look in the dead letter file.\"\n\nIn 1986, a trunk containing Evans' diaries and other effects was found in the basement of a New York publisher, and then sent to his family in London. In 1992, Lennon's original pages of lyrics to \"A Day in the Life\" were sold by the Evans estate for £56,600 at Sotheby's in London.\nIn 2010, a double-sided sheet of paper containing the hand-written lyrics and notes to \"A Day in the Life\" were sold at auction at Sotheby's in New York to an anonymous American buyer for $1.2m (£810,000). Other lyrics collected by Evans have been subject to legal action over the years: In 1996, McCartney went to the High Court in England and prevented the sale of the original lyrics to \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" that Evans' ex-wife had tried to sell, by claiming that the lyrics were collected by Evans as a part of his duties, and therefore belonged to The Beatles, collectively. A 2004 report of the discovery of a further collection of Evans's Beatles' memorabilia proved to be false.\n\nA notebook in which McCartney wrote the lyrics for \"Hey Jude\" was sold in 1998, for £111,500. The notebook also contains lyrics for \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"All You Need Is Love\". It also contained lyrics, notes, drawings and poems by Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr, as well as by Evans.\n\nA one-man play about Evans was performed at the Cavern Club in 2012.\n\n\n"}

Heng Shan in Shanxi Province is sometimes known as the Northern Heng Shan, and the one in Hunan Province as Southern Heng Shan. Both mountains have the same pronunciation in Chinese, and the Southern Heng Shan is also one of the Five Sacred Mountains.\n\nLike the other mountains in China with strong Taoist presence, Heng Shan has been considered a sacred mountain since the Zhou Dynasty. Due to its northerly location, often under control of non-Chinese nations, the mountain has a weaker history of pilgrimage than its four fellows. Indeed, to this day it is the least-visited and least-developed of the five, also the smallest in area. Because of this, Hengshan is not nearly as religiously important in China as the other Taoist mountains. But as a further consequence, it is also less commercialized -- there are no hotels on the mountain, for instance. The main peak is a lovely hike of around three hours round trip from the parking lot (a few miles up the mountain from where you buy the ticket), with the summit covered in fragrant lilac blossoms in June, and temples set into the cliffs. The slopes are largely covered with hemlocks, pines, elm, fir, poplar, and hawthorn, in the barer areas.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, a temple called the Shrine of the Northern Peak (Beiyue Miao), dedicated to the mountain god was built on Hengshan's slopes. While periodically destroyed and rebuilt, this temple has an uninterrupted history from Han times to the present day. During times of occupation by non-Han Chinese people, worship to Hengshan was done at the Beiyue Temple in Quyang.\n\nAnother temple of the area is the famous Hanging Temple, built more than 1,500 years ago into a cliff near the Mount.\n\n"}

According to Ringo Ringvee, \"religion has never played an important role on the political or ideological battlefield\" and that the \"tendencies that prevailed in the late 1930s for closer relations between the state and Lutheran church were ended with the Soviet occupation in 1940\". He further states that \"the chain of religious traditions was broken in most families\" under the Soviet policy of state atheism. Before the Second World War, Estonia was approximately 80% Protestant; overwhelmingly Lutheran.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2011 census, Eastern Orthodoxy overtook Lutheranism to become the largest Christian denomination in the country due to increasing unaffiliation and very small conversions among Estonians and more migration from Russian neighbors. Lutheranism still remains the most popular religious group among ethnic Estonians (11% of them are Lutherans while also 2% of them are Orthodox), while Eastern Orthodoxy is practised mainly by the mostly non-indigenous immigrant Slavic minorities (~45% of them are Orthodox). According to the University of Tartu, irreligious Estonians are not necessarily atheists; instead, the years 2010s have witnessed a growth of Neopagan, Buddhist and Hindu beliefs among those who declare themselves to be \"not religious\".\n\nIn the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights brought Christianity to Estonia as part of the Livonian Crusade and during the Protestant Reformation, the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church became the established church. Before the Second World War, Estonia was approximately 80% Protestant; overwhelmingly Lutheran, with individuals adhering to Calvinism, as well as other Protestant branches. Robert T. Francoeur and Raymond J. Noonan write that \"In 1925, the church was separated from the state, but religious instruction remained in the schools and clergymen were trained at the Faculty of Theology at Tartu University. With the Soviet occupation and the implementation of anti-Christian legislation, the church lost over two thirds of its clergy. Work with children, youth, publishing, and so on, was banned, church property was nationalized, and the Faculty of Theology was closed.\" Aldis Purs, a professor of history at the University of Toronto writes that in Estonia, as well as Latvia, some evangelical Christian clergy attempted to resist the Soviet policy of state atheism by engaging in anti-regime activities such as Bible smuggling. The text titled \"World and Its Peoples: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland\", published by the Marshall Cavendish, states that in addition to the Soviet antireligious campaign in Estonia, which mandated the confiscation of church property and deportation of theologians to Siberia, many \"churches were destroyed in the German occupation of Estonia, from 1941 through 1944, and in World War II (1939-1945)\". After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this antireligious legislation was annulled.\n\nLess than a third of the population define themselves as believers; of those most are Eastern Orthodox, predominantly, but not exclusively, among the Slavic minorities, or Lutheran. There are also a number of smaller Muslim, Protestant, Jewish, and Buddhist groups. The organisation Maavalla Koda unites adherents of animist traditional religions (Estonian Neopaganism). The Russian Rodnover organisation \"Vene Rahvausu Kogudus Eestis\" is registered in Tartu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jordanian Christians in a country of almost 10 million are thought to number 250,000-400,000 excluding tens of thousands Syrian and Iraqi Christians in the country. A 2015 study estimates some 6,500 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.\n\nThere are around 20,000 to 32,000 Druze living mostly in the north of Jordan, while there are fewer than 800 Jordanian Bahá'ís mainly living in Addassia village near the Jordan Valley.\n\nThere are no legal restrictions on Jews, but in 2006 there were reported to be no Jewish citizens.

{"id": "42199619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42199619", "title": "Schools of Islamic theology", "text": "Schools of Islamic theology\n\nSchools of Islamic theology are various Islamic schools and branches in different schools of thought regarding aqidah (creed). According to Muhammad Abu Zahra, Qadariyah, Jahmis, Murji'ah, Muʿtazila, Batiniyya, Ash'ari, Maturidi, Athari are the ancient schools of aqidah.\n\nThe main split between Sunni and Shia Islam was initially more political than theological, but over time theological differences have developed. Still, differences in aqidah occur as divisions orthogonal to the main divisions in Islam along political or fiqh lines, such that a Muʿtazili might, for example, belong to Ja'fari, Zaidi or even Hanafi school of jurisprudence.\n\n\"Aqidah\" is an Islamic term meaning \"creed\" or \"belief\". Any religious belief system, or creed, can be considered an example of \"aqidah\". However this term has taken a significant technical usage in Muslim history and theology, denoting those matters over which Muslims hold conviction. The term is usually translated as \"theology\". Such traditions are divisions orthogonal to sectarian divisions of Islam, and a Mu'tazili may for example, belong to Jafari, Zaidi or even Hanafi school of jurisprudence.\nOne of the earliest systematic theological school to develop, in the mid 8th-century, was Mu'tazila. It emphasized reason and rational thought, positing that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry and that the Qur'an, albeit the word of God, was created rather than uncreated, which would develop into one of the most contentious questions in Islamic theology.\n\nIn the 10th century, the Ash'ari school developed as a response to Mu'tazila, leading to the latter's decline. Ash'ari still taught the use of reason in understanding the Qur'an, but denied the possibility to deduce moral truths by reasoning. This was opposed by the school of Maturidi, which taught that certain moral truths may be found by the use of reason without the aid of revelation.\n\nAnother point of contention was the relative position of \"iman\" (\"faith\") vs. \"taqwa\" (\"piety\"). Such schools of theology are summarized under \"Ilm al-Kalam\", or \"science of discourse\", as opposed to mystical schools who deny that any theological truth may be discovered by means of discourse or reason.\n\nSunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam and are known as \"Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā‘h\" or simply as \"Ahl as-Sunnah\". The word \"Sunni\" comes from the word \"sunnah\", which means the teachings and actions or examples of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Therefore, the term \"Sunni\" refers to those who follow or maintain the \"sunnah\" of the prophet Muhammad.\n\nThe Sunnis believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor to lead the Muslim \"ummah\" (community) before his death, and after an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent companions gathered and elected Abu Bakr Siddique, Muhammad's close friend and a father-in-law, as the first \"caliph\" of Islam. Sunni Muslims regard the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, `Umar ibn al-Khattāb, Uthman Ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abu Talib) as \"al-Khulafā’ur-Rāshidūn\" or \"The Rightly Guided Caliphs.\" After the Rashidun, the position turned into a hereditary right and the caliph's role was limited to being a political symbol of Muslim strength and unity. \n\nAtharism (; \"textualism\") is a movement of Islamic scholars who reject rationalistic Islamic theology (kalam) in favor of strict textualism in interpreting the Quran. The name is derived from the Arabic word , literally meaning \"remnant\" and also referring to a \"narrative\". Their disciples are called the \"Athariyya\", or Atharis. \n\nFor followers of the Athari movement, the \"clear\" meaning of the Qur'an, and especially the prophetic traditions, has sole authority in matters of belief, and to engage in rational disputation (kalam), even if one arrives at the truth, is absolutely forbidden. Atharis engage in an amodal reading of the Qur'an, as opposed to one engaged in \"Ta'wil\" (metaphorical interpretation). They do not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, and believe that the \"real\" meaning should be consigned to God alone (\"tafwid\"). In essence, the meaning has been accepted without asking \"how\" or \"Bi-la kaifa\".\n\nOn the other hand, the famous Hanbali scholar Ibn al-Jawzi states, in \"Kitab Akhbar as-Sifat,\" that Ahmad ibn Hanbal would have been opposed to anthropomorphic intrepretations of Qur'anic texts such as those of al-Qadi Abu Ya'la, Ibn Hamid and Ibn az-Zaghuni. Based on Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi's criticism of \"Athari-Hanbalis,\" Muhammad Abu Zahra, a Professor of Islamic law at Cairo University deduced that \"Salafi aqidah\" is located somewhere between ta'tili and anthropopathy \"(Absolute Ẓāhirīsm in understanding the tashbih in Qur'an)\" in Islam. \"Absolute Ẓāhirīsm\" and total rejection of \"ta'wil\" are amongst the fundamental characteristics of this \"new\" Islamic school of theology.\n\n\"Anthropomorphic Karram’iyyah\" was founded by Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Karrām Ibn Karram considered that God was a substance and that He had a body (\"jism\") finite in certain directions when He comes into contact with the Throne.\n\nʿIlm al-Kalām (, literally \"science of discourse\"), usually foreshortened to kalam and sometimes called \"Islamic scholastic theology\", is an rational undertaking born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islamic faith against doubters and detractors. 'Ilm al-Kalam incorporates Aristotelian reasoning and logic into Islamic theology. A scholar of kalam is referred to as a \"mutakallim\" (plural \"mutakallimūn\") as distinguished from philosophers, jurists, and scientists. There are many possible interpretations as to why this discipline was originally called \"kalam\"; one is that the widest controversy in this discipline has been about whether the Word of God, as revealed in the Qur'an, can be considered part of God's essence and therefore not created, or whether it was made into words in the normal sense of speech, and is therefore created.\n\nThe Mu'tazila were challenged by Abu al-Hasan Al-Ash'ari, who famously defected from the Mu'tazila and formed the rival Ash'ari school of theology. The Ash'ari school took the opposite position of the Mu'tazila and insisted that truth cannot be known through reason alone. The Ash'ari school further claimed that truth can only be known through revelation. The Ash'ari claim that without revelation, the unaided human mind would not be able to know if something is good or evil. \n\nToday, the Ash'ari school is considered one of the Orthodox schools of theology. The Ash'ari school is the basis of the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence, which has supplied it with most of its most famous disciples. The most famous of these are Abul-Hassan Al-Bahili, Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, al-Juwayni, Al-Razi and Al-Ghazali. Thus Al-Ash`ari’s school became, together with the Maturidi, the main schools reflecting the beliefs of the Sunnah.\n\nJahmis were the followers of the Islamic theologian Jahm bin Safwan who associate himself with Al-Harith ibn Surayj. He was an exponent of extreme determinism according to which a man acts only metaphorically in the same way in which the sun acts or does something when it sets. This is the position adopted by the Ash'ari school, which holds that God's omnipotence is absolute and perfect over all creation.\n\nThe Maturidi school was founded by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi, and is the most popular theological school amongst Muslims, especially in the areas formerly controlled by the Ottomans and the Mughals. Today, the Maturidi school is the position favored by the ahl al-ra'y (people of reason), which includes the Hanafi and Maliki schools of fiqh who make up the majority of Muslims.\n\nThe Maturidi school takes the middle position between the Ash'ari and Mu'tazili schools on the questions of knowing truth and free will. The Maturidis say that the unaided human mind is able to find out that some of the more major sins such as alcohol or murder are evil without the help of revelation, but still maintain that revelation is the ultimate source of knowledge. Additionally, the Maturidi believe that God created and can control all of His creation, but that he allows humans to make individual decisions and choices for themselves.\n\nMurji'ah () is an early Islamic school whose followers are known in English as \"Murjites\" or \"Murji'ites\" (). The Murji'ah emerged as a theological school in response to the Kharijites on the early question about the relationship between sin and apostasy \"(rida).\" The Murji'ah believed that sin did not affect a person's beliefs (\"iman\") but rather their piety (\"taqwa\"). Therefore, they advocated the idea of \"delayed judgement,\" (\"irjaa)\". The Murji'ah maintain that anyone who proclaims the bare minimum of faith must be considered a Muslim, and sin alone cannot cause someone to become a disbeliever \"(kafir).\" The Murjite opinion would eventually dominate that of the Kharijites and become the mainstream opinion in Sunni Islam. The later schools of Sunni theology adopted their stance while form more developed theological schools and concepts.\n\nQadariyyah is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted human beings are ontologically free and have a perfect free will, whose exercise justifies divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world. Their doctrines were adopted by the Mu'tazilis and rejected by the Ash'aris. The tension between free will and God's omnipotence was later reconciled by the Maturidi school of theology, which asserted that God grants human beings their agency, but can remove or otherwise alter it at any time. \n\nThe first group to pursue this undertaking were the Mu'tazila, who asserted that all truth could be known through reason alone. Mu'tazili theology originated in the 8th century in Basra when Wasil Ibn 'Ata' stormed out of a lesson of Hasan al-Basri following a theological dispute. \n\nThe Mu'tazila asserted that everything in revelation could be found through rational means alone. The Mu'tazila were heavily influenced by the Greek philosophy they encountered and began to adopt the ideas of Plotinus, whose Neoplatonic theology caused an enormous backlash against them. The political backlash the Mu'tazila faced, as well as the challenged brought forth by new schools of theology caused this group to atrophy and decline into irrelevancy. They are no longer considered an Orthodox school of theology by Sunni Muslims. \n\nBâh’ Sham’iyyah was a school of Mu'tazili thought, rivaling the school of Qadi Abd al-Jabbar, based primarily on the earlier teaching of Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i, the son of Abu 'Ali Muhammad al-Jubba'i.\n\nThe groups that were seceded from Ali's army in the end of the Arbitration Incident constituted the branch of \"Muhakkima\" (). They mainly divided into two major sects called as Kharijites and Ibadis.\n\nThe Kharijites considered the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar to be rightly guided but believed that Uthman ibn Affan had deviated from the path of justice and truth in the last days of his caliphate, and hence was liable to be killed or displaced. They also believed that Ali ibn Abi Talib committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with Muʿāwiyah. In the Battle of Siffin, Ali acceded to Muawiyah's suggestion to stop the fighting and resort to negotiation. A large portion of Ali's troops (who later became the first Kharijites) refused to concede to that agreement, and they considered that Ali had breached a Qur'anic verse which states that \"The decision is only for Allah\" (Qur'an 6:57), which the Kharijites interpreted to mean that the outcome of a conflict can only be decided in battle (by God) and not in negotiations (by human beings).\n\nThe Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators (Abu Musa al-Ashʿari and Amr Ibn Al-As), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators (Ali and Muʿāwiyah) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of Ali and Muʿāwiyah) as Kuffār (disbelievers), having breached the rules of the Qur'an. They believed that all participants in the Battle of Jamal, including Talha, Zubair (both being companions of Muhammad) and Aisha had committed a \"Kabira\" (major sin in Islam).\n\nKharijites reject the doctrine of infallibility for the leader of the Muslim community, in contrast to Shi'a but in agreement with Sunnis. Modern-day Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi wrote an analysis of Kharijite beliefs, marking a number of differences between Kharijism and Sunni Islam. The Kharijites believed that the act of sinning is analogous to Kufr (disbelief) and that every grave sinner was regarded as a Kāfir (disbeliever) unless he repents. With this argument, they denounced all the above-mentioned Ṣaḥābah and even cursed and used abusive language against them. Ordinary Muslims were also declared disbelievers because first, they were not free of sin; secondly they regarded the above-mentioned Ṣaḥābah as believers and considered them as religious leaders, even inferring Islamic jurisprudence from the Hadeeth narrated by them. They also believed that it is not a must for the caliph to be from the Quraysh. Any pious Muslim nominated by other Muslims could be an eligible caliph. Additionally, Kharijites believed that obedience to the caliph is binding as long as he is managing the affairs with justice and consultation, but if he deviates, then it becomes obligatory to confront him, demote him and even kill him.\n\nIbadiyya has some common beliefs overlapping with Ashari, Mu'tazila, Sunni and some Shi'ites.\n\nThe \"Zaidi School of Divinity\" is close to the Mu'tazilite school. There are a few issues between both schools, most notably the Zaydi doctrine of the Imamate, which is rejected by the Mu'tazilites. Amongst the Shi'a, Zaydis are most similar to Sunnis since Zaydism shares similar doctrines and jurisprudential opinions with Sunni scholars.\n\n\"The Bāṭen’iyyah ʿAqīdah,\" was originally introduced by \"Abu’l-Khāttāb Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asadī,\" and later developed by \"Maymūn al-Qaddāh\" and his son \"ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maymūn\" for the esoteric interpretation of the Qur'an. The members of \"Batiniyyah\" may belong to either Ismailis or Twelvers.\nThe \"Ismā'īlī Imāmate\" differ from Twelvers because they had \"living imams or da'is\" for centuries. They followed Isma'il ibn Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful Imam after his father Ja'far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imāmate to his son Muḥammad ibn Ismā'īl al-Maktum as the next imam. \n\nThe followers of \"\"Batiniyyah-Twelver\" madh'hab\" consist of Alevis and Nusayris, who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the Ja'fari jurisprudence. Their combined population is nearly around 1% of World overall Muslim population.\n\nAlevis are sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam, and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many \"Tasawwufī\" characteristics and express belief in the Qur'an and The Twelve Imams, but reject polygamy and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish shamanism. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. Seven to Eleven Million Alevi people including the other denominations of Twelver Shi'ites live in Anatolia.\n\nIn Turkey, Shia Muslim people belong to the Ja'fari jurisprudence Madhhab, which tracks back to the sixth Shia Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq \"(also known as Imam Jafar-i Sadiq),\" are called as the Ja'faris, who belong to Twelver Shia. Although the Alevi Turks are being considered as a part of Twelver Shia Islam, their belief is different from the Ja'fari jurisprudence in conviction.\n\nThe Bektashiyyah is a Shia Sufi order founded in the 13th century by Haji Bektash Veli, a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia at the time of the Mongol invasions (1219–23). This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the \"Çelebi clan,\" who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called \"\"Bel evladları\" (children of the loins),\" and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the \"Babağan,\" those faithful to the path \"\"Yol evladları\" (children of the way),\" who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.\n\nBektashism places much emphasis on the concept of Wahdat-ul-Wujood وحدة الوجود, the \"Unity of Being\" that was formulated by Ibn Arabi. This has often been labeled as pantheism, although it is a concept closer to panentheism. Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of Ali, The Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of Ashurah marking the Battle of Karbala. The old Persian holiday of Nowruz is celebrated by Bektashis as Imam Ali's birthday.\n\nIn keeping with the central belief of \"Wahdat-ul-Wujood\" the Bektashi see reality contained in Haqq-Muhammad-Ali, a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of trinity. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (\"muhabbet\") and yearly confession of sins to a \"baba\" (\"magfirat-i zunub\" مغفرة الذنوب). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and mystical interpretation and understanding of the Qur'an and the prophetic practice (Sunnah). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Jelalludin Rumi who are close in spirit to them.\n\nThe Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide — called a \"baba\" in Bektashi parlance — as well as the doctrine of \"the four gates that must be traversed\": the \"Sharia\" \"(religious law),\" \"Tariqah\" \"(the spiritual path),\" \"Haqiqah\" \"(truth),\" and \"Marifa\" \"(true knowledge).\"\n\nBektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (\"Zāher\" ظاهر) and an inner (\"bāṭen\" باطن). They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in Ismailism and Batiniyya.\n\nBektashism is also initiatic and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the Reality. First level members are called \"aşıks\" عاشق. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called \"nasip\") one becomes a \"mühip\" محب. After some time as a \"mühip\", one can take further vows and become a \"dervish\". The next level above dervish is that of \"baba\". The \"baba\" (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a \"tekke\" and qualified to give spiritual guidance (\"irshad\" إرشاد). Above the \"baba\" is the rank of \"halife-baba\" (or \"dede\", grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the \"dedebaba\" (great-grandfather). The \"dedebaba\" was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the \"dedebaba\" was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacıbektaş \"(Solucakarahüyük)\".\nTwelvers believe in twelve Imams. The twelfth Imam is believed to be in occultation, and will appear again just before the \"Qiyamah\" (Islamic view of the Last Judgment). The Shia \"hadiths\" include the sayings of the Imams. Many Muslims criticise the Shia for certain beliefs and practices, including practices such as the Mourning of Muharram (\"Mätam\"). They are the largest Shia school of thought (93%), predominant in Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain and have a significant population in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan Kuwait and the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The Twelver Shia are followers of \"either the Jaf'ari or Batiniyyah madh'habs\".\n\nFollowers of \"the Jaf'ari madh'hab\" are divided into the following sub-divisions, all of them are the followers of \"the Theology of Twelvers:\"\n\nThe Usuli form the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a Marja-i Taqlid on the subject of taqlid and fiqh. They are concentrated in <nowiki>Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon</nowiki>.\n\nAkhbari, similar to Usulis, however reject ijtihad in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain.\nShaykhism is an Islamic religious movement founded by Shaykh Ahmad in the early 19th century Qajar dynasty, Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the Bábí and Bahá'í religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.\n\nAlawites are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their madhhab is established by Ibn Nusayr, and their aqidah is developed by Al-Khaṣībī. They follow \"Cillī\" aqidah of \"Maymūn ibn Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī fiqh\" of the ‘Alawis. One million three hundred and fifty thousand of them lived in Syria and Lebanon in 1970. It is estimated they are 10-12% of the population of Syria of 23 millions in 2013.\n\nAlawites consider themselves to be Muslims, although some Sunnis dispute that they are. Alawite doctrine incorporates Gnostic, neo-Platonic, Islamic, Christian and other elements and has, therefore, been described as syncretistic. Their theology is based on a divine triad, or trinity, which is the core of Alawite belief. The triad comprises three emanations of the one God: the supreme aspect or entity called the \"Essence\" or the \"Meaning\" (both being translations of \"ma'na\"), together with two lesser emanations known as his \"Name\" (\"ism\"), or \"Veil\" (\"hijab\"), and his \"Gate\" (\"bab\"). These emanations have manifested themselves in different human forms over several cycles in history, the last cycle of which was as Ali (the Essence/Meaning), Muhammad (the Name) and Salman the Persian (the Gate). Alawite belief is summarised in the formula: \"I turn to the Gate; I bow before the Name; I adore the Meaning\". The claim that Alawites believe Ali is a deity has been contested by some scholars as a misrepresentation on the basis that Ali is, in fact, considered an \"essence or form\", not a human being, by which believers can \"grasp God\". Alawites also hold that they were originally stars or divine lights that were cast out of heaven through disobedience and must undergo repeated reincarnation (or metempsychosis) before returning to heaven. They can be reincarnated as Christians or others through sin and as animals if they become infidels.\n\nAlawite beliefs have never been confirmed by their modern religious authorities. Alawites tend to conceal their beliefs (\"taqiyya\") due to historical persecution. Some tenets of the faith are secret, known only to a select few; therefore, they have been described as a mystical sect. In addition to Islamic festivals, the Alawites have been reported to celebrate or honor certain Christian festivals such as the birth of Jesus and Palm Sunday. Their most-important feast is Eid al-Ghadeer.\n\nAlawites have always described themselves as being Twelver Shi'ite Muslims and have been recognized as such by the prominent Lebanese Shi'ite cleric Musa al-Sadr. The Sunni Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini issued a \"fatwa\" recognising them as part of the Muslim community in the interest of Arab nationalism. However, Athari Sunni (modern day Salafis) scholars such as Ibn Kathir \"(a disciple of Ibn Taymiyya)\" have categorised Alawites as pagans in their writings.\n\nBarry Rubin has suggested that Syrian leader Hafiz al-Assad and his son and successor Bashar al-Assad pressed their fellow Alawites \"to behave like \"regular Muslims,\" shedding (or at least concealing) their distinctive aspects\". During the early 1970s a booklet, \"al-`Alawiyyun Shi'atu Ahl al-Bait\" (\"The Alawites are Followers of the Household of the Prophet\") was published, which was \"signed by numerous 'Alawi' men of religion\", described the doctrines of the Imami Shia as Alawite. Additionally, there has been a recent movement to unite Alawism and the other branches of Twelver Islam through educational exchange programs in Syria and Qom.\n\nSome sources have discussed the \"Sunnification\" of Alawites under the al-Assad regime. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies, writes that Hafiz al-Assad \"tried to turn Alawites into 'good' (read Sunnified) Muslims in exchange for preserving a modicum of secularism and tolerance in society\". On the other hand, Al-Assad \"declared the Alawites to be nothing but Twelver Shiites\". In a paper, \"Islamic Education in Syria\", Landis wrote that \"no mention\" is made in Syrian textbooks (controlled by the Al-Assad regime) of Alawites, Druze, Ismailis or Shia Islam; Islam was presented as a monolithic religion. Ali Sulayman al-Ahmad, chief judge of the Baathist Syrian state, has said: \n\nQizilbash and Bektashi tariqah shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Qizilbash and Bektashi developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, all members of Alevism developed a tradition of opposition \"(ibāḥa)\" to all forms of external religion.\n\nThe doctrine of Qizilbashism is well explained in the following poem written by the Shaykh of Safaviyya tariqah Shāh Ismāʿil Khatai:\n\nThe lines of poetry above may easily be judged as an act of \"Shirk\" \"(polytheism)\" by the Sunni Ulama, but they have a bāṭenī taʾwīl \"(inner explanation)\" in Qizilbashism. \n\nThe belief of Incarnation was first emerged in Sabaʾiyya, and later some personalities like Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, Abu Muslim, Sunpadh, Ishaq al-Turk, Al-Muqanna, Babak Khorramdin, Maziar and Ismail I had become the subject of God incarnates.\n\nThe Ahmadis' beliefs are more aligned with the Sunni tradition, such as The Five Pillars of Islam and The Six articles of Islamic Faith. Likewise, Ahmadis accept the Qur'an as their holy text, face the Kaaba during prayer, accept the authority of Hadiths (reported sayings of and stories about Muhammad) and practice the Sunnah (traditions) of Muhammad.\n\nAhmadi teachings state that the founders of all the major world religions had divine origins. God was working towards the establishment of Islam as the final religion, because it was the most complete and included all the previous teachings of other religion (but they believe that all other religions have gone astray in their present form). The completion and consummation of the development of religion came about with the coming of Muhammad; and that the perfection of the ‘manifestation’ of Muhammad’s prophethood and of the conveyance of his message was destined to occur with the coming of the Mahdi.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community regard Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who claimed to be the promised Messiah (\"Second Coming of Christ\") the Mahdi awaited by the Muslims and a 'subordinate' prophet to Muhammad whose job was to restore the Sharia given to Muhammad by guiding or rallying disenchanted Ummah back to Islam and thwart attacks on Islam by its opponents, as the \"Promised One\" of all religions fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, as well as Zoroastrianism, the Indian religions, Native American traditions and others. Ahmadi Muslims believe that Ahmad was divinely commissioned as a true reflection of Muhammad's prophethood to establish the unity of God and to remind mankind of their duties towards God and God's creation.\n\n\n"}

Shabkar's yogic and poetic skill is considered second only to Milarepa.\n\nShabkar begin his spiritual practice early, completing a one year retreat at the age of 16, later becoming a Gelug monk at 20. Shabkar studied with masters of all major Tibetan Buddhist schools including Gelug and Nyingma, and received Dzogchen teachings from his main root guru Chögyal Ngakgi Wangpo. He spent years in solitary retreats in various caves, woods and mountains of Tibet.\n\nShabkar's works express non-sectarian ideals similar to those of the 19th century Rimé movement, even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rime masters from Kham. Shabkar also held that even non-Buddhist religions are manifestations of the Buddhas: \n\n“\"Thus, one should know all the tenets of the religions of Buddhism and non-Buddhism—for example, other religions, Bönpos, the Chan Buddhists, the Nyingma, the Kagyus, the Sakya, the Geluks, and so forth—to be the emanations of the buddhas and bodhisattvas.\"”\n\nShabkar was a prolific writer, his collecter works running into several volumes. One of his key works is a series of poems on Trekchö and Tögal, \"Khading Shoklap\"—\"Flight of the Garuda\" which has become an important text in the Nyingma Nyingthig tradition. \n\nHe also wrote a spiritual autobiography in mixed prose and verse, which is considered one of the lengthiest and most masterful of the Tibetan namtar literature.\n\nShabkar also wrote works promoting vegetarianism and compassion for animals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11277004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11277004", "title": "Stoic categories", "text": "Stoic categories\n\nThe term Stoic categories refers to Stoic ideas regarding categories of being: the most fundamental classes of being for all things. The Stoics believed there were four categories (substance, quality, disposition, relative disposition) which were the ultimate divisions. Since we do not now possess even a single complete work by Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes or Chrysippus what we do know must be pieced together from a number of sources: doxographies and the works of other philosophers who discuss the Stoics for their own purposes.\n\nThe present information comes from Plotinus and Simplicius, with additional evidence from Plutarch of Chaeronea and Sextus Empiricus. According to both Plotinus and Simplicius there were four Stoic categories, to wit:\n\n\nA simple example of the Stoic categories in use is provided by Jacques Brunschwig:\nI am a certain lump of matter, and thereby a substance, an existent something (and thus far that is all); I am a man, and this individual man that I am, and thereby qualified by a common quality and a peculiar one; I am sitting or standing, disposed in a certain way; I am the father of my children, the fellow citizen of my fellow citizens, disposed in a certain way in relation to something else.\n\nStoicism, like Aristotelianism is derived from Platonic and Socratic traditions. The Stoics held that all being (ὄντα) — though not all things (τινά) — are corporeal. They accepted the distinction between concrete bodies and abstract ones, but rejected Aristotle's teaching that purely incorporeal being exists. Thus, they accepted Anaxagoras' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all accidents. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.\n\nIn addition, the Stoics differed from Aristotle in their sharp distinction between concrete and abstract terms. Technically speaking all four Stoic categories are of concrete bodies. For Aristotle \"white, whiteness, heat\", and \"hot\" were qualities. For the Stoics, however, quality refers to \"white\", but not \"whiteness; hot\", but not \"heat.\" Furthermore, they believed that there are concrete bodies with no corresponding abstraction, something that makes no sense in Aristotelian terms.\n\nIt was apparent that the mere distinction between concrete substance and concrete quality was not a sufficient basis for logic. Socrates in the Hippias Major had pointed out problems in Anaxagoras' approach, explaining all attributes through their presence in a body in the way one body may be contained in another. In that dialog, Hippias tried to explain beauty to Socrates. Socrates finds fault with his explanations, that beauty is a beautiful maiden, that beauty is gold, that beauty is health, wealth and a long life.\n\nAristotle solved the problem in proposing that accidental attributes are non-substantial beings that inhere in substances. He defines this presence saying \"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject.\" (\"The Categories\" 1 24–26)\n\nSuch incorporeal presence caused problems to the Stoics in saying that the οὐσία of a thing is its matter. It is easy to understand the problem. If there is an insubstantial being, \"in Athens\" somehow present in Socrates, causing him to be substantially present in Athens we seem to be faced with an infinite regression, for there would seem to be an insubstantial Socrates in the insubstantial Athens in Socrates, in Athens, etc. Ultimately, who is to say who is the real Socrates and what is the real Athens? Similar arguments can be made of Aristotle's other categories. Was there an insubstantial \"running\" in Archimedes causing him to run naked through the streets of Syracuse, shouting out his immortal \"Eureka\"? Was there an insubstantial fist in Athena causing her to strike Aphrodite as the Iliad recounts?\nOnce Hera spoke, Athena dashed off in pursuit,\ndelighted in her heart. Charging Aphrodite, \nshe struck her in the chest with her powerful fist. \n\nIt was the effort to solve the problems raised by the Platonists and Peripatetics that led the Stoics to develop their categories, \"somehow disposed\" and \"somehow disposed in relation to something.\" The fact that Stoicism, rather than either Platonism or Aristotelianism became the prominent philosophy of the ancient world is due in part to the approach they took to the problem.\n\nAccording to Stephen Menn the first two categories, substance and quality, were recognized by Zeno. The fourth category \"somehow disposed in relation to something\" seems to have been developed by the time of Aristo. The third category, \"somehow disposed\" is first seen in Chrysippus.\n\nThe need for relative terms, seen in the fourth category \"somehow disposed in relation to something\" is more obvious than the need for the third category \"somehow disposed\" and so it seems to have arisen first.\n\nAristotle had used relative terms in a somewhat general way. \"Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be of something else or related to something else, are explained by reference to that other thing.\" (\"The Categories\" 6 37–38) Thus he says that \"knowledge\" and \"the thing known\" are relatives. One can certainly consider knowledge as something properly existing in its subject. Aristotle himself recognized a much different kind of relationship. \"In respect of relation there is no proper change; for, without changing, a thing will be now greater and now less or equal, if that with which it is compared has changed in quantity.\" (\"Metaphysics\" 1088 33–35) In the first case, a relative term can be said to be something \"in\" its subject. In the second case, it can not. Thus, the need for \"somehow disposed in relation to something\" to explain how one thing can be relative to another without the presence of anything corporeal in a subject.\n\nAccording to Stephen Menn, the third category, \"somehow disposed\" probably was recognized first in relation to the virtues. According to Socrates, virtue was a sort of knowledge. The wise man will act virtuously, since he will see it as the right thing to do. But the ignorant man can not avoid vice. The Stoic position held that a sage will possess all the virtues in their fullness. Aristo had argued that there is really only one virtue differentiated as \"somehow disposed in relation to something.\" This seemed to be too much like the Megarian position. Chrysippus thus came to see the virtues as distinct bodies, inseparable from each other \"somehow disposed\" in themselves and not in relation to something. Thus the need for the third category.\n\nPlotinus criticized both Aristotle's Categories and those of the Stoics. His student Porphyry however defended Aristotle's scheme. He justified this by arguing that they be interpreted strictly as expressions, rather than as metaphysical realities. The approach can be justified, at least in part, by Aristotle's own words in \"The Categories.\" Boethius' acceptance of Porphyry's interpretation led to their being accepted by Scholastic philosophy.\n\nThe Stoic scheme did not fare as well. Plotinus wrote...\n\n\"Besides, if they make life and soul no more than this \"pneuma,\"\nwhat is the import of that repeated qualification of theirs \"in a\ncertain state,\" their refuge when they are compelled to recognize some\nacting principle apart from body? If not every pneuma is a soul, but\nthousands of them soulless, and only the pneuma in this \"certain\nstate\" is soul, what follows? Either this \"certain state,\" this\nshaping or configuration of things, is a real being or it is nothing.\n\nIf it is nothing, only the pneuma exists, the \"certain state\"\nbeing no more than a word; this leads imperatively to the assertion\nthat Matter alone exists, Soul and God mere words, the lowest alone\nis.\n\nIf on the contrary this \"configuration\" is really existent-\nsomething distinct from the underlie or Matter, something residing\nin Matter but itself immaterial as not constructed out of Matter, then\nit must be a Reason-Principle, incorporeal, a separate Nature.\n\n\n"}

The city was known in the Hellenistic period as and Latin \"Apollonopolis Magna\", after the chief god Horus, who was identified as Apollo under the interpretatio graeca. It is one of the best preserved shrines in Egypt. The temple was built in the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 237 and 57 BC. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the Hellenistic period in Egypt. In particular, the Temple's inscribed building texts \"provide details [both] of its construction, and also preserve information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation.\" There are also \"important scenes and inscriptions of the Sacred Drama which related the age-old conflict between Horus and Seth.\" They are translated by the German Edfu-Project.\n\nEdfu was one of several temples built during the Ptolemaic Kingdom, including the Dendera Temple complex, Esna, the Temple of Kom Ombo, and Philae. Its size reflects the relative prosperity of the time. The present temple, which was begun \"on 23 August 237 BC, initially consisted of a pillared hall, two transverse halls, and a barque sanctuary surrounded by chapels.\" The building was started during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes and completed in 57 BC under Ptolemy XII Auletes. It was built on the site of an earlier, smaller temple also dedicated to Horus, although the previous structure was oriented east-west rather than north-south as in the present site. A ruined pylon lies just to the east of the current temple; inscriptional evidence has been found indicating a building program under the New Kingdom rulers Ramesses I, Seti I and Ramesses II. \n\nA naos of Nectanebo II, a relic from an earlier building, is preserved in the inner sanctuary, which stands alone while the temple's barque sanctuary is surrounded by nine chapels. \n\nThe temple of Edfu fell into disuse as a religious monument following Theodosius I's persecution of pagans and edict banning non-Christian worship within the Roman Empire in 391. As elsewhere, many of the temple's carved reliefs were razed by followers of the Christian faith which came to dominate Egypt. The blackened ceiling of the hypostyle hall, visible today, is believed to be the result of arson intended to destroy religious imagery that was then considered pagan.\n\nOver the centuries, the temple became buried to a depth of 12 metres (39 ft) beneath drifting desert sand and layers of river silt deposited by the Nile. Local inhabitants built homes directly over the former temple grounds. Only the upper reaches of the temple pylons were visible by 1798, when the temple was identified by a French expedition. In 1860 Auguste Mariette, a French Egyptologist, began the work of freeing Edfu temple from the sands.\n\nThe Temple of Edfu is nearly intact and a very good example of an ancient Egyptian temple. The Temple of Edfu's archaeological significance and high state of preservation has made it a centre for tourism in Egypt and a frequent stop for the many riverboats that cruise the Nile. In 2005, access to the temple was revamped with the addition of a visitor center and paved carpark. A sophisticated lighting system was added in late 2006 to allow night visits.\n\nThe temple of Edfu is the largest temple dedicated to Horus and Hathor of Dendera. It was the center of several festivals sacred to Horus. Each year, \"Hathor travelled south from her temple at Denderah to visit Horus at Edfu, and this event marking their sacred marriage was the occasion of a great festival and pilgrimage.\"\n\nThe Temple of Edfu provides the model for Temple Works in Holbeck, Leeds. The courtyard columns at Edfu are closely copied in the frontage of the Works.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18744139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18744139", "title": "The Jewel of Medina", "text": "The Jewel of Medina\n\nThe Jewel of Medina is a historical novel by Sherry Jones. It was scheduled for publication by Random House in 2008, but subsequently cancelled; it was subsequently announced that it would be published by Beaufort Books in the United States and by Gibson Square in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Eventually it was published in the U.S. by Beaufort Books. The novel tells a fictionalized version of the life of Aisha, one of the wives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the person who reportedly accompanied him as he received most of his revelations. The novel tells Aisha's story from the age of six, when she was betrothed to Muhammad, to his death.\n\nIn 2007, Random House bought the publication rights to \"The Jewel of Medina\" in a $100,000, two-book contract. The novel was scheduled to be published on August 12, 2008. The Book of the Month Club had agreed to feature the novel in its August 2008 issue, and Quality Paperback Book Club was due to follow suit in January 2009. The novel's original marketing blurb read, \"Married at six to the much-older Muhammad, Aisha uses her wits, her courage, and her sword to defend her first-wife status even as Muhammad marries again and again, taking 12 wives and concubines in all.\"\n\nAccording to an opinion article by Asra Nomani in \"The Wall Street Journal\", the original publication plans began to unravel when Random House received an email from University of Texas Professor of history and Middle Eastern Studies Denise Spellberg, which was critical of the book and suggested its publication may inspire violent reactions from some Muslims. Random House's publicity department had sent Spellberg galleys of the novel, hoping for publishable comments from her. Instead, she found the book a \"very ugly, stupid piece of work\", and suggested that it may elicit violence akin to past controversies over \"The Satanic Verses\" and the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Similarly, Jane Garrett, an editor at Random House's Knopf imprint, said in an email that Spellberg had told her by phone that she thought the novel should be withdrawn due to \"a very real possibility of major danger for the building and staff and widespread violence.\" Garrett also claimed Spellberg described the book as \"a declaration of war...explosive stuff...a national security issue.\" Shortly thereafter, Random House cancelled publication.\n\nNomani also wrote that Shahed Amanullah, a guest lecturer in Spellberg's classes and the editor of altmuslim.com, a popular Muslim Web site, sent emails to a listserv of Middle East and Islamic studies graduate students about the book. Amanullah later stated he had received a \"frantic call\" from Spellberg who \"was upset\", telling him that the novel \"made fun of Muslims and their history,\" and asked him to \"warn Muslims\" about the book since \"she found it incredibly offensive\".\n\nIn the wake of Nomani's article, \"The Washington Post\" published an editorial criticizing Random House's decision to \"dump\" the book \"[w]ithout waiting for an actual uproar in the Muslim world\"; the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" and the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" were also critical of Random House's decision to cancel the book's publication. Irshad Manji wrote in \"The Globe and Mail\" that pre-emptive censorship was offensive to Muslims, while poet and literary critic Adam Kirsch criticized Spellberg and Random House for depriving the Muslim reading public of the freedom to reimagine their religious tradition through the eyes of a novelist. University of Pennsylvania adjunct lecturer Carlin Romano, writing in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", criticized Spellberg for her \"aggressive act\" in working to cancel publication, for effectually advocating censorship, and what she claimed were Spellberg's \"disingenuous\" attempts to deny that she had played an instrumental role in the Random House decision.\n\nSpellberg subsequently wrote a letter to the \"Wall Street Journal\" contesting Nomani's characterization of her as the \"instigator\" of the book's cancellation. Spellberg stated that \"I felt it was my professional responsibility to counter this novel's fallacious representation of a very real woman's life.\" However, she insisted that \"I do not espouse censorship of any kind, but I do value my right to critique those who abuse the past without regard for its richness or resonance in the present.\" She also stated that \"The author and the press brought me into a process, and I used my scholarly expertise to assess the novel. It was in that same professional capacity that I felt it my duty to warn the press of the novel's potential to provoke anger among some Muslims.\" Regarding her \"frantic\" phone call to Shahed Amanullah, Spellberg said she had only intended to call the book to his attention, and that he had apparently misunderstood her intentions. Spellberg also stated that since the story broke she has received hate mail and been roundly pilloried online, stating that \"they are calling me an opponent of free speech, saying I am a supporter of Muslim extremists\".\n\nRandom House released a public statement about the decision not to publish the book:\n\nJones told Reuters: \"I have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about Islam and Mohammed… I envisioned that my book would be a bridge-builder.\" She wrote in a blog for \"The Washington Post\" that she was \"chagrined to realize the far-reaching ramifications of this historic decision to quash a work of art before it could even reach the public eye.\"\n\nSalman Rushdie, author of \"The Satanic Verses\", criticized Random House for the decision, saying, \"This is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed.\" Andrew Franklin, who worked for Penguin Books when they published \"The Satanic Verses\" and is now the publisher of Profile Books, described the decision as \"absolutely shocking\" and called the Random House editors \"such cowards\". Geoffrey Robertson, who received terrorist threats for representing Rushdie, said that Random House should pay Jones \"substantial compensation\" and recommended that the book be placed on a website \"so everyone can read it\".\n\nWriting in his blog for \"The New York Times\", Stanley Fish disagreed with the characterization of the controversy as \"censorship\", arguing that \"Random House is free to publish or decline to publish whatever it likes, and its decision to do either has nothing whatsoever to do with the Western tradition of free speech or any other high-sounding abstraction. …[The cancellation] doesn't rise to the level of constitutional or philosophical concern. And it is certainly not an episode in some 'showdown between Islam and the Western tradition of free speech.' Formulations like that at once inflate a minor business decision and trivialize something too important and complex to be reduced to a high-school civics lesson about the glories of the First Amendment.\" Fish argued that the term \"censorship\" should be restricted to cases in which a governmental body interferes with the expression of ideas. However, linguist Bill Poser, writing on the Language Log blog, disagreed with Fish's interpretation, arguing that \"[t]he Enlightenment value of freedom of expression does not lead only to restrictions on the powers of government: it requires that all of us tolerate expression that we may find offensive. A free society cannot permit anyone, government, corporation, church, or individual, to decide what may and what may not be published. That a publisher should cancel publication of a novel out of fear of violence by religious fanatics has everything to do with the Western tradition of free speech. It is a disturbing reminder that this tradition is not universal and that it is at present subject to very real threats.\"\n\nOn September 4, 2008, it was announced that British publisher Gibson Square would publish \"The Jewel of Medina\" in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Gibson Square publisher Martin Rynja called for \"open access to literary works, regardless of fear\" and said, \"If a novel of quality and skill that casts light on a beautiful subject we know too little of in the West, but have a genuine interest in, cannot be published here, it would truly mean that the clock has been turned back to the dark ages.\" In a press release, Rynja added, \"I was bowled over by the novel and the moving love story and interesting but unknown history it portrays. I was struck by the research of Sherry Jones, who is a journalist with almost 30 years of experience, her literary imagination and passion for the novel's characters.\" Commenting on the decision by Gibson Square, Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a Latin American author, wrote in a widely published article for \"The New Republic\": \"The book's content — which has been described, promisingly, as being full of sex and violence — is irrelevant to the discussion. It may well be, as one scholar who read it contends, that \"The Jewel of Medina\" is pure trash.\" He closes his essay with: \"I am not interested in the reasons why Gibson Square has decided to publish the book — whether opportunism, greed, love of scandal, a dislike of the prophet, or a belief in the merits of the novel. But the fact that someone, somewhere, is willing to run the risk of not letting the threat of violence inhibit free expression is tremendously comforting.\"\n\nOn September 27, 2008, Martin Rynja's house in London was firebombed, apparently by individuals opposed to the publication. Three men were arrested on suspicion of commissioning, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism; radical Islamic clerics such as Anjem Choudhary warned of further attacks. The three men were caught because officers had been watching them in an intelligence-led surveillance operation; they were later found guilty of conspiracy to recklessly damage property and endanger life.\n\nAfter the arson attempt, the publisher issued a statement saying that Jones had decided to indefinitely postpone publication of the book. Jones denies doing so, and says that the decision was entirely the publisher's.\n\nOn September 5, 2008, it was announced that American publisher Beaufort Books (previously best known as the publishers of \"If I Did It\" by O. J. Simpson) would publish \"The Jewel of Medina\" in America. According to Jones' agent, Natasha Kern, \"about a dozen\" other publishers had expressed interest in the novel, but some had backed off due to \"possible threats\". Kern said that Beaufort was giving Jones a smaller advance than Random House had, but a higher rate of royalties. Beaufort's president, Eric Kampmann, said in a press release, \"We are building a great team to bring \"The Jewel of Medina\" to the audience it deserves to have. Everyone at Beaufort is proud to be associated with this ground breaking novel.\"\n\nThe book was first officially published in Serbia, in August 2008. After strong reactions from the Serbian Muslim community, Serbian publisher \"Beobook\" withdrew it from stores, but after a few weeks, the publisher decided to return it to the stores, because of a large number of pirate copies of the book. In Serbia, the book was the number-one bestseller for at least two months.\n\nAs of December 2008, the book had been published in five countries—the US, Germany, Denmark, Serbia, and Italy—with no repercussions. It will debut in Spain February 4. Plans for publication are underway in other countries, including India, Hungary, Brazil, Russia, Republic of Macedonia, Finland, and Poland; there have also been negotiations with publishers in Sweden and The Netherlands.\n\nJones provided the manuscript of \"The Jewel of Medina\" to Islamic website IslamOnline.net, where the novel was reviewed on August 18, 2008, by writer and poet Marwa Elnaggar. Elnaggar criticizes the book for its inaccurate portrayal of pre-Islamic Arab culture (including non-Arabic customs such as bowing and purdah), and suggests that Jones was influenced by \"the idea of the exotic and mystical Orient.\" Elnaggar describes \"The Jewel of Medina\" as \"an attempt by a Western writer with little knowledge of Arabic, Arabia, Islam, and Muslims using her own Western, 21st century values, ideals and emotions to portray an unrecognizable version of the well-known and well-documented story of `A'ishah.\" However, Elnaggar argues that despite the novel's \"inaccuracies, its faults, and its biases\", its publication should not be stopped. On September 2, 2008, Elnaggar published Jones' response to her review to \"present as many sides of an issue as possible\" and \"for the sake of objectivity\" approached the writer and invited her to an interview where she can express her own point of view and clarify many questions that were raised. Unfortunately, Jones said that her publishers have asked her not to speak before the book is published. Instead, Jones sent Elnaggar a column where she speaks about \"The Jewel of Medina\" and the motives behind writing it. However, Jones has promised Elnaggar an interview after the novel is published. On October 11, 2008, Elnagger wrote \"A Second Look at Jewel of Medina\".\n\nIndian Muslim writer Farzana Versey criticized Jones' prose and perspective, based on the published excerpts: \"It would be unfair to tar the whole book based on the Prologue, but it gives a credible peek into the language and lack of nuance the author employs. ... Apparently, Ms. Jones for all her two years of research has managed a version of chick lit, where Aisha gets in confessional mode and in a Mills and Boon fashion 'leans on her husband', 'falls into his arms', and in a rather treacly account relates that 'the pain of consummation soon melted away. Muhammad was so gentle. I hardly felt the scorpion's sting. To be in his arms, skin to skin, was the bliss I had longed for all my life.' At age nine or eleven, the 'all my life' seems rather a stretch.\" Versey also criticizes Asra Nomani's perspective that fictional accounts can \"humanize\" Islamic history: \"If people do believe in a certain faith, then let them decide on how to define their belief. That too constitutes freedom of speech. Fictional accounts of this nature only serve as trashy one-upmanship. They do not humanize or, alas, even demonize religion.\"\n\nEgyptian writer Ethar El-Katatney reviewed the novel on October 6, 2008, in an article for \"Egypt Today\" entitled \"Flawed Jewel\" and interviewed both Sherry Jones and Denise Spellberg. She critiqued the book and offered both Jones and Spellberg the opportunity to answer her critiques.\". El-Katatney also made a telephone interview with Jones publicly accessible. The transcript of the interview is available online. On October 7, 2008, El-Katatney wrote an op-ed entitled 'The \"Flawed\" Jewel of Medina' to which Jones responded to directly.\n\nOn October 6, 2008, a Muslim organisation run by British Islamist Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri Muhammad wrote an article on the novel, referring to it as a \"blasphemous book\" and to Jones as \"an enemy of Islam and author of this heinous book\" and her \"illicit portrayal of the marriage\" of Muhammad and 'Aisha. The organisation states that \"\"The Jewel of Medina\" is a book that accurately reflects the current temperament of the disbelievers\" and that it \"is yet another chapter in the continuing war against Islam and Muslims that reveals the burning hatred harboured in the hearts of the disbelievers.\" Jones responded to this article directly, stating that, \"I extend the hand of peace with a book that is respectful. Please do not judge my book by the slander being spread about it! I urge you to read \"The Jewel of Medina\" and see for yourselves that I am respectful toward Islam and your Prophet. Just as I have publicly refused to judge all Muslims by the actions of a violent few, I ask you to judge me and my book by the actual contents of \"The Jewel of Medina.\" Already I have been criticized by non-Muslims as \"pandering\" to Muslims with my book because it portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a gentle, compassionate, wise leader and man respectful toward women and his wives. Several reviews have been posted already, including a review in \"Egypt Today\", in which the author, a Muslim, says that I have written very favorably about the Prophet. You may not like my book or agree with it, but it does not insult Islam or Muhammad!\"\n\n\"The New York Times Book Review\" gave the novel a rather scathing review. They lean more towards the novel being historical fiction. Reviewer Lorraine Adams notes that \"an inexperienced, untalented author has naively stepped into an intense and deeply sensitive intellectual argument\" and that \"Jones' prose is lamentable\".\n\nAccording to the author, several sequels to the book are in the works. A German publisher will publish a sequel to the novel entitled \"A'isha: The Legacy of the Prophet\" and Beaufort Books published the U.S. sequel, titled \"The Sword of Medina\" October 15, 2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38851513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38851513", "title": "Xiaodao Lun", "text": "Xiaodao Lun\n\nThe Xiaodao Lun is an anti-Daoist polemic written in 570 for the Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (543–578) by the Buddhist courtier Zhen Luan. After holding several inconclusive debates in the court, Emperor Wu commissioned the \"Xiaodao Lun\" as one of two reports examining the suitability of sponsoring either Buddhism or Daoism as a state religion for the Northern Zhou dynasty, with a view towards unifying China. The \"Xiaodao Lun\" mocked Daoist practices, accused Daoists of plagiarizing Buddhist texts, and portrayed the religion as dangerous to social stability. Its advice was disregarded by the Emperor, who supported the preservation of Daoism, but his dynasty was ultimately short-lived. Zhen Luan's \"Xiaodao Lun\" is preserved in the Chinese Buddhist canon and is consulted for its quotations of Daoist texts that have not been preserved until today.\n\nThe Buddhist \"sangha\" in China held Buddhism to be superior to Daoism, whose canon it regarded as \"heretical\" (\"xié\" ) and \"false sutra\" (\"wěijīng\" ). Daoists, for their part, published the \"Huahujing\" in the 4th century, which argued that Chinese Buddhism was a simplified form of Daoism, developed during the travels of the Daoist philosopher Laozi while he was in India. One organized Daoist-Buddhist debate was organized in 520 by the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535), and a second was organized in 570 by the Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581), prompted by the proposal by the Buddhist Wei Yuansong () to make the Emperor a divine Buddhist ruler and to weaken the Buddhist \"sangha\"'s independence from the state.\n\nThe debate was inconclusive, so the Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (543–578) commissioned comparative reports on the suitability of Buddhism and Daoism as state religions, resulting in the \"Xiaodao Lun\" by official Zhen Luan, and \"Erjiao Lun\" () by Dao An. Submitted in 570 as the \"Xiaodao Lun\", Zhen's report denied that Daoism had any value and ridiculed the religion's exorcisms, talismans, and internal inconsistencies.\n\nThe author of the \"Xiaodao Lun\" was Zhen Luan, an apostate from Daoism who lived during the Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581). Zhen Luan was a scholar-official for Emperor Wu's court who also served as a commandant, mathematician, and astronomer. Zhen trained in a Daoist congregation, but converted to Buddhism out of disgust with Daoist sexual practices. He wrote the \"Xiaodao Lun\" after attending three of the Buddhist-Daoist debates sponsored by Emperor Wu.\n\nThe \"Xiaodan Lun\" is written in 36 sections in an imitation of the Daoist canon, and aimed to show that the mythology, rituals, and practices of Daoism were inconsistent and absurd. Zhen's text criticizes not those scripture which were most important to contemporary Daoist practice, but those which were easiest to ridicule, such as \"The Size of the Sun and the Moon\". In addition, the treatise references Daoist texts from the Lingbao and Tianshi schools of Daoism disproportionately to those from the Shangqing school.\n\nThe polemic accuses Daoists of \"stealing\" (\"qiè\" ) the Buddhist Lotus Sutra for use in Daoist scripture. Zhen further charged the Daoists of not fully understanding the Buddhist texts that they plagiarized. These criticisms prompted some internal Daoist reform, as the Buddhist encyclopedia \"Fayuan Zhulin\" (668) noted the replacement of Buddhist terminology in Daoist texts with more native Chinese terms.\n\nThe \"Xiaodao Lun\" was the most lurid and complete account of Daoist sexual practices that anti-Daoist polemicists used to attack the religion, including group sex and partner swapping. Another argument of the \"Xiaodao Lun\" implicated Daoism in general for various peasant revolts, including the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184–205), whose organizers were associated with secret Daoist societies.\n\nThe Emperor largely disregarded the conclusions of the \"Xiaodao Lun\", positively interpreting Zhen's examples of alleged Daoist plagiarism of Buddhist texts, as increasing Daoism's appeal as a unifying ideology for the Zhou realm. Emperor Wu went on to found the Tongdao Guan () for Daoist research, which would eventually compile the first Daoist encyclopedia, the Wushang Biyao (). However, Emperor Wu would not achieve his goal of Chinese reunification, which was achieved by the Sui Dynasty (581-618), who favored Buddhism over Daoism.\n\nAs an apologetic, the \"Xiaodao Lun\" is included in the Chinese Buddhist canon. Polemical confrontation between Buddhists and Daoists was limited after the Tang Dynasty (618–907), with the last great flareup during the Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368). The Yuan debates of 1255 and 1258 concluded in a government-sponsored book burning of Daoist texts and printing materials in 1281. In modern times, the \"Xiaodao Lun\" is consulted for its quotations of medieval Daoist scriptures that have not survived court censorship.\n"}

{"id": "742791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=742791", "title": "Zhang Daoling", "text": "Zhang Daoling\n\nZhang Ling (; 34–156), courtesy name Fuhan (), was an Eastern Han Dynasty Taoist figure credited with founding the Way of the Celestial Masters sect of Taoism, which is also known as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice.\n\nHe is also known as Zhang Daoling (), Celestial Master Zhang (張天師, \"Zhāng tiānshī\"), Ancestral Celestial Master (祖天師, \"Zǔtiānshī\") or Zhengyi Zhenren (正一真人) to Taoists. Zhang is sometimes pictured riding on a tiger. In some Taoist sects, Zhang, along with Ge Xuan, Xu Xun () and Sa Shoujian (), are called the \"Four Celestial Masters\" (四大天師).\n\nThe details of the life of the historical figure Zhang Ling are obscure; most of the information about him comes from later scripture and hagiography. According to these, Zhang traced his ancestral home to Feng County, Jiangsu, and was said to be a descendant of Zhang Liang. He was born in the tenth year of the \"Jianwu\" era during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han. He started reading the \"Tao Te Ching\" at a young age and studied in the Taixue (Imperial Academy) before. He served as a magistrate in Jiangzhou, Ba Commandery (present-day Chongqing) during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han.\n\nZhang later retired and led a reclusive life at Mount Beimang, where he practiced taoist methods of achieving longevity. When invited to serve as a \"boshi\" (equivalent of a present-day professor) in the Imperial Academy, he claimed that he was ill. Emperor He of Han summoned him thrice to serve as the \"Taifu\" (Imperial Tutor) but he refused again.\n\nAccording to hagiographies compiled in approximately 400 C.E., in 142 C.E. the deity Taishang Laojun (a deified Laozi) revealed to Zhang on Mount Heming the \"Doctrine of the Orthodox One [Resting On] the Authority of the Alliance\" (), and bestowed upon him the title Celestial Master. The deity warned that plagues, beasts, and the demons of the Three Offices and Six Heavens of the underworld were due to be released upon humankind, and that only 240,000 people would be chosen as survivors and \"seed people\" () to populate the new age, the era of Great Peace.\n\nZhang then endeavored to reform supposedly degenerate religious practices. After gathering numerous followers, he started a health cult that advocated certain longevity practices (recorded in books which have been lost) and founded a theocratic state in Sichuan organized into 24 parishes (later 28), which outsiders called the Way of Five Pecks of Rice after a tax of that amount levied on followers. A major change instituted by the new Covenant was the rejection of food and animal sacrifices. Also, the teachings of Laozi as transmitted by Zhang included the first true Taoist religious pantheon as distinguished from the prior ancient religion of China. The \"Xiang'er\", a commentary on the \"Tao Te Ching\" preserved today in a sixth-century manuscript, is traditionally ascribed to Zhang Daoling's authorship and even if not his work may reflect his teachings.\n\nZhang is said to have died on Mount Qingcheng in 156 during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han at the age of 123. However, it is also said that Zhang did not die but learned the arcana of Taoism to ascend in broad daylight (\"Xiandao\"). Instead, his body became like luminous ether, disappearing from eyesight and became an immortal.\n\nHis descendants have held the title of Celestial Masters up to the present day. They also held the title of 正一嗣教眞人.\n\n"}
