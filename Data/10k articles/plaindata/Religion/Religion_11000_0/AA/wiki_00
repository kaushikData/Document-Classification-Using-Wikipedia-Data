Abraham was a Jewish ascetic who flourished at the end of the 18th century. He went to live at Jerusalem in 1785, but afterward traveled through Europe as an agent for the collection of donations for the Polish Jews in the Eretz Yisrael, making Amsterdam his center; he died as Hakam at Safed, during a riot against the Jews, who had protested against excessive taxation. Another version says he was punished by the Turks, in Jerusalem, (see below) and died in Safed, in 1799, there he was buried. He did not have children.\n\nAbraham (brother of Samuel Catz of Lask) was an ascetic of a remarkable type; he fasted six days of the week, from Sabbath night to Sabbath eve, but feasted quite luxuriously on the Sabbath. Often he devoted entire days and nights to the study of the Torah, standing upright during that time. He took his daily ablutions in the river before offering his prayers in the morning, often breaking through the ice in winter for this purpose. Yet in spite of all this austerity he was a man of uncommon vigor.\n\nOnce in the Holy Land, together with a number of Jewish scholars, Abraham was dragged to prison by some Turkish officials, and subjected to the bastinado, for no other reason than that it was the usual method pursued by the Turkish government for extorting money from the Jews. Abraham and another rabbi alone survived. At every stroke received Abraham uttered the rabbinic phrase, גם זו לטובה (\"This, too, is for the best\"). He was held in reverence by the best men of the time as \"the holy man of God.\"\n\nHe published several kabalistic homilies, one under the title of \"Weshab ha-Kohen\" (The Priest Shall Return), Leghorn, 1788; another, \"Wechishab lo ha-Kohen\" (The Priest Shall Reckon), Fürth, 1784; a third, \"Bet Ya'akob\" (Jacob's House), Leghorn, 1792; and a fourth, \"Ayin Panim ba-Torah\" (Seventy Meanings of the Law), Warsaw, 1797. The last work gives seventy reasons for the order of the sections in the Pentateuch, as well as seventy reasons why the Law begins, \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" (Gen. i.1). All are filled with fantastic numerical and alphabetical combinations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3266", "title": "Acephali", "text": "Acephali\n\nIn church history, the term (from Ancient Greek: ἀκέφαλοι \"akephaloi\", \"headless\", singular ἀκέφαλος \"akephalos\" from ἀ- \"a-\", \"without\", and κεφαλή \"kephalé\", \"head\") has been applied to several sects that supposedly had no leader. E. Cobham Brewer wrote, in \"Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\", that acephalites, \"properly means men without a head.\" Jean Cooper wrote, in \"Dictionary of Christianity\", that it characterizes \"various schismatical Christian bodies\". Among them were Nestorians who rejected the Council of Ephesus condemnation of Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople, which deposed Nestorius and declared him a heretic.\n\nThose who refused to acknowledge the authority of the Council of Chalcedon were originally called Haesitantes; the \"\" developed from among them, and, according to Blunt, the earlier name – Haesitantes – seems to have been used for only a short time.\n\nWith the apparent purpose of bringing the Orthodox and heretics into unity, Patriarch Peter III of Alexandria and Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople had elaborated a new creed in which they expressly condemned both Nestorius and Eutyches, a presbyter and archimandrite, but at the same time rejected the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon. This ambiguous formula, though approved by Byzantine Emperor Zeno and imposed in his \"Henoticon\", could only satisfy the indifferent.\n\nThe term applied to a 5th-century faction among the Eutychians, who seceded from Peter, a Monophysite or more accurately a Miaphysite, in 482, after Peter signed the \"Henoticon\" and was recognised by Zeno as the legitimate patriarch of Alexandria by which they were \"deprived of their head\".\n\nThe condemnation of Eutyches irritated the rigid Monophysites; the equivocal attitude taken towards the Council of Chalcedon appeared to them insufficient, and many of them, especially the monks, deserted Peter, preferring to be without a head, rather than remain in communion with him.\nLater, they joined the adherents of the non-Chalcedonian Patriarch Severus of Antioch.\nThey were, according to \"Oxford English Dictionary Online\", a \"group of extreme Monophysites\" and \"were absorbed by the Jacobites\".\n\nLiberatus of Carthage wrote, in ', that those at the Council of Ephesus who followed neither Patriarch Cyril I of Alexandria nor Patriarch John I of Antioch were called '.\n\nEsaianites were one of the sects into which the Alexandrian \"\" separated at the end of the 5th century. They were the followers of Esaias, a deacon of Palestine, who claimed to have been consecrated to the episcopal office by the Bishop Eusebius. His opponents averred that after the bishop's death his hands had been laid upon the head of Esaias by some of his friends.\n\n' were a sect of ' who followed Chalcedonian Patriarch Paul of Alexandria, who was deposed by a synod at Gaza, in 541, for his uncanonical consecration by the Patriarch of Constantinople, and who, after his deposition, sided with the Miaphysites.\n\nBarsanians, later called Semidalites, were a sect of \"\" at the end of the 5th century. They had no succession of priests, and professed to keep up the celebration of a valid Eucharist by placing a few crumbs of some of the bread which had been consecrated by Dioscorus into a vessel of meal, and then using as fully consecrated the bread baked from it.\n\nAccording to Brewer, acephalites were also certain bishops exempt from the jurisdiction and discipline of their patriarch. Cooper explains that they are \"priests rejecting episcopal authority or bishops that of their metropolitans.\" Blunt described \"\" as those clergy who were ordained with a sinecure benefice and who generally obtained their orders by paying for them, that is by simony. The Council of Pavia, in 853, legislated its canons 18 and 23 against them, from which it appears, according to Blunt, that they were mostly chaplains to noblemen, that they produced much scandal in the Church, and that they disseminated many errors.\n\nAccording to Brewer, acephalites were also a sect of Levellers during the reign of Henry I of England who acknowledged no leader. They were, according to \"Oxford English Dictionary Online\", \"a group of free socagers having no feudal superior except the king.\" This usage is now considered obsolete.\n\nFabled human-like creatures in Greek mythology, analogous to Pliny the Elder's ', without heads and with facial features on their torsos, were also called '.\n"}
{"id": "10183469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10183469", "title": "Another Gospel", "text": "Another Gospel\n\nAnother Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement is a non-fiction book discussing new religious movements and the New Age movement, written by Ruth A. Tucker. The book was published in 1989 by Zondervan, a Christian publishing house. Another edition was released by the same publisher in 2004.\n\nRuth A. Tucker is a former professor of missiology with a PhD from Northern Illinois University. Tucker has taught alternative religions at both the graduate and undergraduate level. Her book \"Daughters of the Church\" was published in 1987. In 2000, Tucker was a professor at Calvin Theological Seminary. Tucker authored the book \"Walking Away from Faith\" in 2002.\n\nThe title \"Another Gospel\" is taken from Paul's Epistle to the Galatians in the New Testament verses 1:6-8: \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\"\n\n\"Another Gospel\" discusses a wide range of groups, including Mormonism, Seventh-day Adventism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Science, New Thought and Unity, the Worldwide Church of God, the Way International, the Children of God, the Unification Church, Hare Krishnas, Bahá'ís, and Scientology. Other groups, including Rosicrucianism and Swedenborgianism, are described in appendices. Tucker discusses some of the controversies as related to these groups, while adding that frequently new religions maintain an \"ability to reach out and meet the needs of people who are suffering and dejected.\"\n\nTucker writes about the New Age movement, \"The most popular and widely publicized new religion in recent years has been the New Age movement, a difficult-to-define variety of mystical, spiritualistic, and occultic groups that above all else are not \"new\". From channeling crystals to harmonic convergence, celebrities and ordinary citizens have been captivated by this increasingly popular religious trend.\" Tucker asks: \"Is New Age merely an age-old form of the occult that will taper off in popularity as the fad loses its luster, or is it truly a movement that has only barely begun to make its all-encompassing mark on the world?\" and warns that \"every individual concerned about maintaining traditional Christian values should be apprehensive about the potential negative effect the New Age may have on the coming generations.\"\n\nIn discussion of the Unification Church, Tucker writes that the organization has used controversial recruitment tactics which subsequently resulted in college students dropping out of universities in order to join it. \"The recruitment strategy of the Unification Church was widely criticized for utilizing tactics that sometimes were compared to brainwashing techniques,\" writes Tucker. \"Another Gospel\" describes how Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon stated that he was told by Jesus Christ to complete a task in which Jesus had not succeeded, and carry out the desires of God on the earth.\n\nTucker notes a disparity between approaches to religious movements abroad compared to within a person's own cultural milieu. \"In cross-cultural evangelism overseas, missionaries are admonished not to ridicule other religious beliefs or practices. ... Yet, these 'cross-cultural' courtesies are often blatantly ignored when they pertain to situations within our own culture. We often ridicule or mock the unorthodox religious beliefs of people in our own communities, because \"cultists\" do not deserve respect,\" writes Tucker.\n\n\"Another Gospel\" delves into the difficulty in defining cults. Tucker says that a cult is \"a religious group that has a 'prophet'-founder called of God to give a special message not found in the Bible itself\". She comments on the defining characteristics utilized by sociologists, who \"have tended to define cults more in terms of lifestyle, proselytizing practices, and authoritarian leadership, rather than in terms of belief or by any standard of orthodoxy\". According to Tucker cults often have a \"prophet-founder\" who serves as a \"legalistic, authoritarian leader\". In her given definition of a cult, Tucker writes, \"In deference to this charismatic leader ... the style of leadership is authoritarian and there is frequently an exlusivistic outlook supported by a legalistic lifestyle and persecution mentality. ... It is the attribute of a prophet-founder that very distinctly separates cults from denominations.\"\n\nAccording to the description of the book from the publisher, Tucker \"explains how ... alternative religious movements appear to meet people's needs.\" Tucker concludes that \"the increase in cult membership is a direct result of a failure on the part of the church.\"\n\nCharles H. Lippy, writing in \"Modern American Popular Religion: A Critical Assessment and Annotated Bibliography\", stated that \"Another Gospel\" is written \"from a decidedly conservative Christian perspective\", and although Tucker \"does not ridicule the groups she seeks to expose ... it is clear that [she] does not see the groups she studies as legitimate religious alternatives.\"\n\nRobert M. Bowman, Jr., reviewing \"Another Gospel\" for the \"Christian Research Journal\", commented: \"Although Tucker is at her best in recounting the histories of the religions she surveys, at places she is not critical enough of the historical accounts that have been published by the cults themselves.\" Bowman's review concluded, \"... Ruth Tucker's \"Another Gospel\" is, in several respects, the best general textbook on the cults. It is more up-to-date, more readable, and more respectful of the cults than any other such textbook. But, because it is lacking in biblical critiques of the cults (which is understandable, given the author's areas of expertise), it cannot replace those books which do provide such critiques, however much fresh treatments are needed.\"\n\nA review of the book for the \"Journal of Christian Nursing\", said that the book provides information about \"what people in various cults and religious groups believe\", and called the book \"outstanding\", and recommended it for personal libraries and church libraries. The reviewer commented: \"Although designed as a reference book, it is hard to put down. I started dipping into sections that interested me, then sat down and read the whole book. In the process, I felt as if I'd taken a semester course in alternative religions.\"\n\nAuthor M. James Penton wrote positively of the book, in his book \"Apocalypse Delayed\" published by University of Toronto Press. He wrote that Tucker's chapter on Jehovah's Witnesses \"is far more superior to most older books and articles produced by Catholic and Protestant critics of the Watch Tower movement.\"\n\nIn a discussion of the prevalence of belief in reincarnation among adherents of various belief systems, \"Theology for the Community of God\" author Stanley J. Grenz recommended Tucker's book \"for references to the presence of this doctrine in the New Age movement\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "94155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=94155", "title": "Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology", "text": "Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology\n\nAustralian Aboriginal religion and mythology (also known as Dreamtime or Dreaming stories, songlines, or Aboriginal oral literature) are the stories traditionally performed by Aboriginal peoples within each of the language groups across Australia.\n\nAll such myths variously \"tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local landscape. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to time immemorial\".\n\nDavid Horton's \"Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia\" contains an article on Aboriginal mythology observing:\n\n\"A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Many were shape changing, transformed from or into human beings or natural species, or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories.\"Australian Aboriginal mythologies have been characterized as \"at one and the same time fragments of a catechism, a liturgical manual, a history of civilization, a geography textbook, and to a much smaller extent a manual of cosmography.\"\nAn Australian linguist, R. M. W. Dixon, recording Aboriginal myths in their original languages, encountered coincidences between some of the landscape details being told about within various myths, and scientific discoveries being made about the same landscapes. In the case of the Atherton Tableland, myths tell of the origins of Lake Eacham, Lake Barrine, and Lake Euramo. Geological research dated the formative volcanic explosions described by Aboriginal myth tellers as having occurred more than 10,000 years ago. Pollen fossil sampling from the silt which had settled to the bottom of the craters confirmed the Aboriginal myth-tellers' story. When the craters were formed, eucalyptus forests dominated rather than the current wet tropical rain forests. (See Lake Euramo for an excerpt of the original myth, translated.)\n\nDixon observed from the evidence available that Aboriginal myths regarding the origin of the Crater Lakes might be dated as accurate back to 10,000 years ago. Further investigation of the material by the Australian Heritage Commission led to the Crater Lakes myth being listed nationally on the Register of the National Estate, and included within Australia's World Heritage nomination of the wet tropical forests, as an \"unparalleled human record of events dating back to the Pleistocene era.\"\n\nSince then, Dixon has assembled a number of similar examples of Australian Aboriginal myths that accurately describe landscapes of an ancient past. He particularly noted the numerous myths telling of previous sea levels, including:\n\n\nOther volcanic eruptions in Australia may also be recorded in Aboriginal myths, including Mount Gambier in South Australia, and Kinrara in northern Queensland.\n\nThere are 900 distinct Aboriginal groups across Australia, each distinguished by unique names usually identifying particular languages, dialects, or distinctive speech mannerisms. Each language was used for original myths, from which the distinctive words and names of individual myths derive.\n\nWith so many distinct Aboriginal groups, languages, beliefs and practices, scholars cannot attempt to characterise, under a single heading, the full range and diversity of all myths being variously and continuously told, developed, elaborated, performed, and experienced by group members across the entire continent. (See external link for one indicative spatial map of Australian Aboriginal groups, and see here for an earlier Tindale map of Aboriginal groups.)\n\n\"The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia\" nevertheless observes: \"One intriguing feature [of Aboriginal Australian mythology] is the mixture of diversity and similarity in myths across the entire continent.\"\n\nThe Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's booklet, \"Understanding Country\", formally seeks to introduce non-indigenous Australians to Aboriginal perspectives on the environment. It makes the following generalisation about Aboriginal myths and mythology:\n\n\"...they generally describe the journeys of ancestral beings, often giant animals or people, over what began as a featureless domain. Mountains, rivers, waterholes, animal and plant species, and other natural and cultural resources came into being as a result of events which took place during these Dreamtime journeys. Their existence in present-day landscapes is seen by many indigenous peoples as confirmation of their creation beliefs...\"\n\n\"The routes taken by the Creator Beings in their Dreamtime journeys across land and sea... link many sacred sites together in a web of Dreamtime tracks criss-crossing the country. Dreaming tracks can run for hundreds, even thousands of kilometres, from desert to the coast [and] may be shared by peoples in countries through which the tracks pass...\"\n\nAustralian anthropologists willing to generalise suggest Aboriginal myths still being performed across Australia by Aboriginal peoples serve an important social function amongst their intended audiences: justifying the received ordering of their daily lives; helping shape peoples' ideas; and assisting to influence others' behaviour. In addition, such performance often continuously incorporates and \"mythologises\" historical events in the service of these social purposes in an otherwise rapidly changing modern world. As R.M. W. Dixon writes:\n\n\"It is always integral and common... that the Law (Aboriginal law) is something derived from ancestral peoples or Dreamings and is passed down the generations in a continuous line. While... entitlements of particular human beings may come and go, the underlying relationships between foundational Dreamings and certain landscapes are theoretically eternal ... the entitlements of people to places are usually regarded strongest when those people enjoy a relationship of identity with one or more Dreamings of that place. This is an identity of spirit, a consubstantiality, rather than a matter of mere belief...: the Dreaming pre-exists and persists, while its human incarnations are temporary.\"\n\nAboriginal specialists willing to generalise believe all Aboriginal myths across Australia, in combination, represent a kind of unwritten (oral) library within which Aboriginal peoples learn about the world and perceive a peculiarly Aboriginal 'reality' dictated by concepts and values vastly different from those of western societies:\n\"Aboriginal people learned from their stories that a society must not be human-centred but rather land centred, otherwise they forget their source and purpose ... humans are prone to exploitative behaviour if not constantly reminded they are interconnected with the rest of creation, that they as individuals are only temporal in time, and past and future generations must be included in their perception of their purpose in life.\"\n\n\"People come and go but the Land, and stories about the Land, stay. This is a wisdom that takes lifetimes of listening, observing and experiencing ... There is a deep understanding of human nature and the environment... sites hold 'feelings' which cannot be described in physical terms... subtle feelings that resonate through the bodies of these people... It is only when talking and being with these people that these 'feelings' can truly be appreciated. This is... the intangible reality of these people...\"\n\nIn 1926 a British anthropologist specialising in Australian Aboriginal ethnology and ethnography, Professor Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, noted many Aboriginal groups widely distributed across the Australian continent all appeared to share variations of a single (common) myth telling of an unusually powerful, often creative, often dangerous snake or serpent of sometimes enormous size closely associated with the rainbows, rain, rivers, and deep waterholes.\n\nRadcliffe-Brown coined the term 'Rainbow Serpent' to describe what he identified to be a common, recurring myth. Working in the field in various places on the Australian continent, he noted the key character of this myth (the 'Rainbow Serpent') is variously named:\n\nThis 'Rainbow Serpent' is generally and variously identified by those who tell 'Rainbow Serpent' myths, as a snake of some enormous size often living within the deepest waterholes of many of Australia's waterways; descended from that larger being visible as a dark streak in the Milky Way, it reveals itself to people in this world as a rainbow as it moves through water and rain, shaping landscapes, naming and singing of places, swallowing and sometimes drowning people; strengthening the knowledgeable with rainmaking and healing powers; blighting others with sores, weakness, illness, and death.\n\nEven Australia's 'Bunyip' was identified as a 'Rainbow Serpent' myth of the above kind. The term coined by Radcliffe-Brown is now commonly used and familiar to broader Australian and international audiences, as it is increasingly used by government agencies, museums, art galleries, Aboriginal organisations and the media to refer to the pan-Australian Aboriginal myth specifically, and as a shorthand allusion to Australian Aboriginal mythology generally.\n\nA number of linguists, anthropologists and others have formally documented another common Aboriginal myth occurring across Australia. Predecessors of the myth tellers encounter a mythical, exotic (most often English) character who arrives from the sea, bringing western colonialism, either offering gifts to the performer's predecessors or bringing great harm upon the performer's predecessors.\n\nThis key mythical character is most often named 'Captain Cook', this being a 'mythical' character shared with the broader Australian community, who also attribute James Cook with playing a key role in colonising Australia. The Aboriginal 'Captain Cook' is attributed with bringing British rule to Australia, but his arrival is not celebrated. More often within the Aboriginal telling, he proves to be a villain.\n\nThe many Aboriginal versions of this 'Captain Cook' are rarely oral recollections of encounters with the Lieutenant James Cook who first navigated and mapped Australia's east coast on the HM Bark \"Endeavour\" in 1770. Guugu Yimidhirr predecessors, along the Endeavour River, did encounter James Cook during a 7-week period beached at the site of the present town of Cooktown while the Endeavour was being repaired. From this time the Guugu Yimidhirr did receive present-day names for places occurring in their local landscape; and the Guugu Yimmidhir may recollect this encounter.\n\nThe pan-Australian Captain Cook myth, however, tells of a generic, largely symbolic British character who arrives from across the oceans sometime after the Aboriginal world was formed and the original social order founded. This Captain Cook is a harbinger of dramatic transformations in the social order, bringing change and a different social order, into which present-day audiences have been born. (see above regarding this social function played by Aboriginal myths)\n\nIn 1988 Australian anthropologist Kenneth Maddock assembled several versions of this 'Captain Cook' myth as recorded from a number of Aboriginal groups around Australia. Included in his assemblage are:\n\"set up the people [cattle industry] to go down the countryside and shoot people down, just like animal, they left them lying there for the hawks and crows... So a lot of old people and young people were struck by the head with the end of a gun and left there. They wanted to get the people wiped out because Europeans in Queensland had to run their stock: horses and cattle.\"\n\nDeath in Aboriginal religion in some aspects may seem like it has some Western traditions in regard to having a ceremony and mourning the loss of the person that is deceased. However, that is really the only thing that this religion has in common with Western religion as far as death is concerned. \"For Aboriginal people when a person dies some form of the persons spirit and also their bones go back to the country they were born in\". \"Aborigine people believe that they share their being with their country and all that is within it\". \"So when a person dies their country suffers, trees die and become scarred because it is believed that came into being because of the deceased person\".\n\nWhen an Aborigine person dies the families have death ceremonies called the \"Sorry Business\". \"During this time the entire community and family mourns the loss of the person for days\". \"They are expected to cry together and share grief as a community\". If someone was out of town and arrives after they have had a ceremony for the deceased, the entire community stops what they are doing and goes and tells them and mourns with them. \"The family of the deceased all stay in one room and mourn for their loved one\".\n\n\"Naming a person after they have died is not allowed in the Aborigine religion\". \"To say someone's name after they die would be to disturb their spirit \". Photos of the deceased are not allowed for fear of disturbing the spirit also. Many Aborigine families will not have any photographs of their loved ones after they die. \"A smoking ceremony is also conducted when someone dies\". \"The community uses smoke on the belongings and also the residence of the deceased to help release the spirit\". \"Identifying the cause of death is determined by elders who hold the cultural authority to do so, and the causes in question are usually of a spiritual nature\". \"The ceremonies are likened to an autopsy of Western practice\".\n\nCeremonies and mourning periods last days, weeks and even sometimes months depending upon the social status of the deceased person. It is culturally inappropriate for a non-Aboriginal person to contact and inform the next of kin of a person’s passing. When someone passes away, the family of the deceased move out of their house and another family then moves in. Some families will move to \"sorry camps\" which are usually further away. \nMourning includes the recital of symbolic chants, the singing of songs, dance, body paint, and cuts on the bodies of the mourners. The body is placed on a raised platform for several months, covered in native plants. Sometimes a cave or a tree is used instead. \"When nothing but bones are left, family and friends will scatter them in a variety of ways. They sometimes wrap the bones in a hand-knitted fabric and place them in a cave for eventual disintegration or place them in a naturally hollowed out log\".\n\nThe Aboriginals believe in a place called the \"Land of the Dead\". This place was also commonly known as the \"sky-world\", which is really just the sky. As long as certain rituals were carried out during their life and at the time of their death, the deceased is allowed to enter The Land of the Dead in the \"Sky World\". The spirit of the dead is also a part of different lands and sites and then those areas become sacred sites. This explains why the Aboriginals are very protective of sites they call sacred. The Aboriginals believe that life is a never-ending cycle. You are born, you die, you are born again as an animal, human or other life form .\n\nThe rituals that are performed enable the aborigine to return to the womb of all time which is another word for \"Dream Time\". It allows the spirit to be connected once more to all nature, to all their ancestors, and to their own personal meaning and place within the scheme of things. \"The Dreamtime is a return to the real existence for the aborigine\". \"Life in time is simply a passing phase – a gap in eternity\". It has a beginning and it has an end. \"The experience of Dreamtime, whether through ritual or from dreams, flowed through into the life in time in practical ways\". \"The individual who enters the Dreamtime feels no separation between themselves and their ancestors\". \"The strengths and resources of the timeless enter into what is needed in the life of the present\". \"The future is less uncertain because the individual feels their life as a continuum linking past and future in unbroken connection\". Through Dreamtime the limitations of time and space are overcome. \nFor the Aborigine people dead relatives are very much a part of continuing life. It is believed that in dreams dead relatives communicate their presence.\" At times they may bring healing if the dreamer is in pain\". \"Death is seen as part of a cycle of life in which one emerges from Dreamtime through birth, and eventually returns to the timeless, only to emerge again. It is also a common belief that a person leaves their body during sleep, and temporarily enters the Dreamtime\".\n\nThe Murrinh-Patha people (whose country is the saltwater country immediately inland from the town of Wadeye) describe a Dreamtime in their myths which anthropologists believe is a religious belief equivalent to, though wholly different from, most of the world's other significant religious beliefs.\n\nIn particular, scholars suggest the Murrinh-Patha have a oneness of thought, belief, and expression unequalled within Christianity, as they see all aspects of their lives, thoughts and culture as under the continuing influence of their Dreaming. Within this Aboriginal religion, no distinction is drawn between things spiritual/ideal/mental and things material; nor is any distinction drawn between things sacred and things profane: rather all life is 'sacred', all conduct has 'moral' implication, and all life's meaning arises out of this eternal, everpresent Dreaming.\n\"In fact, the isomorphic fit between the natural and supernatural means that all nature is coded and charged by the sacred, while the sacred is everywhere within the physical landscape. Myths and mythic tracks cross over.. thousands of miles, and every particular form and feature of the terrain has a well-developed 'story' behind it.\"\n\nAnimating and sustaining this Murrinh-patha mythology is an underlying philosophy of life that has been characterised by Stanner as a belief that life is \"... a joyous thing with maggots at its centre.\". Life is good and benevolent, but throughout life's journey, there are numerous painful sufferings that each individual must come to understand and endure as he grows. This is the underlying message repeatedly being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people motive and meaning in life.\n\nThe following Murrinh-patha myth, for instance, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood. \n\"A woman, \"Mutjinga\" (the 'Old Woman'), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents' absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body.\"\n\nWithin the myth and in its performance, young, unadorned children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being (who transforms into a giant snake), then regurgitated before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and privileges of young adults.\n\nScholars of the Pintupi peoples (from within Australia's Gibson Desert region) believe they have a predominantly 'mythic' form of consciousness, within which events occur and are explained by the preordained social structures and orders told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology, rather than by reference to the possible accumulated political actions, decisions and influences of local individuals (i.e. this understanding effectively 'erases' history). \n\"The Dreaming.. provides a moral authority lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied.\"\n\n\"These human creations are objectified – thrust out – into principles or precedents for the immediate world.. Consequently, current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order.\"\n\nWithin this Pintupi world view, three long geographical tracks of named places dominate, being interrelated strings of significant places named and created by mythic characters on their routes through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of narratives, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as \"Tingarri\". It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country.\n\n\n\n"}

With conversions and pioneers the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1958. From 1959 the Bahá'ís of Tonga and their local institutions were members of a Regional Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific. By 1963 there were five local assemblies. Less than forty years later, in 1996, the Bahá'ís of Tonga established their paramount Bahá'í school in the form of the Ocean of Light International School. Around 2004 there were 29 local spiritual assemblies. The 2015 estimate of the World Religion Database ranked the Bahá'ís at 3.5% of the national population, though as recently as 2006 the Tonga Broadcasting Commission maintained a policy that does not allow discussions by members of the Bahá'í Faith of its founder, Bahá'u'lláh on its radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1953 the twelve existing Bahá'í National Spiritual Assemblies were asked by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, to help spread the religion. The community of the United States was to attempt to bring the religion to Tonga. In Tonga, the Bahá'í community grew much like it did in other Pacific communities — first the community emerged through the acts of both pioneers and converts and then grew by spreading through family and tribal groups or clan-structures.\n\nAustralian Stanley P. Bolton was the first Bahá'í to arrive in Tonga — he arrived on 25 January 1954. American Dudley M. Blakely, nephew of Lua Getsinger, and wife Elsa also pioneered to Tonga on 12 July 1954. Each earned the title Knights of Bahá'u'lláh for their service to the religion. Blakely was a designer and worked as an adviser to the Tongan government contributing to a number of buildings and furnishings as well as stamps and coins for the government. In 1961 he had designed a five-stamp special issue set commemorating mail deliveries to the islands changing from the era of the fishing boat to airmail. In 1962 he designed a set of the first gold coins in Polynesia. He designed Tonga's first decimal coin set in 1965.\n\nBy 1956 there were indigenous Bahá'í converts on the islands; three individuals who converted to the religion were prominent in Tongan society: Mosese Hokafonu, Lisiata Mak, and Suliana Halaholo. Mosese Hokafonu, who lived on the island of Tongatapu, converted to the Bahá'í Faith in the early 1950s. For many years Hokafonu served on the Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Nuku'alofa and donated a significant portion of the land for the site of the national Bahá'í Center. Hokafonu joined Gina and Russell Garcia on board their boat \"the Dawnbreaker\" for an extensive trip which took them through the islands of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. Hokafonu was the first Pacific Islander to undertake missionary trips of long duration — including Kiribati and Tuvalu; Niue; the Solomon Islands; New Guinea; the Marshall, Mariana and Caroline Islands; Nauru; Australia and New Zealand (especially among the Māori), Hawaii, Alaska and the continental United States. Baron Vaea, a Tongan noble and former Prime Minister, a relative of Hokafonu, conducted the funeral service which was attended by many hundreds of people.\n\nLisiata Maka, a legal adviser in Tonga's lower and supreme courts, became a Bahá'í in 1957 and was elected to the Regional National Assembly, and was later appointed to the Continental Board of Counsellors. Suliana Halaholo was born in Tonga in 1950 and began attending a Bahá'í school's children's classes at the age of eight. Soon she was teaching classes and began being involved in administrative activities while she was still a youth. She was secretary of the youth committee of Tonga, and later of Fiji, and thanks to her academic achievements the government of Tonga gave her a scholarship to study dietetics at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji, where she obtained her bachelor's degree. Halalholo devoted two of her vacations from schooling to translating into the Tongan language \"The Seven Valleys\" (one of Bahá'u'lláh's metaphysical works), and later the Tablet Words of Wisdom. Both translations were approved by the National Spiritual Assembly of Tonga.\n\nThe first Local Spiritual Assembly of Tonga was of Nuku'alofa in 1958, and by 1963 there were Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies in Houma, Kolonga, Mu'a, Nuku'alofa, Vaini, and smaller Bahá'í groups in Folaha, Tokomolo, Vaotu'u and isolated Bahá'ís in Felemea and several villages on the island of Haʻapai - Kotu', Lotofoa, Na'ufanga, Nomuka and Ohonua Eua.\n\nTonga developed international administrative relationships in tandem with its internal growth. Mr. Latu Tu 'Akihekolo represented Tongan Bahá'ís to an Bahá'í International Conference in Japan in 1958. Tonga was allocated delegates for the election of the regional Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific from 1959 to 1963. Eventually Tonga and the Cook Islands alone shared a regional National Assembly starting in 1970 and the Cook Islands Bahá'í community formed their own National Assembly in 1985.\n\nBahá'í pioneers continued to make their presence felt in Tonga whether their stay was short or long. Margaret Rowling was almost constantly traveling to Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, New Caledonia, Nouméa and the Cook Islands between 1956 and 1975. During 1974-79 Australian pioneers embarked to many of the Pacific islands including Tonga. Tongan Bahá'ís have also traveled to other lands; in addition to the travelers and travels mentioned above there have also been two exchange students from Tonga attended the Daystar International School, the first development project of the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan.\n\nIn 2004, during the golden jubilee of the Bahá'í community of Tonga, there were 29 local spiritual assemblies and the community has had visits over the years from prominent Baha'is — Hands of the Cause Collis Featherstone, Abu'l-Qasim Faizi, Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir, Enoch Olinga, Rúhíyyih Khanum, and John Robarts, and a member of the Universal House of Justice, Hugh Chance.\n\nCelebrations held for the golden anniversary of the Bahá'í Faith in Tonga included the attendance of then Crown Prince Tupouto'a, Native American artist Kevin Locke as well as choirs, dance troops, tribal story tellers and hundreds of participants. The brother of then Crown Prince Topouto'a, the Honoroble Ma'atu, died on 17 February 2004 after suffering a heart attack. Representatives of the Bahá'í community accepted an invitation to offer prayers at the memorial service held on 24 February and was survived by his wife Alaileula, the granddaughter of the late Malietoa Tanumafili II, former Head of State of Samoa, also a member of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nWhile the Bahá'í community has grown in the country, there has also been opposition. In 1973, the Wesleyan Church of Niua Toputapu published an anti-Bahá'í polemic \"The Baha'i Faith Answered by Christianity\".\n\nFurthermore, even as late as 2008 the Tonga Broadcasting Commission (TBC) maintains policy guidelines regarding the broadcast of religious programming on Radio Tonga. The TBC guidelines state that in view of \"the character of the listening public\" those who preach on Radio Tonga must confine their preaching \"within the limits of the mainstream Christian tradition.\" Due to this policy, the TBC does not allow discussions by members of the Bahá'í Faith of its founder, Bahá'u'lláh, by name, or of the tenets of their religions. Members of the Bahá'í Faith utilize a privately owned radio station for program activities and the announcement of functions.\n\nIn 1983, Bahá'í sources claimed they constituted 3.9% of the national population and by 1987 the number of Bahá'ís was at 6.3%. Through 2000-2006 estimates ranged between nearly 5% or 6.09%. In 2007 Encyclopedia Encarta estimated the Bahá'í community constituted 7% of the national population, (about 8100 individuals) — more than twice the size of the remaining non-Christian religious groups in Tonga. The World Religion Database estimated 3.5% of the national population in 2015 were Bahá'ís. However the national census listed its official population in the upper hundreds: 595 in 1986, 686 in 2006, and 777 in 2011.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Bahá'í community in Tonga has organized various institutions and events in the country. The Ocean of Light International School is a private internationalist Bahá'í school directly administered by a non-profit Board of Education nominated by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Tonga. The school is known as a Bahá'í school and is striving to incorporate Bahá'í ideals, principles and concepts into the curriculum and organization of the school. The school is located in Kolomotu’a / Hofoa - about 3 kilometers from the centre of Nukualofa. It offers classes from kindergarten (3 years old) to high school diploma using Cambridge International Examinations including the International General Certificate of Secondary Education. There are Bahá'í youth performing periods of service at the school. Furthermore, Nancy Watters, a consultant promoting virtue oriented programs especially for schools toured Tonga in 2002. See also The Virtues Project.\n\nIn October 2007, ‘Ilifeleti Tovo of Kolomotu’a was elected President of the University of the South Pacific Students Association (USPSA) despite not being affiliated with a political party. The Bahá'í Faith does not condone party affiliations and Tovo resigned his party affiliation \"...because I did not want to break my religious rules and ethics\". In 2008, Tovo strongly criticized the salary range of University officers and was censured but salaries were adjusted downward by 45-65%.\n\nThere also exists the \"1844\" Rock band composed of Tongan Bahá'ís whose style is religious rock.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2254206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254206", "title": "Bid‘ah", "text": "Bid‘ah\n\nIn Islam, bid‘ah (; ) refers to innovation in religious matters. Linguistically the term means \"innovation, novelty, heretical doctrine, heresy\".\n\nIn classical Arabic literature (adab), it has been used as a form of praise for outstanding compositions of prose and poetry.\n\nIn early Islamic history, bid'ah referred primarily to heterodox doctrines (as evidenced below). However, in Islamic law, when used without qualification, bid'ah denotes any newly invented matter that is without precedent and is in opposition to the Quran and Sunnah.\n\nScholars (most prominent of which is Imam Shafi‘i) generally have divided bid'ah into two types: innovations in worldly matters and innovations in religious matters. Some have additionally divided bid'ah into lawful and unlawful innovations, the details of which are discussed below.\n\nIntroducing and acting upon a bid‘ah in religious matters is a sin and considered one of the in Islam that is obligatory to immediately desist and repent from.\n\nSunni Muslim scholars have divided bid‘ah in worldly matters into two types:\n\nThere are a number of different definitions of Bid‘ah.\n\nThe Qur'anic verse: \"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\"(), is considered by at least some Muslim to be against bid'ah in religion. The Sunnah has many more prohibitions against innovation in religion.\n\nAli ibn Abu Talib, of the \"Rashidun\" (rightly guided Caliphs), said; \"He who innovates or gives protection to an innovator, there is a curse of Allah and that of His angels and that of the whole humanity upon him.\" Abdullah ibn Umar said: \"Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people see it as something good.\"\n\nAbd Allah ibn Abbas, a companion of the Prophet and early Islamic scholar also said: \"Indeed the most detestable of things to Allah are the innovations.\" Sufyan al-Thawri, a \"tabi'i\" Islamic scholar, Hafiz and jurist, mentions: \"Innovation is more beloved to Iblees than sin, since a sin may be repented for but innovation is not repented for.\" He also said, \"Whoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allāh and is entrusted with the innovation.\"\n\nA person once sent salaam to Abdullah ibn Umar who replied: \"I do not accept his salaam, as this person has innovated by becoming Qadariyah (A sect which does not believe in destiny.\")\n\nAl-Fuḍayl ibn ‘Iyāḍ is reputed to have said: \"I met the best of people, all of them Salafi and they used to forbid from accompanying the people of innovation.\" Hasan al-Basri mentions: \"Do not sit with the people of innovation and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them\". Ibraaheem ibn Maysarah mentions: \"Whoever honours an innovator has aided in the destruction of Islam.\"\n\nAl-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari mentions: \"The innovators are like scorpions. They bury their heads and bodies in the sand and leave their tails out. When they get the chance they sting; the same with the innovators who conceal themselves amongst the people, when they are able, they do what they desire.\" Abu Haatim said: \"A sign of the people of innovation is their battling against the people of Narrations.\" Abu 'Uthmaan as-Saaboonee said: \"The signs of the people of innovation are clear and obvious. The most apparent of their signs is their severe enmity for those who carry the reports of the Prophet.\"\n\nA tradition holds that Muhammad told a companion: \"The person who introduced a good (precedent) thing in Islam, shall obtain the reward for it and also the reward for those who adopt it. As for the one who introduces a bad thing he will obtain the punishment for introducing it and also for those who adopt it, will also be punished.\"\n\nJabir ibn Abd Allah narrated \"...The Prophet said: He who introduced some good (precedent) practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their's being diminished in any respect.\n\nAnas ibn Malik said \"I heard the Prophet say: 'My nation will not unite on misguidance, so if you see them differing, follow the great majority.'\"\n\nAbu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet said, \"Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.\" After the Prophet's death the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of Umar ibn Al-Khattab's Caliphate. During Ramadan upon seeing people praying in different groups, Umar ordered Ubay ibn Ka'b to lead the people in congregational prayer. On this Umar said: 'What an excellent Bida (i.e. innovation in religion at that time from an earlier time) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.'\n\nSalman al-Farsi narrated that the Prophet was asked, by some of the companions, about the permissibility and prohibition of certain items, he states \"Halal is that which Allah has made Halal in His book, Haram is that which Allah has made Haram in His book and about which he has remained silent is all forgiven.\"\n\nAbu Hurairah narrated at the time of the Fajr prayer the Prophet asked Bilal ibn al-Harith, \"Tell me of the best deed you did after embracing Islam, for I heard your footsteps in front of me in Paradise.\" Bilal replied, \"I did not do anything worth mentioning except that whenever I performed ablution during the day or night, I prayed after that ablution as much as was written for me.\" Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani says in \"Fath al-Bari\" that \"the hadith shows it is permissible to use personal reasoning (ijtihad) in choosing times for acts of worship, for Bilal reached the conclusion he mentioned by his own inference and the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) confirmed him therein.\" Similar to this, Khubyab bin Adi asked to pray two rak‘as before being executed by idolators in Mecca, and was hence the first to establish the \"sunna\" of two rak'as for those who are steadfast in going to their death.\n\nRifaa ibn Rafi narrated: When we were praying behind the Prophet and he raised his head from bowing and said, \"Allah hears whoever praises Him,\" a man behind him said, \"Our Lord, Yours is the praise, abundandly, wholesomely, and blessedly.\"When he rose to leave, the Prophet asked who said it, and when the man replied that it was he, the Prophet said, \"I saw thirty-odd angel each striving to be the one to write it.\" Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani comments in \"Fath al-Bari\" that the hadith \"indicates the permissibility of initiation new expression of \"dhikr\" in the prayer other than the ones related through hadith texts (even though this is still reported in the hadiths), as long as they do not contradict those conveyed by the hadith. It is clear that this is since the above were a mere enhancement and addendum to the know, \"sunna dhikr\".\"\n\nImam Shafi'i gave the following advice, \"An innovation which contradicts the Qur'an, Sunnah, an Athar or Ijma is a heretical bid'a: if however something new is introduced which is not evil in itself and does not contradict the above mentioned authorities of religious life, then it is a praiseworthy, unobjectional bid'a.\" This can infer worldly bid'a or technology.\n\nThe criterion that qualifies a particular action as a bid'ah in the religion is a debate amongst Sunni scholars. Scholars affiliated to the Salafi and Wahhabi sects argue for an exclusive, literal definition that entails anything not specifically performed or confirmed by the Prophet.\n\nPractitioners of Sufism, in contrast, argue for an inclusive, holistic definition. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah writes:\nAccording to Shia Islam the definition of bid'ah is anything that is introduced to Islam as either being fard (mandatory), mustahabb (recommended), halal (neutral), makruh (reprehensible) or haram (forbidden) that contradicts the Qur'an or hadith. Any new good practice introduced that does not contradict the Qur'an or hadith is permissible. However, it is not permissible to say that a new good practice (that does not contradict the Qur'an or hadith) is obligatory, highly recommended or \"sunnah\" proper. Hence, the Shi'a stance mirrors the body of Sunni scholars who proffer the idea of \"bid'ah hasana\". As a general rule in Shi'a jurisprudence, anything is permissible except whatever is prohibited through divine revelation (i.e. the Qur'an or hadith).\n\nDespite the general understanding of standing scholarly disagreements (ikhtilaf), the notion of lawful innovation is a polarizing issue in the Islamic world. A practical example of this is the debate over the permissibility of the mawlid or commemoration of Muhammad's birthday. All scholars agree that such celebrations did not exist in the early period of Islamic history, and yet \"mawalid\" commemorations are a common element in Muslim societies around the world. Even so, Sunnis' scholars are divided between emphatic unconditional condemnation and conditional acceptance of the celebration with the former insisting it is a bid'ah and thus automatically unlawful, while the latter argues it nonetheless is contextually permissible.\n\nBritish historian Sadakat Kadri has noted the change over time in what is considered bid'ah.\n\nHadith were not written down until the 9th century, at least in part because \"traditionialists such as Ibn Hanbal considered human literature to be an unholy innovation.\" This interpretation changed even for very conservative jurists such as Ibn Taymiyyah who wrote dozens of books. Ibn Taymiyyah however considered mathematics, a bidah, a false form of knowledge that \"does not bring perfection to the human soul, nor save man from castigation of God, nor lead him to a happy life\", and forbade its use in determining the beginning of lunar months. Very conservative Wahhabis allow the broadcast of television but Indian Deobandi forbid their followers from watching it, but make use of the more recent invention the internet to issue fatwas.\n\nTraditionally who died of plague and who did not was explained as simply the will of God based on al-Bukhari’s al-Sahih hadith, but studying the progress of the Black Death (bubonic plague) in the 14th century, scholar Ibn al-Khatib noted those who died had the plague transmitted to them from \"garments, vessels, ear-rings; ... persons ... by infection of a healthy sea-port by an arrival from an infected land\" where as isolated individuals were immune. In the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun defends the science of medicine from suggestions that it is an innovation going against the Sunna. \"The medicine mentioned in religious tradition ... is in no way part of the divine revelation.\" It was simply part of \"Arab custom and happened to be mentioned in connection with the circumstances of the Prophet, like other things that were customary in his generation.\" But was \"not mentioned in order to imply that [it] is stipulated by the religious law.\"\n\nIn his \"Book of Knowledge\" Al-Ghazali observed that many phenomena once thought bid'ah had come to be though legally unobjectionable. \n[A]mong the accepted practices of our time are decorating and furnishing the mosques, and expending great sums of money on their ornate construction and fine rugs which were then considered innovations. These were introduced by the pilgrims, since the early Muslims seldom placed anything on the ground during prayer. Similarly disputation and debate are among the most honoured disciples of the day and are numbered among the best meritorious works (qarubat): nevertheless they were among the taboos at the time of the Companions. The same is true of the chanting (talhiri) of the Qur'an and the call for prayer, going to excess in matters of cleanliness and being over fastidious in matters of ceremonial purity, ruling clothes unclean on petty and far-fetched grounds, and, at the same time, being lax in ruling foods lawful and unlawful as well as many other like things.\nHe quoted Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman approvingly: \"Strange as it may seem, accepted practices of today are the taboos of a day gone by. ... And the taboos of today are the accepted practices of a day yet to come.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38968546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38968546", "title": "Coven Celeste", "text": "Coven Celeste\n\nCoven Celeste was the first \"official\" Gardnerian Wiccan coven in Canada, founded in the late 1960s by Gary Botting, the grandson of Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)'s London-based High Priestess Lysbeth Turner, and Botting's wife Heather Botting. Since Heather Botting's initiation by Turner in 1966, the coven has remained matrilineal, with the Bottings' granddaughters Phaydra and Ariadne Gagnon inheriting the athame as high priestesses.\n\nThe seed of Coven Celeste was planted in Peterborough, Ontario in the summer of 1966 when Heather Botting met her prospective husband's maternal grandmother, Lysbeth Turner (née Rendle) (1896–1968), the younger sister of Thomas Edward Rendle VC, the first British infantryman to receive the Victoria Cross in the First World War. Originally from Bristol, Lysbeth Turner had become one of Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)'s followers in London prior to World War II. She had introduced her grandson Gary Botting to Gardner in Bloomsbury in 1953. Realizing that most of her Canadian family (including Gary) had become committed Jehovah's Witnesses, during her 1966 visit to Canada Lysbeth lamented to Heather that her tradition of the \"Old Religion\" (i.e. Wicca) would be lost forever unless someone \"fresh\" took up the athame. Despite her being raised a Jehovah's Witness, Heather knew something about suppressed cultural values since in Ontario she had been forced to deny her Assiniboine-Sioux heritage. Now, she rose to the challenge, abandoned the faith of her youth and was initiated into witchcraft, soon afterwards naming her new sacred circle \"Coven Celeste\"—the first Wiccan coven in Canada. Heather and Gary eloped later that year, but kept both their marriage and their new religion a secret from their Jehovah's Witness parents—and especially from the elders in their respective JW congregations in Newmarket and Peterborough.\n\nGary Botting's interest in the occult was fueled by his research as an English major into the life and death of Christopher Marlowe, especially Marlowe's best-known play, \"Doctor Faustus\". Botting himself later wrote two plays about The School of Night, a clandestine Elizabethan club dedicated to delving into the occult, membership in which included Marlowe and such notables as Sir Walter Raleigh, Baron Cobham, the Earl of Northumberland, Thomas Kyd, and Thomas Harriott. Because of the severe social strictures placed upon them by Jehovah's Witnesses, including fear of being disfellowshipped, the Bottings stayed in the \"broom closet,\" discussing their new faith only with fellow practicing pagans. Gary Botting later depicted the early formation of the coven and its barely disguised principals in his play \"The Succubus\", produced as a major project by the University of Alberta Department of Drama in 1982. When after Lysbeth Turner's death in 1968 Botting's JW mother discovered the extent of her mother's Wiccan proclivities, she publicly burned most of the pagan artifacts and images that Turner had left behind in a bid to purge her house of \"Satan's\" influence.\n\nCoven Celeste remained in the \"gestation\" phase for four years, and came to full development, with a public profile, after the Bottings moved to Alberta in 1970. Heather Botting taught \"Witchcraft and the Occult\" at Red Deer College. By 1974, Coven Celeste was drawing witches from all over the west of Canada to its central \"covenstead\" in Sylvan Lake, Alberta. True to the Gardnerian tradition, rituals, especially sabbats, were performed in the nude. The Bottings purchased properties in Sylvan Lake, Burnt Lake, Alix and Bentley, Alberta with heavy woods either on or adjacent to their land, and made paths through the woods to hidden altars and sacred circles. As the coven expanded, nudity became optional and it was recognized that all witches were \"naked under their gowns.\" Before long, floor-length gowns had become the norm. Major rituals were conducted outdoors in the nearby woods except in the dead of winter. The original rituals were created by Heather Botting (\"Lady Aurora\") and Gary Botting (\"Lord Pan\") using eclectic sources, including adaptations of the rituals of Jessie Wicker Bell (better known as \"Lady Sheba\") as published in \"The Grimoire of Lady Sheba\".\n\nCommencing in 1975, the Alberta coven began to \"hive\", with different members of the coven moving away, taking Coven Celeste's traditional brand of Gardnerian witchcraft with them. Pagan-oriented visitors who had heard of Coven Celeste were made welcome either as observers or participants, and Coven Celeste's influence spread. Michele Favarger of Cobble Hill, BC attended Coven Celeste rituals in Alberta in 1982 and subsequently returned to BC to form the Canadian Aquarian Tabernacle Church (\"ATC\") on Vancouver Island, basing it on some of the precepts of Coven Celeste. Later, in British Columbia, the coven incorporated many of the rituals of Starhawk as published in \"The Spiral Dance\". In 1993, Gary Botting, who by then had become established as a criminal lawyer in Victoria, BC, represented Starhawk and dozens of other Wiccans charged with criminal contempt of court following the Clayoquot protests against logging in the Clayoquot Sound on Vancouver Island. Subsequently, the Bottings, Favarger, and Favarger's partner and high priest Erik Lindblad successfully campaigned the Province of British Columbia to recognize Wiccan weddings. By 1995 Coven Celeste had become one of the mainstay covens of Temple of the Lady in Victoria, BC.\n\nThe Bottings were divorced in 1999, and the following year Heather married Denis O'Brien, the Mohawk-Irish high priest of Circle of the Moonsong; whereupon she transferred Coven Celeste to her granddaughters Phaydra and Ariadne Gagnon,\nalong with the secrets of its sacred tools, the athame, white handled knife, pentacle, scourge, cauldron, candle holders, candles, censor, Book of Shadows, and wands cut and manufactured by them under the supervision of their grandfather. In 2010, Lady Aurora was still conducting a prison ministry and as High Priestess of ATC was officially recognized by the Province as an officiator of pagan weddings. As a professor of anthropology at the University of Victoria, Heather Botting was an officially recognized Wiccan chaplain there for more than a decade, the first officially recognized Wiccan chaplain in any university in North America.\n"}

Gross on the origins of intelligent design, specifically the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture and its wedge strategy. The authors are highly critical of what they refer to as intelligent design creationism, and document the intelligent design movement's fundamentalist Christian origins and funding.\n\nThe book grew out of an essay, \"The Wedge at Work: How Intelligent Design Creationism Is Wedging Its Way into the Cultural and Academic Mainstream\" which Forrest wrote for the book \"Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics\" (2001) edited by Robert T. Pennock. It is published by Oxford University Press and has a foreword by Steven Weinberg.\n\nMichael Cavanaugh, President of the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science called the book \"chilling\", saying that \"It lets one see how totalitarian religious thought can begin to take hold even of a multi-cultural free society.\" Karl Giberson, editor-in-chief of the Templeton Foundation's \"Science & Theology News\" chose it as the July's Editor's Choice and described it as a \"remarkable analysis\". Allan H. Harvey reviewed the book for \"Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith\", the journal of the American Scientific Affiliation and criticized the authors' understanding of Christian theology, but wrote that \"its thoroughness makes \"Creationism's Trojan Horse\" worth reading for those who are concerned about the movement's influence on public opinion and science education.\"\n\nThere were also positive reviews in the scientific literature, by Steve Olson in \"Science\", by Rudolf A. Raff in \"Evolution & Development\", by Barry Palevitz in \"Bioscience\" and by Lawrence S. Lerner in \"Physics & Society\".\n\nChris Mooney reviewed the book for his CSICOP column and used it to compare ID creationism with young Earth creationism. Biologist Bruce Grant described the authors as \"heroes\", saying their work was \"the most thorough introduction to that enemy [intelligent design creationism]\".\n\nThe book also had endorsements from Richard Dawkins, E.O. Wilson, Ursula Goodenough, Massimo Pigliucci, Eugenie C. Scott and Steven Pinker.\n\nThe main subject of the book, the Discovery Institute, was highly critical of \"Creationism's Trojan Horse\". Jonathan Witt of the Discovery Institute wrote a review in the theology journal \"Philosophia Christi\" published by the Evangelical Philosophical Society and said that it had \"erroneous reasoning\" and that \"on every page of the book, there is a tone of paranoia.\"\n\nWitt and John G. West of the Discovery Institute also had an article published in the November 2004 edition of \"Science & Theology News\" entitled \"Unraveling The Threads of Darwinist Paranoia\". A month later, Forrest and Gross wrote in \"Science & Theology News\", with a reply by Witt and West. Ian Musgrave contributed a letter to the editor in the February 2005 edition replying to West and Witt's reply.\n\nThe research which Forrest in particular did led to her appearing as an expert witness for the plaintiffs at the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" intelligent design trial, in which intelligent design was ruled to be religious creationism and not science, and thus could not be taught as science in public school classrooms of Dover, Pennsylvania because of the Establishment clause of the US Constitution.\n\nDuring the trial, pre-publication drafts of the textbook at the center of the controversy \"Of Pandas and People\" were uncovered which revealed its creationist origins and how it had changed from using creationist terminology to using intelligent design terminology as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Edwards v. Aguillard\". This formed an important part of Forrest's testimony.\n\nA few days before Forrest's testimony, the Discovery Institute published its own \"brief history of the scientific theory of intelligent design\" by Jonathan Witt, in which he attempts to diminish the importance of Edwards v. Aguillard, claiming instead that the origin of intelligent design was much older.\n\n\n"}

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn appears in sixteen verses of the Quran, specifically the 16 verses (Al Kahf).\n\nThere is extensive ongoing debate on who exactly was the historical character of Dhul-Qarnayn, with various historical, mythical, and sacred figures being proposed. The most popular identification, especially by classical Quran commentators, has been with Alexander the Great.\n\nIn recent years, alternative theories supporting other explanations have become dominant. The most prominent of these is the theory that Dhul-Qarnayn was Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire. This theory was first proposed by Indian scholar Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and was later endorsed by many Sunni and Shia scholars and commentators including Israr Ahmed, Maududi, Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, Allameh Tabatabaei (in \"Tafsir al-Mizan\"), Naser Makarem Shirazi (et al., in \"Tafsir Nemooneh\"), Muhammad Ali, among others.\n\nAbul Ala Maududi, a 20th-century Quran commentator, writes in his Tafsir\nthat the identification of Dhul-Qarnain has been a controversial topic among Islamic scholars from the earliest times. Generally, commentators have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn is actually Alexander the Great. However, some characteristics of Dhul-Qarnain described in the Quran, it has been argued, are not applicable to the historical Alexander. The fact that the Alexander-as-Dhul-Qarnain theory actually refers to the semi-mythical Alexander described in the Alexander Romance makes the connection even more problematic for some Islamic scholars. In recent years some commentators are inclined to believe that Dhul-Qarnain was actually Cyrus The Great, an ancient king of Achaemenid Persia.\n\nThe characteristics of Dhul-Qarnain in the light of his story as given in the Quran are as follows:\n\n(1) The title Dhul-Qarnain (\"The Two-Horned\") should have been quite familiar to the Jews, for it was at their instigation that the disbelievers of Mecca put this question to Muhammad.\n\nAccording to Maududi's commentary on Surah 18 states:\n\nTherefore, one must investigate the Judaic literature and oral tradition available to Jews at the time of Muhammad in order to learn the identity of the person known as \"The Two-Horned\".\n\n(2) Dhul-Qarnayn must have been a great ruler and conqueror whose conquests might have spread from the East to the West and then to the North or the South. Before the revelation of the Quran in 609CE, there were several historical figures who were known to have been conquerors of such caliber.\n\n(3) This title should be applicable to such a ruler who constructed a strong wall across a mountain pass to protect his kingdom from the incursions of tribes or nations associated with \"Gog and Magog\". In order to investigate this, one must determine the identity of Gog and Magog. One must also consider where and when such a wall was built, if at all, and by whom.\n\n(4) Besides possessing the aforementioned characteristics, he should also be a mono-theist and a just ruler, since the Quran has stressed these characteristics more than anything else in the quoted passages. \n\n(1) The first of these characteristics may be applicable to Cyrus. The Prophet Daniel, in the Biblical account, saw a vision that the united kingdom of Media and Persia was like a two-horned ram before the rise of the Greeks.\n\nThe Book of Daniel Chapter 8 says:\n\nThe \"New Revised Standard Version\" of the Bible gives the following interpretation from Gabriel: \"As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.\"\n\nFurthermore, \"two horns\" and two horned symbolism was not an unknown emblem of the kingdoms of Persia and its predecessors, for we see that Elamite kings used this symbol routinely in their insignia.\n\nThe Jews had a very high opinion of Cyrus the Great, because it was his invasion which brought about the downfall of the kingdom of Babylon and the liberation of the Israelites.\n\n(2) The second characteristic is applicable to Cyrus to a great extent but not completely. Though his conquests spread to Syria and Asia Minor in the West and to Bākhtar (Balkh) in the East, there is no trace of any of his great expeditions to the North or to the South, whereas the Quran makes an explicit mention of his third expedition. However some historians do verify the probability of such a voyage. Nevertheless, this third expedition is not completely out of question for history tells us that Cyrus' kingdom extended to Caucasia in the North.\n\n(3) As regards Gog and Magog, it has been established that they were the wild tribes of Central Asia who were known by different names: Scythians, Parthians, Tartars, Mongols, and Huns, who had been making incursions on various kingdoms and empires from very ancient times. It is also known that strong bulwarks had been built in southern regions of Caucasia, though it has yet to be determined historically whether these were built by Cyrus.\n\n(4) As regards the third characteristic, Cyrus is the only known conqueror among the ancient rulers, to whom this may be applicable, for even his enemies have been full of praise for him for his justice, and, Ezra, asserts that he was a God-worshiper and a God-fearing king who set free the Israelites because of his God-worship, and ordered that the Temple of Solomon be rebuilt for the worship of God.\n\nThus in the light of the above, it is possible to conclude that of all the historical conquerors who had died before the revelation of the Quran, Cyrus alone is the one to whom the characteristics of \"Dhul-Qarnain\" are most applicable. There is no other historical conquerors to whom the characteristics stated in the Quran are as much applicable as to Cyrus.\n\nThe historical Cyrus was a Persian ruler whose rise began about 549 BCE. Within a few years he had conquered the kingdoms of Media and Lydia; by 539 BCE he had conquered Babylon. There was no powerful kingdom left to oppose him. His conquests extended eastward to Turkistan; westward to Ionia; northward to Caucasia—covering, in fact, much of the known civilized world.\n\nAccording to Ibn Kathir, it means that he followed a route to the West of the earth until he reached the last boundary of the land, beyond which there was ocean. Verse 18:86 says: \"He found it setting in a muddy spring\" (Pickthall). If Dhul-Qarnain was Cyrus, then that place would be the western limit of Asia Minor and the \"muddy spring\" (or \"warm spring\" according to some hadiths) would be the Aegean Sea. The word \"`ain\" in Quran verse 18:86 means spring or source of water from the ground, as in other verses according to Lane's Lexicon:\n\nThe word \"bahr\" (not used in this verse) means sea or large body of water and appears in many other verses in the Quran to mean sea.\n\nThat is, when he advanced towards the East in Babylon, the people, who had no shelter were the captured tribes of Israel. The reason the Quran mentions no more on the topic is because the whole epic is written in the Book of Kings, of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The Quran simply says at 18:90, \"To the extent that when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for which We had not kept any shelter from it.\"\n\nThe \"two mountains\" must have been parts of that mountain range which runs between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. This must be, for beyond them was the territory of Gog and Magog. \"It was difficult to communicate with them: their language was almost foreign to Dhul-Qarnain and his companions, and, as they were quite barbaric, none could understand their language, nor were they acquainted with any foreign language.\"\n\nAs has already been pointed out, Gog and Magog were the wild tribes of North Eastern Asia which, from the very early times had been making inroads on settled kingdoms and empires in Asia and Europe and ravaging them. According to Genesis (Chapter 10), they were the descendants of Japheth, the son of Noah, and the Muslim historians have also accepted this. And according to the book of Ezekiel (Chapters 38, 39), they inhabited the territories of Meshech (Moscow) and Tubal (Tubalsek). According to the 1st century CE Israelite historian Josephus, Magog were called Scythians by the Greeks, and their territory spread to the north and the east of the Black Sea. However, Josephus also says that the Scythians had been shut up behind an iron gate built across a passage by Alexander [the Great]. According to Jerome, Magog inhabited the territory to the north of Caucasia near the Caspian Sea:\n\nHe said: \"Though I have built a very strong iron-wall, as far as it was possible for me, it is not ever-lasting, for it will last only as long as Allah wills, and will fall down to pieces when the time of my Lord's promise shall come. Then no power in the world shall be able to keep it safe and secure.\"\n\nSome people have entertained the misunderstanding that the wall attributed here to Dhul-Qarnain refers to the famous Great Wall of China, whereas this wall was built between Derbent and Dar'yal, two cities of Daghestan in the Caucasus, the land that lies between the Black Sea and the Caspian. There are high mountains between the Black Sea and Dar'yal having deep gorges which cannot allow large armies to pass through them. Between Derbent and Dar'yal, however, there are no such mountains and the passes also are wide and passable. In ancient times savage hordes from the north invaded and ravaged southern lands through these passes and the Persian rulers who were fearful of them had to build a strong wall, 50 miles long, 29 feet high and 10 feet wide, for fortification purposes, ruins of which can still be seen (e.g. Great Wall of Gorgan). Though it has not yet been established historically who built this wall in the beginning, Muslim historians and geographers assign it to Dhul-Qarnain because its remains correspond with the description of it given in the Quran, despite the fact that the wall is in fact Sassanid in origins, and thus is about 1000 years too late to have been built by Cyrus. \"The OSL and radiocarbon samples demonstrated conclusively that both walls had been built in the 5th or, possibly, 6th century AD\".\n\nIbn Jarir Tabari and Ibn Kathir have recorded the event, and Yaqut al-Hamawi has mentioned it in his Mujam-ul-Buldan that: \"when after the conquest of Azerbaijan, Umar sent Suraqah bin `Amr, in 22 A.H. (643CE) on an expedition to Derbent, the latter appointed `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered Armenia, the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details and then the man was actually presented before `Abdur Rehman. (Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235–239; Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, Vol. VII, pp. 122–125, and Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, under Bab-ul-Abwab: Derbent).\"\n\nTwo hundred years later, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Wathiq dispatched a party of 50 men under Sallam-ul-Tarjuman to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain, whose observations have been recorded in great detail by Yaqut al-Hamawi in Mu jam-ul-Buldan and by Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah. They write:\n\n\"this expedition reached Samarrah from where they reached Tbilisi and then through As-Sarir and Al-Lan, they reached Filanshah, from where they entered the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall. (Al-Bidayah Vol. II, p. 111, Vol. VII, pp. 122–125; Mu jam-ul-Buldan: under Bab-ul-Abwab).\" This clearly shows that even up until the tenth century, Muslim scholars regarded this wall of the Caucasus as the wall of Dhul-Qarnain.\n\nYaqut in his Mu jam-ul-Buldan has further confirmed the same view at a number of places. For instance, under Khazar (Caspian) he writes:\n\nRegarding Bab-ul-Abwab he says that this city is called both Al-Bab and Derbent, which is a highly difficult passage for the people coming from the northern lands towards the south. Once this territory was a part of the kingdom of Nausherwan, and the Persian rulers paid particular attention to strengthening their frontiers on that side.\"\n\nAbout Dhul-Qarnain, Muhammad Ali says (p586):\nThe word qarn means a horn, as also a generation or a century and dhul qarnain literally means the two-horned one, or one belonging to the two generations or two centuries. The reference here seems to be to the two horned ram of Daniel's vision (Dan. 8:3), which he interpreted as the Kingdoms of Media and Persia, which were combined into a single kingdom under one ruler, Cyrus, who is erroneously called Darius in the Bible. The reference in Daniel's vision is, however, not to Cyrus but to Darius I Hystaspes (521-485 B.C.), \"who allowed the Jews to rebuild their temple, and is referred to in Ezra 4:5,24;5:5;6:1;Hag1:1;2:10;Zech. 1;7, and probably in Neh. 12:22. His liberality towards the Jews is in complete accord with what we know otherwise of his general policy in religious matter towards the subject nations\"\n\nMaududi says:\nreferred to Alexander. The characteristics attribute to Dhul-Qarnayn,\nhowever, hardly apply to Alexander. In the light of the latest historical\nevidence, contemporary commentators on the Quran are inclined to believe\nthat Dhul-Qarnayn signifies the Persian Emperor, Cyrus. This, in any case,\nseems more plausible. Nevertheless, the info available to date does not\nenable one to form a definitive opinion concerning Dhul-Qarnayn's identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is identified as the maternal home of Queen Mayadevi, Prajapati Gautami and Princess Yasodhara. There are many places to visit in Devdaha. It is believed that Prince Siddhartha had spent some years of his childhood with his step-mother/aunt Prajapati Gautami in Devdaha.\n\nDevdaha was a township of the koliyan in what is now the Rupandehi District of Nepal. The Buddha stayed there during his tours and preached to the monks on various topics. According to the Commentaries, it was the city of birth of the Buddha's mother (Mayadevi), and of Pajāpatī Gotamī and their companions (Koliyans), who married the Sākiyans of Kapilavatthu.\n\nIn Sanskrit Language, Deva means god and Daha means a pond hence the literal meaning of Devdaha is \"pond of a God\". It is believed that the gods and goddesses and saints bathed in this pond. Prince Siddartha himself is believed to have bathed in this holy pond during his visit here in Devdaha. Because it came into existence without human intervention, hence divine (Pali: \"sayañjāto vā so daho, tasmā pi Devadaho\") and the water of this holy pond was supplied in the Koliya Palace. The ancient Koliya Kingdom and present Devdaha received its name Devdaha from this very holy pond.\n\nAccording to the Buddhist text Dulva (Rockhill, p. 12), the city was founded by Sākiyans from Kapilavatthu, when they grew very numerous. The spot was pointed out by a deva, hence its name.\n\nPakari Brikshya is peepal or weeping fig (\"Ficus benjamina\"). The evergreen tree has a trunk of about 82 ft. Circumference and height about 96 ft. the branches are wide spread creating circumference about 500 ft is believed to be one of the biggest tree in Asia. Pakari Tree a giant and considered to be holy tree. There are many myth and beliefs related to this tree. According to the locals, the large Pakari Tree Date to the time of the Shakyas. The fact that \"birds never nest on it\", \"vultures and crows never perch\" on it and \"elephants never go near i\"t , amaze the people. Its unique structure and public belief of historical relation to the period of Lord Buddha, has made it a famous external and internal tourist attraction spot in last few decades. Pakari Tree can be reached in 5 minute drive from Khaireni bazar in South.\n\nThe historical site of Bhawanipur, also known as Devidamar, is located 4 km South of Mahendra Highway at Devdaha Municipality Ward No. 4. It is believed to have been ancient Devdaha, capital of the Koliya. The site consists of a temple dedicated to the Queen Mayadevi and other archaeological sites. Significants religious and archaeological and objects here include a long stone column(some consider it to be an Ashoka Pillar), stone image of Sun God, ancient brick well etc. Structural wall of ancient constructions are visible even at the surface level here.\n\nLocated at Devdaha Municipality just 1 Km south from the junction of \"Shitalnagar\", the \"Kanya Mai Temple\" is believed to be built in the memory of \"Queen Prajapati Gautami\", the step mother of Lord Buddha. Major images found in the temple, include standing image of \"Lokeshwore\" holding Lotus flower in one hand, while the other is broken off, and many stone idols. Ancient potteries are still visible on the near by mound. Excavation carried out by the \"Department of Archaeology\" and LDT have uncovered several structural ruins and stone antiquities at these sites.\n\nThe structures of traditional palace and well also have been uncovered during the excavation of 2011 AD.\n\nPrince Siddhartha was born in Lumbini while Queen Maya Devi was on her way to Devdaha. Queen Maya Devi died on the seventh day of Siddhartha's birth. He was then brought up by his second mother, Queen Prajapati Gautami. During his childhood, Prince Siddhartha paid several visits to Devdaha. After seven years of his Enlightenment, Prince Siddhartha – now Gautama Buddha – again visited Devdaha and was greatly welcomed there.\n\nThis Park is the eastern front gate of Devdaha. It contains a huge garden and a pagoda. There is a big statue of Buddha () and a gilded statue of Sariputra. The garden contains various flowers including \"bodhi brichha\". The park was built by Devdaha Conservation Academy, and it was inaugurated by Former Crown Prince of Nepal Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev. This park is the entrance and the symbol of peace in Devdaha. Previously due to lack of advertisement, people used to get confused about this place, but nowadays this problem has been solved.\n\n"}
{"id": "797029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797029", "title": "Emerald Tablet", "text": "Emerald Tablet\n\nThe Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Tablet, or Tabula Smaragdina, is a compact and cryptic piece of the \"Hermetica\" reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia and its transmutation. It was highly regarded by European alchemists as the foundation of their art and its Hermetic tradition. The original source of the \"Emerald Tablet\" is unknown. Although Hermes Trismegistus is the author named in the text, its first known appearance is in a book written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. The text was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century. Numerous translations, interpretations and commentaries followed.\n\nThe layers of meaning in the \"Emerald Tablet\" have been associated with the creation of the philosopher's stone, laboratory experimentation, phase transition, the alchemical magnum opus, mystical psychosis, cosmic consciousness, unus mundus, anima mundi, The All (of Hermetism/Hermeticism), successful child conception out of proved pure love, the ancient, classical, element system, and the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm.\n\nSimilarities and correspondences with the \"Emerald Tablet\" have been drawn with Eastern philosophies like Daoism (Tao Te Ching, Tao, wuji, YinYang, and the \"I Ching\"), Hinduism, and Buddhism, and even with the Book of Genesis and Book of Isaiah of the Christian Bible.\n\nThe text of the \"Smaragdine Tablet\" gives its author as Hermes Trismegistus (\"Hermes the Thrice-Greatest\"), a legendary Hellenistic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. Despite the claims of antiquity, it's believed to be an Arabic work written between the sixth and eighth centuries. The oldest documentable source of the text is the \"Kitab Balaniyus al-Hakim fi'l-`Ilal \"Kitāb sirr al-ḫalīqa\"\" (book of Balinas the wise on the Causes) written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. This volume is attributed to \"Balinas\" (or Pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana) In his book, Balinas frames the \"Emerald Tablet\" as ancient Hermetic wisdom. He tells his readers that he discovered the text in a vault below a statue of Hermes in Tyana, and that, inside the vault, an old corpse on a golden throne held the emerald tablet.\nThe laws of hermeticism:\nFollowing Balinas, an early version of the \"Emerald Tablet\" appeared in Kitab Sirr al-Asrar: (\"Book of the Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature\"), itself a composite of earlier works, and in \"Kitab Ustuqus al-Uss al-Thani\" (\"Second Book of the Elements of Foundation\") attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. The \"Smaragdine Tablet\" was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century by Hugo of Santalla. The text is also in an enlarged thirteenth century edition of \"Secretum Secretorum\" (also known as \"Kitab Sirr al-Asrar\").\n\nA translation by Isaac Newton is found among his alchemical papers that are currently housed in King's College Library, Cambridge University.\n\n<poem>Tis true without lying, certain & most true.\nThat which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing\nAnd as all things have been & arose from one by the meditation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.\nThe Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse. \nThe father of all perfection in the whole world is here. \nIts force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.\nSeparate thou the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry. \nIt ascends from the earth to the heaven & again it descends to the earth & receives the force of things superior & inferior.\nBy this means you shall have the glory of the whole world \n& thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.\nIts force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtle thing & penetrates every solid thing.\nSo was the world created.\nFrom this are & do come admirable adaptations whereof the means (or process) is here in this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world\nThat which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished & ended.</poem>\n\nOriginal edition of the Latin text. (\"Chrysogonus Polydorus\", Nuremberg 1541):\n\n<poem>Verum, sine mendacio, certum et verissimum:\nQuod est inferius est sicut quod est superius, et quod est superius est sicut quod est inferius, ad perpetranda miracula rei unius.\nEt sicut res omnes fuerunt ab uno, meditatione unius, sic omnes res natae ab hac una re, adaptatione.\nPater eius est Sol. Mater eius est Luna, portavit illud Ventus in ventre suo, nutrix eius terra est. \nPater omnis telesmi totius mundi est hic.\nVirtus eius integra est si versa fuerit in terram.\nSeparabis terram ab igne, subtile ab spisso, suaviter, magno cum ingenio.\nIdeo fugiet a te omnis obscuritas.\nHaec est totius fortitudinis fortitudo fortis, quia vincet omnem rem subtilem, omnemque solidam penetrabit.\nSic mundus creatus est.\nHinc erunt adaptationes mirabiles, quarum modus est hic. Itaque vocatus sum Hermes Trismegistus, habens tres partes philosophiae totius mundi.\nCompletum est quod dixi de operatione Solis.</poem>\n\nIn its several Western recensions, the \"Tablet\" became a mainstay of medieval and Renaissance alchemy. Commentaries and/or translations were published by, among others, Trithemius, Roger Bacon, Michael Maier, Albertus Magnus, and Isaac Newton. The concise text was a popular summary of alchemical principles, wherein the secrets of the philosopher's stone were thought to have been described.\n\nThe fourteenth century alchemist Ortolanus (or Hortulanus) wrote a substantial exegesis on \"The Secret of Hermes\", which was influential on the subsequent development of alchemy. Many manuscripts of this copy of the \"Emerald Tablet\" and the commentary of Ortolanus survive, dating at least as far back as the fifteenth century. Ortolanus, like Albertus Magnus before him saw the tablet as a cryptic recipe that described laboratory processes using \"deck names\" (or code words). This was the dominant view held by Europeans until the fifteenth century.\n\nBy the early sixteenth century, the writings of Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) marked a shift away from a laboratory interpretation of the \"Emerald Tablet\", to a literal approach. Trithemius equated Hermes' \"one thing\" with the monad of pythagorean philosophy and the anima mundi. This interpretation of the Hermetic text was adopted by alchemists such as John Dee, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Gerhard Dorn.\n\nC.G. Jung identified \"The Emerald Tablet\" with a table made of green stone which he encountered in the first of a set of his dreams and visions beginning at the end of 1912, and climaxing in his writing \"Seven Sermons to the Dead\" in 1916. Historians of science, Eric John Holmyard (1891-1959) and Julius Ruska (1867-1949) also studied the tablet in the twentieth century. Because of its longstanding popularity, the \"Emerald Tablet\" is the only piece of non-Greek Hermetica to attract widespread attention in the West.\n\nIn the television series \"Dark\", the mysterious priest Noah has a large image of the \"Emerald Tablet\" tattooed on his back. The image also appears on a metal door in the caves that are central to the plot. Several characters are shown looking at copies of the text. In addition, the sixth episode of the series is named after a line from the Latin version, \"Sic mundus creatus est.\"\n\nIn 1974, Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor recorded a studio album under the name \"A Tábua de Esmeralda\" (“The Emerald Tablet”), quoting from the Tablet’s text and from alchemy in general in several songs. The album has been defined as an exercise in “musical alchemy” and celebrated as Ben Jor’s greatest musical achievement, blending together samba, jazz and rock rythmes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17043336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17043336", "title": "Freedom of religion in Moldova", "text": "Freedom of religion in Moldova\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice; however, the 1992 Law on Religions, which codifies religious freedoms, contains restrictions that inhibit the activities of unregistered religious groups. Although the law was amended in 2002, many of the restrictions remain in place. The law provides for freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to profess his or her religion in any form. It also protects the confidentiality of the confessional, allows denominations to establish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may not interfere in the religious activities of denominations. The law specifies that \"in order to organize and function\", religious organizations must be registered with the Government, and unregistered groups may not own property, engage employees, or obtain space in public cemeteries in their own names.\n\nThere is no state religion; however, the Metropolis of Chişinău and Moldova receives some favored treatment from the Government. The Metropolitan of Chişinău and Moldova has a diplomatic passport. Other high-ranking Orthodox Church officials also reportedly have diplomatic passports issued by the Government.\n\nThe procedures for registering a religious organization are the same for all groups. In 2002, Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Religions. A religious organization wishing to register must present a declaration of creation, by-laws, and an explanation of its basic religious beliefs to the State Service on Religious Issues. The State Service on Religious Issues enters the religious organization into the Register of Religions within 30 working days. Under the new procedures, at the request of the State Service on Religious Issues, a court can annul the recognition of the religious organization if the organization \"carries out activities that harm the independence, sovereignty, integrity, and security of the Republic of Moldova, the public order, or are connected with political activities.\" The amendments also provide that religious organizations are prohibited from including in their by-laws any provisions that would violate the Constitution or any other laws.\n\nThe Government has recognized and registered 21 religious organizations, many of which are umbrella organizations with sub-entities throughout the country. Although the 2002 amendments to the Law on Religions were intended to simplify the registration process and make the process essentially automatic, the State Service on Religious Issues continues to deny the registration of somegroups, such as the Spiritual Organization of Muslims. Members of this organization repeatedly tried to register with the State Service on Religious Issues and their applications were denied because the State Service claimed their documents were not in order. A number of other organizations have been denied registration or encountered difficulties in connection with their registration applications.\n\nIn 1999, amendments to the Law on Religions legalizing proselytizing went into effect. However, the law explicitly forbids \"abusive proselytizing\", which is defined as an attempt to influence an individual's religious faith through violence or abuse of authority.\n\nIn 2002, a new draft Law on Religions, which contained numerous contentious provisions, was circulated. The draft law originally contained numerous restrictive measures. The draft law has since been revised, and it appears that many of the restrictive articles have been deleted.\n\nIn February 2003, a new Law on Combating Extremism was passed by Parliament and took effect in March 2003. Critics of the law raised concerns that the law could be used to abuse opposition organizations, which could include religious organizations or individuals who may support or have political ties to certain parties. But in practice this law had never been used against any religious organizations.\n\nA new Criminal Code, adopted by Parliament in April 2002 and in effect since June 2003, includes an article which permits punishment for \"preaching religious beliefs or fulfillment of religious rituals, which cause harm to the health of citizens, or other harm to their persons or rights, or instigate citizens not to participate in public life or of the fulfillment of their obligations as citizens.\" Drafters allegedly copied the passage almost word-for-word from the previous code, which was passed in 1961 when the country was part of the Soviet Union. No organization was prosecuted under this new code.\n\nArticle 200 of the Administrative Offenses Code, which was adopted in 1985, prohibits any religious activities of registered or unregistered religions that violate current legislation. The article also allows for the expulsion of foreign citizens who engage in religious activities without the consent of authorities. The Spiritual Organization of Muslims has reported being fined under this provision of law for holding its religious services in a location registered to a charitable organization. The Government charged that their activities are not in line with the stated activities and purposes of the charitable organization.\n\nForeign missionaries are permitted to enter the country for 90 days on a tourist visa. They have no advantages over other foreigners who wish to stay in the country for longer periods.\n\nIn 2000, Parliament amended the Law on Education to make \"moral and spiritual instruction\" mandatory for primary school students and optional for secondary and university students. The program was introduced gradually, beginning in 2001, for first graders, and then in 2002 and 2003 for second and third graders, respectively. In some schools, there is a class specifically on religion, although this course is conditioned on a request and approval by the parents, and the availability of funds to cover the cost of the course. There are a number of theological institutes, seminaries, and other places of religious education in the country.\n\nTwo public schools and a kindergarten are open only to Jewish students, and a kindergarten in Chişinău has a special \"Jewish group\". These schools receive the same funding as other state schools and are supplemented by financial support from the community. However, Jewish students are not restricted to these schools. There are no comparable schools for other religious faiths and no reports of such schools for other religious faiths. Agudath Israel operates a private boys' yeshiva and a girls' yeshiva, both licensed by the Ministry of Education. The total enrollment of both schools is fewer than 100 students. Total enrollment for all Jewish related schools, including those operated by Agudath Israel and public schools, is approximately 300.\n\nThe authorities in Transnistria also impose registration requirements that negatively affect religious groups and have denied registration to some groups. In April, a new draft Law on Religions, which reportedly contained numerous contentious provisions, was brought before the Transnistrian Supreme Soviet. Following strong objections from the Orthodox Bishop of Tiraspol and some legislators, the draft was sent back for revisions. Despite these protests, the objectionable provisions of the draft law are reportedly strongly supported by a number of high-level authorities in Transnistria.\n\nThe Law on Religions contains restrictions that have inhibited the activities of unregistered religious groups, and the Government continued to deny registration to some religious groups.\n\nUnregistered religious organizations are not permitted to buy land or obtain construction permits for churches or seminaries. In some cases, members of unregistered religious groups hold services in homes, nongovernmental organization (NGO) offices, and other locations. In other cases, the groups obtain property and permits in the names of individual members. Individual churches or branches of officially registered religious organizations are not obliged to register with local authorities; however,the local branch must register locally if it wants to make legal transactions as a legal body, including the ability to receive donations in its name.\n\nBetween the two autonomous Eastern Orthodox churches (Moldovan Orthodox Church belonging to the Russian Orthodox Church, and Metropolis of Bessarabia belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church) there is an ongoing politically charged succession dispute, which, from an ecclesiastical point of view, is an administrative only issue (subject to canon laws), not a theological one, the two belonging respectively to two autocephalous Churches (of Russia and of Romania), which are within the Eastern Orthodox communion.\nThus, in 2001, the Government declared the Moldovan Orthodox Church the successor of the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church for purposes of all property ownership. The Metropolis of Bessarabia was reactivated in 1992 (after Moldova declared independence in 1991) when a number of priests broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox Church, and was only officially recognized in 2002, after years of being denied recognition. The dispute was brought in front of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) which ruled in 2004 in favor of the Metropolis of Bessarabia as the \"spiritual, canonical, historical successor of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia which functioned till 1944, including\". In February 2004, the Supreme Court repealed the Government's 2001 decision. In April 2004, in response to an appeal submitted by the Government, the Supreme Court rescinded its February ruling, making the Moldovan Orthodox Church once again the legal successor to the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church. The Metropolis of Bessarabia, which regards itself as the legal and canonical successor to the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church, being endorsed by the ECHR, does not accept this decision. The registration issue has political as well as religious overtones, since it raises the question of whether the Orthodox Church should be oriented toward the Moscow Patriarchate or the Bucharest Patriarchate.\n\nIn May 2002, after a long series of registration denials and legal appeals, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the Government must register the Church of the True Orthodox-Moldova, a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which is based in the United States. The State Service on Religious Issues failed to implement the decision in the stipulated 30 days and subsequently asked the Court for a 2-week extension to register the church. But after 3 weeks, instead of registering the church, the Service filed an extraordinary appeal with the Court of Appeals. The Court reviewed the appeal and declared that the Service was not allowed to file the appeal, since the case was made against the Government, not the Service. Within a couple of weeks another appeal from the Prime Minister was filed. In early 2004, the appeal was sent to the Supreme Court and was under examination at the end of the period covered by this report. The Church had submitted applications for registration in 1997, 1998, and 2000; the Government rejected these applications on various grounds.\n\nThe Mormons have continuously faced bureaucratic obstacles and have not yet obtained registration. They most recently applied for registration in January (2006?), and the State Service on Religious Issues requested further documentation in March. There has been no further action taken on their registration request, and the Mormons did not report any resistance or pressure from state authorities.\n\nThe State Service on Religious Issues has refused registration on numerous occasions to both the Spiritual Organization of Muslims and the Central Muslim Spiritual Board of Moldova (the latter associated with the Central Muslim Spiritual Board of Russia and CIS states). The Spiritual Organization of Muslims has filed a case against the Government for denying it registration with the European Court of Human Rights, and the case is awaiting review. The Central Muslim Spiritual Board of Moldova filed a complaint locally against the State Service on Religious Issues in 2002. The case was heard by the Court of Appeals, which decided in favor of the Muslim group in September 2003 and ordered the Government to register the organization. The Government subsequently appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Court of Appeals for reexamination. On March 15, 2004, the Court of Appeals began reexamining the case.\n\nThe law provides for restitution to politically repressed or exiled persons of property that was confiscated during the successive Nazi and Soviet regimes. In practice this regulation has been extended to religious communities; however, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has been favored over other religious groups. The Church had little difficulty in recovering nearly all of its property and, in cases where property was destroyed, the Government offered alternative compensation. The Church has recovered churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and administrative properties. Property disputes among the Moldovan and Bessarabian Churches have not been resolved. The Jewish community has experienced mixed results in its effort to recover its property; however, by 2004 there were no pending restitution cases for the Jewish community.\n\nThe Transnistrian authorities have developed a new textbook that is to be used at all school levels, which reportedly contains negative and defamatory information regarding the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nAuthorities in Transnistria used registration requirements and other legal mechanisms to restrict the religious freedom of some religious groups. Evangelical religious groups meeting in private homes reportedly have been told that they do not have the correct permits to use their residences as venues for religious services. In the past, they and other non-Orthodox groups generally were not allowed to rent property and often were harassed during religious services.\n\nIn 1997, the authorities in Transnistria announced that they would annul the registration of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The Jehovah's Witnesses in Transnistria were originally registered in 1991, and the church was reregistered by the \"Ministry of Justice\" in 1994 and 1997. However, in 1997 the \"President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults\" sent official letters to public authorities falsely claiming that the activity of the Jehovah's Witnesses was banned and that their registration was annulled. Using the \"President's Commissioner's\" deceptive letter, authorities have repeatedly harassed the Jehovah's Witnesses, including halting the distribution of religious literature and refusing to approve a property request to build a house of worship. In 2001, the Jehovah's Witnesses lodged an official complaint with the \"President\" of Transnistria, and in 2002, they lodged a complaint with the Magistrate in Tiraspol against illegal actions taken by the \"President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults.\" In July 2002, the \"President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults\" sent a letter to various government departments with instructions to consider the Jehovah's Witnesses as illegal until the case brought against them had been finalized. The Jehovah's Witnesses have lodged an official complaint and a counter lawsuit against the \"President's Commissioner for Religions and Cults.\" Following several hearings, the Court has decided to suspend the trial until the liquidation case has been finalized.In December 2003, the Jehovah's Witnesses were informed that the two trials would be combined into one trial that would be heard by a panel of three judges. The case was being heard at the close of the period covered by this report.\n\nThe Baptist community in Transnistria remains unregistered. In previous years, the Baptists in Transnistria complained of increasing harassment from the authorities; however, in 2004 the Baptists reported no direct harassment. In addition authorities did not report threats to destroy the group's church, and the group continued to meet in the same building.\n\nThe Kishinev community a \"Patrimonial Ring\" (\"Родовое Кольцо\") unites adherents of Slavic vernacular religion.\n\nThe Spiritual Organization of Muslims has reported regular harassment by the police. Members say the police often show up at their Friday prayers, which are held at a local Islamic organization's offices, checking participants' documents and taking pictures. On March 5, the police raided their meeting place after Friday prayers, detaining several members and subsequently deporting three Syrian citizens for not having proper legal residence documents. The authorities claimed the religious services were illegal because the organization is not registered, and the place they were meeting was registered to a charity and was not being used for its stated purpose.\n\nIn several cases, members of Jehovah's Witnesses reported being detained and fined for preaching their religion. In the village of Cruzesti, the mayor and residents of the village physically blocked members of Jehovah's Witnesses from the public cemetery for not respecting the customs of the Orthodox religion.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses in Transnistria have reported several incidents of administrative fines and unjust arrests of their members. In all reported cases, the charges have been dropped in appeals at the level of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe generally amicable relations among religions in society contributed to religious freedom. The dispute between the Moldovan and Bessarabian Orthodox Churches is ongoing; however, the adherents of the respective Churches do not interfere with others' freedom to worship.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses from various regions of the country have complained that their ability to practice their religion freely has been impeded by local town councils and Orthodox priests and adherents. They have also reported physical and verbal abuse by local townspeople at the instigation of local Orthodox priests.\n\nThere were a few reports of negative press articles about non-Orthodox religions. The Jehovah's Witnesses have been the target of articles criticizing their beliefs and legitimacy, and the Baptists in Transnistria claim press reports about their religion have been negative.\n\nBetween March 14 and March 30, more than 70 tombstones were desecrated in the Jewish cemetery in Tiraspol. Swastikas and other Nazi symbols were painted on monuments, and many tombstones were damaged beyond repair. On May 4, unknown persons attempted to set the Tiraspol synagogue on fire by throwing a Molotov cocktail onto the premises near a local gas supply. The attack failed when passers-by extinguished the fire. Transnistrian authorities believe the attacks were propagated by the same people and claim they are investigating the incidents.\n\n"}

Lord Caitanya, widely recognized as the incarnation of Krishna, is also known as Gaura, so the year is called \"Gaurabda,\" or \"the year of Lord Caitanya.\"\n\nMost scholars who have analyzed the two traditional Indian calendar systems, both lunar and solar, have concluded that the lunar system is the more ancient. The lunar phases are known to influence agriculture, and according to scriptures like Manu-samhita (The laws of Manu), they also influence more subtle aspects of human life. In the Vaisnava calendar the times for various celebrations are determined by the lunar tithi, sometimes with \"naksatra\" and other elements of the calendar taken into account.\n\nTraditionally the astronomical calculations needed to make a Pancanga were done according to an astronomical text such as Surya Siddhanta. The methods described in Surya Siddhanta are similar to modern astronomical methods for ascertaining the positions of the planets.\n\nThe main difference is that Surya Siddhanta has a simpler model. Such a model enables practical manual calculation. Observatory instruments could be built without high technology and were used regularly to check that manual calculations tallied with observable reality. When a difference appeared after some time, corrections were made to the astronomical constants in the formulas. With this system, fairly good results were obtainable even though the astronomical model was simple. Its accuracy cannot be compared to that obtained by modern methods, but for the creation of calendars and for the pseudoscientific purpose of astrology it sufficed.\n\nCurrently a computer program is used to provide formulas that give an accuracy of 1 minute of arc for the longitude of the sun and 2 minutes of arc for the longitude of the moon. When determining ending times of tithis, these errors can result in a maximum error of 5 minutes of time. The average error is about 3 minutes. Such an error will report an Ekadasi (the eleventh tithi) on the wrong date roughly once every 20 years.\n\nEach month, or \"masa,\" is known by a name of Visnu.\n\nThe months, the Sanskrit names by which they are commonly known in India, and their rough equivalents according to the Gregorian calendar are listed as follows:\n\n\nEkadasi, the eleventh tithi, has special importance. In the scripture Caitanya-caritamrta, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructs Sanatana Goswami regarding the Vaisnava regulative principles (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya-lila 24.342):\n\n\"You should recommend the avoidance of mixed [viddha] Ekadasi and the performance of pure Ekadasi. You should also describe the fault in not observing this. One should be very careful as far as these items are concerned. If one is not careful, one will be negligent in executing devotional service.\"\nAs described in Hari Bhakti Vilasa, viddha (mixed) Ekadasi takes place when the eleventh tithi starts before sunrise but the tenth tithi still presides at the beginning of brahma muhurta (the auspicious period that starts an hour and a half before sunrise).\n\nOn Ekadasi it is traditional to fast. But under certain conditions, called mahadvadasi, one fasts not on the Ekadasi but on the next day, the dvadasi, even though the Ekadasi is suddha,\nor pure, and not viddha, or mixed. There are eight mahadvadasis.\n\nThe calendars produced by this program make it easy to see when to observe Ekadasi. The Ekadasi fast should be observed on the day called suddha (pure) Ekadasi, or alternatively on\nMahadvadasi, even if the previous day is called Ekadasi. All this is clarified by the asterisk (*), which indicates a fast, at the right margin of the printed computer generated calendar.\n\n\"Break fast 05:18 - 09:34\" and \"Daylight-savings not considered\"\n\nTo complete the proper observance of Ekadasi, the next morning one should end the fast after the first time given in the calendar and before the second time. The calendar gives these\ntimes according to the standard time of the place for which the calendar is made.\n\nDuring the summer, many locations do not follow standard time, but instead move their clocks an hour ahead (or sometimes more) to make more use of the hours of daylight.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13913", "title": "Hamas", "text": "Hamas\n\nHamas (Arabic: حماس \"Ḥamās\", an acronym of حركة المقاومة الاسلامية \"Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah\" Islamic Resistance Movement) is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist organization. It has a social service wing, Dawah, and a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. It has been the \"de facto\" governing authority of the Gaza Strip since its takeover of that area in 2007. During this period it fought several wars with Israel. It is regarded, either in whole or in part, as a terrorist organization by several countries and international organizations, most notably by Israel, the United States and the European Union. Russia, China, and Turkey are among countries who do not regard it so.\n\nHamas was founded in 1987, soon after the First Intifada broke out, as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which in its Gaza branch had been non-confrontational towards Israel, refrained from resistance, and was hostile to the PLO. Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987, and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988, that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine, including modern-day Israel, from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The group has stated that it may accept a 10-year truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders and allows Palestinian refugees from 1948, including their descendants, to return to what is now Israel, although clarifying that this does not mean recognition of Israel or the end of the conflict. Hamas's military wing objected to the truce offer. Analysts have said that it seems clear that Hamas knows that many of its conditions for the truce could never be met.\n\nThe military wing of Hamas has launched attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, often describing them as retaliatory, in particular for assassinations of the upper echelon of their leadership. Tactics have included suicide bombings and, since 2001, rocket attacks. Hamas's rocket arsenal, though mainly consisting of short-range homemade Qassam rockets, also includes long-range weapons that have reached major Israeli cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa. The attacks on civilians have been condemned as war crimes and crimes against humanity by human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch. A 2017 Palestinian Center for Public Opinion poll in the Palestinian territories revealed that Hamas violence and rhetoric against Israelis are unpopular and that a majority of Palestinians would rather Hamas \"accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.\"\n\nIn the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, Hamas won a plurality in the Palestinian Parliament, defeating the PLO-affiliated Fatah party. Following the elections, the Quartet (the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union) made future foreign assistance to the PA conditional upon the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected those changes, which led to the Quartet suspending its foreign assistance program and Israel imposing economic sanctions on the Hamas-led administration. In March 2007, a national unity government headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was briefly formed, but this failed to restart international financial assistance. Tensions over control of Palestinian security forces soon erupted in the 2007 Battle of Gaza, after which Hamas took control of Gaza, while its officials were ousted from government positions in the West Bank. Israel and Egypt then imposed an economic blockade of the Gaza Strip, on the grounds that Fatah forces were no longer providing security there. In 2011, Hamas and Fatah announced a reconciliation agreement that provides for creation of a joint caretaker Palestinian government. Progress stalled, until an April 2014 agreement to form a compromise unity government, with elections to be held in late 2014.\n\n\"Hamas\" is an acronym of the Arabic phrase حركة المقاومة الاسلامية or \"Harakat al-Muqāwama al-Islāmiyya\", meaning \"Islamic Resistance Movement\". The Arabic word 'hamas' (حماس) means \"courage\" or \"zeal\". The Hamas covenant interprets its name to mean \"strength and bravery\".\n\nHamas, as its name (Islamic Resistance Movement) implies, aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation by resisting it. And according to Hamas armed branch Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades:\n\nAl-Qassam Brigades aims to liberate all of Palestine from what they describe as Zionist occupation, and to achieve the rights of the Palestinian people that were robbed by the occupation, and it consider itself part of the movement of a project of national liberation.\n\nHamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council. Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (\"dawah\"); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (\"al-Mujahideen al Filastinun\"); (c) a security service (\"Jehaz Aman\"); and (d) a media branch (\"A'alam\"). Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (\"Kuwaidia\") under Khaled Mashal. The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the Gulf States after its leader Mashal broke with Yasser Arafat's decision to side with Saddam Hussein in the Invasion of Kuwait, with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw. On 6 May 2017, Hamas' Shura Council chose Ismail Haniya to become the new leader, to replace Mashal.\n\nThe exact nature of the organization is unclear, secrecy being maintained for fear of Israeli assassinations and to conceal operational activities. Formally, Hamas maintains the wings are separate and independent. Matthew Levitt maintains this is a public myth. Davis argues that they are both separate and combined for reasons of internal and external political necessity. Communication between the political and military wings of Hamas is difficult, owing to the thoroughness of Israeli intelligence surveillance and the existence of an extensive base of informants. After the assassination of Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi the occasional political direction of the militant wing diminished, with field commanders given discretional autonomy on operations.\n\nThe governing body is the Majlis al-Shura. The principle behind the Council is based on the Qur'anic concept of consultation and popular assembly (\"shura\"), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic framework. As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased it needed a broader base for decisions, the Shura Council was renamed the 'General Consultative Council', elected from members of local council groups and this in turn elected a 15-member Politburo (\"al-Maktab al-Siyasi\") that made decisions at the highest level. Representatives come from Gaza, the West Bank, leaders in exile and Israeli prisons. This organ was located in Damascus until the Syrian Civil War led it to transfer to Qatar in January 2012, when Hamas sided with the civil opposition against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nHamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.For them, charity and the development of one's community are prescribed by religion, and, at the same time, are to be understood as forms of resistance. In Islamic tradition \"dawah\" (lit.'the call to God') obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both waqf endowment resources and charitable donations (zakat) to fund grassroots services like nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions. In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services. It has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine. By 2000 it or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005 was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza. Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt. As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions like financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction. A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other.\n\nThe \"dawah\" infrastructure itself was understood, within the Palestinian context, as providing the soil from which a militant opposition to the occupation would flower. In this regard it differs from the rival Palestinian Islamic Jihad which lacks any social welfare network, and relies on spectacular terrorist attacks to recruit adherents. In 2007, through funding from Iran, Hamas managed to allocate at a cost of $60 million, monthly stipends of $100 for 100,000 workers, and a similar sum for 3,000 fishermen laid idle by Israel's imposition of restrictions on fishing offshore, plus grants totalling $45 million to detainees and their families. Matthew Levitt argues that Hamas grants to people are subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of how beneficiaries will support Hamas, with those linked to terrorist activities receiving more than others. Israel holds the families of suicide bombers accountable and bulldozes their homes, whereas the families of Hamas activists who have been killed or wounded during militant operations are given an initial, one-time grant varying between $500–$5,000, together with a $100 monthly allowance. Rent assistance is also given to families whose homes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing though families unaffiliated with Hamas are said to receive less.\n\nUntil 2007, these activities extended to the West Bank, but, after a PLO crackdown, now continue exclusively in the Gaza Strip. After the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état deposed the elected Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohamed Morsi in 2013, Hamas found itself in a financial straitjacket and has since endeavoured to throw the burden of responsibility for public works infrastructure in the Gaza Strip back onto the Palestinian National Authority, but without success.\n\nThe Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing was formed in either mid-1991 or 1992, under the direction of Yahya Ayyash, a Hamas field-commander and bomb-maker assassinated by Israel in 1996. It was constituted from units associated with the earlier \"al-Jihad wa Da'wa\", an umbrella group that had gathered in militants from various Islamic resistance cells like the \"Al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun\" (Palestinian fighters). established by Salah Shehade in 1986.\n\nThe wing takes its name from the prewar militant Palestinian nationalist Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, though Hamas cells sometimes refer to themselves as \"Students of Ayyash\", \"Students of the Engineer\", or \"Yahya Ayyash Units\". At the outset, weapons were hard to come by, and the organization began to resort to intermittent kidnappings of soldiers to secure arms and munitions. This approach had been justified two years earlier when, in the wake of the killing of some 20 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces dispersing protestors at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in 1990, Hamas had declared every Israeli soldier a legitimate target.\nAyyash, with a degree in electrical engineering, quickly improved Hamas's strike capacity by developing IEDs and promoting the tactic of suicide bombings. By the time of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamas's laboratories had devised a primitive form of rocketry, the Qassam 1, which they first launched in October 2000, carrying a 500 gram warhead with a throw range of 4 kilometres. Both propellant and the explosive were manufactured from chemical fertilizers, though TNT was also tried. Over the next five years of the conflict, a 3-kilogram-warhead-armed version with a strike range of 6–8 kilometres, the Qassam 2, was also produced and in an incremental rise, these rocket types were fired towards Israeli settlements along the Gaza Strip: 4 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 155 in 2003, 281 in 2004, and 179 in 2005. By 2005, the Qassam 3 had been engineered with a 12–14 kilometre range and a 15 kilo warhead. By 2006, 942 such rockets were launched into southern Israel. During the War with Israel in 2008–2009, Hamas deployed 122-mm Grad rocketry with a 20–40 kilometre range and a 30 kilogram warhead and a variety of guided Kornet antitank missiles. By 2012 Hamas had engineered a version of the Fajr-5 rocket, which was capable of reaching as far as Tel Aviv, as was shown after the assassination of Ahmed Jabari in that year. In the 2014 war its advanced rocketry reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa. Hamas deployed its increasingly sophisticated rocketry to replace its martyrdom operations.\n\nWhile the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive military style training, including training in Iran and in Syria (before the Syrian Civil War). Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives, forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade. Recruitment training lasts for two years.\n\nThe group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:\n\nTo evoke the spirit of Jihad (Resistance) among Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims; to defend Palestinians and their land against the Zionist occupation and its manifestations; to liberate Palestinians and their land that was usurped by the Zionist occupation forces and settlers.\n\nAccording to its official stipulations, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' military operations are to be restricted to operating only inside Palestine, engaging with Israeli soldiers, and in exercising the right of self-defense against armed settlers. They are to avoid civilian targets, to respect the enemy's humanity by refraining from mutilation, defacement or excessive killing, and to avoid targeting Westerners either in the occupied zones or beyond.\n\nIn practice, Hamas altered its approach restricting actions to 'legitimate military targets' by extended them to Israeli civilians after 7 years. Though between 1996 and 2001 it generally refrained from targeting Israeli civilians, it adopted sporadic suicide bombings in the wake of the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, when an Israeli settler in military fatigues, Baruch Goldstein, shot dead 29 Muslims at prayer in 1993. After the Al Aqsa revolt, the Brigades were behind most of the suicide bombings in Israel, a measure it defended as a form of \"reciprocity\".\n\nDown to 2007, the Brigades are estimated to have lost some 800 operatives in conflicts with Israeli forces. The leadership has been consistently undermined by targeted assassinations. Aside from Yahya Ayyash (5 January 1996), it has lost Emad Akel (24 November 1993) Salah Shehade, (23 July 2002), Ibrahim al-Makadmeh, (8 March 2003) Ismail Abu Shanab, (21 August 2003) Ahmed Yassin (March 22, 2004) and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi,( April 17, 2004).,\n\nAfter Israel arrested hundreds of its members in May 1989, Hamas regionalized its command system to make its operative structure more diffuse, and minimize the chances of being detected. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades groups its fighters in 4–5 man cells, which in turn are integrated into companies and battalions. Unlike the political section, which is split between an internal and external structure, the Brigades are under a local Palestinian leadership, and disobedience with the decisions taken by the political leadership have been relatively rare.\n\nAlthough the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, the exact nature of the relationship is hotly debated. They appear to operate at times independently of Hamas, exercising a certain autonomy. Some cells have independent links with the external leadership, enabling them to bypass the hierarchical command chain and political leadership in Gaza. Ilana Kass and Bard O'Neill, likening Hamas's relationship with the Brigades to the political party Sinn Féin's relationship to the military arm of the Irish Republican Army. quote a senior Hamas official as stating: \"The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade is a separate armed military wing, which has its own leaders who do not take their orders from Hamas and do not tell us of their plans in advance.\" Matthew Levitt on the other hand argues vocally for the idea that Hamas's welfare institutions act as a mere façade or front for the financing of terrorism, and dismisses the idea of two wings as a 'myth'. He cites Sheikh Ahmad Yassin stating in 1998: \"We can not separate the wing from the body. If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. Hamas is one body.\"\n\nAt the 1993 Philadelphia conference, Hamas leaders' statements indicated that they read George H. W. Bush's outline of a New World Order as embodying a tacit aim to destroy Islam, and that therefore funding should focus on enhancing the Islamic roots of Palestinian society and promoting jihad in the occupying territories.\n\nHamas's budget, calculated to be roughly US$70 million (2011), is derived in large part (85%) from foreign, rather than internal Palestinian, sources. Only two Israeli-Palestinian sources figure in a list seized in 2004, while the other contributors were donor bodies located in Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Britain, Germany, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Italy and France. Much of the money raised comes from sources that direct their assistance to what Hamas describes as its charitable work for Palestinians, but investments in support of its ideological position are also relevant, with Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia prominent in the latter. Matthew Levitt states that Hamas also taps money from corporations, criminal organizations and financial networks that support terror, and is believed to engage in cigarette and drug smuggling, multimedia copyright infringement and credit card fraud. Vittori states that, more than other similar organizations, it is particularly careful about keeping resources for its militant, political and public works activities separate. The United States, Israel and the EU have shut down many charities and organs that channel money to Hamas, such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief. Between 1992 and 2001 this group is said to have provided $6.8 million to Palestinian charities of the $57 million collected. By 2001 it was alleged to have given Hamas $13 million, and was shut down shortly afterwards.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's funding came from states in the Persian Gulf down to the mid 2000s. Saudi Arabia supplied half of the Hamas budget of $50 million in the early 2000s, but, under U.S. pressure, began cut its funding by cracking down on Islamic charities and private donor transfers to Hamas in 2004, which by 2006 drastically reduced the flow of money from that area. Iran and Syria, in the aftermath of Hamas's 2006 electoral victory, stepped in to fill the shortfall. Saudi funding, negotiated with third parties like Egypt, remained supportive of Hamas as a Sunni group but chose to provide more assistance to the PNA, the electoral loser, when the EU responded to the outcome by suspending its monetary aid. Iran in the 1980s began by providing 10% of Hamas's funding, which it increased annually until by the 1990s it supplied $30 million. It accounted for $22 million, over a quarter of Hamas's budget, by the late 2000s. According to Matthew Levitt, Iran preferred direct financing to operative groups rather than charities, requiring video proof of attacks. Much of the Iran funding is said to be channeled through Hezbollah.\nAfter 2006 Iran's willingness to take over the burden of the shortfall created by the drying up of Saudi funding also reflected the geopolitical tensions between the two, since, though Shiite, Iran was supporting a Sunni group traditionally closely linked with the Saudi kingdom. The US imposed sanctions on Iran's Bank Saderat, alleging it had funneled hundreds of millions to Hamas. The US has expressed concerns that Hamas obtains funds through Palestinian and Lebanese sympathizers of Arab descent in the Foz do Iguaçu area of the tri-border region of Latin America, an area long associated with arms trading, drug trafficking, contraband, the manufacture of counterfeit goods, money-laundering and currency fraud. The State Department adds that confirmatory information of a Hamas operational presence there is lacking.\n\nAfter 2009, sanctions on Iran made funding difficult, forcing Hamas to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Funds amounting to tens of millions of dollars raised in the Gulf states were transferred through the Rafah Border Crossing. These were not sufficient to cover the costs of governing the Strip and running the al Qassam Brigades, and when tensions arose with Iran over support of President Assad in Syria, Iran dropped its financial assistance to the government, restricting its funding to the military wing, which meant a drop from $150 million in 2012 to $60 million the following year. A further drop occurred in 2015 when Hamas expressed its criticisms of Iran's role in the Yemeni Civil War.\n\nHamas rose as an offshoot of the Gaza Mujama al-Islamiya branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which had been actively encouraged by Israel to expand as a counterweight to the influence of the secular Palestine Liberation Organization and had since 1973 been quiescent and non-confrontational towards Israel. Aside from developing Islamic charities to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians, it emphasized social justice (\"adala\") and the subordination of the world to the sovereignty of God (\"hakmiyya\").\nHamas was founded in 1987, soon after the outbreak of the First Intifada, the first popular uprising against the Israeli occupation.\nCreating Hamas to participate in the revolt was regarded as a survival measure to enable the Brotherhood itself, which refused to fight against Israel, to hold its own against other competing Palestinian nationalist groups. By forming a military wing distinct from its social charity organizations, it was hoped that the latter would be insulated from being targeted by Israel.\nCo-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin was convinced that Israel was endeavouring to destroy Islam, and concluded that loyal Muslims had a religious obligation to destroy Israel. The short term goal of Hamas was to liberate Palestine, including modern-day Israel, from Israeli occupation. The long-term aim sought to establish an Islamic state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe foundational document, the Hamas Charter (\"mīthāq ḥarakat\"), is dated 18 August 1988, and contains both antisemitic passages, characterizations of Israeli society as Nazi-like in its cruelty, and irredentist claims that have never been revoked despite what some observers say are later policy changes in the organization regarding Israel and the Jews. It declares all of Palestine waqf property endowed by God to Muslims, with religious coexistence under Islam's wing. The charter rejects a two-state solution, envisaging no peaceful settlement of the conflict apart from jihad. It states that the movement's aim is to\n\nraise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine, for under the wing of Islam followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety where their lives, possessions and rights are concerned' (Article 6)\n\nand adds that, 'when our enemies usurp some Islamic lands, jihad becomes a duty binding on all Muslims, for which the whole of the land is non-negotiable, a position likened, without the racist sentiments present in the Hamas charter, to that in the Likud party platform and in movements like Gush Emunim. For Hamas, to concede territory is seen as equivalent to renouncing Islam itself.\n\nDecades down the line, Hamas's official position changed with regard to a two-state solution. Khaled Mashaal, its leader, has publicly affirmed the movement's readiness to accept such a division. When Hamas won a majority in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Haniyeh, then president-elect, sent messages to both George Bush and Israel's leaders asking to be recognized and offering a long-term truce (hudna), along the 1967 border lines. No response was forthcoming.\n\nMousa Marzook said in 2007 that the charter could not be altered because it would look like a compromise not acceptable to the 'street' and risk fracturing the party's unity. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal has stated that the Charter is \"a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons\".Ahmed Yousef, senior adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, added in 2011 that it reflected the views of the Elders in the face of a 'relentless occupation.' The details of its religious and political language had not been examined within the framework of international law, and an internal committee review to amend it was shelved out of concern not to offer concessions to Israel, as had Fatah, on a silver platter. While Hamas representatives recognize the problem, one official notes that Arafat got very little in return for changing the PLO Charter under the Oslo Accords, and that there is agreement that little is gained from a non-violent approach. Richard Davis says the dismissal by contemporary leaders of its relevance and yet the suspension of a desire to rewrite it reflects the differing constituencies Hamas must address, the domestic audience and international relations. The charter itself is considered an 'historical relic.'\n\nIn March 2006, Hamas released its official legislative program. The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading \"Recognition of Israel,\" it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): \"The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.\" This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter. A few months later, via University of Maryland's Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to U.S. President George W. Bush stating they \"don't mind having a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders\", and asked for direct negotiations: \"Segal emphasized that a state within the 1967 borders and a truce for many years could be considered Hamas's \"de facto\" recognition of Israel.\"\n\nIn an April 2008 meeting between Hamas leader Khaled Mashal and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, an understanding was reached in which Hamas agreed it would respect the creation of a Palestinian state in the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, provided this were ratified by the Palestinian people in a referendum. Hamas later publicly offered a long-term truce with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and grant the \"right of return\" to all Palestinian refugees. In November 2008, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh re-stated that Hamas was willing to accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, and offered Israel a long-term truce \"if Israel recognized the Palestinians' national rights\". In 2009, in a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Haniyeh repeated his group's support for a two-state settlement based on 1967 borders: \"We would never thwart efforts to create an independent Palestinian state with borders [from] June 4, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital.\" On December 1, 2010, Ismail Haniyeh again repeated, \"We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees,\" and \"Hamas will respect the results [of a referendum] regardless of whether it differs with its ideology and principles.\"\n\nIn February 2012, according to the Palestinian authority, Hamas forswore the use of violence. Evidence for this was provided by an eruption of violence from Islamic Jihad in March 2012 after an Israeli assassination of a Jihad leader, during which Hamas refrained from attacking Israel. \"Israel –– despite its mantra that because Hamas is sovereign in Gaza it is responsible for what goes on there – almost seems to understand,\" wrote Israeli journalists Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, \"and has not bombed Hamas offices or installations\".\n\nIsrael has rejected some truce offers by Hamas because it contends the group uses them to prepare for more fighting rather than peace. \"The Atlantic\" magazine columnist Jeffrey Goldberg, along with other analysts, believes Hamas may be incapable of permanent reconciliation with Israel. Mkhaimer Abusada, a political scientist at Al Azhar University, writes that Hamas talks \"of hudna [temporary ceasefire], not of peace or reconciliation with Israel. They believe over time they will be strong enough to liberate all historic Palestine.\"\n\nHamas carried out its first attack against Israel in 1989, abducting and killing two soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces immediately arrested Yassin and sentenced him to life in prison, and deported 400 Hamas activists, including Zahar, to South Lebanon, which at the time was occupied by Israel. During this time Hamas built a relationship with Hezbollah.\nHamas's military branch, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was created in 1991. During the 1990s the al-Qassam Brigades conducted numerous attacks on Israel, with both civilian and military victims. In April 1993, suicide bombings in the West Bank began. After the February 1994 massacre by Baruch Goldstein of 30 Muslim civilians in a Hebron mosque, the al-Qassam Brigades began suicide attacks inside Israel.\n\nIn December 1992 Israel responded to the killing of a border police officer by deporting 415 leading figures of Hamas and Islamic Jihad to Lebanon, which provoked international condemnation and a unanimous UN Security Council resolution condemning the action. Although the suicide attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades and other groups violated the 1993 Oslo accords (which Hamas opposed), Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat was reluctant to pursue the attackers and may have had inadequate means to do so. Some analysts state that the Palestinian Authority could have stopped the suicide and other attacks on civilians but refused to do so. According to the Congressional Research Service, Hamas admitted to having executed Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities in the 1990s. A transcript of a training film by the al-Qassam Brigades tells how Hamas operatives kidnapped Palestinians accused of collaboration and then forced confessions before executing them. In 1996, Yahya Ayash, the chief bombmaker of Hamas and the leader of the West Bank battalion of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was assassinated by the Israeli secret service.\n\nIn September 1997, Israeli agents in Jordan attempted but failed to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashal, leading to chilled relations between the two countries and release of Sheikh Yassin, Hamas's spiritual leader, from Israeli prison. Two years later Hamas was banned in Jordan, reportedly in part at the request of the United States, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. Jordan's King Abdullah feared the activities of Hamas and its Jordanian allies would jeopardize peace negotiations with Israel, and accused Hamas of engaging in illegitimate activities within Jordan. In mid-September 1999, authorities arrested Hamas leaders Khaled Mashal and Ibrahim Ghosheh on their return from a visit to Iran, and charged them with being members of an illegal organization, storing weapons, conducting military exercises, and using Jordan as a training base. Hamas leaders denied the charges. Mashal was exiled and eventually settled in Syria. He fled to Qatar in 2012 as a result of the Syrian civil war.\n\nAl-Qassam Brigades militants were among the armed groups that launched both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during the Second Intifada (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada (, \"Intifāat El Aqa\"; , \"Intifādat El-Aqtzah\"), which began in late September 2000. This Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories was much more violent than the First Intifada. The military and civilian death toll is estimated at 5500 Palestinians and more than 1100 Israelis, as well as 64 foreigners. A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during the second intifada (September 2000 through August 2005) found that about 40 percent were carried out by the al-Qassam Brigades.\n\nThe immediate trigger for the uprising is disputed, but a more general cause, writes U.S. political science professor Jeremy Pressman, was \"popular Palestinian discontent [that] grew during the Oslo peace process because the reality on the ground did not match the expectations created by the peace agreements\". Hamas would be the beneficiary of this growing discontent in the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections.\n\nIn January 2004, Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said that the group would end armed resistance against Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and east Jerusalem, and that restoring Palestinians' \"historical rights\" (relating to the 1948 Palestinian exodus) \"would be left for future generations\". On January 25, 2004, senior Hamas official Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi offered a 10-year truce, or \"hudna\", in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the complete withdrawal by Israel from the territories captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Al-Rantissi stated that Hamas had come to the conclusion that it was \"difficult to liberate all our land at this stage, so we accept a phased liberation\". Israel immediately dismissed al-Rantissi's statements as insincere and a smokescreen for military preparations. Yassin was assassinated on March 22, 2004, by a targeted Israeli air strike, and al-Rantisi was assassinated by a similar air strike on April 18, 2004.\n\nWhile Hamas boycotted the 2005 Palestinian presidential election, it did participate in the 2005 municipal elections organized by Yasser Arafat in the occupied territories. In those elections it won control of over one third of Palestinian municipal councils, besting Fatah, which had for long been the biggest force in Palestinian politics. In its election manifesto for the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Hamas omitted a call for an end to Israel, though it did still call for armed struggle against the occupation. Hamas won the 2006 elections, winning 76 of the 132 seats to Fatah's 43. Seen by many as primarily a rejection of the Fatah government's corruption and ineffectiveness, the Hamas victory seemingly had brought to an end 40 years of PLO domination of Palestinian politics.\n\nFollowing its electoral victory, Hamas assumed the administration of the Gaza strip and introduced radical changes. Writing in Foreign Affairs, Daniel Byman stated that\nAfter it took over the Gaza Strip Hamas revamped the police and security forces, cutting them 50,000 members (on paper, at least) under Fatah to smaller, efficient forces of just over 10,000, which then cracked down on crime and gangs. No longer did groups openly carry weapons or steal with impunity. People paid their taxes and electric bills, and in return authorities picked up garbage and put criminals in jail. Gaza-neglected under Egyptian and then Israeli control, and misgoverned by Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his successors-finally has a real government.' \n\nIn early February 2006, Hamas offered Israel a 10-year truce \"in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories: the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem,\" and recognition of Palestinian rights including the \"right of return\". Mashal added that Hamas was not calling for a final end to armed operations against Israel, and it would not impede other Palestinian groups from carrying out such operations. After the election, the Quartet on the Middle East (the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU), and the United Nations) stated that assistance to the Palestinian Authority would only continue if Hamas renounced violence, recognized Israel, and accepted previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements, which Hamas refused to do. The Quartet then imposed a freeze on all international aid to the Palestinian territories. In 2006 after the Gaza election, Hamas leader sent a letter addressed to George W. Bush where he among other things declared that Hamas would accept a state on the 1967 borders including a truce. However, the Bush administration did not reply.\n\nStress the separation between the three powers, the legislative, executive and judicial; activate the role of the Constitutional Court; re-form the Judicial Supreme Council and choose its members by elections and on the basis of qualifications rather than partisan, personal, and social considerations ... ; enact the necessary laws that guarantee the neutrality of general prosecutor ... [and] laws that will stop any transgression by the executive power on the constitution.\n\n\"Achieve equality before the law among citizens in rights and duties; bring security to all citizens and protect their properties and assure their safety against arbitrary arrest, torture, or revenge; stress the culture of dialogue ... ; support the press and media institutions and maintain the right of journalists to access and to publish information; maintain freedom and independence of professional syndicates and preserve the rights of their membership\".\n\nAfter the formation of the Hamas-led cabinet on March 20, 2006, tensions between Fatah and Hamas militants progressively rose in the Gaza strip as Fatah commanders refused to take orders from the government while the Palestinian Authority initiated a campaign of demonstrations, assassinations and abductions against Hamas, which led to Hamas responding. Israeli intelligence warned Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas had planned to kill him at his office in Gaza. According to a Palestinian source close to Abbas, Hamas considers president Abbas to be a barrier to its complete control over the Palestinian Authority and decided to kill him. In a statement to Al Jazeera, Hamas leader Mohammed Nazzal, accused Abbas of being party to besieging and isolating the Hamas-led government.\n\nOn June 9, 2006, during an Israeli artillery operation, an explosion occurred on a busy Gaza beach, killing eight Palestinian civilians. It was assumed that Israeli shellings were responsible for the killings, but Israeli government officials denied this. Hamas formally withdrew from its 16-month ceasefire on June 10, taking responsibility for the subsequent Qassam rocket attacks launched from Gaza into Israel.\n\nOn June 25, two Israeli soldiers were killed and another, Gilad Shalit, captured following an incursion by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Popular Resistance Committees and Army of Islam. In response, the Israeli military launched Operation Summer Rains three days later, to secure the release of the kidnapped soldier, arresting 64 Hamas officials. Among them were 8 Palestinian Authority cabinet ministers and up to 20 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, The arrests, along with other events, effectively prevented the Hamas-dominated legislature from functioning during most of its term. Shalit was held captive until 2011, when he was released in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. Since then, Hamas has continued building a network of internal and cross-border tunnels, which are used to store and deploy weapons, shield militants, and facilitate cross-border attacks. Destroying the tunnels was a primary objective of Israeli forces in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.\n\nIn February 2007 Saudi-sponsored negotiations in Mecca produced agreement on a signed by Mahmoud Abbas on behalf of Fatah and Khaled Mashal on behalf of Hamas. The new government was called on to achieve Palestinian national goals as approved by the Palestine National Council, the clauses of the Basic Law and the National Reconciliation Document (the \"Prisoners' Document\") as well as the decisions of the Arab summit.\n\nIn March 2007, the Palestinian Legislative Council established a national unity government, with 83 representatives voting in favor and three against. Government ministers were sworn in by Mahmoud Abbas, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, at a ceremony held simultaneously in Gaza and Ramallah. In June that year, renewed fighting broke out between Hamas and Fatah. In the course of the June 2007 Battle of Gaza, Hamas exploited the near total collapse of Palestinian Authority forces in Gaza, to seize control of Gaza, ousting Fatah officials. President Mahmoud Abbas then dismissed the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government. and outlawed the Hamas militia. At least 600 Palestinians died in fighting between Hamas and Fatah. Human Rights Watch, a U.S.-based group, accused both sides in the conflict of torture and war crimes.\n\nHuman Rights Watch estimates several hundred Gazans were \"maimed\" and tortured in the aftermath of the Gaza War. 73 Gazan men accused of \"collaborating\" had their arms and legs broken by \"unidentified perpetrators\" and 18 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, who had escaped from Gaza's main prison compound after Israel bombed the facility, were executed by Hamas security officials in the first days of the conflict. Hamas security forces attacked hundreds Fatah officials who supported Israel. Human Rights Watch interviewed one such person:\n\nIn March 2012 Mahmoud Abbas stated that there were no political differences between Hamas and Fatah as they had reached agreement on a joint political platform and on a truce with Israel. Commenting on relations with Hamas, Abbas revealed in an interview with Al Jazeera that \"We agreed that the period of calm would be not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in the West Bank,\" adding that \"We also agreed on a peaceful popular resistance [against Israel], the establishment of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders and that the peace talks would continue if Israel halted settlement construction and accepted our conditions.\" Progress has stalled, until an April 2014 agreement to form a compromise unity government, with elections to be held in late 2014.\n\nOn June 17, 2008, Egyptian mediators announced that an informal truce had been agreed to between Hamas and Israel. Hamas agreed to cease rocket attacks on Israel, while Israel agreed to allow limited commercial shipping across its border with Gaza, barring any breakdown of the tentative peace deal; Hamas also hinted that it would discuss the release of Gilad Shalit. Israeli sources state that Hamas also committed itself to enforce the ceasefire on the other Palestinian organizations. Even before the truce was agreed to, some on the Israeli side were not optimistic about it, Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin stating in May 2008 that a ground incursion into Gaza was unavoidable and would more effectively quell arms smuggling and pressure Hamas into relinquishing power.\n\nWhile Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire, the lull was sporadically violated by other groups, sometimes in defiance of Hamas. For example, on June 24 Islamic Jihad launched rockets at the Israeli town of Sderot; Israel called the attack a grave violation of the informal truce, and closed its border crossings with Gaza. On November 4, 2008, Israeli forces, in an attempt to stop construction of a tunnel, killed six Hamas gunmen in a raid inside the Gaza Strip. Hamas responded by resuming rocket attacks, a total of 190 rockets in November according to Israel's military.\n\nWith the six-month truce officially expired on December 19, Hamas launched 50 to more than 70 rockets and mortars into Israel over the next three days, though no Israelis were injured. On December 21, Hamas said it was ready to stop the attacks and renew the truce if Israel stopped its \"aggression\" in Gaza and opened up its border crossings.\n\nOn December 27 and 28, Israel implemented Operation Cast Lead against Hamas. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said \"We warned Hamas repeatedly that rejecting the truce would push Israel to aggression against Gaza.\" According to Palestinian officials, over 280 people were killed and 600 were injured in the first two days of airstrikes. Most were Hamas police and security officers, though many civilians also died. According to Israel, militant training camps, rocket-manufacturing facilities and weapons warehouses that had been pre-identified were hit, and later they attacked rocket and mortar squads who fired around 180 rockets and mortars at Israeli communities. Chief of Gaza police force Tawfiq Jabber, head of the General Security Service Salah Abu Shrakh, senior religious authority and security officer Nizar Rayyan, and Interior Minister Said Seyam were among those killed during the fighting. Although Israel sent out thousands of cell-phone messages urging residents of Gaza to leave houses where weapons may be stored, in an attempt to minimise civilian casualties, some residents complained there was nowhere to go because many neighborhoods had received the same message. Israeli bombs landed close to civilian structures such as schools, and some alleged that Israel was deliberately targeting Palestinian civilians.\n\nIsrael declared a unilateral ceasefire on January 17, 2009. Hamas responded the following day by announcing a one-week ceasefire to give Israel time to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip. Israeli, Palestinian, and third-party sources disagreed on the total casualty figures from the Gaza war, and the number of Palestinian casualties who were civilians. In November 2010, a senior Hamas official acknowledged that up to 300 fighters were killed and \"In addition to them, between 200 and 300 fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades and another 150 security forces were martyred.\" These new numbers reconcile the total with those of the Israeli military, which originally said were 709 \"terror operatives\" killed.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, Hamas leader Khaled Mashal stated that the organization is ready to open dialogue with the Obama administration because its policies are much better than those of former U.S. president George W. Bush: \"As long as there's a new language, we welcome it, but we want to see not only a change of language, but also a change of policies on the ground. We have said that we are prepared to cooperate with the US or any other international party that would enable the Palestinians to get rid of occupation.\" Despite this, an August 30, 2009 speech during a visit to Jordan in which Mashal expressed support for the Palestinian right of return was interpreted by David Pollock of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy as a sign that \"Hamas has now clearly opted out of diplomacy.\" In an interview in May 2010, Mashal said that if a Palestinian state with real sovereignty was established under the conditions he set out, on the borders of 1967 with its capital Jerusalem and with the right of return, that will be the end of the Palestinian resistance, and then the nature of any subsequent ties with Israel would be decided democratically by the Palestinians. In July 2009, Khaled Mashal, Hamas's political bureau chief, stated Hamas's willingness to cooperate with a resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which included a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, provided that Palestinian refugees be given the right to return to Israel and that East Jerusalem be recognized as the new state's capital.\n\nIn 2011, after the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, Hamas distanced itself from the Syrian regime and its members began leaving Syria. Where once there were \"hundreds of exiled Palestinian officials and their relatives\", that number shrunk to \"a few dozen\". In 2012, Hamas publicly announced its support for the Syrian opposition. This prompted Syrian state TV to issue a \"withering attack\" on the Hamas leadership. Khaled Mashal said that Hamas had been \"forced out\" of Damascus because of its disagreements with the Syrian regime. In late October, Syrian Army soldiers shot dead two Hamas leaders in Daraa refugee camp. On November 5, 2012, the Syrian state security forces shut down all Hamas offices in the country. In January 2013, another two Hamas members were found dead in Syria's Husseinieh camp. Activists said the two had been arrested and executed by state security forces. In 2013, it was reported that the military wing of Hamas had begun training units of the Free Syrian Army. In 2013, after \"several intense weeks of indirect three-way diplomacy between representatives of Hamas, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority\", no agreement was reached. Also, intra-Palestinian reconciliation talks stalled and, as a result, during Obama's visit to Israel, Hamas launched five rocket strikes on Israel. In November, Isra Almodallal was appointed the first spokeswoman of the group.\n\nOn 8 July 2014 Israel launched Operation Protective Edge to counter increased Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. The conflict ended with a permanent cease-fire after 7 weeks, and more than 2,200 dead. 64 of the dead were Israeli soldiers, 7 were civilians in Israel (from rocket attacks), and 2,101 were killed in Gaza, of which according to UN OCHA at least 1,460 were civilians. Israel says 1,000 of the dead were militants. Following the conflict, Mahmoud Abbas president of the Palestinian Authority, accused Hamas of needlessly extending the fighting in the Gaza Strip, contributing to the high death toll, of running a \"shadow government\" in Gaza, and of illegally executing scores of Palestinians. Hamas has complained about the slow delivery of reconstruction materials after the conflict and announced that they were diverting these materials from civilian uses to build more infiltration tunnels.\n\nIn 2016, Hamas began security co-ordination with Egypt to crack down on Islamic terrorist organizations in Sinai, in return for economic aid.\n\nIn May 2017, Hamas unveiled its new charter, in an attempt to moderate its image. The charter no longer calls for Israel's destruction, but still calls for liberation of Palestine and to 'confront the Zionist project'. It also confirms acceptance of the 1967 borders as the basis for establishing a Palestinian state as well as not being an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn October 2017, Fatah and Hamas signed yet another reconciliation agreement. The partial agreement addresses civil and administrative matters involving Gaza and the West Bank. Other contentious issues such as national elections, reform of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and possible demilitarization of Hamas were to be discussed in the next meeting in November 2017, due to a new step-by-step approach.\n\nIn 2005, Hamas announced its intention to launch an experimental TV channel, Al-Aqsa TV. The station was launched on January 7, 2006, less than three weeks before the Palestinian legislative elections. It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver anti-semitic messages. Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,\" and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views. Hamas produced several propaganda songs aimed to scare Israeli citizen including Shock Israel's Security and \"Go, call a Gazan to rip Giv'ati\".\n\n\"Al-Fateh\" (\"the conqueror\") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for \"the young builders of the future\".\n\nAccording to MEMRI (three of whose seven founding staff had formerly served in the IDF), the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as \"murderers of the prophets\" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled \"The Story of a Martyr\" presents the \"heroic deeds\" of a mujahid from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh (\"The Conqueror\") – a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar – as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.\n\nAl-Aqsa TV is a television channel founded by Hamas. The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006. Its programming includes ideologically tinged children's shows, news talk, and religiously inspired entertainment. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the station promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis. Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,\" and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views. Al-Aqsa TV is headed by Fathi Ahmad Hammad, chairman of al-Ribat Communications and Artistic Productions – a Hamas-run company that also produces Hamas's radio station, \"Voice of al-Aqsa\", and its biweekly newspaper, \"The Message\".\n\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted, while defining that role as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing. This is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change.\n\nIn 1989, during the First Intifada, a small number of Hamas followers campaigned for the wearing of the hijab, which is not a part of traditional women's attire in Palestine, for polygamy, and also insisted women stay at home and be segregated from men. In the course of this campaign, women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn 'just to avoid problems on the streets'. The harassment dropped drastically when, after 18 months UNLU condemned it, though similar campaigns reoccurred.\n\nSince Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, some of its members have attempted to impose Islamic dress or the hijab head covering on women. Also, the government's \"Islamic Endowment Ministry\" has deployed Virtue Committee members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress, card playing, and dating. However, there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards, and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students. There has also been successful resistance to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women.\n\nHamas officials deny having any plans to impose Islamic law, one legislator stating that \"What you are seeing are incidents, not policy,\" and that Islamic law is the desired standard \"but we believe in persuasion\". The Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students. When the BBC in 2010 interviewed five \"middle-class\" women in Gaza City, the subjects generally indicated Hamas attempts to enforce conservative religious standards of dress had been largely rejected by the local population, with some expressing concern that the closure of Gaza would allow the proliferation of extremist enforcement attempts by low-level Hamas officials, and others indicating they were happy to see Hamas enforcing such requirements. They also cited examples of leniency by Hamas authorities, such as allowing widowed women to keep custody of their children so long as they did not remarry, and other relaxations in the enforcement of Shariah law. One woman noted that the environment was \"not as bad\" as during the First Intifada, when women were subject to public criticism and stonings for failure to obey conservative Islamic standards of dress. One woman complained that women were not free to speak their minds or travel alone, and added: \"Hamas want to force themselves onto the people. They want the people to submit to them, this is their cover. They destroyed the reputation of Islam, by saying we're doing this because it is religion. This is how they won the elections.\"\n\nIn 2013, UNRWA canceled its annual marathon in Gaza after Hamas rulers prohibited women from participating in the race.\n\nIn 2005, the human rights organization Freemuse released a report titled \"Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music\", which said that Palestinian musicians feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005.\n\nThe attempt by Hamas to dictate a cultural code of conduct in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a violent fighting between different Palestinian sectors. Hamas members reportedly burned down stores that stocked videos they deemed indecent and destroyed books they described as \"heretical\".\n\nIn 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in Qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the Hamas led municipality, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by Islam, or \"Haram\". The municipality also ordered that music no longer be played in the Qalqiliya zoo, and mufti Akrameh Sabri issued a religious edict affirming the municipality decision. In response, the Palestinian national poet Mahmoud Darwish warned that \"There are Taliban-type elements in our society, and this is a very dangerous sign.\"\n\nThe Palestinian columnist Mohammed Abd Al-Hamid, a resident of Ramallah, wrote that this religious coercion could cause the migration of artists, and said \"The religious fanatics in Algeria destroyed every cultural symbol, shattered statues and rare works of art and liquidated intellectuals and artists, reporters and authors, ballet dancers and singers – are we going to imitate the Algerian and Afghani examples?\"\n\nSome Hamas members stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of Tayyip Erdoğan. The foremost members to distance Hamas from the practices of Taliban and to publicly support the Erdoğan model were Ahmad Yousef and Ghazi Hamad, advisers to Prime Minister Hanieh. Yusuf, the Hamas deputy foreign minister, reflected this goal in an interview to a Turkish newspaper, stating that while foreign public opinion equates Hamas with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, the analogy is inaccurate. Yusuf described the Taliban as \"opposed to everything,\" including education and women's rights, while Hamas wants to establish good relations between the religious and secular elements of society and strives for human rights, democracy and an open society. According to professor Yezid Sayigh of the King's College in London, how influential this view is within Hamas is uncertain, since both Ahmad Yousef and Ghazi Hamad were dismissed from their posts as advisers to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Hanieh in October 2007. Both have since been appointed to other prominent positions within the Hamas government. Khaled al-Hroub of the West Bank-based and anti-Hamas Palestinian daily Al Ayyam added that despite claims by Hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the Turkish model of Islam, \"what is happening on the ground in reality is a replica of the Taliban model of Islam.\"\n\nAccording to academic Esther Webman, antisemitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology, although antisemitic rhetoric is frequent and intense in Hamas leaflets. The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and interviews with its leaders, attempts at this differentiation have been made. In 2009 representatives of the small Jewish sect Neturei Karta met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, who stated that he held nothing against Jews but only against the state of Israel. Some commentators have pointed out parallels between Hamas's youth organization and Hitler Youth. According to writer Tom Doran, Hamas is not recognized as a neo-Nazi group because its members are not \"white Christians\".\n\nHamas has made conflicting statements about its readiness to recognize Israel. In 2006 a spokesman signaled readiness to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders. Speaking of requests for Hamas to recognize agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, senior Hamas member Khaled Suleiman said that \"these agreements are a reality which we view as such, and therefore I see no problem.\" Also in 2006, a Hamas official ruled out recognition of Israel with reference to West and East Germany, which never recognized each other.\n\n\nThe Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree (evidently a certain kind of tree), would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.\n\nYou may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars. They were behind World War I, when they were able to destroy the Islamic Caliphate, making financial gains and controlling resources. They obtained the Balfour Declaration, formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state. It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them. There is no war going on anywhere, without having their finger in it.\n\n\nToday it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.\n\nIn 2008, Imam Yousif al-Zahar of Hamas said in his sermon at the \"Katib Wilayat\" mosque in Gaza that \"Jews are a people who cannot be trusted. They have been traitors to all agreements. Go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.\"\n\nAnother Hamas legislator and imam, Sheik Yunus al-Astal, discussed a Koranic verse suggesting that \"suffering by fire is the Jews' destiny in this world and the next.\" He concluded \"Therefore we are sure that the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews.\"\n\nFollowing the rededication of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem in March 2010, senior Hamas figure al-Zahar called on Palestinians everywhere to observe five minutes of silence \"for Israel's disappearance and to identify with Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa mosque\". He further stated that \"Wherever you have been you've been sent to your destruction. You've killed and murdered your prophets and you have always dealt in loan-sharking and destruction. You've made a deal with the devil and with destruction itself – just like your synagogue.\"\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Ahmad Bahr, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas Parliament, stated in a sermon that aired on \"Al-Aqsa TV\":\n\nIf the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female. A woman may set out [on Jihad] without her husband's permission, and a servant without his master's permission. Why? In order to annihilate those Jews. ... O Allah, destroy the Jews and their supporters. O Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. O Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one.\n\nIn an interview with Al-Aqsa TV on September 12, 2012, Marwan Abu Ras, a Hamas MP, who is also a member of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, stated (as translated by MEMRI):\n\nOn December 26, 2012, Senior Hamas official and Jerusalem bureau chief Ahmed Abu Haliba, called on \"all Palestinian factions to resume suicide attacks ... deep inside the Zionist enemy\" and said that \"we must renew the resistance to occupation in any possible way, above all through armed resistance.\" Abu Haliba suggested the use of suicide bombings as a response to Israel's plans to build housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n\nIn an interview on Lebanese television on July 28, 2014, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan repeated the blood libel myth:\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" on July 27, 2014, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal stated:\n\nOn January 8, 2012, during a visit to Tunis, Gazan Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh told The Associated Press on that he disagrees with the anti-Semitic slogans. \"We are not against the Jews because they are Jews. Our problem is with those occupying the land of Palestine,\" he said. \"There are Jews all over the world, but Hamas does not target them.\" In response to a statement by Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas preferred non-violent means and had agreed to adopt \"peaceful resistance,\" Hamas contradicted Abbas. According to Hamas spokesman Sami Abu-Zuhri, \"We had agreed to give popular resistance precedence in the West Bank, but this does not come at the expense of armed resistance.\"\n\nIn May 2009, senior Hamas MP Sayed Abu Musameh said, \"in our culture, we respect every foreigner, especially Jews and Christians, but we are against Zionists, not as nationalists but as fascists and racists.\" In the same interview, he also said, \"I hate all kinds of weapons. I dream of seeing every weapon from the atomic bomb to small guns banned everywhere.\" In January 2009, Gazan Hamas Health Minister Basim Naim published a letter in \"The Guardian\", stating that Hamas has no quarrel with Jewish people, only with the actions of Israel. In October 1994, in a response to Isreael's crackdown on Hamas militants following a suicide bombing on a Tel Aviv bus, Hamas promised retaliation: \"Rabin must know that Hamas loves death more than Rabin and his soldiers love life.\"\n\nHamas has been explicit in its Holocaust denial. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on the Jewish Holocaust, held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release that it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:\n\nThis conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests.\n\nIn August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper \"Al-Risala\" that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.\n\nIn 2005, Khaled Mashal called Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's December 14, 2005 statements on the Holocaust that Europeans had \"created a myth in the name of Holocaust\") as \"courageous\". Later in 2008, Basim Naim, the minister of health in the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in Gaza countered holocaust denial, and said \"it should be made clear that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian government in Gaza denies the Nazi Holocaust. The Holocaust was not only a crime against humanity but one of the most abhorrent crimes in modern history. We condemn it as we condemn every abuse of humanity and all forms of discrimination on the basis of religion, race, gender or nationality.\"\n\nIn an open letter to Gaza Strip UNRWA chief John Ging published August 20, 2009, the movement's Popular Committees for Refugees called the Holocaust \"a lie invented by the Zionists,\" adding that the group refused to let Gazan children study it. Hamas leader Younis al-Astal continued by saying that having the Holocaust included in the UNRWA curriculum for Gaza students amounted to \"marketing a lie and spreading it\". Al-Astal continued \"I do not exaggerate when I say this issue is a war crime, because of how it serves the Zionist colonizers and deals with their hypocrisy and lies.\"\n\nIn February 2011, Hamas voiced opposition to UNRWA's teaching of the Holocaust in Gaza. According to Hamas, \"Holocaust studies in refugee camps is a contemptible plot and serves the Zionist entity with a goal of creating a reality and telling stories in order to justify acts of slaughter against the Palestinian people.\" In July 2012, Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, denounced a visit by Ziad al-Bandak, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, to the Auschwitz death camp, saying it was \"unjustified\" and \"unhelpful\" and only served the \"Zionist occupation\" while coming \"at the expense of a real Palestinian tragedy\". He also called the Holocaust an \"alleged tragedy\" and \"exaggerated\". In October 2012, Hamas said that they were opposed to teaching about the Holocaust in Gaza Strip schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency. The Refugee Affairs Department of Hamas said that teaching the Holocaust was a \"crime against the issue of the refugees that is aimed at canceling their right of return\".\n\nHamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals. For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use \"armed resistance to end the occupation\".\n\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Hamas was responsible for killing nearly 400 Israelis and wounding more than 2,000 in 425 attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 through May 2008, Hamas launched more than 3,000 Qassam rockets and 2,500 mortar attacks into Israel.\n\nIn the first years of the First Intifada (1987–1993), Hamas violence was directed first at collaborators with Israel and at individuals it considered moral deviants, and then later at the Israeli military. A new direction began with the formation of the al-Qassam Brigades militia in 1992, and in 1993 suicide attacks began against Israeli targets on the West Bank. \nThe first such attack occurred on April 16, 1993, when an al-Qassam Brigades operative detonated explosives in a car he parked next to two buses, one military and one civilian, in the West Bank town of Mehola, killing a Palestinian civilian and wounding 8 Israeli soldiers. After the February 1994 massacre by Baruch Goldstein of 30 Muslim civilians in a Hebron mosque, the al-Qassam Brigades expanded suicide attacks to target primarily civilians. The first of the suicide bombings that targeted civilians was at Afula on April 16, 1994, when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden car next to a bus, killing nine (including the bomber) and wounding 50. The most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a Netanya hotel on March 27, 2002, in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded. The attack has also been referred to as the Passover massacre since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of Passover at a Seder.\n\nHamas has defended suicide attacks as a legitimate aspect of its asymmetric warfare against Israel. In 2003, according to Stephen Atkins, Hamas resumed suicide bombings in Israel as a retaliatory measure after the failure of peace talks and an Israeli campaign targeting members of the upper echelon of the Hamas leadership. but they are considered as crimes against humanity under international law. In a 2002 report, Human Rights Watch stated that Hamas leaders \"should be held accountable\" for \"war crimes and crimes against humanity\" committed by the al-Qassam Brigades.\n\nIn May 2006 Israel arrested a top Hamas official, Ibrahim Hamed, who Israeli security officials alleged was responsible for dozens of suicide bombings and other attacks on Israelis. Hamed's trial on those charges has not yet concluded. In 2008, Hamas explosives engineer Shihab al-Natsheh organized a deadly suicide bombing in Dimona.\n\nSince 2002, paramilitary soldiers of al-Qassam Brigades and other groups have used homemade Qassam rockets to hit Israeli towns in the Negev, such as Sderot. Al-Qassam Brigades was estimated in 2007 to have launched 22% of the rocket and mortar attacks, which killed fifteen people between the years 2000 and 2009 (see Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel). The introduction of the \"Qassam-2\" rocket in 2008 enabled Palestinian paramilitary groups to reach, from Gaza, such Israeli cities such as Ashkelon.\n\nIn 2008, Hamas leader Khaled Mashal, offered that Hamas would attack only military targets if the IDF would stop causing the deaths of Palestinian civilians. Following a June 19, 2008 ceasefire, the al-Qassam Brigades ended its rocket attacks and arrested Fatah militants in Gaza who had continued sporadic rocket and mortar attacks against Israel. The al-Qassam Brigades resumed the attacks after the November 4 Israeli incursion into Gaza.\n\nOn 15 June 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of involvement in the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers (including one who held American citizenship), saying \"This has severe repercussions.\" On 20 July 2014, nearly two weeks into Operation Protective Edge, Netanyahu in an interview with CNN described Hamas as \"genocidal terrorists.\"\n\nOn 5 August 2014 Israel announced that Israeli security forces arrested Hussam Kawasme, in Shuafat, in connection with the murders. During interrogation, Kawasme admitted to being the mastermind behind the attack, in addition to securing the funding from Hamas. Officials have stated that additional people arrested in connection with the murders are still being held, but no names have been released.\n\nOn 20 August, Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader in exile in Turkey, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens. He delivered an address on behalf of Khaled Mashal at the conference of the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Istanbul, a move that might reflect a desire by Hamas to gain leverage. In it he said: \"Our goal was to ignite an intifada in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as within the 1948 borders. ... Your brothers in the Al-Qassam Brigades carried out this operation to support their imprisoned brothers, who were on a hunger strike. ... The mujahideen captured these settlers in order to have a swap deal.\" Hamas political leader Khaled Mashal accepted that members of Hamas were responsible, stating that he knew nothing of it in advance and that what the leadership knew of the details came from reading Israeli reports. Meshaal, who has headed Hamas's exiled political wing since 2004, has denied being involved in the \"details\" of Hamas \"military issues\", but \"justified the killings as a legitimate action against Israelis on \"occupied\" lands.\"\n\nHamas suicide attacks on Israeli civilians have largely disappeared since 2005; this has coincided with an increase in rocket attacks. One analysis suggests that the decline in suicide attacks is not motivated by any lack of supplies or volunteers to carry out such operations, by enhanced Israeli security measures such as the West Bank barrier (if Israeli actions were the reason, one would expect to see an equal decline in suicide attacks by all Palestinian factions, which is not observed), or by a newfound desire for reconciliation with Israel on the part of Hamas. Rather, suicide bombings provoked targeted killings that decimated the leadership of Hamas, whereas rocket attacks have elicited weaker Israeli reprisals that have tended to harm the Palestinian population as a whole more than Hamas (such as the blockade of the Gaza Strip) – thereby paradoxically increasing Hamas's popular support.\n\nRocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as war crimes, both because they usually take aim at civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. After Operation Pillar of Defense, Human Rights Watch stated that armed Palestinian groups fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, violating international humanitarian law, and that statements by Palestinian groups that they deliberately targeted Israeli civilians demonstrated an \"intent to commit war crimes\". HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said that Palestinian groups made clear that \"harming civilians was their aim\" and said that launching rockets at populated areas had no legal justification. International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and intentional violations can be war crimes.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the \"accidental result\" of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following Operation Cast Lead, Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, \"showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants\". In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.\n\nAccording to one report, commenting on the 2014 conflict, \"nearly all the 2,500–3,000 rockets and mortars Hamas has fired at Israel since the start of the war seem to have been aimed at towns\", including an attack on \"a kibbutz collective farm close to the Gaza border\", in which an Israeli child was killed. Former Israeli Lt. Col. Jonathan D. Halevi stated that \"Hamas has expressed pride in aiming long-range rockets at strategic targets in Israel including the nuclear reactor in Dimona, the chemical plants in Haifa, and Ben-Gurion Airport\", which \"could have caused thousands\" of Israeli casualties \"if successful\".\n\nIn July 2008 Barack Obama, then the Democratic presidential candidate, said: \"If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing.\" On December 28, 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement: \"the United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel.\" On March 2, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks.\n\nIn 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 Palestinian militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled peace talks between Israel and Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority. According to the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with Salam Fayyad, to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, \"while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress\". According to Dangot, Hamas must not be seen as ruling successfully or be allowed to \"get credit for a policy that would improve the lives of people\". The campaign consists of attacks against Israelis in which, according to a Hamas declaration in early September, \"all options are open\". The participating groups also include Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Resistance Committees and an unnamed splinter group of Fatah.\n\nAs part of the campaign, on August 31, 2010, 4 Israeli settlers, including a pregnant woman, were killed by Hamas militants while driving on Route 60 near the settlement Kiryat Arba, in the West bank. According to witnesses, militants opened fire on the moving vehicle, but then \"approached the car\" and shot the occupants in their seats at \"close range\". The attack was described by Israeli sources as one of the \"worst\" terrorist acts in years. A senior Hamas official said that Israeli settlers in the West Bank are legitimate targets since \"they are an army in every sense of the word\".\n\nAccording to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, stated on Al-Aqsa TV, \"For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life.'\"\n\nIn 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5 million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the Garden of Eden, which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs. He continued by saying that nobody on Earth \"will be able to confront the resistance, or to confront the mujahideen, those who worship Allah and seek martyrdom\".\n\nHamas has made great use of guerrilla tactics in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank. It has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception. According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza.\n\nHamas has used IEDs and anti-tank rockets against the IDF in Gaza. The latter include standard RPG-7 warheads and home-made rockets such as the Al-Bana, Al-Batar and Al-Yasin. The IDF has a difficult, if not impossible time trying to find hidden weapons caches in Palestinian areas – this is due to the high local support base Hamas enjoys.\n\nIn addition to killing Israeli civilians and armed forces, Hamas has also murdered suspected Palestinian Israel collaborators and Fatah rivals. Hundreds of Palestinians were executed by both Hamas and Fatah during the First Intifada. In the wake of the 2006 Israeli conflict with Gaza, Hamas was accused of systematically rounding up, torturing and summarily executing Fatah supporters suspected of supplying information to Israel. Human Rights Watch estimates several hundred Gazans were \"maimed\" and tortured in the aftermath of the conflict. Seventy-three Gazan men accused of \"collaborating\" had their arms and legs broken by \"unidentified perpetrators\" and 18 Palestinians accused of helping Israel were executed by Hamas security officials in the first days of the conflict. In November 2012, Hamas's Izzedine al-Qassam brigade publicly executed six Gaza residents accused of collaborating with Israel. According to the witnesses, six alleged informers were shot dead one by one in Gaza City, while the corpse of the sixth victim was tied by a cable to the back of a motorcycle and dragged through the streets. In 2013, Human Rights Watch issued a statement condemning Hamas for not investigating and giving a proper trial to the 6 men. Their statement was released the day before Hamas issued a deadline for \"collaborators\" to turn themselves in, or they will be pursued \"without mercy\". In August 2014, during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, at least 22 accused collaborators were executed by Hamas shortly after three of its commanders were assassinated by Israeli forces. An Israeli source denied that any of the commanders had been targeted on the basis of human intelligence.\n\nFrequent killings of unarmed people have also occurred during Hamas-Fatah clashes. NGOs have cited a number of summary executions as particular examples of violations of the rules of warfare, including the case of Muhammad Swairki, 28, a cook for Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard, who was thrown to his death, with his hands and legs tied, from a 15-story apartment building in Gaza City. Hamas security forces reportedly shoot and torture Palestinians who opposed Hamas rule in Gaza. In one case, a Palestinian had criticized Hamas in a conversation on the street with some friends. Later that day, more than a dozen armed men with black masks and red kaffiyeh took the man from his home, and brought him to a solitary area where they shot him three times in the lower legs and ankles. The man told Human Rights Watch that he was not politically active.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, Hamas fighters stormed the Mosque of cleric Abdel-Latif Moussa. The cleric was protected by at least 100 fighters from Jund Ansar Allah (\"Army of the Helpers of God\"), an Islamist group with links to Al-Qaeda. The resulting battle left at least 13 people dead, including Moussa and 6 Hamas fighters, and 120 people injured. According to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, during 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Hamas killed more than 120 Palestinian youths for defying house arrest imposed on them by Hamas, in addition to 30–40 Palestinians killed by Hamas in extrajudicial executions after accusing them of being collaborators with Israel. Referring to the killing of suspected collaborators, a Shin Bet official stated that \"not even one\" of those executed by Hamas provided any intelligence to Israel, while the Shin Bet officially \"confirmed that those executed during Operation Protective Edge had all been held in prison in Gaza in the course of the hostilities\".\n\nHamas has been accused of providing weapons, training and fighters for Sinai-based insurgent attacks, although Hamas strongly denies the allegations, calling them a smear campaign aiming to harm relations with Egypt. According to the Egyptian Army, since the ouster of Egypt's Muslim-Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, over 600 Hamas members have entered the Sinai Peninsula through smuggling tunnels. In addition, several weapons used in Sinai's insurgent attacks are being traced back to Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to the army. The four leading insurgent groups in the Sinai have all reportedly maintained close ties with the Gaza Strip. Hamas is also accused of helping Morsi and other high-ranking Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood members break out of the Wadi Natroun prison in Cairo during the 2011 revolution. Hamas called the accusation a \"dangerous development\". Egyptian authorities stated that the 2011 Alexandria bombing was carried out by the Gaza-based Army of Islam, which has received sanctuary from Hamas and earlier collaborated in the capture of Gilad Shalit. Army of Islam members linked to the August 2012 Sinai attack have reportedly sought refuge in the Gaza Strip. Egypt stated that Hamas directly provided logistical support to the Muslim Brotherhood militants who carried out the December 2013 Mansoura bombing.\n\nHamas, together with several charities it runs, has been designated by several governments and some academics as a terrorist organization. Others regard Hamas as a complex organization with terrorism as only one component. Israel outlawed Hamas in September 1989 The United States followed suit in 1995, as did Canada in November 2002. The European Union outlawed Hamas's military wing in 2001 and included Hamas in its list of terrorist organizations in 2003, which Hamas successfully challenged in the courts, and continued to do so under American and Israeli pressure. The basis of Hamas's challenge to the EU classification in 2007 was that it was drawn up on the basis of media reports, rather than grounded in any analysis of Hamas's history. In July 2017, the European Court of Justice overruled this challenge, citing that the evidence of media reports was only used for keeping Hamas on the list, rather than to add it to the list in the first place.\n\nThe European General Court found in favour of Hamas in 2014, though the verdict was appealed by the EU countries. In September 2016 a legal advisor to the European Court of Justice, Eleanor Sharpston, provided an advisory opinion, in favour of cancelling the listing of Hamas as a terrorist organization. She argued that the determination originally adopted was flawed, and that the EU cannot \"rely on facts and evidence found in press articles and information from the internet\" in order to list organizations as terrorists. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Japan, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom have designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist organization. The organization is banned in Jordan. It is not regarded as a terrorist organization by Iran, Russia, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, China, and Brazil.\n\nAfter Operation Pillar of Defense, Human Rights Watch stated that Palestinian groups had endangered civilians by \"repeatedly fired rockets from densely populated areas, near homes, businesses, and a hotel\" and noted that under international law, parties to a conflict may not to place military targets in or near densely populated areas. One rocket was launched close to the Shawa and Housari Building, where various Palestinian and international media have offices; another was fired from the yard of a house near the Deira Hotel. \"The New York Times\" journalist Steven Erlanger reported that \"Hamas rocket and weapons caches, including rocket launchers, have been discovered in and under mosques, schools and civilian homes.\" Another report published by Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center revealed that Hamas used close to 100 mosques to store weapons and as launch-pads to shoot rockets. The report contains testimony from variety Palestinian sources, including a Hamas militant Sabhi Majad Atar, who said he was taught how to shoot rockets from inside a mosque. Hamas has also been criticized by Israeli officials for blending into or hiding among the Palestinian civilian population During the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict. The Israeli government published what it said was video evidence of human shield tactics by Hamas. Israel said that Hamas frequently used mosques and school yards as hideouts and places to store weapons, and that Hamas militants stored weapons in their homes, making it difficult to ensure that civilians close to legitimate military targets are not hurt during Israeli military operations. Israeli officials also accused the Hamas leadership of hiding under Shifa Hospital during the conflict, using the patients inside to deter an Israeli attack.\n\nThe Israeli government filed a report entitled \"Gaza Operations Investigation: Second Update\" to the United Nations accusing Hamas of exploiting its rules of engagement by shooting rockets and launching attacks within protected civilian areas. Israel says 12,000 rockets and mortars were fired at it between 2000 and 2008 – nearly 3,000 in 2008 alone. In one case, an errant Israeli mortar strike killed dozens of people near a UN school. Hamas said that the mortar killed 42 people and left dozens wounded. Israel said that Hamas militants had launched a rocket from a yard adjacent to the school and one mortar of three rounds hit the school, due to a GPS error. According to the Israeli military probe, the remaining two rounds hit the yard used to launch rockets into Israel, killing two members of Hamas's military wing who fired the rockets. Human Right Watch called Hamas to \"publicly renounce\" the rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and hold those responsible to account. Human Right Watch program director Iain Levine said the attacks by Hamas were \"unlawful and unjustifiable, and amount to war crimes\", and accused Hamas of putting Palestinians at risk by launching attacks from built-up areas. Hamas spokesman relied that the report was \"biased\" and he denied that Hamas uses human shields.\n\nHuman Rights Watch investigated 19 incidents involving 53 civilian deaths in Gaza that Israel said were the result of Hamas fighting in densely populated areas and did not find evidence for existence of Palestinian fighters in the areas at the time of the Israeli attack. In other cases where no civilians had died, the report concluded that Hamas may have deliberately fired rockets from areas close to civilians. HRW also investigated 11 deaths that Israel said were civilians being used as human shields by Hamas. HRW found no evidence that the civilians were used as human shields, nor had they been shot in crossfire. The Israeli 'human shields' charge against Hamas was called \"full of holes\" by \"The National\" (UAE), which stated that only Israel accused Hamas of using human shields during the conflict, though Hamas \"may be guilty\" of \"locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas\" and for \"deliberately firing indiscriminate weapons into civilian populated areas\".\n\nOn July 8, 2014, Hamas's spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri encouraged the \"policy of people confronting the Israeli warplanes with their bare chests\", saying it has proven itself. One survey of Gazan residents addressed the subject of human shields during the 2014 war, with respondents issuing statements such as \"People received warnings from the Israelis and tried to evacuate. ... Hamas shot some of those people...the rest were forced to return to their homes and get bombed\"; \"Hamas imposed a curfew: anyone walking out in the street was shot without being asked any questions. That way Hamas made sure people had to stay in their homes even if they were about to get bombed\"; and \"My father received a text-message from the Israeli army warning him that our area was going to be bombed, and Hamas prevented us from leaving.\" Israeli soldiers recounted \"Suddenly, a small boy appeared, and the terrorist grabbed him and escaped with him\"; \"I saw with my own eyes someone using another person, a woman, as a shield. ... And I can see very clearly that the woman doesn't want to be there and he's pulling her with him\"; and \"We even found explosives in nurseries. The whole neighborhood was practically a terrorist base.\"\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of using children as human shields. The Israeli government released video footage in which it claims two militants are shown grabbing a young boy's arm from behind holding him to walk in front of them toward a group of people waiting near a wall. The IDF argues the militants were placing the boy between themselves and an Israeli sniper. The second scene shows an individual, described as a terrorist, grabbing a school boy off of a floor, where he is hiding behind a column from IDF fire, and using him as a human shield to walk to a different location. After 15 alleged militants sought refuge in a mosque from Israeli forces, the BBC reported that Hamas radio instructed local women to go the mosque to protect the militants. Israeli forces later opened fire and killed two women.\n\nIn November 2006, the Israeli Air Force warned Muhammad Weil Baroud, commander of the Popular Resistance Committees who are accused of launching rockets into Israeli territory, to evacuate his home in a Jabalya refugee camp apartment block in advance of a planned Israeli air strike. Baroud responded by calling for volunteers to protect the apartment block and nearby buildings and, according to \"The Jerusalem Post\", hundreds of local residents, mostly women and children, responded. Israel suspended the air strike. Israel termed the action an example of Hamas using human shields. In response to the incident, Hamas proclaimed: 'We won. From now on we will form human chains around every house threatened with demolition.'\" In a November 22 press release, Human Rights Watch condemned Hamas, stating: \"There is no excuse for calling civilians to the scene of a planned attack. Whether or not the home is a legitimate military target, knowingly asking civilians to stand in harm's way is unlawful.\" Following criticism, Human rights Watch issued a statement saying that their initial assessment of the situation was in error. They stated that, on the basis of available evidence, the home demolition was in fact an administrative act, viewed in the context of Israel's longstanding policy of punitive home demolitions, not a military act and thus would not fall within the purview of the law regulating hostilities during armed conflict, which had been the basis for their initial criticism of Hamas.\n\nWhen the UN-sponsored Goldstone Commission Report on the Gaza War was commissioned in 2009, it stated that it \"found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack\" though they deemed credible reports that Palestinian militants were \"not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from civilians\". Hamas MP Fathi Hamed stated that \"For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel...the elderly excel at this...and so do the children. This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children.\" Following the release of the Goldstone Report, the former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan Col. Richard Kemp was invited to testify at the UN Human Rights Council 12th Special Session that during Operation Cast Lead Israel encountered an \"enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population\".\n\nThe Israeli government released a video compiled mostly from Arab news sources showing Palestinian children under the age of 15 going through military training and carrying and firing arms. The video's narration explains that Hamas indoctrinates these child combatants and that Hamas operators send the children \"on missions from which they would not risk their own lives\". According to the Israeli government, the children are used as spotters, to transport explosives and weapons, sent to play in areas to deter Israeli attacks and are sent unknowingly with explosive devices in their schoolbags to be blown up in the vicinity of Israelis. The United Nations defines the use of children for military purposes as a war crime and a form of slavery. See Military use of children.\n\nAlthough Hamas admits to sponsoring summer schools to train teenagers in handling weapons they condemn attacks by children. Following the deaths of three teenagers during a 2002 attack on Netzarim in central Gaza, Hamas banned attacks by children and \"called on the teachers and religious leaders to spread the message of restraint among young boys\". Hamas's use of child labor to build tunnels with which to attack Israel has also been criticized, with at least 160 children killed in the tunnels as of 2012.\n\n Human rights groups and Gazans have accused the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip of restricting freedom of the press and forcefully suppressing dissent. Both foreign and Palestinian journalists report harassment and other measures taken against them. In September 2007 the Gaza Interior Ministry disbanded the Gaza Strip branch of the pro-Fatah Union of Palestinian Journalists, a move criticized by Reporters without borders. In November of that year the Hamas government arrested a British journalist and for a time canceled all press cards in Gaza. On February 8, 2008, Hamas banned distribution of the pro-Fatah Al-Ayyam newspaper, and closed its offices in the Gaza Strip because it ran a caricature that mocked legislators loyal to Hamas. The Gaza Strip Interior Ministry later issued an arrest warrant for the editor.\n\nMore widely, in late August 2007 the group was accused in \"The Telegraph\", a conservative British newspaper, of torturing, detaining, and firing on unarmed protesters who had objected to policies of the Hamas government. Also in late August, Palestinian health officials reported that the Hamas government had been shutting down Gaza clinics in retaliation for doctor strikes – The Hamas government confirmed the \"punitive measure against doctors\" because, in its view, they had incited other doctors to suspend services and go out on strike. In September 2007 the Hamas government banned public prayers, after Fatah supporters began holding worship sessions that quickly escalated into raucous protests against Hamas rule. Government security forces beat several gathering supporters and journalists. In October 2008, the Hamas government announced it would release all political prisoners in custody in Gaza. Several hours after the announcement, 17 Fatah members were released.\n\nOn August 2, 2012, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) accused Hamas of harassing elected officials belong to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) in Gaza. The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work. Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal \"to give in to pressure\". The IFJ said that these accusations are \"malicious\" and \"should be dropped immediately\". The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials. Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work. The IFJ backed the PJS and called on Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to intervene to stop \"his officials' unwarranted interference in journalists' affairs\". In November 2012, two Gazan journalists were prevented from leaving Gaza by Hamas. There were scheduled to participate in a conference in Cairo, Egypt. After being questioned by security forces, their passports were confiscated. In 2016 Reporters Without Borders condemned Hamas for censorship and for torturing journalists. Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said \"As living conditions in the Gaza Strip are disastrous, Hamas wants to silence critics and does not hesitate to torture a journalist in order to control media coverage in its territory.\"\n\nIn June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in Ramallah published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an \"almost systematic campaign\" of human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.\n\nIn 2012, the Human Rights Watch presented a 43 page long list of human rights violation committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas the HRW report mentions beatings with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of Gilad Shalit, the HRW report described it as \"cruel and inhuman\". The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so called morality offenses and for media censorship. In a public statement Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed, \"after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services.\" Hamas responded by denying charges and describing them as \"politically motivated\"\n\nOn May 26, 2015 Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects during the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.\n\nHamas has always maintained leadership abroad. The movement is deliberately fragmented to ensure that Israel cannot kill its top political and military leaders. Hamas used to be strongly allied with both Iran and Syria. Iran gave Hamas an estimated $13–15 million in 2011 as well as access to long-range missiles. Hamas's political bureau was once located in the Syrian capital of Damascus before the start of the Syrian civil war. Relations between Hamas, Iran, and Syria began to turn cold when Hamas refused to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, Hamas backed the Sunni rebels fighting against Assad. As a result, Iran cut funding to Hamas, and their terror proxy Hezbollah ordered Hamas members out of Lebanon. Hamas was then forced out of Syria. Since then, Iran and Hezbollah have tried to mend fences with Hamas. Hamas contacted Jordan and Sudan to see if either would open up its borders to its political bureau. But both countries refused – though they welcomed many Hamas members leaving Syria. In 2012 Hamas headquarters subsequently moved to Doha, Qatar.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, under the leadership of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi, Hamas had the support of Egypt. However, when Morsi was removed from Office, his replacement Abdul Fattah al-Sisi outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and destroyed the tunnels Hamas built into Egypt. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are likewise hostile to Hamas. Like Egypt, they designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and Hamas was viewed as its Palestinian equivalent.\n\nAccording to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: Qatar and Turkey. Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says that \"Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.\" Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion. Last year on U.S. television Erdogan said, \"I don't see Hamas as a terror organization. Hamas is a political party.\"\n\nIn 2007, Qatar was, with Turkey, the only country to back Hamas after the group ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip. The relationship between Hamas and Qatar strengthened in 2008 and 2009 when Khaled Meshaal was invited to attend the Doha Summit where he was seated next to the then Qatari Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who pledged $250 million to repair the damage caused by the Israel in the Israeli war on Gaza. These events caused Qatar to become the main player in the \"Palestinian issue\". Qatar called Gaza's blockade unjust and immoral, which prompted the Hamas government in Gaza, including former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, to thank Qatar for their \"unconditional\" support. Qatar then began regularly handing out political, material, humanitarian and charitable support for Hamas.\n\nIn 2012, Qatar's former Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule. He pledged to raise $400 million for reconstruction. Some have argued that the money Qatar gives to reconstruct Palestine is an excuse to pour even more money into Hamas. Qatar's reason for funding Hamas, which is shared by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is allegedly that Islamist groups are growing and will eventually play a role in the region; thus it is important for Qatar (and Turkey) to maintain ties. During the Arab Spring, for example, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamist group whose offshoot is Hamas. Other sources say that advocating for Hamas is politically beneficial to Turkey and Qatar because the Palestinian cause draws popular support amongst their citizens at home.\n\nSome began to label Qatar a terrorist haven in part because it is harboring Hamas leader Meshaal. They also harbor Husam Badran, former leader of Hamas's military wing in the northern West Bank. Husam Badran, current media spokesman for Hamas, was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the second intifada, including the Dolphinarium discotheque bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed 21 people. Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists including Saleh al-Arouri, the senior Hamas officer, known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad. Al-Arouri is alleged to have orchestrated the June 2014 abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers and to have started the 50-day war between Israel and Palestine, and now lives in Turkey.\n\nSpeaking in reference to Qatar's support for Hamas, during a 2015 visit to Palestine, Qatari official Mohammad al-Emadi, said Qatar is using the money not to help Hamas but rather the Palestinian people as a whole. He acknowledges however that giving to the Palestinian people means using Hamas as the local contact. Emadi said, \"You have to support them. You don't like them, don't like them. But they control the country, you know.\" Some argue that Hamas's relations with Qatar are putting Hamas in an awkward position because Qatar has become part of the regional Arab problem.\n\nBut Hamas claims that having contacts with various Arab countries establishes positive relations which will encourage Arab countries to do their duty toward the Palestinians and support their cause by influencing public opinion in the Arab world. In March 2015, Hamas has announced its support of the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nIn May 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tweeted to the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu that Hamas is not a terrorist organization but a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power. During that period there were conflicts between Israeli troops and Palestinian protestors in the Gaza Strip, due to the decision of the United States to move their embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nAfter the Hamas victory in 2006, China did not label it a “terrorist organization” and welcomed Hamas’ foreign minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar, to Beijing for the China-Arab Cooperation Forum ignoring protests by both the United States and Israel but receiving praise from Mahmoud Abbas. China has harshly criticised Israel for its economic blockade of Gaza since 2007 when Hamas assumed control of the territory. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao stated, “We believe that the Palestinian government is legally elected by the people there and it should be respected”. In April 2011, a spokesman from China’s foreign ministry embraced the Hamas-Fatah agreement to form an interim government.\n\nIn 2014 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on Israel to lift its blockade and advised both Israel and Hamas to cease fighting. He reaffirmed support from China to the Palestinian people’s right to establish an independent state. He told a joint press conference, “China will grant $1.5 million in emergency humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.” \n\nIn June 2018, China voted in support of a United Nations Security Council resolution vetoed by the US that criticized Israel of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by the Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians in Gaza during the 2018 Gaza border protests. Later the same day, China abstained from voting on a US drafted resolution that blamed Hamas for the escalated violence.\n\nSeveral U.S. organizations were either shut down or held liable for financing Hamas in early 2001, groups that have origins from the mid-1990s: the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), and Kind Hearts. The U.S. Treasury Department specially designated the HLF in 2001 for terror ties: \"from 1995 to 2001 the HLF transferred \"approximately $12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas.\" According to the Treasury Department, Khaled Meshal identified one of HLF's officers, Mohammed El-Mezain as \"the Hamas leader for the U.S.\" In 2003, IAP was found liable for financially supporting Hamas, and in 2006, Kind Hearts had their assets frozen for supporting Hamas. In 2016, it was reported that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) against Israel includes a web of Hamas supporters from the Illinois-based organization American Muslims for Palestine (AMP).\n\n\n\n"}

The messianic figure was repeatedly mentioned by the Báb, the founder of Bábism, in His book, the Bayán. The Báb described the messianic figure as the origin of all divine attributes, and stated that his command was equivalent to God’s command. The Báb stated that once the messianic figure had arrived, the perusal of one of his verses was to be greater than a thousand perusals of the Bayán. The prediction is widely recognized as being fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nAfter the Báb's execution in 1850, there were some Bábis who claimed to be \"He whom God shall make manifest\". Later in 1863, Bahá'u'lláh privately laid claim to be the messianic figure, and made his claim publicly in 1866–1868. Those who followed him became known as Bahá'ís, and his claim was by far the most successful. The Azalis (those Babis who did not accept Bahá'u'lláh) objected to Bahá'u'lláh's statement, and shortly after Bahá'u'lláh's claim first started to attract attention, Bahá'í historians report that Subh-i-Azal made a claim to the title.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6839257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6839257", "title": "Hinduism in New Zealand", "text": "Hinduism in New Zealand\n\nHinduism is the second largest and the fastest growing religion in New Zealand after Christianity, with over 90,000 adherents according to the 2013 Census. The number of Hindus in New Zealand grew modestly until the 1990s when the Immigration Act 1987, the Immigration Amendment Act 1991 and India's Economic Liberal Hinduism currently makes up 2.1% of the New Zealand population, and is the fast growing religion in the country(for religions with more than 20,000 adherents).\n\nIn the 1991 Census, surging migration as a result of the Immigration Act 1987 made the number of Hindus surpass 17,000. India's Economic Liberalisation occurred in the same year, increasing the standard of living and allowing more immigrants to come in the future. The 1996 New Zealand Census showed the eased immigration laws resulted in the number of Hindus growing from 18,000 in 1991 to surpassing 25,000 for the first time. This was largely due to the continued success of the Immigration Act 1987.\n\nIn the 2001 Census, the population of Hindus was at almost 40 000, meaning that the number of Hindus tripled in the 10 years since the 1991 census. The 2006 census showed the number of Hindus to be 64,557, an increase of nearly 62% from the previous census in 2001. The growth of the number of Hindus in New Zealand then slowed in the years between the 2006 Census and the 2013 Census because of a mixture of events. the heightened violence against Indian Australians(2007-2010) and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake were the main reasons why growth of Hindus declined. The latter was also the main reason why the Census year was moved from 2011 to 2013. The slowdown in long term migration was partially offset by soaring numbers of Indian Students and Skilled Migrants, whose numbers increased rapidly during the Great Recession partly due to costs being cheaper and a better economic outlook. The recently conducted 2013 Census showed the Hindu population made up slightly over 2% of the population, with 90,018 adherents. This increased Hinduism's share of the total New Zealand population by 0.5% despite immigration slowing as a result of the events mentioned earlier.\n\nFor more detailed analysis, see \"Religion in New Zealand\"\n\nJews and Hindus hold the highest education level in New Zealand.\n\nList of Hindu Temples in major New Zealand cities.

{"id": "462984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462984", "title": "Humanistic Judaism", "text": "Humanistic Judaism\n\nHumanistic Judaism ( \"Yahadut Humanistit\") is a Jewish movement that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people and encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish holidays and lifecycle events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature.\n\nIts philosophical foundation includes the following ideas:\n\n\nIn its current form, Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1963 by Rabbi Sherwin Wine. As a rabbi trained in Reform Judaism, with a small secular, non-theistic congregation in Michigan, Wine developed a Jewish liturgy that reflected his and his congregation’s philosophical viewpoint by emphasizing Jewish culture, history, and identity along with Humanistic ethics, while excluding all prayers and references to God. This congregation developed into the Birmingham Temple, now in Farmington Hills, Michigan. It was soon joined by a previously Reform congregation in Illinois, as well as a group in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1969, these congregations and others were united organizationally under the umbrella of the Society for Humanistic Judaism (SHJ). The Society for Humanistic Judaism has 10,000 members in 30 congregations spread throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nThe International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1986. It is the academic and intellectual center of Humanistic Judaism. It was established in Jerusalem in 1985 and currently has two centers of activity: one in Jerusalem and the other in Lincolnshire, IL. Rabbi Adam Chalom is the North American dean. The Institute offers professional training programs for Spokespersons, Educators, Leaders (also referred to in Hebrew as \"madrikhim/ot\" or in Yiddish as \"vegvayzer\"), and Rabbis, in addition to its publications, public seminars and colloquia for lay audiences.\n\nHumanistic Judaism presents a far more radical departure from traditional Jewish religion than Mordecai Kaplan (co-founder of Reconstructionist Judaism) ever envisioned. Kaplan redefined God and other traditional religious terms so as to make them consistent with the naturalist outlook, and continued to use traditional prayer language. Wine rejected this approach as confusing, since participants could ascribe to these words whatever definitions they favored. Wine strove to achieve philosophical consistency and stability by creating rituals and ceremonies that were purely non-theistic. Services were created for Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and other Jewish holidays and festivals, often with reinterpretation of the meaning of the holiday to bring it into conformity with Secular Humanistic philosophy.\n\nHumanistic Judaism was developed as a possible solution to the problem of retaining Jewish identity and continuity among non-religious. Recognizing that congregational religious life was thriving, Wine believed that secular Jews who had rejected theism would be attracted to an organization that provided all the same forms and activities as, for example, Reform temples, but which expressed a purely Secular Humanistic viewpoint. The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, which is sponsored by the Society for Humanistic Judaism and the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations, trains rabbis and other leaders in the United States and in Israel. The Society for Humanistic Judaism was organized with the mission to mobilize people to celebrate Jewish identity and culture consistent with a humanistic philosophy of life.\n\nWithin Humanistic Judaism, Jewish identity is largely a matter of self-identification. Rabbis and other trained leaders officiate at intermarriages between Jews and non-Jews, and the Humanistic Judaism movement, unlike the Conservative and Orthodox Jewish denominations, does not take any position or action in opposition to intermarriage, rather it affirms that \"Intermarriage is an American Jewish reality—a natural consequence of a liberal society in which individuals have the freedom to marry whomever they wish...that intermarriage is neither good nor bad, just as we believe that the marriage of two Jews, in itself, is neither good nor bad. The moral worth of a marriage always depends on the quality of the human relationship—on the degree of mutual love and respect that prevails.\" Secular Humanistic rabbis and leaders will also co-officiate at intercultural marriages between Jews and non-Jews. These views concerning Jewish identity and intermarriage are criticized by those who believe that they will hasten the assimilation of Jews into the general society and thus adversely affect Jewish continuity.\n\nHumanistic Judaism is egalitarian with respect to gender and gender identification, Jewish status, and sexual orientation. Brit shalom (baby-naming ceremonies), similar for boys and girls, are performed rather than the brit milah. Those who identify as Jews and those who do not, as well as LGBTI members, may participate in all ways in all Humanistic Jewish rituals and leadership roles.\n\nHumanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, Tamara Kolton, who was ordained in 1999. Its first cantor was also a woman, Deborah Davis, ordained in 2001; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors. The Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, \"we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications.\" They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the passage of the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act” by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called \"a direct attack on a woman’s right to choose\".

He comes from a prominent acting family and appeared on the television series \"Sea Hunt\" (1958–60) with his father Lloyd Bridges and brother Beau Bridges. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the 2009 film \"Crazy Heart\" and earned Academy Award nominations for his roles in six other films.\n\nJeffrey Leon Bridges was born on December 4, 1949, in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of actor Lloyd Bridges (1913–1998) and actress and writer Dorothy Bridges (née Simpson; 1915–2009). His older brother Beau Bridges is also an actor. He has a younger sister Lucinda, and had another brother named Garrett who died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1948. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Liverpool in England.\n\nBridges and his siblings were raised in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. He shared a close relationship with his brother Beau, who acted as a surrogate father when their father was working. He graduated from University High School in 1967. At age 17, he toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\", then moved to New York City where he studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio. He also served seven years in the United States Coast Guard Reserve.\n\nBridges made his first screen appearance at the age of almost two years in \"The Company She Keeps\" in 1951. In his youth, Bridges and brother Beau made occasional appearances on their father's show \"Sea Hunt\" (1958–1961) and the CBS anthology series, \"The Lloyd Bridges Show\" (1962–1963). In 1969, he played Cal Baker, a Jobs Corps crew member, in the TV series \"Lassie\" episode \"Success Story\". In 1971, he played the lead role Mike in the TV movie \"In Search of America\". His first major role came in the 1971 film \"The Last Picture Show\", for which he garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He co-starred in the 1972 critically acclaimed neo-noir boxing film \"Fat City\", directed by John Huston. He was nominated again for Best Supporting Actor for his performance opposite Clint Eastwood in the 1974 film \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\". In 1976, he starred as the protagonist Jack Prescott in the first remake of \"King Kong\", opposite Jessica Lange. This film was a commercial success, earning $90 million worldwide, more than triple its $23 million budget, and also winning an Academy Award for special effects.\n\nOne of his better-known roles was in the 1982 science fiction film \"Tron\", in which he played Kevin Flynn, a video game programmer (a role he reprised in late 2010 with the sequel \"\"). The same year (1982), he also starred in \"Kiss Me Goodbye\", an American romantic comedy film directed by Robert Mulligan that also starred Sally Field. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1984, for playing the alien in \"Starman\". He was also acclaimed for his roles in the thriller \"Against All Odds\" (1984) and the crime drama \"Jagged Edge\" (1985). His role in \"Fearless\" (1993) is thought by some critics to be one of his best performances. One critic dubbed it a masterpiece; Pauline Kael wrote that he \"may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived\". In 1994, he starred as Lt. Jimmy Dove in the action film \"Blown Away\", opposite Tommy Lee Jones and Forest Whitaker. His real life father Lloyd Bridges also featured in the film, playing the uncle of Bridges' character. The film managed to recoup $30 million of its $50 million budget at the box office. It was up against another explosive-themed film, \"Speed\", which had been released a few weeks before Bridges' film. On July 11, 1994, Bridges received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry. The star is located at 7065 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1998, he starred as what is arguably his most famous role, The Dude, in the Coen brothers' film \"The Big Lebowski\".\n\nIn 2000, he received his fourth Academy Award nomination, for his role in \"The Contender\". He also starred in the 2005 Terry Gilliam film \"Tideland\", his second with the director (the first being 1991's \"The Fisher King\"). He shaved his trademark mane of hair to play the role of Obadiah Stane in the 2008 Marvel comic book adaptation \"Iron Man\". In July 2008, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, he appeared in a teaser for \"\", shot as concept footage for director Joseph Kosinski; this developed into a full 3D feature release in 2010.\n\nBridges is one of the youngest actors ever to be nominated for an Academy Award (1972, age 22, Best Supporting Actor, \"The Last Picture Show\"), and one of the oldest ever to win (winning the Best Actor in 2010 at age 60 for \"Crazy Heart\"). \"Crazy Heart\" also won him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nBridges received his sixth Academy Award nomination for his role in \"True Grit\", a collaboration with the Coen brothers in which he starred alongside Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and Hailee Steinfeld. Both the film and Bridges' performance as Rooster Cogburn, were critically praised. Bridges lost to Colin Firth, whom he had beaten for the Oscar in the same category the previous year. In 2016, Bridges appeared in the film \"Hell or High Water\", for which he received his seventh Academy Award nomination.\n\nReferring to his career as an actor and his passion for music, Bridges says, \"I dug what an actor did, but it took me a while to feel it, to truly appreciate the craft and the preparation. Plus, I was still playing music a lot, and I guess I had a hard time choosing: was I an actor or a musician, or could I be both?\"\n\nBridges studied piano at a young age, strongly encouraged by his mother. While working on the 1980 film \"Heaven's Gate\", he often played guitar with his co-star, singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, between takes. His character in \"Crazy Heart\", Bad Blake, was later based partly on Kristofferson. He released his debut album \"Be Here Soon\" on January 1, 2000. In 2005, Bridges, known as \"The Dude\" in the film \"The Big Lebowski\", showed up at a Lebowski Fest in Los Angeles singing and playing the film's theme song written by Bob Dylan, \"Man in Me\".\n\nOn January 15, 2010, Bridges performed the song \"I Don't Know\" from \"Crazy Heart\" on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\". In the film \"The Contender\", in which he co-starred, Bridges recorded a version of Johnny Cash's standard \"Ring of Fire\" with Kim Carnes that played over the pivotal opening credits. In February 2010, he was among the nearly 80 musicians to sing on the charity-single remake of \"We Are the World\". On October 24, 2010, Bridges appeared at Neil Young's annual \"Bridge School Benefit\" concert and played a set with singer-songwriter Neko Case.\n\nOn April 19, 2011, Country Music Television announced that Bridges had signed a recording contract with Blue Note Records/EMI Music Group. He worked with producer T-Bone Burnett and released his second album, \"Jeff Bridges,\" on August 16, 2011. On November 5, 2011, Bridges played Austin City Limits in support of this album.\n\nIn 2015, Bridges released an ambient/spoken-word album entitled \"Sleeping Tapes\". All proceeds from the album go directly to Bridges' charity No Kid Hungry.\n\nBridges plays many guitars, including the Gretsch Chet Atkins Country Gentlemen Model G6122-1959.\n\nIn 2013, Bridges wrote \"The Dude and the Zen Master\" with Bernie Glassman. Bridges found himself at a party with Glassman and Ram Dass and their conversation led to discussing the parallels between \"The Dude\" from \"The Big Lebowski\" and Zen Buddhism. The book was formed from what has been described as a \"transcript of a five-day \"hang\" on a Montana ranch.\"\n\nBridges has been an amateur photographer since high school and began taking photographs on film sets during \"Starman\", at the suggestion of co-star Karen Allen. Since 1980, he began photographing on and off set shots with his favorite camera, a Widelux F8. He published many of these photographs online and published a book in 2003 entitled, \"Pictures: Photographs by Jeff Bridges\".\n\nBridges narrated the documentary \"Lost in La Mancha\" (2002), about the making of a Terry Gilliam retelling of \"Don Quixote\", tentatively titled \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\", which would have starred Johnny Depp as Sancho Panza and Jean Rochefort as the quixotic hero. Bridges had previously appeared in Gilliam's \"The Fisher King\". Bridges also narrated the documentaries National Geographic's \"Lewis & Clark: Great Journey West\" (2002, IMAX), Discovery Channel's \"Raising the Mammoth\" (2000), and ABC's \"Heroes of Rock and Roll\" (1979). He voiced the character Big Z in the animated picture \"Surf's Up\". He also hosted VH1's \"Top 100 Greatest Albums of Rock and Roll\" series in 2001.\nBridges has performed TV commercial voiceover work as well, including Hyundai's 2007 \"Think About It\" advertising campaign as well as the Duracell advertisements in the \"Trusted Everywhere\" campaign.\n\nOn December 18, 2010, Bridges hosted NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\"; he had hosted the show before in 1983 with his brother, Beau. With the December 18, 2010, episode, Bridges beat Sigourney Weaver's record for longest gap between hosting appearances on \"SNL\" (Weaver had a 24-year gap between her first time hosting in 1986 and her second time hosting in 2010 while Bridges had a 27-year gap between his first appearance in 1983 and his most recent one, also in 2010).\n\nBridges married Susan Geston in 1977. They met while filming \"Rancho Deluxe\", on a ranch where Geston was working as a waitress. They have three daughters: Isabelle Annie (born August 6, 1981), Jessica Lily \"Jessie\" (born June 14, 1983), Haley Roselouise (born October 17, 1985), and granddaughter Grace (born March 31, 2011) from Isabelle.\n\nBridges has studied Buddhism. He meditates for half an hour before beginning work on a film set. He has learned Transcendental Meditation.\n\nIn 1984, Bridges and other entertainment industry leaders founded the End Hunger Network aimed at encouraging, stimulating and supporting action to end childhood hunger. He supported President Obama's initiative to End Childhood Hunger by 2015. In November 2010, Bridges became spokesman for the No Kid Hungry campaign of the organization Share our Strength. Its goal is to present and undertake a state-by-state strategy to end childhood hunger in the United States by 2015. Bridges also supports environmental causes and organizations such as the Amazon Conservation Team.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "408911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408911", "title": "Jeremy Collier", "text": "Jeremy Collier\n\nJeremy Collier (; 23 September 1650 – 26 April 1726) was an English theatre critic, non-juror bishop and theologian.\n\nBorn Jeremiah Collier, in Stow cum Quy, Cambridgeshire, Collier was educated at Caius College, University of Cambridge, receiving the BA (1673) and MA (1676). A supporter of James II, he refused, as a nonjuror (see Nonjuring schism) to take the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II after the Glorious Revolution. Furthering his obvious disapproval of the new monarchs, he publicly absolved two Jacobites who had conspired to assassinate the King and Queen. In 1713 he was consecrated a non-juror bishop by George Hickes and two Scottish bishops, Archibald Campbell and James Gadderar.\n\nCollier was the primus of the nonjuring line and a strong supporter of the four usages. (see Nonjuring schism) In the years following the Revolution he wrote a series of tracts questioning the legitimacy of the new monarchs and the deprival of the Non-juror bishops. He was well known for his \"Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain\", 1708–1714, which was attacked for its tendentious political and theological comments, but nevertheless widely used. His \"Reasons for restoring some prayers and directions, as they stand in the communion-service of the first English reform'd liturgy\", 1717 was the first salvo in the usages debate. His Essays were popular in his own day but are now little read. Collier wrote anti-theatrical polemic but was a high-church monarchist, unlike the many Puritans who wrote in this genre as well.\nCollier also translated the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius into English.\n\nIn the history of English drama, Collier is known for his anti-theatrical attack on the comedy of the 1690s in his \"Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage\" (1698), which draws for its ammunition mostly on the plays of William Congreve, John Vanbrugh, John Dryden, and Thomas D'Urfey. At the start of the English Civil War (1642) theatres were closed and in 1647 a law was passed to punish anyone who participated in or viewed drama. After the war, and during the English Interregnum, the Puritans, under Oliver Cromwell, had control of most of the English government. They placed heavy restrictions on entertainment and entertainment venues that were perceived as being pagan or immoral. In the English Restoration (1660), playwrights reacted against the Puritanical restrictions with much more decadent plays. The plays produced in the Restoration drew comparisons to the great Elizabethan dramas by critics of the day. However, these plays were considered vulgar because they mocked and disrespected marriage, morals, and the clergy. Furthermore, King Charles II allowed women to act on stage; some of the first actresses were of ill-repute. Collier's pamphlets sought to stem the spread of vice but turned out to be the sparks that kindled a controversial flame between like-minded Puritans and Restoration dramatists.\n\nCollier devotes nearly 300 pages to decry what he perceived as profanity and moral degeneration in the stage productions of the era. This ranged from general attacks on the morality of Restoration theatre to very specific indictments of playwrights of the day. Collier argued that a venue as influential as the theatre—it was believed then that the theatre should be providing moral instruction—should not have content that is morally detrimental. These pamphlets began a pamphlet war (see:Pamphlet wars) between Collier and some playwrights like Vanbrugh. Many of the playwrights responded with equally vehement attacks, but some were so deeply affected, they withdrew from theatre permanently or substantially changed their approach to writing comedies, William Congreve amongst them.\n\nAlthough the theatre styles of the Restoration lasted a while even after Collier's pamphlets, a new and more restrained theatre began to develop due, in part, to Collier's critiques. Due to the strict morals of the Puritans as well as others such as Collier, neoclassism drama began to emerge even while Restoration drama was still flourishing. During Collier's time, Societies for the Reformation of Manners dedicated themselves to maintaining honour in playhouses.\n\nCollier published an early encyclopedia in 1701, \"The great historical, geographical, genealogical and poetical dictionary\". He freely admitted that the text was based on a number of earlier historians, but especially out of the eight edition of Louis Moréri's \"Grand Dictionnaire Historique\". This was issued in two volumes in London from 1701-1705 with an appendix covering the time period from 1688 \"by another hand\" being issued in the latter year. A further appendix was issued in 1721 and a second edition in 1727. The work was not considered a success as Colliers additions were not of the same quality as the source text and it came out during the same period as the \"Lexicon Technicum\".\n\nCollier died on 26 April 1726 and was buried on 29 April in Old St. Pancras Churchyard. The grave is lost but Collier is not listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial to the important graves lost therin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "642147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=642147", "title": "Karaite Judaism", "text": "Karaite Judaism\n\nKaraite Judaism () or Karaism (; ; also spelt Qaraite Judaism or Qaraism) is a Jewish religious movement characterized by the recognition of the Tanakh alone as its supreme authority in \"Halakha\" (Jewish religious law) and theology. It is distinct from mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, which considers the Oral Torah, as codified in the Talmud and subsequent works, to be authoritative interpretations of the Torah. Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah without additional Oral Law or explanation. As a result, Karaite Jews do not accept as binding the written collections of the oral tradition in the Midrash or Talmud.\n\nWhen interpreting the Tanakh, Karaites strive to adhere to the plain or most obvious meaning (\"peshat\") of the text; this is not necessarily the literal meaning, but rather the meaning that would have been naturally understood by the ancient Israelites when the books of the Tanakh were first written. By contrast, Rabbinic Judaism relies on the legal rulings of the Sanhedrin as they are codified in the Midrash, Talmud, and other sources to indicate the authentic meaning of the Torah. Karaite Judaism holds every interpretation of the Tanakh to the same scrutiny regardless of its source, and teaches that it is the personal responsibility of every individual Jew to study the Torah, and ultimately decide personally its correct meaning. Karaites may consider arguments made in the Talmud and other works without exalting them above other viewpoints.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud, in his \"Sefer HaQabbalah\", the Karaite movement crystallized in Baghdad in the Gaonic period (\"circa\" 7th–9th centuries) under the Abbasid Caliphate in what is present-day Iraq. This is the view universally accepted among Rabbinic Jews. However, some Arab scholars claim that Karaites were already living in Egypt in the first half of the 7th century, based on a legal document that the Karaite community in Egypt had in its possession until the end of the 19th century, in which the first Islamic governor ordered the leaders of the Rabbinite community against interfering with Karaite practices or the way they celebrate their holidays. It was said to have been stamped by the palm of 'Amr ibn al-'As, the first Islamic governor of Egypt, and was reportedly dated 20 AH (641 CE).\n\nHistorians have argued over whether Karaism has a direct connection to anti-Rabbinic sects and views, such as those of the Sadducees, dating back to the end of the Second Temple period (70 CE), or whether Karaism represents a novel emergence of similar views. Karaites have always maintained that, while there are some similarities to the Sadducees, due to the rejection of Rabbinical authority and the Oral Law, there are major differences. The ancestors of the Karaites were a group called \"Benei Ṣedeq\" during the Second Temple period.\n\nKaraites at one time made up a significant proportion of the Jewish population. Estimates of the Karaite population are difficult to make because they believe on the basis of Genesis 32 that counting Jews is forbidden. In the 21st century, some 30,000–50,000 are thought to reside in Israel, with smaller communities in Turkey, Europe and the United States. Another estimate holds that, of the 50,000 worldwide, more than 40,000 descend from those who made aliyah from Egypt and Iraq to Israel. The largest Karaite community today resides in the Israeli city of Ashdod.\n\nArguments amongst Jewish sects regarding the validity of the Oral Law can be dated back to the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE. Accordingly, some scholars trace the origin of Karaism to those who rejected the Talmudic tradition as an innovation. Judah Halevi, an 11th-century Jewish philosopher and rabbi, wrote a defense for Judaism entitled \"Kuzari\", placing the origins of Karaism in the first and second centuries BCE, to the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (\"King Jannai\"):\n\nAbraham Geiger, a 19th-century German scholar who founded Reform Judaism, posited a connection between the Karaites and a remnant of the Sadducees, the 1st-century Jewish sect that followed the Hebrew Bible literally and rejected the Pharisees' notion of an Oral Torah even before it was written. Geiger's view is based on comparison between Karaite and Sadducee \"halakha\": for example, a minority in Karaite Judaism do not believe in a final resurrection or after-life, a position also held by the Sadducees. The British theologian John Gill (1767) noted, \nGill also traces the Karaite sect to the split between the schools of Hillel the Elder and Shammai in 30 BCE.\n\nAmerican scholar Bernard Revel rejects many of Geiger's proofs in his 1913 published dissertation, \"The Karaite Halakah\". Revel also points to the many correlations between Karaite halakha and theology and the interpretations of Philo of Alexandria, the 1st-century philosopher and Jewish scholar. He also notes the writings of a 10th-century Karaite who refers to Philo's works, showing that the Karaites made use of Philo's writings in the development of their movement. Later Medieval Karaite commentators did not view Philo in a favorable light. These attitudes show a friction between later Karaite theology and possible connections to Philo's philosophy, which could serve as either a rejection of their origins, rejection of theological positions no longer accepted, or that Philo's philosophy was not entirely used in the founding of the Karaites (although some influences remain possible).\n\nEarly 20th-century scholars Oesterley and Box suggested that Karaism formed in a reaction to the rise of Islam. The new religion recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith, but claimed that it detracted from its belief by deferring to rabbinical authority.\n\n‘Anan ben David (, c. 715 – 795 or 811?) is widely considered to be a major founder of the Karaite movement. His followers were called Ananites; they did not believe the Rabbinical oral law was divinely inspired.\n\nAccording to a 12th-century Rabbanite account, in approximately 760, Shelomoh ben Ḥisdai II, the Exilarch in Babylon died, and two brothers among his nearest kin, ‘Anan ben David (whose name according to the Rabbanite account was ‘Anan ben Shafaṭ, but was called \"ben David\" due to his Davidic lineage) and Ḥananyah were next in order of succession. Eventually Ḥananyah was elected by the rabbis of the Babylonian Jewish colleges (the Geonim) and by the notables of the chief Jewish congregations, and the choice was confirmed by the Caliph of Baghdad.\n\nA schism may have occurred, with ‘Anan ben David being proclaimed exilarch by his followers. However, not all scholars agree that this event occurred. Leon Nemoy notes, \"Natronai, scarcely ninety years after ‘Anan's secession, tells us nothing about his aristocratic (Davidic) descent or about the contest for the office of exilarch which allegedly served as the immediate cause of his apostasy.\" Nemoy later notes that Natronai — a devout Rabbanite — lived where ‘Anan's activities took place, and that the Karaite sage Jacob Qirqisani never mentioned ‘Anan's purported lineage or candidacy for Exilarch.\n\nAnan's allowing his followers to proclaim him as Exilarch was considered treason by the Muslim government. He was sentenced to death, but his life was saved by his fellow prisoner, Abu Hanifa, the founder of the madhhab or school of fiqh (Muslim jurisprudence) known as the Hanafi. Ultimately he and his followers were permitted to migrate to Palestine. They erected a synagogue in Jerusalem that continued to be maintained until the time of the Crusades. From this center, the sect diffused thinly over Syria, spread into Egypt, and ultimately reached Southeast Europe.\n\nBen David challenged the Rabbanite establishment. Some scholars believe that his followers may have absorbed Jewish Babylonian sects such as the Isunians (followers of Abu Isa), Yudghanites, and the remnants of the pre-Talmudic Sadducees and Boethusians. Later, sects such as the Ukbarites emerged separately from the Ananites.\n\nHowever, the Isunians, Yudghanites, ‘Ukabarites, and Mishawites all held views that did not accord with those of either the ‘Ananites or the Karaites. Abu ‘Isa al-Isfahani, who was an illiterate tailor, claimed to be a prophet, prohibited divorce, claimed that all months should have thirty days, believed in Jesus and Muhammad as prophets, and told his followers that they must study the New Testament and the Qur’an. Yudghan was a follower of ‘Isa al-Isfahani and claimed to be a prophet and the Messiah, saying that the observance of Shabbat and Holy Days was no longer obligatory. Isma‘il al-‘Ukbari believed he was the prophet Elijah, and hated ‘Anan. Mishawayh al-‘Ukbari, who was a disciple of Isma‘il al-‘Ukbari and the founder of the Mishawites, taught his followers to use a purely solar calendar of 364 days and 30-day months, insisting that all the Holy Days and fast days should always occur on fixed days in the week, rather than on fixed days of the months. He further said that Shabbat should be kept from sunrise on Saturday to sunrise on Sunday. Most ‘Ananites and Karaites rejected such beliefs.\n\n‘Anan developed his movement's core tenets. His \"Sefer HaMiṣwot\" (\"The Book of the Commandments\") was published about 770. He adopted many principles and opinions of other anti-rabbinic forms of Judaism that had previously existed. He took much from the old Sadducees and Essenes, whose remnants still survived, and whose writings—or at least writings ascribed to them—were still in circulation. Thus, for example, these older sects prohibited the burning of any lights and the leaving of one's dwelling on the Sabbath. Unlike the Sadducees, ‘Anan and the Qumran sectaries allowed persons to leave their house, but prohibited leaving one's town or camp. ‘Anan said that one should not leave one's house for frivolous things, but only to go to prayer or to study scripture. The Sadducees required the observation of the new moon to establish the dates of festivals and always held the Shavuot festival on a Sunday.\n\nIn the \"Golden Age of Karaism\" (900–1100) a large number of Karaite works were produced in all parts of the Muslim world. Karaite Jews were able to obtain autonomy from Rabbinite Judaism in the Muslim world and establish their own institutions. Karaites in the Muslim world also obtained high social positions such as tax collectors, doctors, and clerks, and even received special positions in the Egyptian courts. Karaite scholars were among the most conspicuous practitioners in the philosophical school known as Jewish Kalam.\n\nAccording to historian Salo Wittmayer Baron, at one time the number of Jews affiliating with Karaism was as much as 40 percent of world Jewry, and debates between Rabbinist and Karaite leaders were not uncommon.\n\nMost notable among the opposition to Karaite thought and practice at this time are the writings of Rabbi Saadia Gaon, which eventually led to a permanent split between some Karaite and Rabbinite communities.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Russian authorities began to differentiate Karaite Jews from Rabbinite Jews, freeing them from various oppressive laws that affected Rabbinic Jews. The Tsarist governor of the Taurida Governorate, Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, told the Karaite leaders that, even though the Russian Empire liked the idea that the Karaites did not accept the Talmud, they were still Jews and responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus and thus subject to the laws. The leaders, hearing that, devised a ruse by which they could be freed of the oppressive laws and told him that the Karaites had already settled in the Crimea before the death of Jesus. The Tsarist government then said that, if they could prove it, they would be free of the oppressive laws.\n\nThe community leaders charged Abraham Firkovich (1786-1874) with gathering anything that could help show that Karaites were not in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus, and thus not responsible for the crucifixion. Through his work, Firkovich helped establish the idea among the Russian authorities that the Karaites, as descendants of the exiled northern kingdom of Israel, had already gone into exile centuries before the death of Jesus and thus had no responsibility for it. Firkovich referenced tombstones in Crimea (altering the dates) and gathered thousands of Karaite, Rabbinic, and Samaritan manuscripts, including one Rabbinic document from Transcaucasia that claims that the Jews there were descendants of the exiles from the northern Kingdom of Israel. \n\nThese actions convinced the Tsar that Karaite ancestors could not have killed Jesus and that thus their descendants were free of familial guilt.\n\nDespite this, within the community Ḥakhamim still taught that the Karaites were and had always been a part of the Jewish people; prayer was in Hebrew, the lineage of Kohens, Levites, and families of Davidic descent were meticulously preserved, and books printed in Hebrew adamantly identified the Karaites as Jews.\n\nIn 1897 the Russian census counted 12,894 Karaites in the Russian Empire.\n\nBy the early 20th century, most European Karaites were no longer very knowledgeable about the religion and Seraya Shapshal, a Karaite soldier of fortune who had been the tutor of the last Qajar Shah of Persia, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar and a Russian spy, managed about 1911 to get himself elected Chief Ḥakham of the Karaites in the Russian Empire (by that time, due to Russian regulations, the position had become more of a political one than a spiritual one). Influenced by the Pan-Turkic movement in Turkey, Shapshal made his position into that of an Emperor-priest. He changed the title Hakham to \"Ḥakhan\" (a cross between the Turkic titles khagan and khan), forbade the use of Hebrew, and in the 1930s introduced pagan elements (such as the veneration of sacred oak trees in the cemetery). He recognized both Jesus and Muhammad as prophets (thus appeasing both the Russian Orthodox Tsarist government and the Muslim Turkic peoples).\n\nAfter the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, atheism became official state policy in Soviet territories and Karaite religious schools and places of worship were the very first religious institutions closed by the Soviet government. The authorities allowed only the teaching of Shapshalian doctrines about the Karaites, and the official stance according to Soviet law (carried over from Russian Imperial law) erroneously regarded the Karaites as Turkic descendants of the Khazars and not as Jews.\n\nNot all European Karaites accepted the Shapshalian doctrines. Some Hachamim and a small part of the general Karaite population still preserved their Jewish heritage, but most dared not oppose Shapshal openly due to his official standing with regard to the Soviet Union.\n\nAll Jewish men in Egypt were placed in camps during the Six-Day War, and they were kept there for up to three years; Karaites were among the last to leave; most of Egypt's Karaite Jews settled in Israel.\n\nKaraites believe they observe the original religion of Ancient Israel, as prescribed by God in the Tanakh and understood by the Israelites before the Pharisaic period. They do not accept later additions, such as the Talmud of Rabbinic Judaism, as divinely inspired. They place the ultimate responsibility of interpreting the Tanakh on each individual. Karaism holds every interpretation up to the same objective scrutiny regardless of its source.\n\nKaraites believe in one, eternal, omnipresent, incorporeal, and almighty God, Creator of the Universe, who gave the Tanakh to the Israelites through Moses and the Prophets. Karaites trust in Divine providence, and the majority hope for the coming of the Messiah.\n\nKaraites do not accept the existence of an Oral Law because:\n וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵן, קָרָא אֶת־כָּל־דִּבְרֵי הַתּוֹרָה, הַבְּרָכָה, וְהַקְּלָלָה—כְּכָל־הַכָּתוּב, בְּסֵפֶר הַתּוֹרָה.לֹא־הָיָה דָבָר, מִכֹּל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּה מֹשֶׁה—אֲשֶׁר לֹא־קָרָא יְהוֹשֻׁעַ, נֶגֶד כָּל־קְהַל יִשְׂרָאֵל וְהַנָּשִׁים וְהַטַּף, וְהַגֵּר, הַהֹלֵךְ בְּקִרְבָּם.\nAfter that, he [Joshua] read all the words of the Torah, the Blessing and the Curse, according to all that is written in the Torah scroll. There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that walked among them.\n\nSince Joshua read from the Torah every word Moses had written, this implies that Moses had not been given an Oral Law, since Joshua could not have \"read\" an Oral Law from the written Torah. Secondly, there could not have been additional commandments outside of the written Torah, since all the commandments that existed could be read from the Torah scroll.\n\nIn addition to this, Joshua 1:8 states:\n\"This book of the law is not to depart out of your mouth, but you are to meditate on it day and night, so that you may observe to do according to all that is \"written\" in it.\"\n\nKaraite Jews do not object to the idea of a body of interpretation of the Torah, along with extensions and development of non-Rabbinic \"Halakha\" (Jewish law) that strives to adhere to the Tanakh's straightforward meaning. Several hundred such books have been written by various Karaite Ḥakhamim (sages) throughout the movement's history, although most are lost today. The disagreement arises over the Rabbinic tradition's raising of the Talmud and the other writings of the Rabbis above the Torah. The Karaites believe this has led to traditions and customs being kept under Rabbinic law that contradict what is written in the Torah. The Karaites also have their own traditions and customs passed down from their ancestors and religious authorities. These are known as \"Sevel HaYerushah\", which means \"the Yoke [or burden] of Inheritance.\" Most of these practices are kept primarily by traditional Karaites; theoretically, any tradition thereof is said to be rejected if it contradicts the simple meaning of the Tanakh's Text. The vast majority of these traditions are not forced upon any Karaite Jew or convert to Judaism through the Karaite movement, except very few such as donning a head covering in the Karaite synagogues (except the synagogue in Hedgesville, West Virginia).\n\nThose Karaites who are new to the Karaite lifestyle do not have such an inheritance or tradition and tend to rely heavily upon just the Tanakh and those practices mentioned in it, and to adapt Biblical practices to their cultural context. Karaite communities are so small and generally isolated, that their members commonly adopt the customs of their host country. In Israel, too, traditional Karaites tend to be culturally assimilated into mainstream society (both secular and Orthodox).\n\nMany modern Karaite Jews have emerged from the Karaite revival of the late 20th century; the World Karaite Movement was founded by Nehemia Gordon and Ḥakham Meir Rekhavi in the early 1990s. Karaite Jewish University (KJU), approved by the Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim (the Council of Sages) in Israel, was founded to teach an introductory course on Karaite Judaism. It could lead to a student's conversion by a \"Beit Din\" (religious Jewish court) authorized by the Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim. KJU teaches various forms of Karaite Judaism and includes \"Sevel HaYerushah\" in its course materials. Thus, newly admitted converts to Karaite Judaism can choose to accept or reject Sevel HaYerushah.\n\nKaraites (at least in Trakai, Lithuania) no longer follow Biblical dictates for animal sacrifices during holidays.\n\nKaraites use the observational form of the Hebrew calendar used by Jews in the Land of Israel until at least the end of the Second Temple period. Under that system, a new month (Rosh Chodesh) commences with the observation of a new moon in Israel. The start of a new year in the first biblical month is based upon the observation of the agricultural stage of ripeness of the barley (called the \"Aviv\" stage). Before quick worldwide communication was available, Karaites in the Diaspora used a calculated form of the Hebrew calendar similar to, yet different from, that used by Jews in general, for convenience. The Karaites of Trakai follow a \"movable Shabbat\" based on a lunar calendar that accommodates holidays and fast days - one might be on a Thursday and the next on a Sunday.\n\nAs with other Jews, during Shabbat, Karaites attend synagogues to worship and to offer prayers. Most Karaites refrain from sexual relations on that day since they maintain that engaging in them can cause fatigue and copulation, in particular, results in ritual impurity on this holy day, concerns that Rabbinic Judaism ceased to have long ago; additionally, impregnating one's wife is considered \"melakha\" (forbidden work). Their prayer books are composed almost completely of Biblical passages. Karaite Jews often practice full prostration during prayers, while most other Jews no longer pray in this fashion.\n\nUnlike Rabbinic Jews, Karaites do not practice the ritual of lighting Shabbat candles. They have a differing interpretation of the Torah verse, \"You shall not [burn] (Hebrew: \"bi‘er\" the \"pi‘el\" form of \"ba‘ar\") a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of Shabbat.\" In Rabbinic Judaism, the \"qal\" verb form \"ba‘ar\" is understood to mean \"burn\", whereas the \"pi‘el\" form (present here) is understood to be, not intensive as usual but causative, the rule being that the pi‘el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif‘il. Hence \"bi‘er\" means \"kindle\", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits \"starting\" a fire on Shabbat. The vast majority of Karaite Jews hold that, throughout the Tanakh, \"ba‘ar\" explicitly means \"to burn\", while the Hebrew word meaning \"to ignite\" or \"to kindle\" is \"hidliq\". Accordingly, the mainstream in Karaite Judaism takes the passage to mean that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. However, the minority of Karaites who view the prohibition to be on kindling a fire often permit a fire to continue burning into the Sabbath.\n\nHistorically, Karaites refrained from using or deriving benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit during the night of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a fluorescent or LED lamp powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either unplug their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers. Karaites consider producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat, no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a commercial transaction that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the electric meter is considered by them to be a commercial transaction.\n\nKaraites maintain that in the absence of a Temple, ordinary washing with flowing waters (described in the Torah as \"living\"—flowing—water) should be substituted for purification with water that includes ashes obtained through the red heifer burning ritual. Karaites believe that this was the practice before the Tabernacle was built in the Sinai Peninsula following the Exodus. They follow certain Torah laws for avoiding \"Ṭum’at Met\" (ritual impurity caused by contact with a dead body, human bones, graves, or being present in a space under any ceiling where a human died) which are no longer considered relevant in Rabbinic Judaism, except for Kohanim (members of the Jewish priestly class).\n\nThe Karaite method of counting the days from the offering of the ‘Omer is different from the Rabbinic method. The Karaites understand the term \"morrow after the Sabbath\" in Leviticus 23:15–16 to refer to the weekly Sabbath, whereas Rabbinic Judaism interprets it as referring to the day of rest on the first day of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot. So while Rabbinic Judaism begins the count on the 16th of Nisan and celebrates Shavu‘ot on the 6th of Sivan, Karaite Jews count from the day after the weekly Sabbath (i.e., the Sunday) that occurs during the seven days of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot to the day after the seventh weekly Sabbath. They celebrate Shavu‘ot on that Sunday, no matter what the calendar date of that Sunday on which it happens to fall.\n\nA Tzitzit (alternatively spelled Ṣiṣit, plural: Tzitziyot or Ṣiṣiyot) is a knotted or braided tassel worn by observant Jews (both Karaite and Rabbinic) on each of the four corners of what is often an outer garment or their Tallit. The Torah commands Israel to make tassels on the corners of their four-cornered garment containing a thread of \"Tekhelet\" () and repeats this commandment using the word for \"twisted cords\" (\"Gedilim\") instead of \"tassels\" at . The purpose of the tassels is stated in the Book of Numbers as a visual reminder to the Israelites to remember the commandments given by God.\n\nThe thread of Tekhelet is a blue-violet or blue thread, which, according to the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, is to be dyed with a specific kind of dye derived from a mollusc (notably the \"Hexaplex trunculus\" sea snail). Due to a number of factors, including Rome outlawing the use of Tekhelet by commoners, the source and practice of using a Tekhelet thread in Tzitzit was lost for most Rabbinic Jews. Their Tzitziyot are usually all white. Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color of thread is blue-violet and it may be produced from any source, including synthetic industrial dyes, except impure (a state mostly overlapping unkosher) marine creatures, rather than insist on a specific dye. Therefore, they believe that the Rabbinic tradition of relying on a dye from a mollusc is incorrect. They suggest that the source of the dye was indigo or \"Isatis tinctoria\".\n\nRabbinic Jews have specific traditions on how the tassels are to be knotted. Karaite Jews, for their part, have certain traditions on the manner of braiding the tassels, although they are not binding. Consequently, the way the Tzitziyot are made usually distinguishes Karaite Tzitziyot from Rabbinic Tzitziyot.\n\nKaraite Jews do not wear tefillin in any form. According to Karaites, the Biblical passages cited for this practice are metaphorical, and mean to \"remember the Torah always and treasure it\". This is because the commandment in scripture is \"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart\"… \"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for forehead ornaments between thine eyes\". (Deuteronomy 6:5,9) Since words cannot be on one's heart, or bound on one's hand, the entire passage is understood metaphorically. Furthermore, the same expressions (\"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand\" as well as \"and they shall be as frontal ornaments between thine eyes\") are used in Exodus 13:9 in reference to the commandments of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot, in Exodus 13:16 in reference to the ritual of redeeming the first born, in Deuteronomy 6:8 in reference to the ‘Aseret HaDevarim (the Ten Utterances, usually mistranslated as \"the Ten Commandments\"), and in Deuteronomy 11:18 in reference to all the words of the Torah, indicating that, from a Karaite perspective, they must be metaphorical in nature (because one could never ritually \"write\" and \"bind\" upon their hearts themselves).\n\nLike Tefillin, Karaites interpret the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as a metaphorical admonition, specifically, to keep the Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage is understood as a metaphor. Therefore, they do not put up mezuzot, although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the Ten Commandments on their doorposts.\n\nHowever, a Christian account in the 19th century tells of a Karaite synagogue in Constantinople that reportedly had a mezuzah. In Israel, in an effort to make Rabbinic Jews comfortable, many Karaite Jews do put up mezuzot, but not out of belief that it is commanded.\n\nIn both Deuteronomy 23:3, and Zechariah 9:6, the Hebrew word \"mamzer\" is referenced alongside the nations of Ammon and Moab (in Deut 23:3), and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod (in Zech 9:5–6). From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew word \"mamzer\", which modern Rabbinical Jews understand to refer to either children born from adultery or from incest (Talmud Bavli, Masekhet Yevamot), to actually speak of a nation or people. Karaites think that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, (and this was also the understanding of the Rabbinist commentator Yehudah ben Shemu’el ibn Bil‘am). Several Medieval Rabbinite Jewish sages felt it necessary to debate this topic with Medieval Karaite Jewish sages.\n\nKaraite Judaism defines the Arba`at haMinim somewhat differently than Rabbinic Jews, i.e. (1) fruit of splendorous tree (\"Peri `Eṣ Hadar\"), which need not be the Etrog (yellow Citrus fruit) demanded by Rabbinic law, yet may be either any seasonal fruit tree considered splendorous by an individual Jew, or branches of olive trees featuring the olives, that were considered splendorous by the Judean Israelites in the generation of Nehemiah, as seen in Neḥemyah 8; (2) date palm fronds (\"Kappoth Temarim\") instead of the closed palm frond used by Rabbinical Jews; (3) branches of thickly leaved trees (\"‘Eṣ ‘Avoth\") which may be from fig, laurel and Eucalyptus rather than myrtle branches only; and (4) willow branches (\"‘Aravoth Naḥal\") e.g. Maple, Oak, Yew and Butternut, as opposed to the Rabbinically dictated willow tree's boughs. Karaite Jews have always understood the \"Arba`at haMinim\" to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the Sukkah (pl. \"Sukkot\"); they are not made into a lulav and shaken in six directions, as is the Rabbinic practice. In the book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date palm fronds, myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah's construction.\n\nNehemiah 8:14–15\n\"And they found written in the Torah, how YHWH had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in Sukkot in the feast of the seventh month; and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go forth into the mountains, and fetch olive branches, and oil tree branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thickly leaved trees, to make Sukkot, as it is written.\"\n\nKaraite Judaism follows patrilineal descent, meaning a Jew is someone whose father is Jewish, or who has undergone a formal conversion, since almost all Jewish descent in the Tanakh is traced patrilineally.\n\nHowever, anyone who formally accepts the God of Israel as their own God, the people of Israel as their own people, and is circumcised (males only), is a fully established member of the people of Israel (Jew); Karaites believe this should be done after living among Karaite Jews and studying the Tanakh in the form of a vow (the dominant position among modern Karaites maintains that this oath should be taken before a Karaite Beit Din whose members act on the behalf of the Israeli Council of Sages), see Exodus 12:43–49, Ruth 1:16, Esther 8:17, and Isaiah 56:6–7; also Ezekiel the prophet states that Sojourners (\"resident aliens\" or \"strangers\") who have joined themselves to the Children of Israel will be given land inheritance among the Tribes of Israel among whom they live during the final redemption.\n\nSome, such as the Karaites Jews in Khorasan (Persia) viewed it in Medieval times as a Mitzvah to do so because the name appears some 6800 times throughout the Tanakh (Old Testament). Today, publicly uttering the Tetragrammaton (4 letter name) of God in Hebrew is a controversial issue among Karaites and indeed all Jews. Virtually all traditional Karaites view the pronunciation of God's name to be blasphemous, and adhere to the Rabbinic tradition of substituting \"Adonai\", when coming across YHVH while reading. Other Karaites and some of those coming from a Rabbinic background like Nehemia Gordon and Ḥakham Meir Rekhavi, as well as some joiners to the people of Israel through Karaite Judaism such as James Walker and Daniel ben Immanuel, do not consider the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton to be forbidden. Although, there is disagreement among scholars as to the correct pronunciation.\n\nKaraism has produced a vast library of commentaries and polemics, especially during its \"Golden Age\". These writings prompted new and complete defenses of the Mishnah and the Talmud, the culmination of these in the writings of Saadia Gaon and his criticisms of Karaism. Though he opposed Karaism, the Rabbinic commentator Abraham ibn Ezra regularly quoted Karaite commentators, particularly Yefet ben ‘Eli, to the degree that a legend exists among some Karaites that Ibn Ezra was ben ‘Eli's student.\n\nThe most well-known Karaite polemic is Yiṣḥaq ben Avraham of Troki's \"Faith Strengthened\" (), a comprehensive counter-Christian missionary polemic, which was later translated into Latin by Johann Christoph Wagenseil as part of a larger collection of Jewish anti-Christian polemics entitled \"Tela Ignea Satanæ, sive Arcani et Horribiles Judæorum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri\" (Altdorf, 1681: \"The Fiery Darts of Satan, or the Arcane and Horrible Books of the Jews Against Christ, God, and the Christian Religion\"). Many counter-missionary materials produced today are based upon or cover the same themes as this book.\n\nScholarly studies of Karaite writings are still in their infancy, and owe greatly to the Firkovich collections of Karaite manuscripts in the National Library of Russia that have become accessible after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The cataloguing efforts of scholars at the Bibliothèque nationale de France and in the United States and England is continuing to yield new insights into Karaite literature and thought.\n\nAaron ben Moses ben Asher was a Jewish scholar from Tiberias, famous as the most authoritative of the Tiberian Masoretes, and a member of a family who had been involved in creating and maintaining the Masoretic Text (authoritative text of the Hebrew scripture), for at least five generations. His Tiberian vocalization of the Bible is still, for all intents and purposes, the text all Jews continue to use, and he was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian.\n\nHis \"Sefer Diqduqei HaTe‘amim\" (\"Grammar of the Punctuation/Vocalizations\") was an original collection of grammatical rules and Masoretic information. Grammatical principles were not at that time considered worthy of independent study. The value of this work is that the grammatical rules presented by ben Asher reveal the linguistic background of vocalization for the first time. He had a tremendous influence on the world of Biblical criticism.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, certain scholars suggested that Aharon Ben Asher might have been a Karaite and not a rabbinic Jew. Aharon Dothan has examined this issue from many angles, and his conclusion is that Ben Asher was a rabbinic Jew, but Raphael Zer has raised this issue again and presented new evidence.\n\nIn 989, an unknown scribe of a former \"Nevi'im\" manuscript vouched for the care with which his copy was written by claiming that he had vocalized and added the Masoretic text \"from the books that were vocalized by Aaron ben Moses Ben-Asher\". Maimonides, by accepting the views of ben Asher in regard to open and closed sections, helped establish and spread his authority. Referring to a Bible manuscript then in Egypt, he wrote: \"All relied on it, since it was corrected by Ben-Asher and was worked on and analyzed by him for many years, and was proofread many times in accordance with the masorah, and I based myself on this manuscript in the Sefer Torah that I wrote\".\n\nEstimates of the size of the modern Karaite movement put the number at 4,000 Karaites in the United States, some 80 Constantinopolitan Karaites in Turkey, 35,000-40,000 in Israel, the largest communities being in Ramla, Ashdod and Beersheba, 1,196 in Ukraine (with Crimea), 300 in Lithuania and 205 in Russia. At the Polish census of 2002, only 45 people declared themselves \"Karaims\", including 43 Polish citizens.\n\nDuring the early 1920s a British mandate official in Jerusalem records visiting the Karaite synagogue, which he describes as being \"small, mediaeval, semi-underground\" serving \"Jerusalem's tiny colony of Qaraites\".\n\nIn the early 1950s, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel originally objected to the immigration of Karaite Jews to Israel, and unsuccessfully tried to obstruct it. In 2007, however, Rabbi David Ḥayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netayana was quoted in \"The Jerusalem Post\" as saying, \"A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary.\"\n\nMoshe Marzouk, one of the Egyptian Jews executed in 1954 for planting bombs in Cairo in the service of Israeli Military Intelligence (the Lavon Affair) was a Karaite. Marzouk was considered a hero in Israel; however, his Karaite identity was downplayed in newspapers, which usually just described him as an Egyptian Jew. However, in 2001, the Israeli government, through the Israel Postal Authority, issued a special memorial sheet honoring him and many other Karaite Jews that gave their lives for Israel.\n\nIn Israel, the Karaite Jewish leadership is directed by a group called Universal Karaite Judaism. Most of the members of its Board of Ḥakhamim are of Egyptian Jewish descent. The largest Karaite community today resides in Ashdod \nThere are about 4,000 Karaites living in the United States. The Congregation B'nai Israel is located in Daly City, California, which is a suburb of San Francisco. It is the only Karaite synagogue in the United States with a permanent dedicated facility. The leaders of the congregation are of Egyptian Karaite extraction. One notable congregant, Mark Kheder, the Synagogue's treasurer, has described his internment in an Egyptian prisoner of war camp during the 1967 Six-Day war. The congregation's acting Rav (Ḥakham), Joe Pessah, was also among those who were arrested by the Egyptian government. Another, much smaller congregation, Karaite Jewish Congregation Oraḥ Ṣaddiqim, exists in Albany, NY, but they have yet to find a permanent dedicated facility and, in the mean time, continue to use a room in the home of their Ḥakham, Avraham Ben-Raḥamiël Qanaï, as their temporary synagogue.\n\nOn 1 August 2007, some members of the first graduating class of Karaite Jewish University were converted, representing the first new officially authorized members into Karaite Judaism in 542 years. At a ceremony in its Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors joined the Jewish people by taking the same oath that Ruth took. The group's course of study lasted over one year. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.\nOn 17 February 2009, the second graduating class of converts took the oath. This included 11 adults and 8 minors.\n\nThere are about 80 Karaites living in Istanbul, Turkey, where the only Karaite synagogue in Turkey, the \"Kahal haKadosh Bene Mikra\", is still functional (on Shabbat and holy days) in the Hasköy neighborhood in the European part of the city.\n\nIn Poland, Karaites are a recognized minority, represented by the Association of Polish Karaites () and the Karaite Religious Association in the Polish Republic (). Karaites live primarily in and around Warsaw, Wrocław and Tricity, they are linguistically assimilated.\n\nIn 2016, the Religious Council of Karaite Jews unanimously reelected their chief rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Piroz, for another four-year term. Piroz has been serving as chief rabbi since 2011.\n\nRabbinic Judaism's scholars, such as Maimonides, write that people who deny the divine authority of the Oral Torah are to be considered among the heretics. However, at the same time, Maimonides holds (\"Hilkhot Mamrim\" 3:3) that most of the Karaites and others who claim to deny the \"oral teachings\" are not to be held accountable for their errors in the law because they are led into error by their parents and are similar to a tinok shenishba (a captive baby), or to one who was forced.\n\nRabbinic scholars have traditionally held that, because the Karaites do not observe the rabbinic law on divorce, there is a strong presumption that they are mamzerim (adulterine bastards), so that marriage with them is forbidden even if they return to Rabbinic Judaism. Some recent Ashkenazi Ḥaredi scholars have held that Karaites should be regarded as Gentiles in all respects, though this is not universally accepted. They hasten to add that this opinion is not intended to insult the Karaites, but only to give individual Karaites the option of integrating into mainstream Judaism by way of conversion. In contrast, in 1971, Ovadia Yosef, who was then the Chief Rabbi of the Sefaradim and ‘Edot HaMizraḥ of Israel, proclaimed that Karaites are Jews \"LeKhol Davar\" (literally, for all purposes) and that it is permissible for Rabbinic Jews to marry with them.\n\nIn response to the position taken by the Karaites in regards to the authority of the Talmud, Orthodox Judaism counters first that the majority of the Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last Sanhedrin, a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally \"Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai\". The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of Zadok who served as priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. This is essentially the same view held by the Sadducees and Boethusians during the second Temple period. Secondly Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states \"this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, to say, who shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and cause us to understand it, that we do it?\" indicating the Torah could easily be understood by the average Israelite. Examples cited in Rabbinic Judaism as laws requiring rabbinic explanation include:\n\nOrthodox Judaism also notes that the Torah was never meant to be observed as a personal covenant between the individual Jew and God, but a national covenant wherein the Torah functions as the constitution of Israel as a whole. Orthodox Jews point out that the Torah could never be enforced as a national law, as it was during the time of Joshua, King David, and Ezra, if every individual Jew had their own opinion on how to observe its commandments. In order for the Torah to properly govern the Jewish people, and for its laws be legally enforced with the punishments and penalties prescribed in the Torah, those laws must be legislated and clearly defined by a ruling Sanhedrin. Karaites counter that the enforcement of the Torah on a national scale can only be legislated by the descendants of Zadok in the Temple in Jerusalem as per the Torah (Deuteronomy 17) and prophets (Ezekiel 44) not by a collection of opinions by various rabbis.\n\nFor Karaites, in sum, the rabbinic interpretations above, as codified in oral law, are only one form of interpretation. They are not divinely ordained, and they are neither binding halakhah nor practical religious law.\n\nA person whose mother was a Karaite Jew is regarded as halakhically Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate. By contrast, somebody who is patrilineally Jewish (one whose father is Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the \"Mo′eṣet HaḤakhamim\" (the Karaite Council of Sages) on the condition that they were raised Jewish during childhood. Although it is widely accepted that Karaite Jews are halakhically Jewish (apparently with the exception of those who join the Jewish people through the Karaite movement), there is still a question as to whether or not marriage between the Karaite and Rabbinite communities is permitted. Two Sephardi chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron and Ovadia Yosef encouraged such marriages, hoping it would help Karaites to assimilate into mainstream Judaism. Maimonides decreed that Jews raised in a Karaite household are considered to be \"Tinoq she'Nishba\", like babies taken captive by non-Jews; they cannot be punished for their supposedly wayward behavior, because it is the result of their parents' influence.\n\nSince the early 2010s, there has been a resurgence in the questioning of the Jewish identity of Karaites by Israel's chief rabbinate. According to the rabbinate's spokesman, \"Israel is a Jewish state and Jews have superior rights. But the Karaites are not Jewish.\" This has led to protestations from R' Moshe Firrouz, head of the Karaites' Council of Sages, that \"the rabbinate is denying us our religious freedom.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "590270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590270", "title": "Miko", "text": "Miko\n\nIn Shinto, a miko (巫女) is a shrine (jinja) maiden or a supplementary priestess. Miko were once likely seen as a shaman but are understood in modern Japanese culture to be an institutionalized role in daily shrine life, trained to perform tasks, ranging from sacred cleansing to performing the sacred Kagura dance.\n\nThe traditional attire of a \"miko\" would be a pair of red hakama (long, divided trousers) or a long, red, slightly pleated skirt tied with a bow, a white haori (kimono jacket), and some white or red hair ribbons. In Shintoism, the color white symbolizes purity.\n\nTraditional Miko tools include azusayumi (梓弓 or “catalpa bow”) the tamagushi (玉串 or “offertory sakaki-tree branches”) and the gehōbako (外法箱 or the “supernatural box that contains dolls, animal and human skulls ... [and] Shinto prayer beads”).\n\nThe miko also use bells, drums, candles, and bowls of rice in ceremonies.\n\nThe Japanese words \"miko\" and \"fujo\" (\"female shaman\" and \"shrine maiden\" respectively) are usually written 巫女 as a compound of the kanji 巫 (\"shaman\"), and 女 (\"woman\"). \"Miko\" was archaically written 神子 (literally \"kami\" or \"god\" + \"child\") and 巫子 (\"shaman child\").\n\n\"Miko\" once performed spirit possession and \"takusen\" as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. Miko at shrines today do no more than sit at reception counters and perform kagura dance. In addition to a medium or a miko (or a Geki, which is a male shaman), the site of a \"takusen\" may occasionally also be attended by a sayaniwa who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present. Kamigakari and takusen may be passive, when a person speaks after suddenly becoming involuntarily possessed or has a dream revelation; they can also be active, when spirit possession is induced in a specific person to ascertain the divine will or gain a divine revelation.\n\nMiko are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for \"shrine-attached Miko\" and 43 for \"non-shrine-attached Miko\". Other names are \"ichiko\" (巫子, \"shaman child\", or 市子, \"market/town child\", both likely instances of ateji) meaning \"female medium; fortuneteller\", and \"reibai\" (霊媒) meaning \"spirit go-between, medium\").\n\nIn English, the word is often translated as \"shrine maiden\", though freer renderings often simply use the phrase \"female shaman\" (shamanka) or, as Lafcadio Hearn translated it, \"Divineress\".\n\nSome scholars prefer the transliteration, contrasting the Japanese Mikoism with other Asian terms for female shamans. As Fairchild explains:\n\nWomen played an important role in a region stretching from Manchuria, China, Korea and Japan to the Ryukyu Islands. In Japan these women were priests, soothsayers, magicians, prophets and shamans in the folk religion, and they were the chief performers in organized Shintoism. These women were called Miko, and the author calls the complex \"Mikoism\" for lack of a suitable English word.\n\nMiko traditions date back to the prehistoric Jōmon period of Japan, when female shamans who would go into “trances and convey the words of the gods” (the kami), an act comparable with \"the pythia or sibyl in Ancient Greece.\"\n\nThe earliest record of anything resembling the term \"miko\", is of the Chinese reference to Himiko, Japan's earliest substantiated historical reference (not legendary), however it is completely unknown whether Himiko was a miko, or even if miko existed in those days.\n\nThe early Miko was an important social figure who was \"associated with the ruling class\". \"In addition to her ritual performances of ecstatic trance\", writes Kuly, \"[the Miko] performed a variety of religious and political functions\". One traditional school of Miko, Kuly adds, \"claimed to descend from the Goddess Uzume\".\n\nDuring the Nara period (710–794) and Heian period (794–1185), government officials tried to control Miko practices. As Fairchild notes:\n\nIn 780 A.D. and in 807 A.D. official bulls against the practice of ecstasy outside of the authority of the shrines were published. These bulls were not only aimed at ecstasy, but were aimed at magicians, priests, sorcerers, etc. It was an attempt to gain complete control, while at the same time it aimed at eradicating abuses which were occurring.\n\nDuring the feudal Kamakura period (1185–1333) when Japan was controlled by warring \"shōgun\" states:\n\nThe Miko was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy. Disassociated from a religious context, her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a non-ecclesiastical nature. The travelling Miko, known as the aruki Miko, became associated with prostitution.\n\nDuring in the Edo period (1603–1868), writes Groemer, \"the organizational structures and arts practiced by female shamans in eastern Japan underwent significant transformations\". Though in the Meiji period (1868–1912), many shamanistic practices were outlawed:\n\nAfter 1867 the Meiji government's desire to create a form of state Shinto headed by the emperor—the shaman-in-chief of the nation—meant that Shinto needed to be segregated from both Buddhism and folk-religious beliefs. As a result, official discourse increasingly repeated negative views of Miko and their institutions.\n\nThere was an edict called \"Miko Kindanrei\" (巫女禁断令) enforced by security forces loyal to Imperial forces, forbidding all spiritual practices by miko, issued in 1873, by the Religious Affairs Department (教部).\n\nThe Shinto kagura dance ceremony, which originated with \"ritual dancing to convey divine oracles\", has been transformed in the 20th century into a popular ceremonial dance called Miko-mai (巫女舞) or Miko-kagura (巫女神楽).\n\nThe position of a shaman passed from generation to generation, but sometimes someone not directly descended from a shaman went voluntary into training or was appointed by the village chieftains. To achieve this, such a person had to have some potential. Several characteristics could be seen as a sign a person was called towards shamanism: neurosis, hallucinations, unusual behavior and hysteria. These conditions are still referred to as \"‘shamanistic sicknesses’\".\n\nTo become a shaman, the girl (still at a young age, mostly after the start of the menstruation cycle) had to undergo very intensive training specific to the \"kuchiyose miko\". An acknowledged elder shaman, who could be a family member (like an aunt) of a member of the tribe, would teach the girl in training the techniques required to be in control of her trance state. This would be done by rituals including washings with cold water, regular purifying, abstinence and the observation of the common taboos like death, illness and blood. She would also study how to communicate with \"kami\" and spirits of the deceased, as a medium, by being possessed by those spirits. This was achieved by chanting and dancing, thus therefore the girl was taught melodies and intonations that were used in songs, prayers and magical formulas, supported by drum and rattlers. \n\nOther attributes used for rituals were mirrors (to attract the kami) and swords (katana). She also needed the knowledge of the several names of the kami that were important for her village, as well as their function. Finally she learned a secret language, only known by insiders (other shamans of the tribe) and so discovered the secrets of fortune-telling and magical formulas.\nAfter the training, which could take three to seven years, the girl would get her initiation rite to become a real shaman. This mystic ceremony was witnessed by her mentor, other elders and fellow shamans. The girl wore a white shroud as a symbol for the end of her previous life. The elders began chanting and after a while the girl started to shiver. Next, her mentor would ask the girl which \"kami\" had possessed her and therefore she would serve. As soon as she answered, the mentor would throw a rice cake into her face, causing the girl to faint. The elders would bring the girl to a warm bed and keep her warm until she woke up. When the whole ordeal was over and the girl had woken up, she was permitted to wear a beautifully coloured wedding dress and perform the corresponding tradition of the wedding toast.\n\nThe resemblance of a wedding ceremony as the initiation rite suggests that the trainee, still a virgin, had become the bride of the kami she served (this is called a \"Tamayori Hime\" 玉依姫). During her trance, said kami had requested the girl to his shrine. In some areas of Japan she had to bring a pot filled with rice (\"meshibitsu\") and a pan. An old, since long forsaken, practice was the sexual intercourse with a shintô priest who would represent the kami. As a result of this intercourse, the shaman would have the \"kami’s\" baby (\"mikogami\" 御子神 ). \n\nIn some cases the girls or women were visited at night by a travelling spirit (\"marebito\" 稀人). After this visit the woman made her new position of being possessed by a \"kami\" known to the rest of her village by placing a white, feathered arrow on the roof of her house.\n\nModern miko are often seen at Shinto shrines, where they assist with shrine functions, perform ceremonial dances, offer \"omikuji\" fortune telling, sell souvenirs, and assist a Kannushi in Shinto rites. Kuly describes the contemporary miko: \"A far distant relative of her premodern shamanic sister, she is most probably a university student collecting a modest wage in this part-time position.\"\n\nThe ethnologist Kunio Yanagita (1875–1962), who first studied Japanese female shamans, differentiated them into \"jinja miko\" (神社巫女 or \"shrine shamans\") who dance with bells and participate in \"yudate\" (湯立て or \"boiling water\") rituals, \"kuchiyose miko\" (口寄せ巫女 or \"spirit medium shamans\") who speak on behalf of the deceased, and \"kami uba\" (神姥 or \"god women\") who engage in cult worship and invocations (for instance, the Tenrikyo founder Nakayama Miki).\n\nResearchers have further categorized contemporary miko in terms of their diverse traditions and practices. Such categorizations include blind \"itako\" (concentrated in north and east Japan), mostly blind \"okamin\" (north and east Japan), blind \"waka\" or \"owaka\" (northeastern Japan), \"moriko\" (north and east of Tokyo), \"nono\" (central Japan), blind \"zatokaka\" (northwest Japan), \"sasa hataki\" who tap \"sasa\" (\"bamboo grass\") on their faces (northeast of Tokyo), plus family and village organizations. Others have divided miko or fujo by blindness between blind \"ogamiya\" (尾上屋 or \"invocation specialist\") or \"ogamisama\" who perform \"kuchiyose\" and spirit mediumship and sighted miko' or \"kamisama\" who perform divination and invocations.\n\nIn the eclectic Shugendō religion, male priests who practiced ecstasy often married miko. Many scholars identify shamanic miko characteristics in Shinshūkyō (\"New Religions\") such as Sukyo Mahikari, Ōmoto, and Shinmeiaishinkai.\n\n\n\n"}

An Indian priest, Tom Ozhonaniel, was kidnapped. \n\nThe identities of the attackers are unknown. Media outlets published a statement attributed to Ansar al-Sharia, one of the active jihadist organizations in the country, denies any relation to the incident.\n\n\"The Times of India\" posited the attackers belonged to the Yemen-based affiliate of the Islamic State (ISIS) group.\n\nChristian presence in Yemen goes back to the fourth century AD to hold a number of Himyarites believers due to the efforts of Theophilos the Indian. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but estimated at between 3,000 and 25,000 people, and most of them are refugees or temporary residents.\n\nFreedom of worship, conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized in the Constitution or as laws or legal rights. At the same time, Wahabbi activities linked to Al-Islah were being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance, which says that its tasks \"to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens.\"\n\nThe Missionaries of Charity, founded by Mother Teresa, have worked in Aden since 1992, and the order has three other centers in Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two from India and the third from the Philippines, at the hands of a member of Al-Islah Abdullah al-Nashiri, arguing that they were calling for conversion to Christianity. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel. Survivors say that the hospital was \"a political football\" often raised by Islamists (Al-Islah), who talked about it in mosques and hospital workers describing Hospital workers as \"spies\". But they emphasized that these opinions are a minority among Yemenis.\n\nIn December 2015, a Catholic church in Aden was destroyed. Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from John Bosco remained, and twenty workers of charitable missions in the country, described by Pope Francis by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict. He called the Apostolic Vicar of Southern Arabia to pray for all the oppressed and tortured, expelled from their homes, and killed unjustly. The Missionaries of Charity were not actively engaged in evangelization according to the testimonies of beneficiaries of its services.\n\nThe attack on the house took place at 12:00pm local time, when two armed men had persuaded the guards to let them through the main gate having claimed they were going to visit their elderly mother. Once they entered, they began to shoot randomly, according to Indian officials at the Foreign Ministry.\n\nInside the building, nuns were preparing breakfast. Four of the five nuns sensed danger and tried to hide in a convent, where they were shot dead in an open area. All the rooms were stormed and the meeting tent was destroyed, as were statues and crucifixes in the small church. In one picture, two nuns are shown lying on the ground in a dirt yard, after having been shot execution-style. The attackers were dressed in a \"semi-blue\" uniform. According to the Catholic News Agency, the last prayer said by the nuns before they were killed says:\nSunita Kumar, a spokesman for the charity's mission, described the killers as \"demented\", adding \"there is no other explanation as to why armed people would enter the premises of the home and shoot down innocent, harmless nurses who had dedicated their lives to serving others.\" Bishop Michael Lewis of the Anglican Church said the compound contained seventy or eighty elderly people, many destitute. The Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin commented that Pope Francis prayed that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.\n\nPope Francis described the crime as \"satanic\", stating that the nuns were \"martyrs of today\", adding that they were killed by both the attackers, and a \"globalization of indifference.\". His statement was published, including the following quote:\nThe Missionaries of Charity announced it would continue its work in Yemen despite the violence and danger.\n\nAn Indian priest, Tom Ozhonaniel, was also kidnapped. Since, he has appeared in several videos chastising the lack of effort to release him and pleading for his life.\n\n"}

Reconstructionism attempts to re-establish historical polytheistic religions in the modern world, in contrast with neopagan syncretic movements like Wicca, and \"channeled\" movements like Germanic mysticism or Theosophy.\n\nWhile the emphasis on historical accuracy may imply historical reenactment, the desire for continuity in ritual traditions (orthopraxy) is a common characteristic of religion in general, as seen in Anglican ritualism, or in much Christian liturgy.\n\nD. H. Lawrence put a sketch of a fictional program into the mouth of a character in \"The Plumed Serpent\" (published in 1926):\nSo if I want Mexicans to learn the name of Quetzalcoatl, it is because I want them to speak with the tongues of their own blood. I wish the Teutonic world would once more think in terms of Thor and Wotan, and the tree Igdrasil. And I wish the Druidic world would see, honestly, that in the mistletoe is their mystery, and that they themselves are the Tuatha De Danaan, alive, but submerged. And a new Hermes should come back to the Mediterranean, and a new Ashtaroth to Tunis; and Mithras again to Persia, and Brahma unbroken to India, and the oldest of dragons to China.\nThe term \"Reconstructionist Paganism\" was likely coined by Isaac Bonewits in the late 1970s. Bonewits has said that he is not sure whether he \"got this use of the term from one or more of the other culturally focused Neopagan movements of the time, or if [he] just applied it in a novel fashion.\" Margot Adler later used the term \"Pagan Reconstructionists\" in the 1979 edition of \"Drawing Down the Moon\" to refer to those who endeavour through scholarly research and use of folklore, to revive or \"reconstruct\" a historically accurate, pre-Christian spiritual practice. This emphasis on reconstruction contrasts with the more fanciful and eclectic approaches to paganism, as seen for example in Wicca.\n\nLinzie (2004) enumerates the difference between modern reconstructionist polytheism, (such as modern Hellenismos), and \"classical\" paganism as found in eighteenth to mid-twentieth century movements, (including Germanic mysticism, early Neodruidism and Wicca). Aspects of the former, not found in the latter, are as follows:\n\n\nThe use of the terms \"Pagan\" and \"Neopagan\" to apply to polytheistic reconstructionists is controversial. Some reconstructionist, ethnic and indigenous religious groups take great issue with being referred to as \"Pagan\" or \"Neopagan,\" viewing \"Pagan\" as a pejorative term used in the past by institutions attempting to destroy their cultures and religions. In addition, reconstructionists may choose to reject the terms \"Pagan\" and \"Neopagan\" in order to distance themselves from aspects of popular Neopaganism, such as eclecticism, cultural appropriation, the practice of magic, and a tendency to conduct rituals within a Wiccan-derived format, that they find irrelevant or even inimical to their religious practice.\n\nEven among those reconstructionist groups who see themselves as part of the broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with what they see as the more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and are unwilling to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.\n\n\n\n"}

The 1901 census noted that people using the Shoorsaini name were by then found only in Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. Sainis also claim themselves to be Mali Rajputs.\n\nAs both a statutory agricultural tribe and a designated martial race during the British Raj era that followed the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Sainis had been chiefly engaged in both agriculture and military service since then until recent times. However, since the independence of India, Sainis have diversified into different trades and professions other than military and agriculture. Sainis are now also seen in increasing numbers as businessmen, lawyers, professors, civil servants, engineers, doctors and research scientists, etc.\n\nSainis profess in both Hinduism and Sikhism. They have a national organisation called \"Saini Rajput Mahasabha\" located in Delhi, established in 1920.\n\nThe Sainis of Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur districts claim to be the descendants of the Rajputs of the Yaduvanshi or Surasena lineage who ruled these kingdoms, who came to these areas to avoid forced conversion to Islam.\n\nGahlot and Banshidhar (1989) indicate some commonality in origin with Rajput Malis of Rajputana who are also stated to be of Rajput descent but these scholars add that out of the two the Sainis continued to maintain their Rajput character despite adoption of agriculture in the era of Muslim ascendancy.

{"id": "2287171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2287171", "title": "Secularism in India", "text": "Secularism in India\n\nSecularism in India means equal treatment of all religions by the state.\n\nWith the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India enacted in 1976, the Preamble to the Constitution asserted that India is a secular nation. However, neither India's constitution nor its laws define the relationship between religion and state. The laws implicitly require the state and its institutions to recognise and accept all religions, enforce parliamentary laws instead of religious laws, and respect pluralism. India does not have an official state religion. In matters of law in modern India, however, the applicable code of law is unequal, and India's personal laws - on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, alimony - varies with an individual's religion. Muslim Indians have Sharia-based Muslim Personal Law, while Hindu, Christian and Sikh Indians live under common law. The attempt to respect unequal, religious law has created a number of issues in India such as acceptability of child marriage, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, extra judicial unilateral divorce rights favorable to some males, and conflicting interpretations of religious books.\n\nSecularism as practiced in India, with its marked differences with Western practice of secularism, is a controversial topic in India. Supporters of the Indian concept of secularism claim it respects. Supporters of this form of secularism claim that any attempt to introduce a uniform civil code, that is equal laws for every citizen irrespective of his or her religion, would impose majoritarian Hindu sensibilities and ideals. Opponents argue that India's acceptance of Sharia and religious laws violates the principle of Equality before the law.\n\nSecularism is a divisive, politically charged topic in India.\n\nIndian religions are known to have co-existed and evolved together for many centuries before the arrival of Islam in the 12th century, followed by Mughal and colonial era. Ashoka about 2200 years ago, Harsha about 1400 years ago accepted and patronised different religions. The people in ancient South Asia had freedom of religion, and the state granted citizenship to each individual regardless of whether someone’s religion was Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or any other. Ellora cave temples built next to each other between 5th and 10th centuries, for example, shows a coexistence of religions and a spirit of acceptance of different faiths.\n\nThis approach to interfaith relations changed with the arrival of Islam and establishment of Delhi Sultanate in North India by the 12th century, followed by Deccan Sultanate in Central India. The political doctrines of Islam, as well as its religious views were at odds with doctrines of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Indian religions. New temples and monasteries were not allowed. As with Levant, Southeast Europe and Spain, Islamic rulers in India treated Hindus as dhimmis in exchange of annual payment of jizya taxes, in a sharia-based state jurisprudence. With the arrival of Mughal era, Sharia was imposed with continued zeal, with Akbar - the Mughal Emperor - as the first significant exception. Akbar sought to fuse ideas, professed equality between Islam and other religions of India, forbade forced conversions to Islam, abolished religion-based discriminatory jizya taxes, and welcomed building of Hindu temples. However, the descendants of Akbar, particularly Aurangzeb, reverted to treating Islam as the primary state religion, destruction of temples, and reimposed religion-based discriminatory jizya taxes.\nAfter Aurangzeb, India came into control of East India Company and the British Raj. The colonial administrators did not separate religion from state, but marked the end of unequal hierarchy between Islam and Hinduism, and reintroduced the notion of equality before the law for Hindus, Christians and Muslims. The British Empire sought commerce and trade, with a policy of neutrality to all of India’s diverse religions. Before 1858, the Britishers followed the policy of patronizing and supporting the native religions as the earlier rulers had done. By the mid-19th century, the British Raj administered India, in matters related to marriage, inheritance of property and divorces, according to personal laws based on each Indian subject’s religion, according to interpretations of respective religious documents by Islamic jurists, Hindu pundits and other religious scholars. In 1864, the Raj eliminated all religious jurists, pandits and scholars because the interpretations of the same verse or religious document varied, the scholars and jurists disagreed with each other, and the process of justice had become inconsistent and suspiciously corrupt. The late 19th century marked the arrival of Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim personal laws, where the governance did not separate the state and religion, but continued to differentiate and administer people based on their personal religion. The British Raj provided the Indian Christians, Indian Zoroastrians and others with their own personal laws, such as the Indian Succession Act of 1850, Special Marriage Act of 1872 and other laws that were similar to Common Laws in Europe.\n\nAlthough the British administration provided India with a common law, it's divide and rule policy contributed to promoting discord between communities. The Morley-Minto reforms provided separate electorate to Muslims, justifying the demands of the Muslim league.\n\nIn the first half of 20th century, the British Raj faced increasing amounts of social activism for self-rule by a disparate groups such as those led by Hindu Gandhi and Muslim Jinnah; the colonial administration, under pressure, enacted a number of laws before India’s independence in 1947, that continue to be the laws of India in 2013. One such law enacted during the colonial era was the 1937 Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, which instead of separating state and religion for Western secularism, did the reverse. \n\nIt, along with additional laws such as Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939 that followed, established the principle that religious laws of Indian Muslims can be their personal laws. It also set the precedent that religious law, such as sharia, can overlap and supersede common and civil laws, that elected legislators may not revise or enact laws that supersede religious laws, that people of one nation need not live under the same laws, and that law enforcement process for different individuals shall depend on their religion. The Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 continues to be the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.\n\nThe 7th schedule of Indian constitution places religious institutions, charities and trusts into so-called Concurrent List, which means that both the central government of India, and various state governments in India can make their own laws about religious institutions, charities and trusts. If there is a conflict between central government enacted law and state government law, then the central government law prevails. This principle of overlap, rather than separation of religion and state in India was further recognised in a series of constitutional amendments starting with Article 290 in 1956, to the addition of word ‘secular’ to the Preamble of Indian Constitution in 1975.\nThe overlap of religion and state, through Concurrent List structure, has given various religions in India, state support to religious schools and personal laws. This state intervention while resonant with the dictates of each religion, are unequal and conflicting. For example, a 1951 Religious and Charitable Endowment Indian law allows state governments to forcibly take over, own and operate Hindu temples, and collect revenue from offerings and redistribute that revenue to any non-temple purposes including maintenance of religious institutions opposed to the temple; Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance.\n\nIn matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law.\n\nSecularism in India, thus, does not mean separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that is neutral to all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools. These differences have led a number of scholars to declare that India is not a secular state, as the word secularism is widely understood in the West and elsewhere; rather it is a strategy for political goals in a nation with a complex history, and one that achieves the opposite of its stated intentions.\n\nIn the West, the word secular implies three things: freedom of religion, equal citizenship to each citizen regardless of his or her religion, and the separation of religion and state. One of the core principles in the constitution of Western democracies has been this separation, with the state asserting its political authority in matters of law, while accepting every individual’s right to pursue his or her own religion and the right of religion to shape its own concepts of spirituality. Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West.\n\nIn contrast, in India, the word secular does not imply separation of religion and state. It means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law. The applicable personal law differ if an individual’s religion is Christianity, or Hindu.\nThe term secularism in India also differs from the French concept for secularity, namely laïcité. While the French concept demands absence of governmental institutions in religion, as well as absence of religion in governmental institutions and schools; the Indian concept, in contrast, provides financial support to religious schools and accepts religious law over governmental institutions. The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, Indian government financially supports, regulates and administers the historic Hindu temples, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.\n\nIndian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject. Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.\n\nIn 1978, the Shah Bano case brought the secularism debate along with a demand for uniform civil code in India to the forefront.\n\nShah Bano was a 62-year-old Muslim Indian who was divorced by her husband of 44 years in 1978. Indian Muslim Personal Law required her husband to pay no alimony. Shah Bano sued for regular maintenance payments under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1978. Shah Bano won her case, as well appeals to the highest court. Along with alimony, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India wrote in his opinion just how unfairly Islamic personal laws treated women and thus how necessary it was for the nation to adopt a Uniform Civil Code. The Chief Justice further ruled that no authoritative text of Islam forbade the payment of regular maintenance to ex-wives.\n\nThe Shah Bano ruling immediately triggered a controversy and mass demonstrations by Muslim men. The Islamic Clergy and the Muslim Personal Law Board of India, argued against the ruling. Shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Indian government with Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister, enacted a new law which deprived all Muslim women, and only Muslim women, of the right of maintenance guaranteed to women of Hindu, Christian, Parsees, Jews and other religions. Indian Muslims consider the new 1986 law, which selectively exempts them from maintenance payment to ex-wife because of their religion, as secular because it respects Muslim men’s religious rights and recognises that they are culturally different from Indian men and women of other religions. Muslim opponents argue that any attempt to introduce Uniform Civil Code, that is equal laws for every human being independent of his or her religion, would reflect majoritarian Hindu sensibilities and ideals.\n\nThe controversy is not limited to Hindu versus Muslim populations in India. The Islamic feminists movement in India, for example, claim that the issue with Muslim Personal Law in India is a historic and ongoing misinterpretation of the Quran. The feminists claim that the Quran grants Muslim women rights that in practice are routinely denied to them by male Muslim ulema in India. They claim that the ‘patriarchal’ interpretations of the Quran on the illiterate Muslim Indian masses is abusive, and they demand that they have a right to read the Quran for themselves and interpret it in a woman-friendly way. India has no legal mechanism to accept or enforce the demands of these Islamic feminists over religious law.\n\nSome religious rights granted by Indian concept of secularism, which are claimed as abusive against Indian women, include child marriage, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights of women and men, extrajudicial unilateral divorce rights of Muslim man that are not allowed to a Muslim woman, and subjective nature of shariat courts, ‘‘jamaats’’, ‘‘dar-ul quzat’’ and religious qazis who preside over Islamic family law matters.\n\nGoa is the only state in India which has Uniform Civil Code.The Goa Civil Code, also called the Goa Family Law, is the set of civil laws that governs the residents of the Indian state of Goa. In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions. Goa is an exception to that rule, in that a single secular code/law governs all Goans, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or linguistic affiliation.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the Indian constitution clubs Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains along with Hindus, a position contested by some of these community leaders.\n\nWriting in the Wall Street Journal, Sadanand Dhume criticises Indian \"Secularism\" as a fraud and a failure, since it isn't really \"secularism\" as it is understood in the western world (as separation of religion and state) but more along the lines of religious appeasement. He writes that the flawed understanding of secularism among India's left wing intelligentsia has led Indian politicians to pander to religious leaders and preachers including Zakir Naik, and has led India to take a soft stand against Islamic terrorism, religious militancy and communal disharmony in general.\n\nHistorian Ronald Inden writes:\nAmartya Sen, the Indian Nobel Laureate, suggests that secularism in the political – as opposed to ecclesiastical – sense requires the separation of the state from any particular religious order. This, claims Sen, can be interpreted in at least two different ways: The first view argues the state be equidistant from all religions – refusing to take sides and having a neutral attitude towards them. The second view insists that the state must not have any relation at all with any religion. In both interpretations, secularism goes against giving any religion a privileged position in the activities of the state. Sen argues that the first form is more suited to India, where there is no demand that the state stay clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever. Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment. Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of sharia in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion. Critics of Sen claim that secularism as practised in India is not the secularism of first or second variety Sen enumerates.\n\nAuthor Taslima Nasreen sees Indian secularists as pseudo secularist, accusing them of being biased towards Muslims saying, \"Most secular people are pro-Muslims and anti-Hindu. They protest against the acts of Hindu fundamentalists and defend the heinous acts of Muslim fundamentalists\". She also said that most Indian politicians appease Muslims which leads to anger among Hindus.\n\nPakistani columnist Farman Nawaz in his article \"Why Indian Muslim Ullema are not popular in Pakistan?\" states \"Maulana Arshad Madani stated that seventy years ago the cause of division of India was sectarianism and if today again the same temptation will raise its head then results will be the same. Maulana Arshad Madani considers secularism inevitable for the unity of India\". Maulana Arshad Madani is a stanch critic of sectarianism in India. He is of the opinion that India was divided in 1947 because of sectarianism. He suggests secularism inevitable for the solidarity and integrity of India.\n\n\n\n"}

Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures. Sikhism is Punjab's only indigenous religion with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture – the Rig Veda – was composed in the Punjab region. Some other religions, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization). All the Sikh gurus, saints and majority of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people. Punjabi culture and Sikhism are considered inseparably intertwined. \"Sikh\" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs \"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority'\" and believe \"that they are more than just a religion\".\n\nSikh art and culture is synonymous with that of the Punjab region. The Punjab itself has been called \"India’s melting pot\", due to the confluence of invading cultures, such as Mughal and Persian, that mirrors the confluence of rivers from which the region gets its name. Thus, Sikh culture is to a large extent informed by this synthesis.\n\nSikhism has forged a unique form of architecture which Bhatti describes as being \"inspired by Guru Nanak’s creative mysticism\" such that Sikh architecture \"is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality\". The keynote of Sikh architecture is the Gurdwara which is the personification of the \"melting pot\" of Punjabi cultures, showing both Islamic, Sufi and Hindu influences.\nThe reign of the Sikh Empire was the single biggest catylst in creating a uniquely Sikh form of expression, with Maharajah Ranjit Singh patronising the building of forts, palaces, bungas (residential places), colleges, etc. that can be said to be of the \"Sikh Style\". The \"jewel in the crown\" of the \"Sikh Style\" is the Harmandir Sahib.\n\nSikh culture is heavily influenced by militaristic motifs, with Khanda being the most obvious; thus it is no surprise that the majority of Sikh artifacts, independent of the relics of the Gurus, have a military theme. This motif is again evident in the Sikh festivals of Hola Mohalla and Vasakhi which feature marching and practicing displays of valor respectively.\n\nThe art and culture of the Sikh diaspora has been merged with that of other indo-immigrant groups into categories such as 'British Asian', 'Indo-Canadanian' and 'Desi-Culture'; however there has emerged a niche cultural phenomenon that can be described as 'Political Sikh'. The art of prominent diaspora Sikhs such as Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra and Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh ('The Singh Twins'), is partly informed by their Sikh heritage and the current affairs of the Punjab.\n\nAlthough the Punjabi Sikhs form the majority of the Sikh population, the Sikh community is varied and includes people who speak the Assamese language, the Kashmiri language, the Telugu language and many more. The many communities following Sikhism is detailed below.\n\nThe Sikhs of Afghanistan have a unique culture which has elements of the culture of Afghanistan.\n\nHarbhajan Sing Puri is credited with raising awareness of Sikhism amongst the non Asian community of the United States of America. This community is known as the white Sikh community which practices Sikhism and maintains a distinct culture.\nAlthough the ancestors of the Sikhs of Assam were from Punjab, the Assamese Sikhs have been living in Assam for over 200 years. The community traces its origins to the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh who took his army to Assam. According to the 2001 census, there were 22,519 Sikhs in Assam, out of which 4,000 are Assamese Sikhs.\n\nAssamese Sikhs follow the Sikh religion and celebrate Sikh festivals. However, they also celebrate local festivals such as Magh Bihu and wear traditional Assamese dress. Their language is the Assamese language.\n\nAgrahari Sikh is a Sikh community found in eastern India including state West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. Agrahari Sikhs, also known as Bihari Sikhs, have lived for centuries in Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nBihari Sikhs share their culture with the local Bihari community. The men generally wear the local dhoti and women wear the Sari. They also celebrate local festivals such as the Chath festival.\nDakhni Sikhs are the descendants of the Sikh soldiers who came to the South in the early 19th century when the Nizam of Hyderabad raised a Sikh contingent in his army.\n\nDakhani Sikhs are the descendants of Sikh soldiers sent by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to support the Nizam. After the death of the Maharaja, the soldiers who remained there, married local women and adopted their language and culture. The traditional dress of women is the saree. The native language of Dakhni Sikhs is the Telugu language\n\nEthnic Kashmiri Sikhs speak the Kashmiri language and observe Kashmiri culture. They trace their ancestry to the Sikh soldiers who settled in Kashmir under the Maharaja Ranjit Singh rule in 1819. However, the soldiers permanently settled in Kashmir.\n\nPunjabi Sikhs follow the Punjabi culture. Their traditional dress includes the Punjabi Salwar Suit, Punjabi Tamba and Kurta, Punjabi juti and Patiala salwar.\n\nIn addition to the Sikh festivals using the Nanakshahi calendar, Punjabi Sikhs observe traditional Punjabi festivals using the Punjabi calendar.\n\nBhangra and the Giddha are two forms of indigenous Punjabi folk dancing that have been appropriated, adapted and pioneered by Punjabi Sikhs. The Punjabi Sikhs have championed these forms of expression all over the world, such that Sikh Culture has become inextricably linked to Bhangra, even though \"Bhangra is not a Sikh institution but a Punjabi one.\"\n\nIn addition to celebrating Sikh festivals, Sindhi Sikhs celebrate festivals such as Cheti Chand, the Sindhi new year. Sindhi Sikhs speak the Sindhi language.\n\nThere are Sikh communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra who settled there centuries ago.\n\nThe Sikhs comprise Banjara and Satnami. The process of blending into southern India for the Sikligars began at the time of 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, who came to the Deccan and died in 1708 at Nanded (Maharashtra).\n\nSikligars came to southern India as expert arms-making camp followers of the tenth Guru. Sikligar is a compound of the Persian words `saiqal` and `gar` meaning a polisher of metal. The traditional occupation of the Sikligars is crafting kitchen implements.\n\nBanjaras are a nomadic tribe who traditionally travelled with merchandise and are found across a large swathe of northern India, as well as in the south. Sikh Banjaras too travelled with armies of the past supplying them with provisions.\n\n"}

In contrast to Buddhism that says Skandha is without any underlying substance or identity, Jainism posits that all Skandhas are ultimately backed by a combination of Paramanus or elementary particles that are indestructible and uncreatable. Skandha is nothing but a combination of Paramanus (elementary particles). Jainism doesn't include the last four types of aggregates of Buddhism because those phenomena are explained in Jainism by the groupings between fine matter called (karma particles, second last from the list below) and Atman Substance (unified individual whose existence is denied in Buddhism). A grouping between matter and Atman is not considered a Skandha but is considered a Bandha (bondage).\n\nEach Paramanu has \"intensity points\" of aridness or cohesiveness that, because of transformation, can increase or decrease between one and infinity. These Paramanus can combine with each other to create Skandhas or Aggregates when there is a difference of two \"intensity points\", whether it is arid or cohesive or whether having even or odd \"intensity points\" except the minimum (one) \"intensity point\". For example, a paramanu with two points of cohesiveness can combine with a paramanu of four points of cohesiveness or aridness; and that of three points with that of five points and so on. This definition is given in Pravachanasara.\n\nSkandhas and Paramanus are two types of Pudgalas (Matter).\n\nSkandha are of six types: Gross-gross, gross, gross-fine, fine-gross, fine, and fine-fine.

Especially noteworthy is the publication of \"Chinese Christian Texts from the Roman Archives of the Society of Jesus\". This collection of 12 volumes contains a selection of hitherto unpublished texts.\n\n\"Renlai magazine\" (“human flute-or voice”), a Chinese expression created by Zhuangzi, Taoist philosopher, is a monthly magazine written in Chinese, published in Taipei since January 2004. This magazine is mainly concerned with social, spiritual and cultural topics. Edited by Renlai staff and TRI, the magazine is published in association with the French Jesuit review \"Etudes\". Since 2006, TRI has started an internet magazine \"eRenlai\" www.erenlai.com, available in English, Chinese, both traditional and simplified. Renlai and eRenlai are particularly concerned about questions such as sustainable development, cultural diversity and mobilization of spiritual resources in the Chinese world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10682357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10682357", "title": "Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram", "text": "Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram\n\nVanavasi Kalyan Ashram is an Indian social welfare organization based in Jashpur, in the Chhattisgarh state of India. It focuses on the welfare activities of Janjatis that is Scheduled Tribes in remote areas of Bharat (India) and has branches throughout the country. These branches focus on agriculture, healthcare, child education, and sports. It also works to create cultural awareness among janjatis thereby facilitating the idea of preservation of their tradition and customs followed in different groups. \nThe organization is a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, the family of organisations affiliated with the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\n\nThe Ashram was founded in 1952 by Ramakant Keshav Deshpande, (Also known as Balasaheb Deshpande) an official of the Orissa State Department of Tribal Welfare, with the support of the State Government and the RSS. After Independence, Balasaheb was appointed by the then Ravi Shankar Shukla Government to work in tribal dominated Jashpur area as ‘Regional Officer’ of the ‘Tribal Development Scheme’. This particular area had gone into the iron grip of the Christian missionaries who had converted the simple tribal people to their religion by using all means fair and foul. Their conversion to Christianity had alienated them from the cultural and national moorings. Its aim was to counter the appeal of Christian missionary schools to the tribals. Based in Jashpur (214 km from Raigarh), it established schools in Raigarh and Surguja districts - areas with large tribal populations. The Ashram grew rapidly and a permanent office was established in 1963, inaugurated by the RSS chief M. S. Golwalkar.\n\nIn 1977, during the Janata Party Government, it acquired national status (expressed in its new name, \"Bhāratiya Vanavāsi Kalyān Āshram\"). From 1978 to 1983, the number of its full-time volunteers rose from 44 to 264 (56 of whom were tribal). In Jashpur, a hospital was established, and schools, hotels, and centers for apprenticeship in manual trades were also established in 40 villages. The programs are presently located in 312 districts throughout the country and are supervised by more than a thousand full-time workers. While most districts have primary schools, many other places have residential schools, hostels, libraries, and health centers. Important annual events include establishing medical camps, playing traditional sports, and celebrating tribal festivals.\n\nThe tribal communities in India suffer from a lack of both education and proper health care facilities due to various factors including government neglect. As a result, the communities often have a sense of alienation from present-day India which is being rapidly urbanized and westernized. To bring them into the mainstream with economic development but with their cultural moorings intact is an important role of the Kalyan Ashram. The Vanavasi Ashram helps the communities protect their interests and assists them to solve their own problems.\n\nThe Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram helps with the formation of people's self-help groups. It also encourages smaller gatherings in post offices, provides training for scientific cultivation of cash crops, distributes seeds and seedlings, and helps arrange local resources for irrigation. It also helps widows and the elderly get their pensions. The Ashram increases people's awareness by organizing occasional symposiums on current issues like \"Impact of Globalization and Liberalization on Tribal Life\" and publishing books and periodicals dealing with socio-cultural aspects of day-to-day tribal life.\n\nThe Ashram, by providing the basic amenities like health care, employment, and education, helps the tribes avoid activity that can hamper their development. Their efforts are also directed at conflict resolution between the different tribes, which sometimes clash amongst themselves over petty issues. The Ashram has been promoting the concept that all the tribal groups belong to India and hence are one.\n\nThe Ashram has a network of single teacher schools (\"Ekal Vidyalaya\") across tribal areas where there are no government schools, based on Swami Vivekananda's saying, \"If the mountain does not come to Mohammed, Mohammed must go to the mountain. If the poor cannot come to education, education must reach them at the plough, in the factory, everywhere.\" Many tribal people are now serving in higher government posts at the central and state level. Almost 90% of Hindi teachers in Nagaland state are products of Kalyan Ashram hostels, as well as one medical officer serving in the central government in Delhi. Many of the Ashram's former students have been selected for state police services.\n\nThe Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram has hundreds of sports facilities and centers across the tribal areas of the countries that promote tribal sports, especially archery. Students from schools and hostels run by the organization have won laurels in archery at national and international levels.\n\nAccomplished Indian archer and Padma Shri recipient Limba Ram, whose family belongs to the Ahari tribe, was a student of the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram in Saradeet Village, Rajasthan who would go on to win many medals as well as represent India thrice at the Olympic Games. Many other students from different schools of the Ashram across India have won medals at state and national levels in games conducted by the Sports Authority of India. The Ashram has various centers across the country where basic infrastructure is provided to train them in archery and help them preserve the tribal games.\n\nKavita Raut, a medalist in the 10,000-meter run at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, and who studied at Vishva Hindu Parishad Nasik, now trains at SAI Bangalore for better performance for the forthcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe Vanavāsis (\"Tribals\") were called \"Aboriginals\" and made victims of the divide and rule policy of the British. They were declared to be \"animists\" with no religion worth the name. The tribal regions were scaled off as \"Protected Areas\" to all except Christian missionaries. Now, the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram has begun working in those areas. Sanskar Kendras for women and children, schools, hostels, reading rooms, free dispensaries, and village and cottage industries have been started and are increasing in number throughout all the provinces.\n\nThe Ashram helps the tribes protect their rich cultures. It organizes performances of traditional folklore and dances like Kolatam, Chakka Bhajana and Dhimsa dance. Among the several events, the important ones include medical camps, traditional sports, and the celebration of Tribal festivals as well as major Hindu festivals, like Raksha Bandhan, Hanuman Jayanti, Ram Navami, Govardhan Puja, Indal Pooja and Krishna Janmashtami.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "356670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356670", "title": "We the Living", "text": "We the Living\n\nWe the Living is the debut novel of the Russian American novelist Ayn Rand. It is a story of life in post-revolutionary Russia and was Rand's first statement against communism. Rand observes in the foreword that \"We the Living\" was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Rand finished writing the novel in 1934, but it was rejected by several publishers before being released by Macmillan Publishing in 1936. It has since sold more than three million copies.\n\nThe story takes place from 1922 to 1925, in post-revolutionary Russia. Kira Argounova, the protagonist of the story, is the younger daughter of a bourgeois family. An independent spirit with a will to match, she rejects any attempt by her family or the nascent Soviet state to cast her into a mold. At the beginning of the story, Kira returns to Petrograd with her family, after a prolonged exile due to the assault of the Bolshevik revolutionaries. Kira's father had been the owner of a textile factory, which was seized and nationalized. Having given up all hopes of regaining their past possessions after the victories of the Red Army, the family returns to the city in search of livelihood. They find that their home has also been seized and converted to living quarters for several families.\n\nKira's family eventually manages to find living quarters, and Kira's father gets a license to open a textile shop, an establishment that is but a shadow of his old firm. Life is excruciatingly difficult in these times. Rand portrays long queues, weary citizens and low standards of living. With some effort, Kira manages to obtain her Labor Book, which permits her to study and work. Kira also manages to enroll in the Technological Institute, where she aspires to fulfill her dream of becoming an engineer. At the Institute, Kira meets Andrei Taganov, a co-student, an idealistic Communist and an officer in the Soviet secret police. The two share a mutual respect and admiration for each other in spite of their differing political beliefs, and become friends.\nIn a chance encounter, Kira meets Leo Kovalensky, an attractive man with a free spirit. It is love at first sight for Kira, and she throws herself at Leo, who initially takes her to be a prostitute. He is also strongly attracted to her and promises to meet her again. Kira and Leo are shown to be united by their desperate lives and their beliefs that run counter to what is being thrust on them by the state. After a couple of meetings, when they share their deep contempt for the state of their lives, the two plan to escape the country together.\n\nFrom this point on, the novel slowly cascades into a series of catastrophes for Kira and Leo. They are caught while attempting to flee the country, but escape imprisonment with the help of an official who knew Leo's father before the revolution. Kira leaves her parents' apartment and moves into Leo's. Soon the state decides to expel any college students of a bourgeois background, and Kira is also fired from her job. The relationship between Kira and Leo, intense and passionate in the beginning, begins to deteriorate under the weight of their hardships and their different reactions. Kira keeps her ideas and aspirations alive, but decides to go along with the system until she feels powerful enough to challenge it. Leo, in contrast, sinks slowly into indifference and depression. He contracts tuberculosis and is prescribed treatment in a sanatorium. Kira's efforts to finance his treatment fail, and her appeals to the authorities to get state help fall on deaf ears.\n\nAs Kira's relationship with Leo evolves, so does her relationship with Andrei. Despite their political differences, she finds Andrei to be the one person with whom she could discuss her most intimate thoughts and views. Andrei's affection and respect for Kira slowly turns into love. When he confesses his love to Kira, she is dismayed but also desperate, so she feigns love for Andrei and agrees to become his mistress. She uses money from Andrei to fund Leo's treatment.\n\nLeo returns cured of tuberculosis and healthy, but a changed man. He opens a food store that is a facade for black market trade. Andrei, who is concerned that corruption is damaging the communist state, starts investigating Leo's store. He arrests Leo and in the process discovers that Kira has secretly been living with Leo. Disillusioned about both his personal relationship and his political ideals, Andrei secures Leo's release and shortly thereafter commits suicide. Kira, perhaps the only genuine mourner at his state funeral, wonders if she has killed him. Having lost any moral sense that he may have left, Leo leaves Kira to begin a new life as a gigolo. After Leo's departure, Kira makes a final attempt to cross the border. Almost in sight of freedom, she is shot by a border guard and dies.\n\nThe novel was first completed in 1934, under the working title \"Airtight\". Despite support from H. L. Mencken, who deemed it \"a really excellent piece of work\", it was rejected by several publishers until September 1935, when George Platt Brett of Macmillan Publishing agreed to publish it. Brett's decision was not without controversy within Macmillan. Associate editor Granville Hicks, then a member of the American Communist Party, was strongly opposed to publishing Rand's novel. Rand later said that Brett was unsure whether the novel would turn a profit, but he thought it was a book that ought to be published. The first edition was issued on April 7, 1936.\n\nThe initial American publication of \"We the Living\" was not a commercial success. Macmillan did not expect the novel to sell and did little marketing. Initial sales were slow and although they picked up later, Macmillan destroyed the plates before the first printing of 3000 copies sold out. Eighteen months after its release, the novel was out of print. Rand's royalties from the first American edition amounted to $100.\n\nThere was also a British publication by Cassell in January 1937, and editions were published in Denmark and Italy. These did considerably better than the American release, remaining in print into the 1940s.\n\nIn 1957, Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\" became a best-seller for Random House. Its success motivated them to republish \"We the Living\" in 1959. In preparation for the new edition, Rand made some changes to the text. In her Foreword to the revised edition, Rand declared that \"In brief, all the changes are merely editorial line changes.\" Rand's description notwithstanding, some of the changes have been taken to have philosophical significance. In the first edition, Kira said to Andrei, \"I loathe your ideals. I admire your methods.\" In the second edition, this became simply \"I loathe your ideals.\" A few pages later, Kira said to Andrei, \"What are your masses but mud to be ground underfoot, fuel to be burned for those who deserve it?\" Rand's revision deleted this sentence.\n\nThe significance of these and other revisions has been debated. Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein commented, \"She claims that the revision was minimal. Some readers of both editions have questioned her definition of 'minimal'.\" According to Ronald Merrill, Kira in the first edition \"adopts in the most explicit terms possible the ethical position of Friedrich Nietzsche.\" Rand had made her break with Nietzsche by the time she published \"The Fountainhead\". Canadian writer Barbara Branden said that \"Some of her readers were disturbed when they discovered this and similar changes\", but insisted that \"unlike Nietzsche, she rejected as unforgivably immoral any suggestion that the superior man had the right to use physical force as a means to his end.\" Robert Mayhew cautioned that \"We should not conclude too quickly that these passages are strong evidence of an earlier Nietzschean phase in Ayn Rand's development, because such language can be strictly metaphorical (even if the result of an early interest in Nietzsche)\". Susan Love Brown countered that \"Mayhew becomes an apologist for Rand's denials of change and smooths over the fact that Rand herself saw the error of her ways and corrected them.\"\n\nNearly everyone who reads \"We the Living\" today reads the second edition. The first is a rare book; the second has sold over three million copies.\n\n\nRand believed that \"We the Living\" was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says \"it was the most reviewed of any of her works\", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were mixed, but more positive than the reviews she received for her later work. In \"The New York Times\", reviewer Harold Strauss said Rand had \"a good deal of narrative skill\", but the novel was \"slavishly warped to the dictates of propaganda\" against the Soviets. \"Kirkus Reviews\" called it a \"first rate\" representation of the realities of life in Soviet Russia. In his syndicated \"A Book a Day\" column, Bruce Catton called it \"a tragic story\" about the harmful impact of revolution on the middle class. Ethel Lockwood recommended it as a realistic look at the impact of Soviet policies, but warned it was not for the \"squeamish\" or those unaccustomed to \"the continental viewpoint toward sex relationships\".\n\nWhen the book was released in Australia, it received several positive reviews. In the \"Australian Women's Weekly\", news editor Leslie Haylen described the novel as \"very vivid, human, and wholly satisfying\", saying it described Russian life without taking sides. \"The Barrier Miner\" said it was \"entertaining\" and \"intensely moving\", and not at all propaganda. The \"Wodonga and Towong Sentinel\" called it a \"vivid story\" that showed Russia \"dispassionately, without once imposing any preconceived ideas on the reader\".\n\nRand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein compared it to two of her later novels, saying, \"While it does not have the power of \"The Fountainhead\" or the majestic sweep of \"Atlas Shrugged\", \"We the Living\" is still a compelling story about interesting characters.\" Historian James Baker said it was \"preachy\" and \"indoctrinated without entertaining\".\n\nShortly after the novel was published, Rand began negotiations with Broadway producer Jerome Mayer to do a theatrical adaptation. Rand wrote the script, but Mayer's financing fell through. Several years later, she was able to interest George Abbott in producing the play. Helen Craig took the lead role as Kira, alongside John Emery as Leo and Dean Jagger as Andrei. It opened under the title \"The Unconquered\" at the Biltmore Theatre on February 13, 1940, but closed just five days later after scathing reviews.\n\nThe play was not published during Rand's lifetime. In 2014, Palgrave Macmillan published a volume with both the final script and an earlier version, edited by Robert Mayhew.\n\n\"We the Living\" was published in an Italian translation in 1937. Without Rand's permission, it was adapted in 1942 as an Italian film, released in two parts, titled \"Noi Vivi\" (\"We the Living\") and \"Addio Kira\" (\"Goodbye Kira\"). The films were directed by Goffredo Alessandrini for Scalera Films of Rome, and starred Alida Valli as Kira, Fosco Giachetti as Andrei, and Rossano Brazzi as Leo. Prior to their release, the films were nearly censored by Mussolini's government, but they were permitted because the story itself was set in Soviet Russia and was directly critical of that regime. The films were successful, and the public easily realized that they were as much against fascism as communism. After several weeks, German authorities, who were allied with the Italian government, insisted that the film be pulled from distribution because of its anti-Fascist themes.\n\nRediscovered in the 1960s through the efforts of Rand's lawyers, Erika Holzer and Henry Mark Holzer, these films were re-edited into a new version with English subtitles composed by Erika Holzer and revision co-producer Duncan Scott. This version, approved by Rand and her estate, was re-released as \"We the Living\" in 1986.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49015936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49015936", "title": "Yemenite Jewish poetry", "text": "Yemenite Jewish poetry\n\nYemenite Jewish poetry, often referred to as \"paraliturgical poetry\" because of its religious nature, has been an integral part of Yemenite Jewish culture since time immemorial. The Jews of Yemen have preserved a well-defined singing arrangement which not only includes the very poetic creation itself, but also involves a vocal and dance performance, accompanied in certain villages outside Sana'a by drumming on an empty tin-can (\"tankah\") or a copper plate. The Jews of Yemen, maintaining strict adherence to Talmudic and Maimonidean halakha, observed the gezeirah which prohibited playing musical instruments, and \"instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm.\" (For the modern Yemenite-Israeli musical phenomenon see Yemenite Jewish music.) This arrangement was integrated into the walks of life familiar to the Jews of Yemen. The texts used in the arrangement were put down in writing and later included in separate song collections (\"dīwāns\"). The social strictures and norms in Yemenite Jewish culture provide for separate settings for men and for women, where the sexes are never mixed. Men’s song usually expressed the national aspirations of the Jewish people, and it was far removed from the singing associated with the Muslim environment, whereas folk songs of Jewish women were sung by rote memory (unwritten poetry) and expressed the happiness and sorrows inherent in their daily life and was, as a rule, closer to that of Muslim women.\n\nIn terms of the formal structure, men’s songs during social gatherings among Yemenite Jews are of three genres: \"nashīd\" (introduction), \"shirah\" (poem) and \"hallel\" (praise). The \"nashīd\" is written in the form of a classical Arabic \"qaṣīda\". All songs of praise are always preceded by a song of supplication and of entreaties, known in Arabic as a \"nashīd\". The \"shirah\" (poem) is a Hebrew term denoting two known structures taken from Arabic poetry, namely, the \"muwashshaḥ\" (lit. \"girdle poem,\" being the most common poetic form in Yemen) and the Andalusian \"zajal\". In the \"muwashshaḥ\", the first strophe of the poem sets up a specific rhyme, and each strophe that follows is composed of four verses, whose last rhymes with the original strophe. These poetic genres were strictly composed in Hebrew, or else with a mixture of the two languages (Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic), although, occasionally, it could be found solely in Judeo-Arabic. The vast majority of these compositions are contained in an anthology known as the Dīwān.\nThe \"nashīd\" is a song that, from the beginning to end, uses only one metre and one rhyme. It is sung by one or, at most, two members of a group, who are answered by the rest in attendance. The \"nashīd\" is a serious, often sad chant.<ref name=\"Frankfurt/Main1987\">\"The Jews of Yemen\", \"Yemen - 3000 Years of Art and Civilisation in Arabia Felix\", (ed. Werner Daum), Frankfurt/Main, Germany, 1987, p. 279 </ref> Its content is religious rather than secular, the tone slow and monotonous, while the language employed is generally Hebrew.\n\nThe \"shirot\" constitute the chief and essential component of the singing performance. If the atmosphere is agreeable, several \"shirot\" (plural of \"shirah\", or poems) are performed one after the other. \"When the atmosphere becomes charged the singer switches the melody or changes the rhythm. The more switches there are the more successful the event and the more esteemed the singer.\"\n\nIn the \"dīwān\", the structural layout of the \"shirah\" (poem), such as those performed at wedding celebrations, is the double \"muwaššaḥ\", a structure that is characteristic of Muslim and Jewish poetry of Yemen, alike. The sense here is that the \"qufl\", or \"simṭ\", which concludes the strophe, is made-up of two parts: (a) three or four short lines, embodying a single rhyme which changes from strophe to lines; (b) two long lines whose rhyme is identical in all the strophes. In Yemenite Jewish tradition, these short lines are called \"tawšīḥ\". The performance of the \"shirah\" (poem) at wedding celebrations by the professional \"meshorer\" (lead singer) opens with a melodious tune, slow and full of yearning, of the \"ghuṣn\" line in the first strophe.\n\nThe \"halleloth\" (plural for \"Hallel\") are short songs of blessing that begin and conclude with the word \"Hallelujah\". As far as musical intonation and performance is concerned, the \"hallel\" (praise) is considered the simplest of the three genres. One man of the party opens with the starting words of the \"hallel\", while the entire party eagerly joins in with him, in an audible voice and with a monotonous staccato melody, and by prolonging the end of the textual and musical frames.\n\nYemenite poetry is often steeped in allegorical expressions drawn from the Kabbalah and esoteric writings. Although it might incorporate themes of wine and of love, or that of a bridegroom and bride, it is, nonetheless, distinctly set apart from songs of hedonism sung in revelry and in drinking bouts. In Yemenite poetry, such themes serve a mystical meaning, not to be understood in its literal context of a marriage between a man and a woman in the flesh, but of the bridegroom being the Holy One, blessed be He, and his bride, the people of Israel (\"Knesset Yisroel\"). The poem's principal content is the bride's supplication, meaning, Israel who was banished in exile from the groom's inheritance, from the holy city of Jerusalem, and also the incensed groom's (God's) ethical words of reproof and his longing for his bride. The arch-poet, Shalom Shabazi, many of whose poems make-up a large segment of the \"dīwān\", has written a warning not to think of his poetry in sensual or secular terms, since all had been written as an allegory.\n\nThe \"nashīd\" (plural: \"nashwad\") is quintessentially religious, usually an appeal to God. The \"shirah\" (poem) is the principal genre sung on different joyous occasions, especially weddings. It is a long song which incorporates different themes–primarily philosophy, praise, and supplication–and has a fixed opening structure in which God is praised, and an ending in which the party of men gathered on that joyous occasion are praised. Actually, on such occasions several \"shirot\" (songs) are sung one after the other.\n\nIn Yemen (as also in Israel), the all-male social-gathering always takes place around set tables, on which a variety of dainties have been laid up, with beverages (never actually solid foodstuffs), and traditionally opens with a \"nashīd\". The first to perform this is the most distinguished of the guests at the social-gathering, usually the rabbi, even if he were not a man with a pleasant voice, neither an expert in terms of musical performance, seeing that the music of the \"nashīd\" is simple, similar to the music of liturgical poems (\"piyyutim\") recited in the synagogues, expressing longing and emotion. After he commences with the \"nashīd\", the performance passes unto a more experienced man in the congregation, known for his musical talents and who is called by the Hebrew word, \"meshorer\" (singer of poetry).\n\nThe \"meshorer\" (singer) sings the first hemistich of the stanza, while another person, or the entire congregation, answers after him in concert. Often, one part of the song is sung by the lead singer, while another part is answered in company. In almost every song, repetition of the line in a verse is used, something also alluded to in the Babylonian Talmud (\"Berakhoth\" 31a). The professional \"meshorer\" (singer) improvises the performance by changing the melody, but maintains the leisurely pace of the music. In the course of the performance, the \"meshorerim\" (“singers”) can be changed, and, occasionally, even by those who are not professional performers. The performance at the end of the song returns to the one who commenced it.\n\nIn the course of performing the \"nashīd\" or the \"shirah\", absolute silence reigns, insofar that these songs are considered sacred songs. Only at the conclusion of the \"nashīd\" or \"shirah\" is it permissible for those lounging to partake of the dainties and beverages, and to bless aloud each man his neighbor.\n\nWedding festivities are conducted in the presence of a large group of people and which require a higher level of singing performance. The opening is similar to that of Sabbath and holiday meals, but they soon move to the more essential part of the \"shirot\", as noted, performed by the professional \"meshorer\" (singer), accompanied by a rhythmic beating of a copper plate (\"ṣaḥn\") and by dancing performed by well-mannered dancers. The melodies of the Sabbath and holiday meals are very similar to those related to prayers and liturgical poems and which are said in the synagogue, and belong to the ancient musical heritage of the Jewish people. According to some scholars who found in them a resemblance to the liturgical music of orthodox Christian churches in the Land of Israel, their origin belongs rather to the music of the Temple. In contrast, the melodies of the \"shirot\" (poems) in wedding celebrations and in the dances that accompany them are borrowed, without doubt, from the Muslim surrounding. The impact of Islamic poetry in Yemen over Jewish singing was already felt by Rabbi Yiḥya Qoraḥ, one of the more important Jewish sages in Ṣanʻā’ during the 19th century (1840–1881), who did not hesitate to go to singing parties of the Muslims in his city in order to thoroughly acquaint himself with the poetic requirement of the singing and its performance.\n\nIn Yemenite Jewish tradition, the melodies of \"shirot\" sung at wedding celebrations are ascribed unto Rabbi Shalom Shabazi, the most renowned poet of Yemenite Jewry who lived in the 17th century (ca. 1610–1680). However, it seems that this tradition merely reflects the fact that he was the poet who was most instrumental in planting the style of the school of Muslim \"Ḥumaynī\" poetry in Yemenite-Jewish poetry, although he was not the first Jewish poet who wrote in the \"Ḥumaynī\" style. It may be assumed that he not only took from \"Ḥumaynī\" poetry the parameters related to the folk register of the Arabic language and to the lenient approach in relation to metre and to its bold use of erotic imagery to describe the love of God, but also took the melodies by which Muslims had performed their singing. There is evidence that Jews occasionally sang erotic poems of Muslims–known as \"ash‘ār\"–a matter that provoked in its wake harsh criticism from the religious leadership of the Jewish community. It seems that, similar to the phenomenon that is well-known in other Jewish communities, Shabazi–and presumably also other Jewish poets in Yemen–wrote poems of a religious and national Jewish content, while making use of these Muslim melodies. Dr. Yosef Tobi possesses a video dating back to the 1980s in which a young Muslim from Yemen is performing an Arabic song in the same melodious tune, and with full of yearning, as is found in the poem, \"Qiryah yafefiyah\" (O Beautiful City), an emotional song of yearning for Jerusalem by Rabbi Zechariah al-Ḍāhirī who lived in the 16th century.\n\nYemenite Jewish poetry, as it has been known from the twelfth century unto the mid-fifteenth century, was primarily sacred poetry composed in either Hebrew or Aramaic, that is to say, liturgical poetry intended for prayer in the synagogue, or else para-liturgical poetry intended for social occasions resulting from the yearly events or a person’s life cycle. Such poetry was composed under the influence of liturgical poetry, both Hebrew and Aramaic, in Babylonia, but even more so under the influence of Hebrew liturgical poetry in Spain (i.e. the early Spanish poets of the Golden Age, Moses ibn Ezra [b. circa 1060], Alḥarizi [1170–1235], Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra [c. 1089–1167], Solomon ibn Gabirol [c. 1020–1058], Judah Halevi [died 1150], among others). Even secular poetry was written in Yemen to a limited extent, mostly panegyrics, impacted by secular Hebrew poetry in Spain. Although the source for some of the linguistic values, prosody, and content of Yemenite Jewish poetry for that period was taken from Arabic poetry, this wasn’t the result of any direct contact between Jewish poets and Arab poetry, but rather came about through Hebrew poetry in Spain, whose composers were well-acquainted with Arabic poetry and influenced by it. Notwithstanding, Yemenite Jewish poetry, although influenced by Spanish poetry, still maintained a puristic linguistic approach, meaning, they made use of the most eloquent level of the Hebrew language, which is the level of biblical Hebrew.\n\nThere is to be noted in Zechariah al-Ḍāhirī's (\"circa\" 1531 – d. 1608) poetic style a marked transition from the early Spanish-type of poetry typical of Yemen prior to his time (depicted in the prosaic writings of Daniel berav Fayyūmī and Avraham b. Ḥalfon, both, of Yemenite Jewish provenance) and the later classical Yemenite poetic writings (as depicted in the liturgical poems composed by Yosef ben Israel and Shalom Shabazi). Unlike the latter who compiled works, both, in Hebrew and in Judeo-Arabic, al-Ḍāhirī's corpus of prosaic writings are written almost exclusively in Hebrew. Much of al-Ḍāhirī's poetry was inspired by the great Spanish poets, while other works are said to have been inspired by Immanuel of Rome. Some of al-Ḍāhirī's poems are panegyrics influenced by the Arabic \"madiḥ\", in praise of great Jewish scholars, such as Rabbeinu Yerucham (1290-1350), a Provençal rabbi who moved to Spain in 1306, following the expulsion of the Jews from France. Other panegyrics were written about Rabbi Obadiah di Bertinoro (c. 1445-1515) and Maimonides.\n\nVarious sources indicate that, beginning with the 12th century and continuing till the 15th century, Jews in Yemen were familiar with Arabic philosophical literature, mainly that of the Ismāʻīlīs, including Arabic poetry from their school of philosophers (Havazelet 1992). The first Arabic poems compiled by Yemenite Jews were not lyrical or emotional poems–whether personal expressions of emotion or those related to the entire nation–but rather a combination of poetic prosody and philosophical ideas. Meaning, their main purpose was to pass on to the community a philosophical, ethic-like religious message, even though they didn’t have any role in the religious practice related to Yemenite Jews, whether in the synagogue or in the para-liturgical religious frameworks.\n\nIt was only at the end of the 16th century that the Arab contribution in Jewish poetry in Yemen began to surge. The start of this process was in the poetry of Yosef ben Israel (late 16th century – early 17th century). This process, however, reached its climax in the poetry of Shalom Shabazi (1619–1680+), nearly the half of which is written in Arabic (with Hebrew characters). This process, however, involved two other phenomena that are interrelated: (a) the subject matter of the poems written in Arabic was very diverse and incorporated in them virtually all the genres known to poetry, especially poems containing an epic nature; (b) the linguistic register which serves in a particular part of the poetry written by Shabazī distances itself from the classical Judeo-Arabic spoken in the Middle-Ages, and becomes more like a colloquial language.\n\nThese two phenomena characterize in a small measure the poetic work of Yosef ben Israel, who frequently wrote about philosophical issues, and, consequently, preserved the “purity” of the classical Arabic language and wasn’t drawn after the colloquial tongue. Furthermore, in those liturgical poems whose nature is obviously epic, and apparently closer to folk literature, such as the poem entitled \"Asabbiḥ ilāh al-kull wa-aʻla bi-ṭāʻatoh\" (or: \"bi-ḥikmatoh\"), which brings down the story of Joseph and his brothers, the poet has preserved a high “classical” register of Judeo-Arabic and has distanced himself from the colloquial (Ḥafeṣ Ḥayyim, 1966, p. 215–219).\n\nUnder the influence of the Yemeni-Muslim \"ḥumaynī\" poetry, Yosef ben Israel and Shabazī often wrote muwaššaḥāt of double structure, were lenient regarding the rigid rules of Arabic metre, and were not even deterred from using extreme erotic expressions in describing an allegorical lover – whether it happened to be the Messiah or God. This, some say, was also the result of their being influenced by the midrashic commentary on the Song of Songs and kabbalistic literature (Farrāj-Fallāh 2011). Such verse, however, never degenerated into the sensuous \"hazl\" genre. That is certainly the case with regard to the more “classical” genres – \"nashīd\", \"shīrah\", and \"hallel\" – which were in fact an integral part of the national-religious nature of the Yemenite Jewish community, an experience which wasn’t very different from any other Jewish community in the Diaspora. The Jews of Yemen have traditionally viewed Arab poetry with the selective approach of “rapprochement and rejection.” Secular hedonistic poetry was mostly rejected by them, while adopting elements of praise as found in panegyrics and in other genres of Arab poetry.\n\nThe \"qaṣīd\" (poetic tale; plural: \"qiṣwad\"), as used in Yemenite Jewish works, was written mostly in Judeo-Arabic. It is nearly always the fruit of a single poet, and while bearing precise rules of meter and rhyme, it is still artificial and cumbersome, only a few being able to learn it by heart, and remember it only for short periods of time. It is largely distinguished from the earlier canonical genres by its content, and as a result of which, also its designation. The use of the \"qaṣīd\" genre in Yemenite Jewish poetry was unknown prior to Yosef ben Israel and Shalom Shabazī. At large, the general category of the \"qiṣwad\" may be divided into four subgenres:\n\nAll these four subgenres of the \"qaṣīd\" are characterized by actual events and relevance; in other words, relating to the events of everyday life, and to the reality of life that could be felt in Yemen. As such, the language employed adapts itself to this character, and is written in the spoken (colloquial) Yemenite dialect. However, due to this debased and low characteristic, the \"qaṣīd\" was completely detached from the national-religious experience, and was never performed in the aforementioned social gatherings, except toward the end, after the distinguished guests, including rabbis, had abandoned the party. This is absolutely non-existent with respect to the “classical” genres of \"nashīd\", \"shīrah\" and \"hallel\" that were performed with vocal music in para-liturgical social gatherings. It is worthy of noting that copyists were usually not willing to include the \"qiṣwad\" in their \"dīwāns\".\n\nThis is a special literary genre that also found its way into Yemen, used in men's company, but almost exclusively in women's company during their social gatherings. The \"maaneh\" poem (responsive poem) is a term that defines the fact that the poem was composed by combining some of the verses borrowed from an older poem (usually by a different author), including in most cases the poem's meter, rhyme and tempo, and which lyrics were later improvised with new stanzas interspersed between the old. It is of singular importance to note that the corpus of \"maaneh\" poetry were usually drawn from older poems having the structure of a \"nashid\", but none were drawn from older girdle poems. One of the most famous 'responsive poems' written in Yemen was \"Ḥus Elohai mime‘onkha\" (), by the Yemenite poet Hisdai, and which he wrote based on the poem, \"Ya‘avor ‘Alai Reṣonakh\" (), by Judah Halevi. It is highly probable that old melodies were preserved in this way, and which were once common to distant Jewish communities.\n\nThe following \"nashid\" was composed by the arch-poet, Shalom Shabazi, and bears the author's kunya (cognomen) in acrostics; the first letter of each strophe spelling out the name, Abu Shimon Al-Shabazi. The rhyme, needless to say, has been lost in the translation, but can be seen in its original.\n\nIn the first two stanzas of the following \"nashid\", Rabbi Shalom Shabazi makes known his longing for the Divine Presence in the land of Israel:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3519425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3519425", "title": "Zagmuk", "text": "Zagmuk\n\nZagmuk, which literally means \"beginning of the year\", is a Mesopotamian festival celebrating the New Year. The feast fell in December and lasted about 12 days. It celebrates the triumph of Marduk, the patron deity of Babylon, over the forces of Chaos, symbolized in later times by Tiamat. The battle between Marduk and Chaos lasts 12 days, as does the festival of Zagmuk. In Uruk the festival was associated with the god An, the Sumerian god of the night sky. Both are essentially equivalent in all respects to the Akkadian \"Akitu\" festival. In some variations, Marduk is slain by Tiamat on the winter solstice and resurrected on the vernal equinox.\n\nIn Babylon, the battle was acted out at the royal court with the king playing Marduk, and his son-rescuer as Nabu, the god of writing. Once freed from the powers of the underworld, the king would enact the rite of the Sacred Marriage on the 10th day of the ceremony. During this rite, the king (or En, as he was known in Sumer) would perform sexual intercourse with his spouse, normally a high priestess who had been chosen from among the \"naditum\", a special class of priestesses who had taken a vow not of celibacy precisely, but of a refusal to bear children. The high priestess was known as the \"entu\", and her ritual act of intercourse with the king was thought to regenerate the cosmos through a reenactment of the primordial coupling of the cosmic parents An and Ki, who had brought the world into being at the dawn of Time. If an eclipse of the sun fell on any of the 12 days of the ceremony, a substitute for the king was put in his place, since it was thought that any evils which might have befallen the king would accrue to the substitute instead. On the last day of the festival, the king was slain so that he could battle at Marduk's side. To spare their king, Mesopotamians often utilized a mock king, played by a criminal who was anointed as king before the start of Zagmuk, and killed on the last day.\n\n"}
{"id": "2916277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2916277", "title": "Zandik", "text": "Zandik\n\nZandik (Middle Persian: 𐭦𐭭𐭣𐭩𐭪) is a Zoroastrian term conventionally interpreted as heretic in a narrow sense, or, in a wider sense, for a person with any belief or practice that ran contrary to Sassanid-mediated Zoroastrian orthodoxy. \n\nThe Middle Persian term engendered the better-attested Arabic زنديق \"zindiq\", with the same semantic field but related to Islam rather than Zoroastrianism. In the Islamic world, including Islamic-era Iran, the term was also variously assigned to Manichaeans, Mandaeans, Mazdakites, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Christians, and free-thinkers in general, including Muslims. Whether \"zandik\" was also used in any of these ways in Zoroastrian times is unknown; in that context, the term is only attested in three texts (two from the same author), and in all three appears as a hapax legomenon used in a pejorative way, but with no additional hints from which to infer a meaning. \n\nIn several now-obsolete studies related to Zoroastrianism, the word was also speculated to be the proper name of a particular (but hypothetical) priestly tradition that embraced Zurvanite doctrine.\n\nThe conventional translation as 'heretic' was already common in the 19th century when Christian Bartholomae (1885), derived \"zandik\" from Avestan \"zanda\", which he treated as a name of certain heretics.\n\nEarly examples of Arabic \"zindiq\" primarily denote Manichaeans, and this is possibly also the meaning of the term in the early attested use in Middle Persian (see below). This early usage led A. A. Bevan to derive Middle Persian \"zandik\" from Syriac \"zaddiq\" 'righteous' as a Manichaean technical term for 'listeners' (i.e. lay persons, as contradistinguished from the Manichaean elite). Bevan's derivation was widely accepted until the 1930s, especially amongst scholars of Semitic languages, but was discredited following a comprehensive review of both Arabic and Iranian usage by H. H. Schaeder (1930). Schaeder pointed out that the substantive was \"zand\", not \"zandik\" (an etymology would thus have to explain \"zand\", not \"zandik\"), as \"-ik\" was merely a regular Middle Iranian adjectivizing suffix. \n\nAn alternative interpretation that explains both 'Manichaean' and 'heretic' derives the substantive in \"zandik\" from Avestan \"𐬰𐬀𐬥\" \"zan\" 'to know, to explain', which is also the origin of Middle Persian 'zand' (a class of exegetical commentaries) and 'Pazand' (a writing system). In this explanation, the term \"zandik\" came to be applied to anyone who gave greater weight to human interpretation than to scripture (perceived to be divinely transmitted). Prior to Schaeder's review, the term was commonly assumed to first explain 'Manichaean', and to then have developed a meaning of 'heretic' as a secondary development. In that model, the term referred to Manichaeans because of their disposition to interpret and explain the scriptures of other religions in accordance with their own ideas.\n\nUnder the Sassanids (224-651 CE), the previously informal indigenous Iranian religious tradition now known as 'Zoroastrianism' was mediated and formalized into the systemized configuration with which it survives today. The \"Denkard\", a 9th-11th century work of Zoroastrian tradition, attributes this systemization of doctrine -- in which certain beliefs and traditions were seen as definite while others were considered unacceptable -- to an initiative by Tansar, high priest under Ardashir I, the founder of the dynasty. The development of a particular orthodoxy is also indicated by other sources, such as the \"Letter of Tansar\", which additionally suggests that the systemization of the Zoroastrian church was part of a greater state-sponsored \"revival\" of Iranian values, apparently as a Sassanian reaction to the perceived cultural \"corruptions\" of the preceding (likewise Iranian, but Hellenistic) Arsacid Parthian dynasts.\n\nThe Arsacids were probably not as culturally \"un-Iranian\" as Tansar's/Ardashir's propagandistic justification to overthrow them indicates, and it isn't even clear whether the systemization had any effect on the general populace in Sassanid times itself (or whether this first occurred in the post-Sassanian period). However, literary and epigraphic evidence from the third century onwards indicates that Sassanid-era priests in positions of authority persecuted individuals who held beliefs that were in not in accord with their (Sassanid-mediated) brand of Zoroastrianism. Among this epigraphic evidence are the 3rd/4th-century inscriptions of Kartir, Tansar's successor and high priest under three of Ardashir I's successors. In his own inscription on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, Kartir states (\"KKZ\" 8-9) that he persecuted \"Jews, Buddhists, Brahmins, Nasoreans (Judeo-Christians), Christians, 'Maktaks' (Mandaeans, Manichaeans?) and \"zandiks\".\" Kartir's inscription is the earliest epigraphic evidence of the word \"zandik\". \n\nAlthough the precise meaning of \"zandik\" is not evident from Kartir's use of the term, it is commonly assumed to mean 'heretic', or 'unorthodox' in relation to Kartir's ideology. However, none of Kartir's inscriptions actually define the contents of his orthodoxy. From this inscription and another at Sar Mashad, it appears that the only doctrine that Kartir was concerned with was the belief in a hereafter, a heaven and a hell, with one or the other as the final destination of the soul as reward or punishment for deeds in this life. Nonetheless, in 1920s-1960s scholarship, Kartir's silence on the subject precipitated an \"ex silencio\" view that the 'heresy' in question must have been Zurvanism, a now-extinct branch of Zoroastrianism influenced by Hellenistic and/or Babylonian notions of the hereafter. The word \"zandik\" was even speculated to be the proper name of a particular (unattested) priestly school that embraced Zurvanite doctrine, to which a number of unappealing aspects of Zoroastrian religious praxis were then attributed. Modern Iranian scholarship is much less inclined to wild speculation, and these hypothetical constructs are no longer followed today.\n\nNoticeably absent from Kartir's list is any immediately identifiable mention of Manichaeans, who were intermittently persecuted by the Sassanid establishment, also by Kartir, who is explicitly named as one of Mani's persecutor's in Manichaean sources. There are three suggested reasons to explain this anomaly: a) The conventional view is that Kartir includes them under the term 'Maktak'; b) an alternate position is that Kartir's text dates from the early period of Bahram I's rule when Mani still had Shapur I's and Hormizd I's protection; c) the third view is that Manichaeans are included in 'zandik'.\n\nThe term \"zandik\" appears once in the 9th/10th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (the so-called Pahlavi books). In this one instance, in \"Daedestan i Menog-i Khrad\" 36.16, the term appears as an abstract noun ('zandikih') and is explained to be the thirteenth most heinous crime.\n"}
