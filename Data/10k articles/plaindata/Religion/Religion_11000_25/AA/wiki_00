On the territory of the Ivolginsk Settlement, remains of Buddhist prayer beads were found in a Xiongnu grave.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism penetrated northward from Mongolia to reach the Buryat population of Transbaikalia (the area just east of Lake Baikal). Initially, Buddhism disseminated primarily among the ethnic groups that had recently migrated out of Khalkha Mongolia (the Selenga and Zede Buryats). At the end of the 17th to the beginning of the 18th centuries, it spread throughout the Transbaikal region. A second branch came directly from Tibet, from the Labrang Monastery in Amdo.\n\n\n\nBuddhism in Buryatia is the northernmost extension of Vajrayana Buddhism in Central Asia. It is primarily the Gelug tradition from Tibet, although there are signs of influence from the Nyingma tradition as well. Buddhist followers in Buryatia revere the founder of the Gelug school, the great guru Tsongkhapa (called Zonhobo in Buryat), on par with the founder of the entire Buddhist tradition, Shakyamuni Buddha. Gelug adherents in Buryatia prefer to either use this self-designation for the tradition, or the general terms \"teachings of the Buddha\" or \"Mahayana doctrine.\"\n\nBuryat Buddhism shows slight deviations from general Mahayana tradition mainly in its system of religious practice, in its rituals and magical practices, and are due to the influence of traditional, more ancient and archaic beliefs, practices, and rituals of the Tibetans and of the Buryat-Mongols. In particular, the religious system of Buddhism incorporated and assimilated traditional folk ceremonies, rituals, and beliefs associated with the honoring of ovoos, paying homage to spirits of the land, mountains, rivers, and trees. Among monastic religious practices, those of tantric origin, forming the basis of Vajrayana Buddhism, play an important role. In its philosophical, psychological and ethical teachings, Buryat Buddhism does not differ significantly from the fundamental provisions of Mahayana Buddhism as presented in the Tibetan version of the Buddhist canon referred to as the Kangyur (Ganzhuur in Buryat; 108 volumes) and the Tengyur (Danzhuur in Buryat; 225 volumes).\n\nBuddhism has had a tremendous impact on the development of culture and scholarship among the Buryat-Mongols, particularly on the formation and development of philosophical thought, norms of morality, mental development, fictional literature, art, cooking, and aspects of alternative medicine including chronobiology and bioenergetics.\n\nAmong the great variety of religious practices at Buryat datsans, there are six large ceremonies that take place: Sagaalgan (New Year); Duynher (Kalachakra); Gandan-Shunserme (the birth, enlightenment and parinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha); Maidari-Hural (the anticipated coming of Maitreya, the buddha of the next world epoch); Lhabab-Duysen (Buddha's descent from the heaven called Tushita); and Zul-Hural (commemoration of Tsongkhapa).\n\nDatsans in Buryatia and in the Chita and Irkutsk Oblasts:\n\n\n\n"}

It became an independent body in 1926 and Humphreys remained its president until his death in 1983. In 1961 the 14th Dalai Lama became patron of the Society, the first organisation in the West to be so honoured.\n\nThe Buddhist Society was one of the first Buddhist organisations outside Asia and remains one of the oldest in Europe to date.\n\nThe Buddhist Society runs a number of classes, courses and lectures, many of which are open to the general public. This includes Saturday meditation classes and popular Tuesday and Thursday lunchtime sessions. More specific members classes are offered in the Zen, Theravadan and Tibetan traditions. The Society is open on occasional Sundays to the public for 'Zen Sundays', 'Theravadan Sundays' and a Pure Land class.\n\nThree courses are taught at the Society representing three levels of Buddhist study, the first of which, ‘Introducing Buddhism’, is free and open to the public. This can be followed by the Intermediate and advanced, 'Great Way' courses. A Correspondence Course is also available to those who are unable to study at a Buddhist centre.\n\nFree public lectures are held at least once a month on a Wednesday evening. Topics are varied and concern not only the practical application of Buddhism but its cultural and historical aspects too. The guest speakers include academic as well as spiritual scholars of Buddhism. Special function days are held four times a year on Saturdays and are intended for those who do not live in London.\nA Summer School is held annually in August, too.

Between the first and second sessions of the Council, Archbishops Marcel Lefebvre (Superior CSSp) and Geraldo de Proença Sigaud (Diamantina, Brazil) and Bishop José Maurício da Rocha (Bragance, Brazil) decided to organize a more formal group of like-minded bishops. The group soon established a steering committee, of archbishops Lefebvre and Proença Sigaud, bishops Luigi Maria Carli (Segni), Antônio de Castro Mayer (Campos, Brazil). and the Abbot of Solesmes, Jean Prou OSB. After the second session of the Council, the group came formally into existence, issuing a circular letter, signed by archbishops Lefebvre, Proença Sigaud, Cabana (Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada), Silva Santiago (Concepción, Chile (emeritus)), Lacchio (Changsha, China) and Cordeiro (Karachi, Pakistan), which announced a group of Council fathers attached to the traditions of the Church.\n\nSources close to the organization report it had 250 members out of the approximately 2,400 bishops attending the Council at any given time. Other studies describe it either as having 16 \"core members\" or as having 5 members in the steering committee, 55 general members, and 9 supporting cardinals. In addition to the Council fathers, there were also theologians who formed a minor group that helped formulate the group's responses on issues being discussed in the Council. On specific topics they were able to gather additional adherents among the Council fathers; they obtained 435 signatures on a petition calling for an explicit condemnation of communism.\n\nAs a member of the Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre had taken part in the discussions about the draft documents submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council. His concerns with these proposals led to the formation of the study group to deal with a number of issues at the Council. A primary element of their agenda was opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, which they feared could undermine papal primacy and the rights of individual bishops. They thought there should be a specific condemnation of communism and that there should be a separate Council document elevating the status of the Blessed Virgin Mary, not merely a chapter in \"Lumen gentium\".\n\nContinuing complaints from the group about the presence of Protestant observers led Pope Paul VI, who was \"concerned not to alienate the traditionalists\", to ask Cardinal Augustin Bea \"if perhaps the presence of the 'separated brethren' and their 'mentality' were 'excessively dominating the council, thus diminishing its psychological freedom.' (He) emphasized that protecting 'the coherence of the teaching of the Catholic Church' was more important than pleasing the observers.'\" After thus consulting Cardinal Bea, the Pope decided not to disinvite the observers.\n\nTheir influence on the outcome of the Council was decidedly mixed. Their opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, and specifically to the granting of greater authority to conferences of bishops, made it difficult for them to work effectively with the national and regional bishops' conferences. Some have seen the Group's opposition to collegial decision-making also had an effect on their reluctance to achieve consensus by developing compromise positions.\n\nThey did, however, have more success using other channels. The Group had many contacts in the Papal Curia who shared their traditionalist point of view, and in the early years of the Council they were effective in using these back channels to make their opinions known at the highest levels. In the later years of the Council, they produced an almost uninterrupted flood of \"modi\" (amendments) to the proposals before the Council. These moves were not always successful; between the third and fourth sessions the group was repudiated by Cardinal Cicognani, the Vatican Secretary of State, for their divisive influence on the assembly.\n\nOn specific issues, they failed to defeat the constitution on the liturgy, which introduced the vernacular and gave greater authority to episcopal conferences, or the decree on ecumenism, which some say undermined the traditional belief that the Catholic Church was the unique path to salvation. Their petition insisting on a condemnation of communism in the constitution on the Church in the Modern World was only slightly more successful; it led to the insertion of a footnote which referred to an earlier papal condemnation of communism, without mentioning the word. Perhaps their greatest success involved a last minute papal intervention, where Pope Paul VI insisted on the insertion of an explanatory note into the document on the Church, which significantly weakened the force of its claims for collegiality.\n\n"}
{"id": "37784457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37784457", "title": "Coptic Orthodox Healing Among Egyptians", "text": "Coptic Orthodox Healing Among Egyptians\n\nComprising about ten to fifteen per cent of the total population in Egypt, Coptic Orthodox Christians (usually referred to as Copts) rely on the many services of the Orthodox Church and its dogma. Because the Copts compromise a small percentage of the population, most live in remote areas around Egypt mostly in the Zabbaleen, a poverty stricken area located in the Mokattam Village, Assuit, Akhmim, Girgeh, Luxor, Kuft and Nagada. As part of their core belief, Copts practice and accept the “Seven Sacrament,” which are explained as channels in which believers receive the sanctifications of the Holy Spirit. In Greek, the word “Sacrament” translates to “mystery” and Copts use this term specifically because of the unexplainable absolution that may derive from it. The Seven Sacraments are affirmed and derived by contemporary Orthodox Catechisms and textbooks. Although there are more than seven official Sacraments of the church, the Orthodox Confessions in the 17th century, endorsed by local councils against the Reformation such as Metrophanes Critopoulos in 1625, Peter Mogila in 1638 and Dostheos of Jerusalem in 1672, determined that there were seven important Sacraments to a spiritual life and the Orthodox Church accepted this. The Seven Sacraments are in order of: baptism, confirmation, repentance and confession, communion, matrimony, anointing of the sick, and priesthood. Here, we will further examine the sixth Sacrament, ‘anointing of the sick’, but first we must briefly contextualize Orthodoxy in Egypt to understand the hierarchy of the Church among Egyptians in Egypt and worldwide.\n\nMany Historians and Church Fathers suggest that there are two main reasons why Christian Egyptians live in secluded areas such as stated above. First, the social condition in which they face has pushed them in such isolated locations and second, among these areas reside Orthodox Churches. Living close to a Church is not only important to Copts but it is necessary. The Coptic Church in Egypt is not only a spiritual temple but also a central foundation for all resources. Amongst these resources, Jill Kamil explains in her book; Coptic Egypt: History and Guide, that there are over 150 Coptic organizations in Cairo alone, institutions including but not limited to: schools, orphanages, retirement homes, hospitals and social service centers, all run on Church grounds. With these exterior sources, Copts (along with Muslims) are permitted the opportunity to go to school and most importantly be a healthy enabled person. However, instead of thanking the Church for these services, Copts are more inclined to thank the grace of God for His work within the Church. Kamil further explains that for Egyptians a sense of the supernatural was, and remains, strong. Copts believe in both miracles and an element of magic: miracles like visitations of Saint Mary or healing of the sick and magic like the efficacy of the Seven Sacraments. \nWith the belief in both miracles and magic, Egyptians believe that their most unfortunate circumstance could be solved by God, as well as the patron of Saints that could intercede on the supplicant's behalf. In between the miracles and heavenly mysteries, Copts have an interesting perception on sickness and its execution as well as spiritual remedies. The next few sections will explain in great detail the spiritual rituals in which Copts partake in during the process of anointing and healing of the sick.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox experience is accurately described when the congregation of the devout is gathered together in worship. Without that description, Alexander a-Malek explains in an article called Sacraments of the Church, that it becomes impossible to understand the fundamentals of Church structure in Orthodoxy. A-Malek further explains that the practices of Orthodoxy have not changed much over the centuries like many other Christian communities in the world do. Tradition has always played a very important role in how the Church performs its liturgies, baptisms, Sacraments, etc. Its important to note that within the Orthodox community, Copts believe that all humanity are equal under God, however, the fathers/priests have jurisdiction which normal lay men do not. Paul Evdokimov explains in his book Orthodoxy, that based on spiritual gifts and the order of their ministries, tradition makes clear distinction between the congregation and the Fathers of the Church. As Sacrament means something secret or hidden, Evdokimov explains that the mysteries of Christ are hidden from the profane, even from the prophets, for Christ has communicated them only in parables. The performance of a sacrament is also considered a mystery because while it is believed that God performs it, He does it through the action of a Priest. The sacrament of Priesthood is considered to be an important and crucial duty. When elected, it is believed that the Father receives the Holy Spirit after an intense period of fasting, prayers and education. After ordination, the Priest is sent to a needed congregation and is given the authority to officiate the Sacraments of the Church. Egyptians are known to be pious people; Kamil explains that Copts depend on Priests to pray over certain situations in their lives. Situations vary but the frequent calling for priests are usually due to sickness or disease of a member.\n\nHealing of the sick, which is also referred to as the “Unction”, is one of the divine mysteries belonging to the Orthodox belief, where the sick who are faithful become healed from psychological and/or physical illnesses. Carl S. Tyneh writes in Orthodox Christianity: Overview and Bibliography, that there are visible and invisible elements to thus sacrament. The visible elements are the oil, the prayer of the Church, the congregation and the actual performance of the anointing. The invisible element is that where the Holy Spirit works to cure the sick. Tyneh explains however, that only if God permits will, will the sick be granted healing. The Orthodox Confession of Peter Mogila clarifies this point by noting; “it is not always good that the healing of the body should occur; nonetheless, the forgiveness of the soul’s sins always takes place with him who repents.” Although some branches of Christianity only perform this unction to those who are fatally ill, Orthodoxy celebrates this mystery at any time even for minor illnesses. It is important to note that this sacrament is optional and not mandatory. Tyneh clarifies that participation are for those who desire and feel the need. However, it is strongly urged that the anointing of the sick is performed for the dying so that their soul be strengthened during their final struggle against death. The importance of this sacrament was stated by Saint James when he wrote in the Bible; “Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick…” With specific orders, this sacrament is commonly referred to as the sacrament of Kendeel, in Arabic that literally translates to the ‘Sacrament of Lamps’. This name was adopted because the early Christians used to place oil in a lamp, from which hung seven other lamps. Each lamp was then lit and followed with a specific prayer. This ritual still exists, however, the seven lamps are now replaced by seven wicks made out of cotton wool and sits in a plate of oil. It is then believed that the Holy Spirit sanctifies the oil in order to heal those anointed by it. However, before this sacrament could take place Bishop Mettaous explains that the sick must partake in confessions. After a private confession, both the priest and their family members are gathered to attend the Sacrament of Unction to witness the diseased be anointed and prayed on. A full recovery is not usually expected immediately after service, the patient has to continue being devout and believe in God’s miracles. In the Orthodox Church, this sacrament can be administered to any baptized person; the Church does not have a special unction for larger cases. It's important to note that throughout the Orthodox history, monasteries were among the first hospitals in Egypt and monks tended to treat the sick by providing the appropriate medication, as well as administering the Sacrament by praying for the diseased. This demonstrates that Orthodoxy does not condone Western medicine but suggests the balance of both human and spiritual healing. For example, St. Pachomious in his Koinonia II, 40, wrote: \"If some sickness is alleged, the housemaster shall proceed to the minister of the sick and receive from them whatever medicine is necessary.\" A- Malek explains that although the Church does not discourage any believer from seeking proper medical attention, it is important to have God in their hearts as their only true Provider and Healer. In other words, medical alternatives are considered as tools but God is the one who fills and completes the medicine ministered by human.\n\nDaniel B. Clendenin affirms in his book, Eastern Orthodox Theology: A Contemporary Reader, that this Unction is not limited to the number of times one receives it; he goes in so far to say, “It should be used as medicine, whenever there is need.” There are many explanations and reasons as to why Copts seek spiritual healing instead or in addition to medical practices. A-Malek explains that while the sixth sacrament is certainly practiced and healing may come from it, it should not replace the practices of Western medicine. It is argued that Copts seek spiritual healing from the Church for three main motives: First, as previously explained above, Egyptian Christians are devout, religious people and truly believe in God’s grace and miracles. Second, Egyptians are very traditional people and do not appreciate Western influence so many resort to using spiritual folk remedies. And finally, many Coptic Egyptians live in remote areas where doctors are inconvenient and are not affordable. From the beginning of time, Egyptian medicine contained a strong element of religious magic. From ancient civilization, Egypt acquired the first physician, Imhotep, as well as the first medical textbook Ebers Papyrus. While offering prayers and sacrifices to religious deities, they also took preventive measures such as storing grain against future need. Researchers have also founded a school offering education to Egyptian physicians that dated as early as 1100 b.c. Here, a number of practical therapeutic remedies of care for the sick were developed and still exercised. Since medicine has a long history in Egypt, Egyptians feel that there is no specific need to Western medicine. With this in mind, Egyptians still partake in traditional remedies and believe that religious powers are beyond the most influential. Other than tradition, most Egyptians view public health as a burden. The Oxford Business Group provides essential information in The Report: Egypt 2010, and further identifies the overburden of the health system in Egypt. For example, making an appointment at a public clinic requires the patients to fill out a substantial amount of paperwork. This is problematic for two main reasons: First lower-class citizens may be illiterate and not able to fill forms and most importantly, many Egyptians don’t have sufficient documentation or money to see a physician. Another key information that is presented is that the public health facilities are centered in urban areas – around two-thirds of facilities are located in Cairo and Alexandria. Of course, this benefits the wealthy patients since it is readily available to them and some may even receive private care more regularly than the less affluent. “The population is very price-sensitive,” said Hazen Adlan, the medical director of Dar El Mona Hospital, “oftentimes if they can't afford care, they just don’t go to the doctor’s office,” he added. These conditions along with many others push and motivate most Copts to rely on the Church for its consistent therapeutical and medical support. However, the most significant factor of Church reliance is the passing of folklores. Since there have been many stories of healings, Egyptians pass certain traditions and stories among their friends and families. In recent time, a \nPriest named Father Makary Younan has performed many spiritual healings in his church Saint Mary and Saint Makar in Oleya. Although he’s widely recognized for his excursions of exorcism, Father Makary has also provided instant healing among Christians and Muslims. His performance started with a small crowd and by word of mouth and many success stories later, the Church is now surrounded by thousands people every Thursday as he performs the Sacrament of healing to hundreds of people within the society and worldwide.\n"}
{"id": "175812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175812", "title": "David Brooks (commentator)", "text": "David Brooks (commentator)\n\nDavid Brooks (born August 11, 1961) is a Canadian-born American conservative political and cultural commentator who writes for \"The New York Times\". He has worked as a film critic for \"The Washington Times\"; a reporter and later op-ed editor for \"The Wall Street Journal\"; a senior editor at \"The Weekly Standard\" from its inception; a contributing editor at \"Newsweek\" and \"The Atlantic Monthly\"; and a commentator on NPR. Brooks is currently a columnist for \"The New York Times\" and commentator on \"PBS NewsHour\". Brooks also serves on the board of the radical centrist New America think tank.\n\nBrooks was born in Toronto, Ontario, where his father was working on a PhD, and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Brooks is Jewish but rarely attends synagogue. As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history. His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.\n\nAs an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: \"In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.\" To his piece, Brooks appended the note: \"Some would say I'm envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?\" When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.\n\nUpon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Chicago Sun Times\". He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley's \"National Review\". According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley's Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut, and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.\n\nBrooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. \"National Review\" was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in \"The New Republic\" that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn't been for his being Jewish. \"If true, it would be upsetting,\" Brooks says.\n\nAfter his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for \"The Washington Times\".\n\nIn 1986, Brooks was hired by \"The Wall Street Journal\", where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\", which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, \"The Wall Street Journal\" posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, where he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative \"Weekly Standard\" when it was launched in 1994. In 1996, he edited an anthology, \"Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.\"\n\nIn 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled \"Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There\" to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or \"new upper class\" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.\n\nAccording to a 2010 article in \"New York Magazine\" written by Christopher Beam, \"New York Times\" editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.\n\nCollins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. \"I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn't make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,\" says Collins. \"He was perfect.\" Brooks started writing in September 2003. \"The first six months were miserable,\" Brooks says. \"I'd never been hated on a mass scale before.\"\n\nIn 2004, Brooks' book \"\" was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, \"Bobos in Paradise\", but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of \"The Best American Essays\" (publication date October 2, 2012), and authored \"The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement\". The book was excerpted in \"The New Yorker\" magazine in January 2011 and received mixed reviews upon its full publication in March of that year. The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the \"Publishers Weekly\" best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.\n\nBrooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006. In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.\n\nIn 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees. He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.\n\nIdeologically, Brooks has been described as a moderate, a centrist, a conservative, and a moderate conservative. Brooks has described himself as a \"moderate\", and said in a 2017 interview that \"[one] of [his] callings is to represent a certain moderate Republican Whig political philosophy.\" \"Ottawa Citizen\" conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a \"sophisticated pundit\"; one of \"those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda\". When asked what he thinks of charges that he's \"not a real conservative\" or \"squishy\", Brooks has said that \"if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don't fit that agenda. But I do think that I'm part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke ... and Alexander Hamilton.\" In fact, Brooks read Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and \"completely despised it\", but \"gradually over the next five to seven years ... came to agree with him\". Brooks claims that \"my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself.\" In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, \"If it's from a loon, I don't mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it's Michelle Malkin attacking, I don't mind it.\" With respect to whether he was \"the liberals' favorite conservative\" Brooks said he \"didn't care\", stating: \"I don't mind liberals praising me, but when it's the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it's like uhhh, I gotta rethink this.\"\n\nBrooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, \"coming to my senses.\" He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman. As Brooks describes it, \"[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. ... That didn't immediately turn me into a conservative, but ...\"\n\nBefore the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as \"a witheringly condescending\" column portraying Senator Harry Reid as an \"unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence.\" By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts. In 2015, Brooks wrote that \"[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment\" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself. Brooks wrote \"many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no.\" Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a \"fable\" the idea that \"intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war.\" Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that \"[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty.\"\n\nHis dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being \"a farce\" and having \"no significance\" was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.\n\nOn August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for \"The New York Times\" titled \"Party No. 3\". The column imagined a moderate McCain-Lieberman Party in opposition to both major parties, which he perceived as polarized and beholden to special interests.\n\nBrooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a \"cancer\" on the Republican Party. He has referred to her as a \"joke\", unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination. But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous \"cancer\" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.\n\nIn a March 2007, article published in \"The New York Times\" titled \"No U-Turns\", Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks \"has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can't still think it's going to happen soon.\"\n\nBrooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, \"The New Republic\" describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: \"Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don't know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew \"both\" better than me. ... I remember distinctly an image of – we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I'm thinking, a) he's going to be president and b) he'll be a very good president.\" Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks \"like a writer\", explaining, \"He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people.\" Two days after Obama's second autobiography, \"The Audacity of Hope\", hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in \"The New York Times\", titled \"Run, Barack, Run\", urging the Chicago politician to run for president. However, in December 2011, during a C-SPAN interview, Brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a \"B-\", and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50–50 if elections were held at that time. He stated, \"I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have.\" However, in a February 2016 \"New York Times\" op-ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's \"integrity\" and \"humanity\" among other characteristics.\n\nIn writing for \"The New York Times\" in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as \"an astonishing success story\". He wrote that \"Jews are a famously accomplished group,\" who, because they were \"forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages ... have been living off their wits ever since\". In Brooks' view, \"Israel's technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world.\"\n\nIn 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in \"The New York Times\" titled \"The Nature of Poverty\" specifically followed the social uproar caused by the death of Freddie Gray, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are \"matters of social psychology\". When discussing Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was \"not on the path to upward mobility\".\n\nIn regard to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be \"competent\" and \"normal\" in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump. In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually be victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become \"sick of\" Trump.\n\nWhen discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a \"New York Times\" op-ed he titled \"No, Not Trump, Not Ever\". In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is \"epically unprepared to be president\" and by pointing out Trump's \"steady obliviousness to accuracy\".\n\nBrooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that \"sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious\" by \"waiting longer to have sex ... [and] having fewer partners\". He sees the culture war as nearly over, because \"today's young people ... seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right.\" As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be \"in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair\".\n\nAs early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: \"We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity ... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage.\"\n\nBrooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.\n\nOn the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.\n\nBrooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual. In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for \"Philadelphia\" magazine, fact-checked \"Bobos in Paradise\", concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth. He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: \"He laughed ... '[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek' ... I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of 'taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said.\" Brooks later said the article made him feel that \"I \"suck\" ... I can't remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.\" In 2015, \"Salon\" found that Brooks had got \"nearly every detail\" wrong about a poll of high-school students.\n\nMichael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of \"fearless generalizing ... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke\". Writing for \"Gawker\", which consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting \"possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief\". Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the \"New York Magazine\", criticized Brooks' statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used \"some very tricksy, misleading math\".\n\nAdditionally, Sean Illing of \"Slate\" criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming he argued his point by framing his sources' arguments out of context and routinely making bold \"half-right\" assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.\n\nIn 2016, James Taranto criticized Brooks' analysis of a U.S. Supreme Court case, writing that \"Brooks's treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant\". Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks \"distorts rather grotesquely\" the case in question. Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having \"scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done\".\n\nIn 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called \"The Hookies\", the honor was renamed \"The Sidney Awards\" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.\n\nBrooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism and changed her given name to Sarah. In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced. In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.\n\nAccording to \"The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles\", in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\", Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "177526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177526", "title": "Ferdinand Christian Baur", "text": "Ferdinand Christian Baur\n\nFerdinand Christian Baur (21 June 1792 – December 1860) was a German Protestant theologian and founder and leader of the (new) Tübingen School of theology (named for the University of Tübingen where Baur studied and taught). Following Hegel's theory of dialectic, Baur argued that second century Christianity represented the synthesis of two opposing theses: Jewish Christianity (Petrine Christianity) and Gentile Christianity (Pauline Christianity). This and the rest of Baur's work had a profound impact upon higher criticism of biblical and related texts.\n\nAdolf Hilgenfeld followed Baur's lead and edited the Tübingen School's journal, though he was less radical than Baur. A patristic scholar and philosopher at Tübingen, Albert Schwegler, gave the School's theories their most vigorous expression. The School's influence peaked in the 1840s, but was waning by the early twentieth century.\n\nBaur's views were revolutionary, but \"one thing is certain: New Testament study, since his time, has had a different colour\" (H.S. Nash). He had a number of followers, who in many cases modified his positions, and the groundwork laid by Baur continues to be built upon in the twenty-first century.\n\nBaur was born at Schmiden, near Cannstatt. After training at the theological seminary of Blaubeuren, he went in 1809 to the University of Tübingen. Here he studied for a time under Ernst Bengel, grandson of the eminent New Testament critic, Johann Albrecht Bengel, and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old Tübingen School. But at the same time the philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling were creating a wide and deep impression. In 1817 Baur returned to the theological seminary at Blaubeuren as professor. This move marked a turning-point in his life, for he now set to work on the investigations on which his reputation rests. He had already, in 1817, written a review of G. Kaiser's \"Biblische Theologie\" for Bengel's \"Archiv für Theologie\" (ii. 656); its tone was moderate and conservative.\n\nWhen, a few years after his appointment at Blaubeuren, he published his first important work, \"Symbolik und Mythologie oder die Naturreligion des Altertums\" (\"Symbol and mythology: the natural religion of Antiquity\", 1824–1825), it became evident that he had made a deeper study of philosophy, and had come under the influence of Schelling and more particularly of Friedrich Schleiermacher. The learning of the work was fully recognized, and in 1826 the author was called to Tübingen as professor of theology. It is with Tübingen that his greatest literary achievements are associated. His earlier publications here treated of mythology and the history of dogma. \"Das manichäische Religionssystem\" (\"The Manichaean religious system\") appeared in 1831, \"Apollonius von Tyana\" in 1832, \"Die christliche Gnosis\" (\"Christian Gnosis\") in 1835, and \"Über das Christliche im Platonismus oder Socrates und Christus\" (\"On Christianity in Platonism: Socrates and Christ\") in 1837. As Otto Pfleiderer (Pflederer 1890 p. 285) observes, \"the choice not less than the treatment of these subjects is indicative of the large breadth of view and the insight of the historian into the comparative history of religion.\"\n\nFerdinand Christian Baur, the founder of the \"Tübingen School\" of New Testament criticism, rested his ideas about the New Testament on the Clementines, and his ideas about the Clementines on St. Epiphanius, who found the writings used by an Ebionite sect in the 4th century. This Judeo-Christian sect at that date rejected St. Paul as an apostate. It was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the Christianity of the Twelve Apostles; Paulinism was originally a heresy, and a schism from the Jewish Christianity of James and Peter and the rest; Marcion was a leader of the Pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century, using only the Pauline Gospel, St. Luke (in its original form), and the Epistles of St. Paul (without the Pastoral Epistles). The Clementine literature had its first origin in the Apostolic Age, and belonged to the original Jewish, Petrine, legal Church. It is directed wholly against St. Paul and his sect. Simon Magus never existed; it is a nickname for St. Paul. The Acts of the Apostles, compiled in the 2nd century, have borrowed their mention of Simon from the earliest form of the Clementines. Catholicism under the presidency of Rome was the result of the adjustment between the Petrine and Pauline sections of the Church in the second half of the 2nd century. The Fourth Gospel is a monument of this reconciliation, in which Rome took a leading part, having invented the fiction that both Peter and Paul were the founders of her Church, both having been martyred at Rome, and on the same day, in perfect union.\n\nThroughout the middle of the 19th century this theory, in many forms, was dominant in Germany. The demonstration, mainly by English scholars, of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the New Testament documents (four Epistles of St. Paul and the Apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date), and the proofs of the authenticity of the Apostolic Fathers and of the use of St. John's Gospel by Justin, Papias, and Ignatius, gradually brought Baur's theories into discredit. Of the original school, Adolf Hilgenfeld may be considered the last survivor (died 1907). He was induced to admit that Simon Magus was a real personage, though he persisted that in the Clementines he is meant for St. Paul. In 1847 Hilgenfeld dated the original nucleus (Kerygmata Petrou) soon after the Jewish war of 70; successive revisions of it were anti-Basilidian, anti-Valentinian, and anti-Marcionite respectively. Baur placed the completed form, ‘‘H’’, soon after the middle of the 2nd century, and Schliemann (1844) agreed, placing ‘‘R’’, as a revision, between 211 and 230. Other writers dated both ‘‘H’’ and ‘‘R’’ to between the 2nd and 4th centuries:\n\n\nMeantime Baur had exchanged one master in philosophy for another, Schleiermacher for Hegel. In doing so, he had adopted completely the Hegelian philosophy of history. \"Without philosophy,\" he has said, \"history is always for me dead and dumb.\" The change of view is illustrated clearly in the essay, published in the \"Tübinger Zeitschrift\" for 1831, on the Christ-party in the Corinthian Church, \"Die Christuspartei in der korinthischen Gemeinde, der Gegensatz des paulinischen und petrinischen Christentums in der ältesten Kirche, der Apostel Petrus in Rom\", the trend of which is suggested by the title (in English, 'The Christ Party in the Corinthian Community, the Opposition of Pauline and Petrine Christianity in the earliest Church, the apostle Peter in Rome'). Baur contends that the apostle Paul was opposed in Corinth by a Jewish Christian party that wished to set up its own form of Christian religion instead of his universal Christianity. He found traces of a keen conflict of parties in the post-apostolic age, which have passed into the mainstream of Early Christian historiography.\n\nThe theory is further developed in a later work (1835, the year in which David Strauss' \"Leben Jesu\" was published), \"Über die sogenannten Pastoralbriefe\". In this Baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned in the Second Epistle to Timothy and Epistle to Titus are the Gnostics, particularly the Marcionites, of the 2nd century, and consequently that the Pastoral Epistles were produced in the middle of the 2nd century in opposition to Gnosticism.\n\nHe next proceeded to investigate other Pauline epistles and the \"Acts of the Apostles\" in the same manner, publishing his results in 1845 under the title \"Paulus, der Apostel Jesu Christi, sein Leben und Wirken, seine Briefe und seine Lehre\". In this he contends that only the Epistle to the Galatians, First and Second Epistle to the Corinthians and Epistle to the Romans are genuinely Pauline, and that the Paul of the Acts of the Apostles is a different person from the Paul of these genuine Epistles, the author being a Paulinist who, with an eye to the different parties in the Church, is at pains to represent Peter as far as possible as a Paulinist and Paul as far as possible as a Petrinist.\n\nBaur was prepared to apply his theory to the whole of the New Testament; in the words of H. S. Nash, \"he carried a sweeping hypothesis into the examination of the New Testament.\" He considers those writings alone genuine in which the conflict between Jewish-Christians and Gentile-Christians is clearly marked. In his \"Kritische Untersuchungen über die kanonischen Evangelien, ihr Verhältniss zu einander, ihren Charakter und Ursprung\" (1847) he turns his attention to the Gospels, and here again finds that the authors were conscious of the conflict of parties; the Gospels reveal a mediating or conciliatory tendency (\"Tendenz\") on the part of the writers or redactors. The Gospels, in fact, are adaptations or redactions of an older Gospel, such as the Gospel of the Hebrews, of Peter, of the Egyptians, or of the Ebionites. The Petrine Matthew bears the closest relationship to this original Gospel (\"Urevangelium\"); the Pauline Luke is later and arose independently; Mark represents a still later development according to Baur; the account in John is idealistic: it \"does not possess historical truth, and cannot and does not really lay claim to it.\"\n\nBaur's theory starts with the supposition that Christianity was gradually developed out of Judaism, see also List of events in early Christianity. Before it could become a universal religion, it had to struggle with Jewish limitations and to overcome them. The early Christians were Jewish-Christians, to whom Jesus was the Messiah. Paul, on the other hand, represented a breach with Judaism, the Temple, and the Law. Thus there was some antagonism between the Jewish apostles Peter, James and John, and Paul the \"Apostle to the Gentiles\", and this struggle continued down to the middle of the 2nd century. In short, the conflict between Petrinism and Paulinism is, as Karl Schwarz puts it, the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd century.\n\nBaur was a theologian and historian as well as a Biblical critic. As early as 1834 he published a strictly theological work, \"Gegensatz des Katholicismus und Protestantismus nach den Prinzipien und Hauptdogmen der beiden Lehrbegriffe\", a strong defence of Protestantism on the lines of Schleiermacher's \"Glaubenslehre\", and a vigorous reply to J. Möhler's \"Symbolik\" (1833). This was followed by his larger histories of dogma, \"Die christliche Lehre von der Versöhnung in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung bis auf die neueste Zeit\" (1838), \"Die christliche Lehre von der Dreieinigkeit und Menschwerdung Gottes in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung\" (3 vols., 1841–1843), and the \"Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte\" (1847). The value of these works is impaired somewhat by Baur's habit of making the history of dogma conform to the formulae of Hegel's philosophy, a procedure \"which only served to obscure the truth and profundity of his conception of history as a true development of the human mind\" (Pfleiderer). Baur, however, soon came to attach more importance to personality, and to distinguish more carefully between religion and philosophy.\nThe change is noticeable in his \"Epochen der kirchlichen Geschichtschreibung\" (1852), \"Das Christenthum und die christiche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte\" (1853), and \"Die christliche Kirche von Anfang des vierten bis zum Ende das sechsten Jahrhunderts\" (1859), works preparatory to his \"Kirchengeschichte\", in which the change of view is specially pronounced.\n\nBaur died, aged 68, in Tübingen. The \"Kirchengeschichte\" was published in five volumes during the years 1853-1863, partly by Baur himself, partly by his son, Ferdinand Baur, and his son-in-law, Eduard Zeller, from notes and lectures which the author left behind him. Pfleiderer describes this work, especially the first volume, as a classic for all time. \"Taken as a whole, it is the first thorough and satisfactory attempt to explain the rise of Christianity and the Church on strictly historical lines, i.e. as a natural development of the religious spirit of our race under the combined operation of various human causes\" (\"Development of Theology\", p. 288). Baur's lectures on the history of dogma, \"Ausführlichere Vorlesungen uber die christliche Dogmengeschichte\", were published later by his son (1865–1868).\n\nThe Tübingen School was at the height of its influence in the 1840s, but lost ground to historical fact. Since Adolf von Harnack proposed very early dates for the synoptics and Acts (c. 1910), the Tübingen School has been generally abandoned.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22726745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22726745", "title": "Frashokereti", "text": "Frashokereti\n\nFrashokereti (\"\") is the Avestan-language term (corresponding to Middle Persian \"fraš(a)gird\" <plškrt>) for the Zoroastrian doctrine of a final renovation of the universe, when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). \n\nThe doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the \"salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.\" Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.\n\nThe name suggests \"making wonderful, excellent\". D. N. MacKenzie in \"A Concise Dictionary of Pahlavi\" gives the meaning as \"the Restoration (at the end of time)\". Considering this meaning, the first part could indicate \"early, first, initial\", related to \"fra\" prefix, cognate with \"pro\" in Greek and Latin. Then the overall meaning being \"making into initial state\", hence \"restoration\". \n\nThe eschatological ideas are only alluded to in the surviving texts of the Avesta, and are known of in detail only from the texts of Zoroastrian tradition, in particular in the ca. 9th century \"Bundahishn\". The accompanying story, as it appears in the \"Bundahishn\" (\"GBd\" 30.1ff), runs as follows: At the end of the \"third time\" (the first being the age of creation, the second of mixture, and the third of separation), there will be a great battle between the forces of good (the \"yazata\"s) and those of evil (the \"daeva\"s) in which the good will triumph. On earth, the Saoshyant will bring about a resurrection of the dead in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a last judgment through ordeal. The \"yazata\"s Airyaman and Atar will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All mankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (\"ashavan\") it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate Angra Mainyu and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.\n\nThe narrative continues with a projection of Ahura Mazda and the six Amesha Spentas solemnizing a final act of worship (\"yasna\"), and the preparation of \"parahaoma\" from \"white haoma\". The righteous will partake of the \"parahaoma\", which will confer immortality upon them. Thereafter, humankind will become like the Amesha Spentas, living without food, without hunger or thirst, and without weapons (or possibility of bodily injury). The material substance of the bodies will be so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language and belong to a single nation without borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with the divine for a perpetual exaltation of God's glory.\n\nAlthough \"frashokereti\" is a restoration of the time of creation, there is no return to the uniqueness of the primordial plant, animal and human; while in the beginning there was one plant, one animal and one human, the variety that had since issued would remain forever. Similarly, the host of divinities brought into existence by Mazda continue to have distinct existences, \"and there is no prophecy of their re-absorption into the Godhead.\"\n\n\n"}

It also prohibits discrimination based on religion and provides for the freedom to practice religious rites as long as doing so does not disrupt public order. The Government generally respected this right, but within defined parameters that placed limitations on the right in practice. While the Government continued to protect the free practice of religion in general, it formalized previously unwritten prohibitions on religious gatherings in locations other than government-approved houses of worship, and on non-Islamic institutions issuing publications within their communities, without prior approval from the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs (MERA). There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 2.5 million, of whom 1.9 million are citizens. The government does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, but three quarters of Omanis adhere to the Ibadi sect of Islam, while the remaining 25% are either Sunni or Shia Muslims. There are small communities of 5% ethnically Indian Hindus and Christians that have been naturalized. Ibadism historically has been Oman's dominant religious sect, and the Sultan is a member of the Ibadi community. The Government, however, does not give official preference to any particular religious group.\n\nNon-Ibadi and non-Sunni religious communities individually constitute less than 5 percent of the population and include, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians. Christian communities are centered in the major urban areas of Muscat, Sohar, and Salalah and are represented by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and various Protestant congregations. These groups tend to organize along linguistic and ethnic lines. More than 50 different Christian groups, fellowships, and assemblies are active in the Muscat metropolitan area. Shi'a Muslims are a small but well-integrated minority, concentrated in the capital area and along the northern coast. The majority of non-Muslims, however, are noncitizen immigrant workers from South Asia. There are also communities of ethnic Indian Hindus. Muscat has two Hindu temples. One of them is over a hundred years old. There is also a significant Sikh community in Oman. Though there are no permanent gurudwaras, many smaller gurudwaras in makeshift camps exist and are recognised by the government. The Government of India had signed an accord in 2008 with the Omani government to build a permanent gurudwara but little progress has been made on the matter.\n\nThe Basic Law declares that Islam is the state religion and that Shari'a (Islamic law) is the source of legislation. It also prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of religion or religious identity and provides for the freedom to practice religious rites so long as doing so does not disrupt public order. In May 2006 the MERA issued a circular to non-Muslim religious leaders and diplomatic missions, reaffirming the individual's right to practice his or her own religious activities according to his or her values, customs, and traditions; however, the circular informed them that gatherings of a religious nature are not allowed in private homes or any other locations except government-approved houses of worship. The circular, which formalized existing, but unwritten, government policy, also prohibits non-Islamic institutions from issuing publications within their communities without prior ministerial approval.\n\nAll religious organizations must be registered and licensed by the MERA. The Ministry recognizes the Protestant Church of Oman, the Catholic Diocese of Oman, the al Amana Center (interdenominational Christian), the Hindu Mahajan Association, and the Anwar al-Ghubaira Trading Company in Muscat (Sikh) as the official sponsors for non-Islamic religious communities. Groups seeking licensure must request meeting and worship space from one of these sponsor organizations, which are responsible for recording the group's doctrinal adherence, the names of its leaders, and the number of active members and submitting this information to the Ministry. Members of non-Islamic communities were free to maintain links with fellow adherents abroad and undertake foreign travel for religious purposes. The Government permitted clergy from abroad to enter the country, under the sponsorship of licensed religious organizations, for the purposes of teaching or leading worship.\n\nOfficials at the MERA claim that there is no limit on the number of groups that can be licensed. New religious groups unaffiliated with one of the main communities must gain ministerial approval before receiving a license. While the Government has not published the rules, regulations, or criteria for approval, the Ministry generally considers the group's size, theology or belief system, and availability of other worship opportunities before granting approval. The Ministry employs similar criteria before granting approval for new Muslim groups to form. According to government regulations, mosques must be built at least 1 kilometer apart and only on government-owned land.\n\nReligious leaders of all faiths must be licensed with the MERA. The Ministry has a formal licensing process for Muslim imams, however unlicensed lay members are not prohibited from leading prayers in mosques. Lay members of non-Islamic communities may lead worship if they are specified as leaders in their group's licensing application. Foreigners on tourist visas are prohibited from preaching, teaching, or leading worship.\n\nApostasy is not a criminal offense under Omani law. Citizens who convert from Islam to another faith, however, generally face problems under Oman's Personal Status and Family Legal Code, which specifically prohibits a father who leaves the Islamic faith from retaining paternal rights over his children. The law does not prohibit proselytizing, but the MERA will stop individuals or groups from engaging in it if the Ministry receives complaints. The Government uses immigration regulations and laws against harassment to enforce the Ministry's policy. Article 209 of the Penal Code assigns a prison sentence and fine to anyone who publicly blasphemes God or His prophets, commits an affront to religions and faiths by spoken or written word, or breaches the peace of a lawful religious gathering; this could be used to limit religious expression. However, there were no reports of any prosecutions under this statute during the reporting period. The Ministry reviews all imported religious material for approval.\n\nLaws governing family and personal status are adjudicated by Oman's civil courts, according to the Personal Status and Family Legal Code, which is based on the principles of Shari'a. Some aspects of the code discriminate against women, particularly by favoring male heirs in adjudicating inheritance claims. While there was continuing reluctance to take an inheritance dispute to court, for fear of alienating the family, women increasingly were aware of, and took steps to protect and exercise, their rights as citizens. Article 282 of the code exempts non-Muslims from the code's provisions, allowing them to follow their own religious rules pertaining to family or personal status.\n\nInstruction in Islam is mandatory in the basic curriculum in all public school grades K-12. Non-Muslim students are allowed to opt out of the public school system and attend private schools that do not offer instruction in Islam. Non-Muslim members of the military are also exempt from otherwise mandatory Islamic studies. Military bases maintain at least one mosque and one imam for the convenience of military personnel. Training facilities dedicate approximately three sessions per week for the study of Islamic subjects. While non-Muslim members of the military were not prohibited from practicing their own religion, the military did not provide them with alternative places of worship on base.\n\nThe Government sponsored fora for examining differing interpretations of Islam, and government-sponsored interfaith dialogues took place on a regular basis. Private groups that promote interfaith dialogue were permitted to exist, as long as discussions did not constitute an attempt to cause Muslims to recant their Islamic beliefs. During the reporting period, the MERA hosted several Christian and Muslim scholars and lecturers of various schools of thought to discuss interfaith relations and tolerance in Islamic traditions.\n\nThe Islamic holy days of Eid al-Adha, Islamic (Hijra) New Year, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, Ascension Day, and Eid al-Fitr are national holidays.\n\nWhile the Government generally respected the freedom of religion, some government procedures and policies placed limitations on religious practice.\n\nThe prohibition on group worship in private homes or other locations limited the ability of some adherents who were physically distant from those locations or who lacked reliable transportation to practice their faith collectively. There were reports that government officials monitored and stopped several small groups from meeting in unsanctioned locations during the reporting period. On the whole, churches and temples voluntarily abided by the May 2006 circular, taking steps to enforce the prohibitions among groups under their sponsorship and provide space on their compounds for worship; however, the lack of sufficient space in the existing locations sanctioned by the Government for collective worship, as well as long waiting lists for use of these facilities, effectively limited the number of groups that could operate.\n\nThe MERA approved a limited number of \"church visas\" to professional clergy of non-Islamic congregations. Some leaders in these congregations claimed, however, that the number of approved clergy was insufficient to handle the demand for worship and therefore limited the natural growth of these congregations.\n\nThe MERA monitored sermons at mosques to ensure that imams did not discuss political topics. The Government expected all imams to preach sermons within the parameters of standardized texts distributed monthly by the Ministry. While the MERA did not control the content of sermons in non-Islamic communities, groups were prohibited from issuing any publications without obtaining the Ministry's prior approval.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the MERA met with visiting leaders of some non-Islamic faiths regarding the state of their communities in Oman and discussed the possibility of allowing groups to establish new places of worship in other metropolitan areas. The Ministry provided an additional 10,000 square meters of space to one of the Christian compounds in Muscat to facilitate its expansion, which could help ease space constraints that limit religious practice.\n\nThere were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.\n\n\n"}

Mucius, with the approval of the Roman Senate, snuck into the Etruscan camp with the intent of murdering Porsena. Since it was the soldiers' pay day, there were two similarly dressed people, one of whom was the king, on a raised platform speaking to the troops. This caused Mucius to misidentify his target, and he killed Porsena's scribe by mistake. After being captured, he famously declared to Porsena: \"I am Gaius Mucius, a citizen of Rome. I came here as an enemy to kill my enemy, and I am as ready to die as I am to kill. We Romans act bravely and, when adversity strikes, we suffer bravely.\" He also declared that he was the first of three hundred Roman youths to volunteer for the task of assassinating Porsena at the risk of losing their own lives.\n\n\"Watch\", he is said to have declared, \"so that you know how cheap the body is to men who have their eye on great glory\". Mucius thrust his right hand into a fire which was lit for sacrifice and held it there without giving any indication of pain, thereby earning for himself and his descendants the cognomen \"Scaevola\", meaning \"left-handed\". Porsena was shocked at the youth's bravery, and dismissed him from the Etruscan camp, free to return to Rome, saying \"Go back, since you do more harm to yourself than me\". At the same time, the king also sent ambassadors to Rome to offer peace.\n\nMucius was granted farming land on the right-hand bank of the Tiber, which later became known as the \"Mucia Prata\" (Mucian Meadows).\n\nIt is not clear whether the story of Mucius is historical or mythical. Parallels noted by Georges Dumezil with the Germanic Týr suggest the possibility the Scaevola story is a pseudo-historical version of an older Indo-European myth involving an act of divine perjury to overcome an existential threat to the gods or the world (or in the Scaevola story, human perjury to preserve the Roman state).\n\nThe story of Mucius inspired a punishment in Rome's Colosseum for condemned prisoners where they would be forced to reenact this tale.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52426072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52426072", "title": "Grand Magal of Touba", "text": "Grand Magal of Touba\n\nThe Grand Magal of Touba is the annual religious pilgrimage of the Senegalese Mouride Brotherhood, one of the four tariqa (Islamic Sufi orders) of Senegal. On the 18th of Safar, the second month of the Islamic calendar, pilgrims gather in the holy Mouride city of Touba to celebrate the life and teachings of Cheikh Amadou Bamba, the founder of the brotherhood.\n\nThe Grand Magal has been recognized as \"one of the most popular pilgrimages in the world,\" with over 3 million participating in 2011. The pilgrimage dates back to 1928 (one year after Bamba's death) and commemorates his 1895 exile to Gabon by the French colonial government.\n\n\"Magal\" is a Wolof word derived from the verb \"mag,\" which means \"to be important\" or \"to be old\"; the noun form is translated as \"celebration\" or \"anniversary.\" There are other Mouride magals annually, such as the Magal of Saint Louis, which commemorates a prayer performed by the saint in 1895 in defiance of colonial authorities. However, the Grand Magal is the most important and widely attended of the Mouride magals - indeed, it is the largest celebration in Senegal, religious or secular.\n\nThe Grand Magal originates in a request of Cheikh Amadou Bamba's in which he asked that his followers celebrate the anniversary of his exile to Gabon. However, after the Cheikh's death in 1927, his son and successor Serigne Moustapha Mbacke organized the first Mouride gathering on the anniversary of his death rather than his exile (the first of these early Magals occurred in 1928, with an estimated participation of 70,000). This date remained until 1946, when Serigne Moustapha Mbacke's successor, Falilou Mbacke, changed the date of the Magal to the anniversary of Bamba's exile, in accordance with the Cheikh's original wishes. The period of exile in Gabon holds great importance to Mourides: it is seen as a time of persecution and testing of Bamba's spiritual strength and resolve.\n\nThe Grand Magal has grown over the years, from hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attending in the later decades of the twentieth century to nearly 2 million in 2000 and over 3 million in 2011. The event is televised, with coverage in part serving the Mouride Brotherhood's proselytizing mission; video cassettes of the Magal are sold domestically and internationally as well.\n\nThe date of the Grand Magal is determined by the Islamic calendar (known as the Hijri calendar), which is based on the lunar year. Each year, the events of the pilgrimage begin on the 18th of Safar and last for two days. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the date for the Grand Magal changes from year to year. Thus, each year in the Gregorian calendar, the pilgrimage starts eleven days (sometimes ten days) earlier than the preceding year. This makes it possible for the pilgrimage season to fall twice in one Gregorian year, and it does so every 33 years, most recently in 2013. The Grand Magal of 2017 will begin on November 7, 2017 (with the small possibility of a one-day error). The table below shows the Gregorian dates of the Grand Magal of recent years:\n\nThe Grand Magal is at once a ceremony and a festival, containing both religious rituals and entertainment. \"No other event in Senegal, religious or secular, attracts as much attention\", writes Villalón; it is \"anticipated for weeks and generates a general effervescence.\" The rites of the pilgrimage bear similarities to those of the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca: the two central events of the Magal are visits to the Great Mosque of Touba, which involves a partial circumambulation of the mosque, and to the mausoleum of Cheikh Amadou Bamba, which is believed to be infused with the \"barakah\", or spiritual power, of the Cheikh. Pilgrims pray with outstretched hands and touch the walls and doors of the mausoleum, and some drop coins inside the area around the tomb, which is fenced off. They may wait for over six hours for a few minutes of prayer at these locations.\n\nPilgrims also visit the mausoleums of other important Mouride leaders, many of whose tombs are located near the mosque. Other common sites to visit include the \"Well of Mercy,\" said to have been created by God to flow for Cheikh Amadou Bamba, and the central library of Touba, which contains the many writings of the Cheikh and other influential Mourides. Lastly, pilgrims visit their personal Mouride spiritual guides, or marabouts. Each prominent Mouride marabout has a residence in the city from which he accepts visits. During the night, pilgrims gather to sing Arabic poetry (or qaṣāʾid) written by the Cheikh.\n\nThere is also a political dimension to the Grand Magal, in which the most prominent Mouride leaders - including the head of the Brotherhood, or Caliph General (currently Serigne Sidy Mokhtar Mbacké) – grant audiences to official government delegations and others of political importance. The tradition has roots in the colonial period, when it was created to defuse tension and demonstrate mutual recognition between the powerful Mourides and the French colonial government.\n\nInformally, pilgrims also visit Touba's renowned marketplace, one of the biggest in the country. Because of the minimal government presence in the city (due to its religious character), business is conducted with little state regulation or oversight; a wide range of products can thus be found with prices lower than those of any other market in Senegal.\n\nThe large number of pilgrims in Touba during the Grand Magal demands an intense degree of organization and logistical management. Traffic jams and road accidents are common as heavy crowds descend on Touba each year; during the November 2016 Magal, 16 people were killed and 572 injured while travelling to the pilgrimage, according to the lieutenant-colonel of the National Fire Brigade.\n\nIn Touba, workers must act with a high degree of discipline, solidarity, and single-mindedness. The Mouride Baye Fall sect are the principle drivers of this effort and provide much of the logistical manpower. Additionally, different local associations of Mourides (called da'iras) are responsible for maintaining different pilgrimage sites and residents of Touba house and feed the pilgrims. The Senegalese government also provides some technical support, although this is generally kept to a minimum due to the religious nature of the event and site. In 2014, 1300 policemen and 160 healthcare workers were deployed to Touba during the Magal, and the army gave out bread rolls and coffee.\n\nPreparations for the pilgrimage begin officially on 1 Safar each year, seventeen days prior to the pilgrimage, and are led by the Committee of Organization of the Grand Magal of Touba.\n\nBy the late 1970s, significant numbers of Mourides were living abroad; this presence has only grown with the intensifying globalization of the past decades. Community associations of disciples, known as dahiras (a Wolof term derived from the Arabic word for \"circle\"), have arisen in many international cities with robust Mouride communities: in 2011, researchers found 47 cities across western Europe and 16 cities in North America with active Mouride dahiras. According to Ross, \"Murid \"dahiras\" abroad are intended as both extensions of, and conduits to, the holy city itself\" and they organize celebrations of the Grand Magal annually.\n\nIn these gatherings, the singing of sacred Mouride poetry and watching of televised footage from Touba is especially important, as these practices connect expatriate Mourides to their spiritual brethren in Touba. With the organizational support of the dahiras, the Grand Magal and can now be accurately characterized as a truly global phenomenon.\n"}

Such methods continued to be used well into the Middle Ages, especially among Christian apostates and pagans, with Thomas Becket apparently consulting both an aruspex and a chiromancer prior to a royal expedition against Brittany.\n\nThe Latin terms \"haruspex\", \"haruspicina\" are from an archaic word \"haru\" \"entrails, intestines\" (cognate with \"hernia\" \"protruding viscera\", and \"hira\" \"empty gut\"; PIE \"*ǵʰer-\") and from the root \"spec-\" \"to watch, observe\". The Greek ἡπατοσκοπία \"hēpatoskōpia\" is from \"hēpar\" \"liver\" and \"skop- \"to examine\".\n\nThe Babylonians were famous for hepatoscopy. This practice is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel 21:21:\n\n\"For the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shaketh the arrows to and fro, he inquireth of the teraphim, he looketh in the liver\".\n\nThe Nineveh library texts name more than a dozen liver-related terms. The liver was considered the source of the blood and hence the basis of life itself. From this belief, the Babylonians thought they could discover the will of the gods by examining the livers of carefully selected sheep. A priest known as a \"bārû\" was specially trained to interpret the \"signs\" of the liver, and Babylonian scholars assembled a monumental compendium of omens called the Bārûtu. The liver was divided into sections, with each section representing a particular deity.\n\nOne Babylonian clay model of a sheep's liver, dated between 1900 and 1600 BC, is conserved in the British Museum. The model was used for divination, which was important to Mesopotamian medicine. This practice was conducted by priests and seers who looked for signs in the stars, or in the organs of sacrificed animals, to tell them things about a patient’s illness. Wooden pegs were placed in the holes of the clay tablet to record features found in a sacrificed animal's liver. The seer then used these features to predict the course of a patient's illness.\n\nHaruspicy was part of a larger study of organs for the sake of divination, called \"extispicy\", paying particular attention to the positioning of the organs and their shape. There are many records of different peoples using the liver and spleen of various domestic and wild animals to forecast weather. There are hundreds of ancient architectural objects, labyrinths composed of cobblestones in the northern countries that are considered to be a model of the intestines of the sacrificial animal, i.e. the colon of ruminants.\n\nThe Assyro-Babylonian tradition was also adopted in Hittite religion. At least thirty-six liver-models have been excavated at Hattusa. Of these, the majority are inscribed in Akkadian, but a few examples also have inscriptions in the native Hittite language, indicating the adoption of haruspicy as part of the native, vernacular cult.\n\nThe Etruscans were also well known for the practice of divining by the entrails of sheep. A bronze sculpture of a liver known as the \"Liver of Piacenza\", dating to around 100 BC, was discovered in 1877 near the town of Piacenza in northern Italy. It is marked with the name of regions assigned to various deities of Etruscan religion.\n\nThe striking parallel not just of the prevalence of the practice of haruspicy, but the specific artifact type of liver models recording the significance of the various parts of the liver has given rise to the hypothesis of a strong cultural connection between Etruria and the Ancient Near East. From as early as 1900, Ludwig Stieda sought to compare the Etruscan with the Babylonian artifacts. The parallel is taken as one of the main pieces of evidence by those arguing for Etruscan origins in Anatolia, alongside Herodotus' (1.94) claim that the \"Tyrrhenians\" descended from the Lydians, and the linguistic relationship between Etruscan and Lemnian.\n\nThe art of haruspicy was taught in the \"Libri Tagetici\", a collection of texts attributed to Tages, a childlike being who figures in Etruscan mythology, and who was discovered in an open field by Tarchon; the \"Libri Tagetici\" were translated into Latin and employed in reading omens.\n\nThe continuity of the Etruscan tradition among the Romans is indicated by several ancient literary sources, perhaps most famously in the incident related by Suetonius in which a haruspex named Spurinna warned Julius Caesar to beware the Ides of March.\n\nThe emperor Claudius was a student of the Etruscan language and antiquities, and opened a college to preserve and improve their art, which lasted until the reign of Theodosius I, the Christian emperor who dismantled the last active vestiges of the traditional state cult. Further evidence has been found of haruspices in Bath, England where the base of a statue was dedicated by a haruspex named Memor.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1969, he began a nine-year association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi before beginning his career as an author and personal relationship counselor. In 1992 he published the book \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\", which became a long term best seller and formed the central theme of all his subsequent books and career activities. His books have sold millions of copies.\n\nGray was born in Houston, Texas, in 1951 to a father who was an oil executive and a mother who worked at a spiritual bookshop, and grew up with five brothers. His parents were both Christians and taught him Yoga and took him to visit Indian Saint Yogananda during his childhood. \"The Autobiography of A Yogi\" inspired him greatly later in life.\n\nHe received a bachelor's and master's degree in the Science of Creative Intelligence, though sources vary on whether these degrees were received from either the non-accredited Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland or the accredited Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa.\n\nGray received an unaccredited PhD degree by correspondence in 1982 from Columbia Pacific University (CPU), a now-defunct institution located in San Rafael, California upon completion of a correspondence course and an honorary doctorate from Governors State University in Illinois after he delivered their commencement address in 2002.\n\nIn 1969, Gray attended a Transcendental Meditation lecture, later becoming a celibate and personal assistant to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi for nine years.\n\nGray writes a USA-syndicated column with 30 million readers that appears in \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, New York Daily News, New York Newsday, The Denver Post,\" and the \"San Antonio Express-News.\" Internationally, Gray's columns have appeared in publications in England, Canada, Mexico, Korea, Latin American and the South Pacific.\n\nGray is a family therapist and a member of the American Counseling Association and the International Association of Marriage and Family Counselors.\n\nIn 1992, Gray published his book, \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\" which has sold more than 15 million copies and, according to a CNN report, it was the \"highest ranked work of non-fiction\" of the 1990s. The book became a \"popular paradigm\" for problems in relationships based on the different tendencies in each gender and led to infomercials, audiotapes and videotapes, a CD-ROM (the first from HarperReference), weekend seminars, theme vacations, a one-man Broadway show, an TV sitcom plus a movie contract with 20th Century Fox.

Dorothy Cantor, a former president of the American Psychological Association, has questioned the ethics of creating a franchise for what is essentially a therapeutic process.\n\nGray has made numerous media appearances including \"Oprah\", \"The Phil Donahue Show\", and \"Larry King Live.\" Gray has been profiled in \"Newsweek, People\" and \"Forbes\" magazine.\n\nIn a June 2014 interview with Agence France-Presse, Gray was quoted as saying with regard to feminism, \"The reason why there's so much divorce is that feminism promotes independence in women. I'm very happy for women to find greater independence, but when you go too far in that direction, then who's at home?\" He also stated that \"feminism in America holds back sales of [his] books\", while other parts of the world - he cited Australia and Latin America notably - are more in tune with his basic message. With regard to online pornography Gray stated, \"With free internet porn, there's a massive addiction happening,\" adding that there are \"just millions and millions of people... experiencing their sexual satisfactions through total fantasy.

{"id": "163227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163227", "title": "Karl Haushofer", "text": "Karl Haushofer\n\nKarl Ernst Haushofer (27 August 1869 – 10 March 1946) was a German general, geographer and politician. Through his student Rudolf Hess, Haushofer's ideas influenced the development of Adolf Hitler's expansionist strategies, although Haushofer denied direct influence on the Nazi regime. Under the Nuremberg Laws, Haushofer's wife and children were categorized as \"Mischlinge\". His son, Albrecht, was issued a German Blood Certificate through the help of Hess.\n\nHaushofer belonged to a family of artists and scholars. He was born in Munich to Max Haushofer, a professor of economics, and Adele Haushofer (née Fraas). On his graduation from the Munich Gymnasium (high school), Haushofer contemplated an academic career. However, service with the Bavarian Army proved so interesting that he stayed to work, with great success, as an instructor in military academies and on the general staff.\n\nIn 1887, Haushofer entered the 1st Field Artillery regiment \"Prinzregent Luitpold\" and completed \"Kriegsschule\", \"Artillerieschule\" and \"War Academy (Kingdom of Bavaria)\". In 1896, he married Martha Mayer-Doss (1877–1946) whose father was Jewish. They had two sons, Albrecht Haushofer and Heinz Haushofer (1906–1988).\n\nHaushofer continued his career as a professional soldier, serving in the army of Imperial Germany and rising through the Staff Corp by 1899. In 1903, he began teaching at the Bavarian \"War Academy\".\n\nIn November 1908, the army sent him to Tokyo to study the Japanese army and to advise it as an artillery instructor. He travelled with his wife via India and South East Asia and arrived in February 1909. He was received by the Japanese emperor and became acquainted with many important people in politics and the armed forces. In autumn 1909, he travelled with his wife for a month to Korea and Manchuria on the occasion of a railway construction. In June 1910, they returned to Germany via Russia and arrived one month later.\n\nShortly afterwards, he began to suffer from several severe diseases and was given a leave from the army for three years. From 1911 to 1913, Haushofer would work on his doctorate of philosophy from Munich University for a thesis on Japan titled \"Dai Nihon, Betrachtungen über Groß-Japans Wehrkraft, Weltstellung und Zukunft\" (\"Reflections on Greater Japan's Military Strength, World Position, and Future\"). By World War I, he had attained the rank of General, and commanded a brigade on the western front. He became disillusioned after Germany's loss and severe sanctioning; he retired with the rank of major general in 1919. At this time, he forged a friendship with the young Rudolf Hess, who would become his scientific assistant.\n\nHaushofer entered academia with the aim of restoring and regenerating Germany. Haushofer believed the Germans' lack of geographical knowledge and geopolitical awareness to be a major cause of Germany’s defeat in World War I, as Germany had found itself with a disadvantageous alignment of allies and enemies. The fields of political and geographical science thus became his areas of specialty. In 1919, Haushofer became Privatdozent for political geography at Munich University and in 1933 professor.\n\nLouis Pauwels, in his book \"Monsieur Gurdjieff\", describes Haushofer as a former student of George Gurdjieff. Others, including Pauwels, said that Haushofer created a Vril society and that he was a secret member of the Thule Society. Stefan Zweig speaks warmly of him but says history will have to judge how far he knowingly contributed to Nazi doctrine, as more documentation becomes available. Zweig credits him with the concept of Lebensraum, used in a psychological sense of a nation's relative energies.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Nazi regime, Haushofer remained friendly with Hess, who protected Haushofer and his wife from the racial laws of the Nazis, which deemed her a \"half-Jew\". During the prewar years, Haushofer was instrumental in linking Japan to the Axis powers, acting in accordance with the theories of his book \"Geopolitics of the Pacific Ocean\".\n\nAfter the July 20 Plot to assassinate Hitler, Haushofer's son Albrecht (1903–1945) went into hiding but was arrested on 7 December 1944 and put into the Moabit prison in Berlin. During the night of 22–23 April 1945, he and other selected prisoners, such as Klaus Bonhoeffer, were walked out of the prison by an SS-squad and were shot. Beginning on 24 September 1945, Karl Haushofer was informally interrogated by Father Edmund A. Walsh on behalf of the Allied forces to determine whether he should stand trial at Nuremberg for war crimes; Walsh determined that he had not committed any.\n\nOn the night of 10–11 March 1946, he and his wife committed suicide in a secluded hollow on their Hartschimmelhof estate at Pähl/Ammersee. Both drank arsenic and his wife then hanged herself while Haushofer was obviously too weak to do so.\n\nHaushofer developed Geopolitik from widely varied sources, including the writings of Oswald Spengler, Alexander Humboldt, Karl Ritter, Friedrich Ratzel, Rudolf Kjellén, and Halford J. Mackinder.\n\nGeopolitik contributed to Nazi foreign policy chiefly in the strategy and justifications for lebensraum. The theories contributed five ideas to German foreign policy in the interwar period:\n\nGeostrategy as a political science is both descriptive and analytical like political geography but adds a normative element in its strategic prescriptions for national policy. While some of Haushofer's ideas stem from earlier American and British geostrategy, German geopolitik adopted an essentialist outlook toward the national interest, oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a panacea. As a new and essentialist ideology, geopolitik found itself in a position to prey upon the post-World War I insecurity of the populace.\n\nHaushofer's position in the University of Munich served as a platform for the spread of his geopolitical ideas, magazine articles, and books. In 1922, he founded the Institute of Geopolitics in Munich, from which he proceeded to publicize geopolitical ideas. By 1924, as the leader of the German geopolitik school of thought, Haushofer would establish the \"Zeitschrift für Geopolitik\" monthly devoted to geopolitik. His ideas would reach a wider audience with the publication of \"Volk ohne Raum\" by Hans Grimm in 1926, popularizing his concept of lebensraum. Haushofer exercised influence both through his academic teachings, urging his students to think in terms of continents and emphasizing motion in international politics, and through his political activities. While Hitler's speeches would attract the masses, Haushofer's works served to bring the remaining intellectuals into the fold.\n\nGeopolitik was essentially a consolidation and codification of older ideas, given a scientific gloss:\n\nThe key reorientation in each dyad is that the focus is on land-based empire rather than naval imperialism.\n\nOstensibly based upon the geopolitical theory of American naval expert Alfred Thayer Mahan, and British geographer Halford J. Mackinder, German geopolitik adds older German ideas. Enunciated most forcefully by Friedrich Ratzel and his Swedish student Rudolf Kjellén, they include an organic or anthropomorphized conception of the state, and the need for self-sufficiency through the top-down organization of society. The root of uniquely German geopolitik rests in the writings of Karl Ritter who first developed the organic conception of the state that would later be elaborated upon by Ratzel and accepted by Hausfhofer. He justified lebensraum, even at the cost of other nations' existence because conquest was a biological necessity for a state's growth.\n\nRatzel's writings coincided with the growth of German industrialism after the Franco-Prussian war and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with Britain. His writings served as welcome justification for imperial expansion. Influenced by Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power. Haushofer was exposed to Ratzel, who was friends with Haushofer's father, a teacher of economic geography, and would integrate Ratzel's ideas on the division between sea and land powers into his theories, saying that only a country with both could overcome this conflict.\n\nHaushofer's geopolitik expands upon that of Ratzel and Kjellén. While the latter two conceive of geopolitik as the state as an organism in space put to the service of a leader, Haushofer's Munich school specifically studies geography as it relates to war and designs for empire. The behavioral rules of previous geopoliticians were thus turned into dynamic normative doctrines for action on lebensraum and world power.\n\nHaushofer defined geopolitik in 1935 as \"the duty to safeguard the right to the soil, to the land in the widest sense, not only the land within the frontiers of the Reich, but the right to the more extensive \"Volk\" and cultural lands.\" Culture itself was seen as the most conducive element to dynamic special expansion. It provided a guide as to the best areas for expansion, and could make expansion safe, whereas projected military or commercial power could not. Haushofer even held that urbanization was a symptom of a nation's decline, evidencing a decreasing soil mastery, birthrate and effectiveness of centralized rule.\n\nTo Haushofer, the existence of a state depended on living space, the pursuit of which must serve as the basis for all policies. Germany had a high population density, but the old colonial powers had a much lower density, a virtual mandate for German expansion into resource-rich areas. Space was seen as military protection against initial assaults from hostile neighbors with long-range weaponry. A buffer zone of territories or insignificant states on one's borders would serve to protect Germany. Closely linked to that need was Haushofer's assertion that the existence of small states was evidence of political regression and disorder in the international system. The small states surrounding Germany ought to be brought into the vital German order. These states were seen as being too small to maintain practical even if they maintained large colonial possessions and would be better served by protection and organization within Germany. In Europe, he saw Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Greece and the \"mutilated alliance\" of Austro-Hungary as supporting his assertion.\n\nHaushofer's version of autarky was based on the quasi-Malthusian idea that the earth would become saturated with people and no longer able to provide food for all. There would essentially be no increases in productivity.\n\nHaushofer and the Munich school of geopolitik would eventually expand their conception of lebensraum and autarky well past the borders of 1914 and \"a place in the sun\" to a New European Order, then to a New Afro-European Order, and eventually to a Eurasian Order. That concept became known as a pan-region, taken from the American Monroe Doctrine, and the idea of national and continental self-sufficiency. That was a forward-looking refashioning of the drive for colonies, something that geopoliticians did not see as an economic necessity but more as a matter of prestige, putting pressure on older colonial powers. The fundamental motivating force would be not economic but cultural and spiritual. Haushofer was, what is called today, a proponent of \"Eurasianism\", advocating a policy of German–Russian hegemony and alliance to offset an Anglo-American power structure's potentially dominating influence in Europe.\n\nBeyond being an economic concept, pan-regions were a strategic concept as well. Haushofer acknowledges the strategic concept of the Heartland Theory put forward by the British geopolitician Halford Mackinder. If Germany could control Eastern Europe and subsequently Russian territory, it could control a strategic area to which hostile seapower could be denied. Allying with Italy and Japan would further augment German strategic control of Eurasia, with those states becoming the naval arms protecting Germany's insular position.\n\nEvidence points to a disconnect between the advocates of geopolitik and Hitler, although their practical tactical goals were nearly indistinguishable.\n\nRudolf Hess, Hitler's secretary who would assist in the writing of \"Mein Kampf\", was a close student of Haushofer's. While Hess and Hitler were imprisoned after the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Haushofer spent six hours visiting the two, bringing along a copy of Friedrich Ratzel's \"Political Geography\" and Clausewitz's \"On War\". After World War II, Haushofer would deny that he had taught Hitler, and claimed that the National Socialist Party perverted Hess's study of geopolitik. Hitler's biographers disagree somewhat on the extent of Haushofer's influence on Hitler: Ian Kershaw writes that \"[his] influence was probably greater than the Munich professor was later prepared to acknowledge,\" while Joachim C. Fest says that \"Hitler's version of [Haushofer's] ideas was distinctly his own.\" Haushofer himself viewed Hitler as a half-educated man who never correctly understood the geopolitik principles explained by Hess, and saw Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop as the principal distorter of geopolitik in Hitler's mind.\n\nAlthough Haushofer accompanied Hess on numerous propaganda missions, and participated in consultations between Nazis and Japanese leaders, he claimed that Hitler and the Nazis only seized upon half-developed ideas and catchwords. Furthermore, the Nazi party and government lacked any official organ that was receptive to geopolitik, leading to selective adoption and poor interpretation of Haushofer's theories. Ultimately, Hess and Konstantin von Neurath, Nazi Minister of Foreign Affairs, were the only officials Haushofer would admit had a proper understanding of geopolitik.\n\nFather Edmund A. Walsh, professor of geopolitics and dean at Georgetown University, who interviewed Haushofer after the allied victory in preparation for the Nuremberg trials, disagreed with Haushofer's assessment that geopolitik was terribly distorted by Hitler and the Nazis. He cites Hitler's speeches declaring that small states have no right to exist, and the Nazi use of Haushofer's maps, language and arguments. Even if distorted somewhat, Walsh felt that was enough to implicate Haushofer's geopolitik.\n\nHaushofer also denied assisting Hitler in writing \"Mein Kampf\", saying that he only knew of it once it was in print, and never read it. Walsh found that even if Haushofer did not directly assist Hitler, discernible new elements appeared in \"Mein Kampf\", as compared to previous speeches made by Hitler. Geopolitical ideas of lebensraum, space for depth of defense, appeals for natural frontiers, balancing land and seapower, and geographic analysis of military strategy entered Hitler's thought between his imprisonment and publishing of \"Mein Kampf\". Chapter XIV, on German policy in Eastern Europe, in particular displays the influence of the materials Haushofer brought Hitler and Hess while they were imprisoned.\n\nHaushofer was never a member of the Nazi Party, and did voice disagreements with the party, leading to his brief imprisonment. Haushofer came under suspicion because of his contacts with left wing socialist figures within the Nazi movement (led by Gregor Strasser) and his advocacy of essentially a German–Russian alliance. This Nazi left wing had some connections to the Communist Party of Germany and some of its leaders, especially those who were influenced by the National Bolshevist philosophy of a German–Russian revolutionary alliance, as advocated by Ernst Niekisch, Julius Evola, Ernst Jünger, Hielscher and other figures of the \"conservative revolution.\" He did profess loyalty to the Führer and make anti-Semitic remarks on occasion. However, his emphasis was always on space over race, believing in environmental rather than racial determinism. He refused to associate himself with anti-Semitism as a policy, especially because his wife was half-Jewish. Haushofer admits that after 1933 much of what he wrote was distorted under duress: his wife had to be protected by Hess's influence (who managed to have her awarded 'honorary German' status); his son was implicated in the July 20 plot to assassinate Hitler and was executed by the Gestapo; he himself was imprisoned in Dachau concentration camp for eight months; and his son and grandson were imprisoned for two-and-a-half months.\n\nThe idea of contact between Haushofer and the Nazi establishment has been stressed by several authors. These authors have expanded Haushofer's contact with Hitler to a close collaboration while Hitler was writing \"Mein Kampf\" and made him one of the 'future Chancellor's many mentors'. Haushofer may have been a short-term student of Gurdjieff, that he had studied Zen Buddhism, and that he had been initiated at the hands of Tibetan lamas, although these notions are debated.\n\nThe influence of Haushofer on Nazi ideology is dramatized in the 1943 short documentary film, \"Plan for Destruction\", which was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

It comprises three major traditions, Saivism,Vaishnavism and Shaktism, whose followers considered Shiva, Vishnu and Shakti (also called as Devi) to be the supreme deity respectively. Most of the other deities were either related to them or different forms (incarnations) of these deities. Hinduism has been called the \"oldest religion\" in the world, and many practitioners refer to Hinduism as \"the eternal law\". (\"\"). Given below is a list of the chief Hindu deities followed by a list of Hindu deities (including demi-gods).\nSmartism, an older tradition and later reestablished by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya, invites the worship of more than one god including Shiva like that, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti and \nGanesha (the elephant god) among other gods and goddesses. It is not as overtly sectarian as either Vashnavism or Saivism and is based on the recognition that Brahman (God) is the highest principle in the universe and pervades all of existence.\n\nThe Hindu trinity consists of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer. Their feminine counterparts are Saraswati, the wife of Brahma, Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, and Parvati the wife of Shiva. The followers of the last two form two major sects. \n\nCults of goddess worship are ancient in India. In the Rigveda, the most prominent goddess is Ushas, the goddess of dawn. In modern Hinduism, goddesses are widely revered. Shaktism is one of the major sects of Hinduism. Followers of Shaktism believe that the goddess (Devi) is the power (Shakti) that underlies the female principle, and that Devi is the supreme being, one and the same with Para Brahman. Devi is believed to manifest in peaceful forms, such as Parvati the consort of Shiva and Lakshmi the consort of Vishnu, and also in fierce forms, such as Kali and Durga. In Shaktism, Adi Parashakti is regarded as Ultimate Godhead or Para Brahman. She is formless i.e. Nirguna in reality, but may take many forms i.e. Saguna. Durga and Lalita Tripurasundari are regarded as the Supreme goddess in the Kalikula and Srikula systems respectively. Shaktism is closely related with Tantric Hinduism, which teaches rituals and practices for purification of the mind and body. Some different forms of Shakti (Devi) the Mother Goddess:\n\nShaivism is one of the major Hindu sects. Adherents of Shaivism believe that the god Shiva is the supreme being. Shiva is the destroyer god among the Trimurti, and so is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Shaivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals. Some alternative forms of Shiva:\n\nAs compared to other Hindu deities,Brahma is considered to be less significant yet worshipped by some North Indian Brahmins. As Brahma worships to Lord Shiva so following to him they also like Shaiva worships to Shiva. It is said that Brahma was punished by Lord Shiva in the form of Bhairavnath that he would not be worshipped by any being on the earth and he would not have temples on earth. According to Hindu mythology,Brahma is considered to be the creator of the entire cosmos. Some alternative forms of Brahma are:\n\nVaishnavism is the sect within Hinduism that worships Vishnu, the preserver god of the Hindu \"Trimurti\" ('three images', the Trinity), and his ten incarnations. It is a devotional sect, and followers worship many deities, including Rama and Krishna of the 2 epics, both considered as incarnations of Vishnu. The adherents of this sect are generally non-ascetic, monastic and devoted to meditative practice and ecstatic chanting. Some alternate names of Vishnu the Preserver:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Hindu legends and epics,it is said that the eighth incarnation of Vishnu was Balarama,the elder brother of Lord Krishna who took birth ninth avatar.But the people in the medieval and modern era say that Buddha is the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu and the ninth WaS Krishna.Krishna is often associated with His beloved goddess Radha, and hence also known as Radha Krishna. Krishna was also manifested as Lord Jagannatha. People of Eastern India consider Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to be his re-incarnation. Krishna is the chief deity of the ISKCON HarKrishna and other sects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rigveda speaks of Thirty-three gods called the Tridasha ('Three times ten'? or three times eleven?). They consists of the 12 Adityas, the 8 Vasus, the 11 Rudras and the 2 Ashvins. Indra also called Śakra, lord of the gods, is the first of the 33 followed by Agni. Some of these brother gods were invoked in pairs such as Indra-Agni, Mitra-Varuna and Soma-Rudra.\n\n\nThe Ramayana tells they are 11 of the 33 children of the sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, along with the 12 Adityas, 8 Vasus and 2 Ashvins, constituting the Thirty-three gods.[2] The Vamana Purana describes the Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi.[3] The Matsya Purana notes that Surabhi – the mother of all cows and the \"cow of plenty\" – was the consort of Brahma and their union produced the eleven Rudras. Here they are named Nirriti, Shambhu, Aparajita Mrigavyadha, Kapardi, Dahana, Khara, Ahirabradhya, Kapali, Pingala and Senani – the foremost.[4] Brahma allotted to the Rudras the eleven positions of the heart and the five sensory organs, the five organs of action and the mind.[2][3] \n\nAssistants of Indra and of Vishnu\n\nThe Ashvins (also called the Nāsatyas) were twin gods. Nasatya is also the name of one twin, while the other is called Dasra.\n\nMost of the Hindu temples are dedicated to Siva, Vishnu (including his incarnations Krishna and Rama), Brahma, Shakti (the mother goddess, hence including the forms of Durga and Kali and the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati), Ganesh and Hanuman. The Hindu scriptures claimed that there were 33 KOTI or 33 category gods, \"koti\" meaning in Sanskrit \"crore\" (33 कोटि = 10 prakar, tarah ). Crore also translates to 10,000,000 or 10 million.\n\nOne theory is that the number 330 million (33 crore) gods refers to the total count of the then known population of all the humans and living beings that ever walked on this planet including the 84 lakh (8.4 million) jeeva rasi (living species) signifying that god exists in every living being. This is in line with the belief of Indians to respect all living beings as gods. It is estimated that the world population was around this number about a 1000 years ago when this number would have originated. It also explains the many gods (e.g. the grama devatas or village gods who were clearly living persons at one time and many of the other gods who were believed to have been persons, e.g. Rama and Krishna)\n\nAnother theory is that the number might be figurative but there are several names and forms for the multitude of gods.

{"id": "42248208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42248208", "title": "Nuo folk religion", "text": "Nuo folk religion\n\nNuo folk religion, or extendedly Chinese popular exorcistic religion, is a variant of Chinese folk religion with its own system of temples, rituals, orders of priests and gods, which is interethnic and practiced across central and southern China but is also intimately connected to the Tujia people. It arose as an exorcistic religious movement, which is the original meaning of \"nuó\" (), and it spread even outside the boundaries of China exporting such practices in Japan and Korea. It has strong influences from Taoism.\n\nOne of the most distinguishing characters of Nuo folk religion is its iconographic style, which represents the gods as wooden masks or heads. This is related to its own mythology, which traces the origin of Nuo to the two very first humans, who were unjustly killed by beheading and are since then worshipped as responsive divine ancestors. Nuo rituals began as efficacious methods to worship them, Lord Nuo and Lady Nuo. Since the 1980s Nuo folk religion has undergone a revitalisation in China, and today is a folk religion endorsed by the central government. Nuo priests are classified as 巫 \"wu\" (shamans) and their historical precursors were the 方相氏 \"fangxiangshi\" (\"masters who assist the (astral) square\").\n\nNuo cosmology is based on a yin and yang theory, clearly represented in mythology, otherwise explainable as a world in which potentiality and actuality, supernature and nature, form a complementary and dialectical duality which is the order of the universe. Man is an active participant within this order, interplaying with the world of divinity in a creative manner. Nuo mythology also tells of a highest goddess,\"Tiānxiān\" (天仙 \"Heavenly Immortal\"), who is directly involved since the origin of humanity in triggering this dialogue between the spiritual and the material. The primary form of dialogue is the worship of ancestors, and this is reflected in the patriarchal structure of Tujia society.\n\nThe highest deities in the Nuo pantheon are Lord Nuo (傩公 \"Nuógōng\") and Lady Nuo (\"Nuópó\" 傩婆), the two ancestors of humanity, according to mythology, whose sacrifice gave origin to Nuo practices. When a Nuo ceremony is performed, the ancestral couple is represented by carved wooden statues erected in front of the temple, while all lesser gods are placed behind them. In simpler rituals, they are seen as embodiments of all the other gods.\n\nGenerally, right below the ancestral couple of Nuogong and Nuopo come the Three Pure Ones (三清 \"Sānqīng\"). These are the main trinity of Taoist theology, and were introduced among the Tujia by Han Chinese who moved to their areas. Apart from the trinity and some elaborate ritual styles, Nuo folk religion has not acquired the philosophical contents of Taoism, as the purpose of Nuo practices is mainly to \"nourish\" Nuo gods. Directly below the Three Pure Ones there is the Jade Deity (玉帝 \"Yùdì\"), another deity from Taoist theology, who is invoked by Nuo priests by blowing into a peculiar ritual instrument, an ox horn. The Jade Deity is conceived as the commander of all lesser gods, so in order to communicate with them it is necessary to call upon him first.\n\nBelow the Jade Deity come the Deities of the Three Worlds (三皇 \"Sānhuáng\") and then the Deities of the Five Directions (五方帝 \"Wǔfāngdì\"), both groups common to pre-Taoist Chinese religion. The triplet is formed by the patron of heaven (天皇 \"Tiānhuáng\", who is Fuxi), the patron of earth (地皇 \"Dehuáng\", who is Nuwa) and the patron of humanity (人皇 \"Rénhuáng\", who is Shennong).\n\nThe other group is formed by the Yellow Deity of the centre of the cosmos, the Green or Blue Deity of the east, the Red Deity of the south, the White Deity of the east, and the Black Deity of the north. As in Chinese religion they have a cosmological significance corresponding to various aspects of nature and are believed to have been incarnated in historical personages.\n\nBelow the Three Patrons and the Five Deities there is the Enthroned Deity, who is considered to be incarnated in the present time. The most prominent contemporary government figure of China is believed to be the Enthroned God. In Nuo shrines there is often a tablet with the inscription \"a long life to the god on the throne\".\n\nEvery order of Nuo priests has its own founders, who are honoured at dedicated altars (师坛 \"shītán\", \"order's altar\"). The ancestors of the order are invoked during every ritual performance and in the divine hierarchy they come right below the Enthroned Deity. The three earliest Nuo ritualists common to nearly all the orders are Yan Sanlang, Liu Wulang and Huang Wanlang.\n\nThere are also a variety of gods of nature and of human affairs, such as the Door Gods, the Well God, the Hearth God, the Land God and the Wealth God, which are those with an immediate relationship with people despite their lower rank in the Nuo pantheon.\n\nThe setting of Nuo activities are distinct temples (傩庙 \"nuómiào\", \"exorcism's temple\") and private altars (傩坛 \"nuótán\"). The main task of Nuo practices is to strengthen the power of gods as much as possible so that they can exorcise malevolent beings.\n\nNuo ceremonies (傩仪 \"nuó yí\") can involve dance performance (傩舞 \"nuó wǔ\"), songs (傩歌 \"nuó gē\"), sacrifices (傩祭 \"nuó jì\") and the Nuo opera ( \"\").\n\nDuring the Heian period (794-1185), the Japanese adopted into Shinto many Tang dynasty (618-907) Chinese customs, including the \"fangxiangshi\" (the precursor of Nuo priests) known in Japanese as \"hōsōshi\" 方相氏 who would lead a funeral procession and exorcise demons from a burial mound. This practice was merged with traditional Japanese exorcistic rites such as the Shinto \"ofuda\" (\"talisman with the name of a \"kami\"\").\n\nThe earliest record was the (c. 797) \"Shoku Nihongi\" history, which mentions a \"hōsōshi\" exorcist officiating at the burial ceremonies for Emperor Shōmu (756), Emperor Kōnin (781), and Emperor Kanmu (806).\n\nThe Kyōgen actor Nomura Mannojō noted that Chinese \"nuo\" 儺 practices were the 8th-century source for the Japanese \"tsuina\" 追儺 or \"setsubun\" (\"ritual to exorcise evil spirits on the last day of winter\"), and proposed that supernatural power links the Chinese \"nuo\" performer \"fangxiangshi\" and the Japanese \"gigaku\" masked character \"Chidō\" 治道 (\"govern the way\") who leads a ceremony. In Japanese tradition and art, the \"hōsōshi\" wears a four-eyed mask rather than the original four-eyed bearskin.\n\n\n"}

The basis of the dispute is over the identity of the Guardian, a term referring to the appointed head of the religion, an executive hereditary office held by Shoghi Effendi from 1921 to 1957.\n\nOther than on the matter of leadership and organization, there are few differences between the orthodox and mainstream Bahá'ís in matters of doctrine. As a group who believe that Mason Remey was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, they are considered heretical Covenant-breakers by the majority of Bahá'ís who follow the leadership of the Universal House of Justice. \n\nMembership data of the Orthodox Bahá'ís is scarce. One source estimated them at no more than 100 members as of 1988. Memorandums from an Illinois court case in 2007 state their membership in the United States at 40. Websites claiming to represent the Orthodox community indicate followers in the United States and India. Joel Marangella died in San Diego, California on Sept 1, 2013.\n\nFollowing the unexpected death of the Bahá'í Faith's first Guardian Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the 27 living Hands of the Cause, having the responsibility to acknowledge any appointment of a successor, gathered and decided that he had died \"without having appointed his successor,\" and that the Universal House of Justice would decide on the situation after its first election. Charles Mason Remey, one of the Hands, declared himself the successor to Shoghi Effendi in 1960. His claim was rejected by the 26 remaining Hands, on the basis that he was not a descendant of Bahá'u'lláh, nor was he appointed to the position by Shoghi Effendi. Remey based his claim on his being the president of the International Bahá'í Council appointed by Shoghi Effendi in 1951. The result was that Remey was unanimously expelled from the Bahá'í community by the Hands of the Cause.\n\nIn 1962 Remey asked his supporters in the United States to organize themselves and elect a \"National Spiritual Assembly Under the Hereditary Guardianship\" (NSAUHG), first elected in 1963. The Assembly of 9 members was incorporated in New Mexico in 1964.\n\nIn 1964 the NSAUHG filed a lawsuit against the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the Bahá'ís of the United States to receive the legal title to the Bahá'í House of Worship in Illinois, and all other property owned by the NSA. The NSA counter-sued, and in August 1966 Remey instructed the NSAUHG to withdraw from any action in the matter \"regardless of the consequences.\" Later that year, Remey asked the NSAUHG to dissolve, as well as the International Bahá'í Council that he had appointed with Joel Marangella as president, residing in France. Marangella previously served on the National Spiritual Assembly of France in 1961, and was declared a Covenant-breaker when he accepted Mason Remey as the next Guardian.\n\nOver the years following 1966 the followers of Mason Remey were not organized; with some of his followers concluding that Remey was suffering from dementia, until several of the individuals involved began forming their own groups based on different understandings of succession.\n\nIn 1962 Remey gave Marangella a sealed envelope, with instructions to open it when the time was right. In 1965 Mason Remey called for the International Bahá'í Council, of which Marangella was president, to become active. Marangella then opened the sealed letter, which was a hand-written note by Remey appointing Marangella as his successor. Marangella looks upon that time as the time of his official appointment. Remey then changed his mind, deactivated the International Bahá'í Council in 1966, and in 1969 Marangella announced that he was the third Guardian. All of the members of the 1966 NSAUHG accepted Marangella's claim. \n\nIn 1970 Marangella appointed members to a \"National Bureau of the Orthodox Bahá'ís in New York\", which two years later was moved to New Mexico, and subsequently changed its name to \"Mother Bahá'í Council of the United States\" (1978) and \"Provisional National Bahá'í Council\" (2000), with all members appointed by Joel Marangella.. Marangella died in San Diego, CA on Sept 1, 2013.\n\nThe third Guardian of the Baha'i Faith Joel Bray Marangella in his Proclamation of 22 September 2006 appointed a Persian Nosrat'u'llah Bahremand the eldest son of Hassan Bahremand, a prominent member of the Orthodox Baha'i Faith as the Fourth Guardian of Orthodox Baha'i Faith. \n\n"}
{"id": "33576199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33576199", "title": "Perun", "text": "Perun\n\nIn Slavic mythology, Perun (Cyrillic: Перун) is the highest god of the pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning. His other attributes were fire, mountains, wind, the oak, iris, eagle, firmament (in Indo-European languages, this was joined with the notion of the \"sky of stone\"), horses and carts, weapons (hammer, axe (Axe of Perun), and arrow), and war. He was first associated with weapons made of stone and later with those of metal.\n\nOf all historic records describing Slavic gods, those mentioning Perun are the most numerous. As early as the 6th century, he was mentioned in De Bello Gothico, a historical source written by the Eastern Roman historian Procopius. A short note describing beliefs of a certain South Slavic tribe states they \"acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.\" While the name of the god is not mentioned here explicitly, 20th century research has established beyond doubt that the god of thunder and lightning in Slavic mythology is Perun. To this day the word \"perun\" in a number of Slavic languages means \"thunder,\" or \"lightning bolt\".\n\nThe Primary Chronicle relates that in the year 6415 (907 AD) prince Oleg (Scandin.: Olaf) made a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire and by taking his men to the shrines and swearing by their weapons and by their god Perun, and by Volos, the god of cattle, they confirmed the treaty. We find the same form of confirmation of a peace treaty by prince Igor in 945. In 980, when prince Vladimir the Great came to the throne of Kiev, he erected statues of five pagan gods in front of his palace which he soon thereafter discarded after his Christianization in 988. Perun was chief among these, represented with a silver head and a golden moustache. Vladimir's uncle Dobrinja also had a shrine of Perun established in his city of Novgorod. After the Christianization of Kievan Rus, this place became a monastery, which, quite remarkably, continued to bear the name of Perun.\n\nPerun is not mentioned directly in any of the records of Western Slavic traditional religion, but a reference to him is perhaps made in a short note in Helmold's Chronica Slavorum, written in the latter half of the 12th century, which states (quite similarly to Procopius some six centuries earlier) that Slavic tribes, even though they worship many various gods, all agree there is a supreme god in heaven which rules over all other on earth. This could be a reference to Perun, but since he is not named, nor any of his chief attributes (thunder or lightning) mentioned, we cannot be certain.\n\nMoreover, the name of Perun is also commonly found in Southern Slavic toponymy. The Bulgarian and Macedonian people believe that the name of the Bulgarian mountain Pirin, one of the highest mountains of the Balkan Peninsula, was named after Perun. There are also places called: Perun (the famous mountain in Bosnia Herzegovina, Vareš), Perunac, Perunovac, Perunika, Perunička Glava, Peruni Vrh, Perunja Ves, Peruna Dubrava, Perunuša, Perušice, Perudina and Perutovac. The word \"Pero\" means feather and the names of mountains and cities could refer to poultry. \nThese names today mostly represent mountain tops, but in medieval times, large oaks, sacred groves and even entire villages or citadels were named Perun. Among South Slavs, a mountain plant \"Iris germanica\" is known in folklore as \"perunika\" (\"Perun's plant\") and sometimes also as \"bogisha\", (\"god's plant\"), and was believed to grow from ground that had been struck by lightning. Also the Serbian surname Peruničić and the Macedonian Перуновски (Perunovski) are derived from Perun.\n\nThe Bulgarian people believe that the name of city Pernik is thought to have originated from that of Slavic god Perun with the Slavic placename suffix –nik (or –ik) added, and was first mentioned in the 9th century. The medieval town was a key Bulgarian stronghold during Bulgarian tsar Samuil's wars against the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century, when it was governed by the local noble Krakra of Pernik, withstanding Byzantine sieges a number of times.\n\nSome places in Central Europe possibly named after Perun are the villages of Parndorf (formerly known as Perun) and Pernitz in the Parndorf Plain, Perná in Moravia, Beroun in Bohemia, and Pernek in Slovakia.\n\nPerun is strongly correlated with the near-identical \"Perkūnas\"/\"Pērkons\" from Baltic mythology, suggesting either a common derivative of the Proto-Indo European thunder god (whose original name has been reconstructed as Perkwunos), or that one of these cultures borrowed the deity from the other. The root \"*perkwu\" originally probably meant \"oak\", but in Proto-Slavic this evolved into \"per-\" meaning \"to strike, to slay\".\nThe Lithuanian word \"Perkūnas\" has two meanings: \"thunder\" and the name of the god of thunder and lightning.\n\nArtifacts, traditions and toponyms show the presence of the cult of Perun among all Slavic, Baltic and Ugro-Finnic peoples. Perun was also related to an archaic form of astronomy – the Pole star was called Perun's eye and countless Slavic and Hungarian astronomers continued this tradition – most known ones are Nicolaus Copernicus, and Franz Xaver von Zach.\n\nIn Slavic mythology, much like in Norse and Baltic mythologies, the world was represented by a sacred tree, usually an oak, whose branches and trunk represented the living world of heavens and mortals, whilst its roots represented the underworld, i.e. the realm of the dead. Perun was the ruler of the living world, sky and earth, and was often symbolised by an eagle sitting on the top of the tallest branch of the sacred tree, from which he kept watch over the entire world. Deep down in the roots of the tree was the place of his opponent, symbolised by a serpent or a dragon: this was Veles, watery god of the underworld, who continually provoked Perun by creeping up from the wet below up into the high and dry domain of Perun, stealing his cattle, children, or wife. Perun pursued Veles around the earth, attacking him with his lightning bolts from the sky. Veles fled from him by transforming himself into various animals, or hiding behind trees, houses, or people; wherever a lightning bolt struck, it was believed that this was because Veles hid from Perun under or behind that particular place. In the end, Perun managed to kill Veles, or to chase him back down into his watery underworld. The supreme god thus reestablished order in the world, which had been disrupted by his chaotic enemy. He then returned to the top of the World tree and proudly informed his opponent down in the roots \"Well, there is your place, remain there!\" (Ну, там твое место, там сабе будь!). This line came from a Belarusian folk tale. To the Slavs, the mythological symbolism of a supreme heavenly god who battles with his underworldly enemy through storms and thunder was extremely significant, and from Perun and Veles, this idea of cosmic battle was passed onto God and the Devil following Christianization.\n\nWhile the exact pantheon characterization differed between the various Slavic tribes, Perun is generally believed to have been considered as the supreme god by the majority, or perhaps by nearly all Slavs, at least towards the end of Slavic paganism. The earliest supreme god was probably Rod; it is unclear precisely how and why his worship as the head of the pantheon evolved into the worship of Perun. Another candidate for supreme deity among at least some Slavs is Svarog.\n\nIn the classification scheme of Georges Dumézil, Perun was the god of the second function (physical and military power), a god of war, and as such, he was armed with several fantastic weapons. Perun's lightning bolts were believed to be stones and stone arrows. According to folk beliefs, fulgurites, belemnites, and sometimes even the remains of prehistoric stone tools found in the ground are remains of these weapons. Various Slavic countries also call these deposits \"Perun's stones\", \"thunderbolt stones\", \"thunderbolt wedges\" and \"Perun's arrow\"; other unrelated names for these include \"devil's finger\", \"God's finger\", and \"Mother of God finger\", and in Lithuania, \"Perkun's finger\" (Belemnitida). These thunderbolt stones were sometimes said to be transferred back to the sky by the wind after being under earth for a period of seven years. The weapons of Perun protected against bad luck, evil magic, disease, and – naturally enough – lightning itself.\n\nPerun also had another type of weapon in his arsenal, as destructive as his firestone arrows, but even more unusual: mythical golden apples. While this may not seem to be much of a weapon, in many Slavic folk accounts, the golden apple appears as a talisman of ultimate destruction. An example from a Serbian folk song from Montenegro with strong mythical elements relates:\n\n\"…Те извади три јабуке златне\" \n\"И баци их небу у висине...\" \n\"…Три муње од неба пукоше\" \n\"Једна гађа два дјевера млада,\" \n\"Друга гађа пашу на дорину,\" \n\"Трећа гађа свата шест стотина,\" \n\"Не утече ока за свједока,\" \n\"Ни да каже, како погибоше.\"\n\n\"…He grabbed three golden apples \nAnd threw them high into the sky... \n…Three lightning bolts burst from the sky, \nThe first struck at two young grooms, \nThe second struck a horse in a stall, \nThe third struck six hundred wedding guests, \nNot an eyewitness left \nNot even to say how they died.\"\n\nIt is conjectured that the mythical golden apples of Perun were symbols of a rare but notorious form of atmospheric discharge, ball lightning. The same is probably true for the thunder marks of East Slavic folklore, of which two examples are shown above.\n\nRemains of an ancient shrine to Perun discovered in Peryn consisted of a wide circular platform centred around a statue, encircled by a trench with eight apses, which contained sacrificial altars and possibly additional statues. The overall plan of the shrine shows clear symbolism of the number nine. This is sometimes interpreted that Perun, in fact, had nine sons (or eight sons, with himself, the father, being the ninth Perun). It should also be noted that in some Slavic folk songs, nine unnamed brothers are mentioned.\n\nSimilarly to Perkūnas of Baltic mythology, Perun was considered to have multiple aspects. In one Lithuanian song, it is said there are in fact nine versions of Perkūnas. From comparison to the Baltic mythology, and also from additional sources in Slavic folklore, it can also be shown that Perun was married to the Sun. He, however, shared his wife with his enemy Veles, as each night the Sun was thought of as diving behind the horizon and into the underworld, the realm of the dead over which Veles ruled.\n\nLike many other Indo-European thunder gods, Perun's vegetative hypostasis was the oak, especially a particularly distinctive or prominent one. In Southern Slavic traditions, marked oaks stood on country borders; communities at these positions were visited during village holidays in the late spring and during the summer. Shrines of Perun were located either on top of mountains or hills, or in sacred groves underneath ancient oaks. These were a general place of worship and holding of sacrifices (with a bull, an ox, a ram, and eggs).\n\nIn addition to the tree association, Perun had a day association (Thursday) as well as the material association (tin).\n\nWith the arrival of Christianity, the old gods fared poorly amongst the Slavs. Grand prince Vladimir the Great, who had once been a very vocal and lavish patron of Perun, converted to Orthodox Christianity. In 998 he, his family and the people of the Kievan Rus' were collectively baptized. He ordered that the statues of Perun which he himself had erected formerly, be dethroned, torn down in with great dishonor and dragged through the streets as they were beaten with sticks. The idols were then cast into rivers and not permitted to land on the shore. Three of Vladimir's sons are also recognized as saints. Modern scholarship on the syncretism (or dvoeverie) of the Christian and pagan gods seems to be more of an academic construct.\n\n\n\n"}

For two millennia, this was organized based on a Confucian understanding of religion and politics, often discussed in terms of Confucian political philosophy. At various points throughout its history, Chinese Buddhism presented an alternative to the political import of Confucianism. However, since the mid-twentieth century, communist understandings of religion have dominated the discourse.\n\nFor Christianity, this relationship can be seen from the religion's earliest encounters in the country during the imperial period, with the Church of the East's interaction with the Emperor Taizong and Jesuit missionaries in the Ming court. But it has developed the most in the 20th and 21st centuries after the establishments of the Republic of China and People's Republic of China. This is particularly true through the establishment of the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, the rise of underground and house churches, and interactions with the secular academy.\n\nFor over two millennia, from the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) until the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), the dominant ideology that was upheld as state orthodoxy was Confucianism. During much of this time, all other religions needed to be registered and administered under the Confucian political system. This would shape the history of the relationship between Christianity and politics in China could be traced to Tang Dynasty (618–907), when scholars believe that Christianity first came to China. Emperor Taizong and his successors of adopted the policy of religious tolerance. They allowed the mission of Church of the East monks and invited them to translate scriptures for the empire. In 845, during the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, the Church of the East was misunderstood as a sect of Buddhism and was banned by Emperor Wuzong. In Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), several Mongol tribes converted to Christianity through the Church of the East. During this time, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church also sent envoys to the Mongol Empire capital Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing).\n\nIn Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), Jesuits initiated mission in China. Matteo Ricci would be the most well-known among these missionaries. Jesuits exerted considerable influence at court via the policy of accommodation and converted several senior officials, such as Xu Guangqi. In Qing dynasty (1636–1912), Catholic missionaries still played important roles at court as consultants of emperors. In the 18th century, the Chinese Rites controversy had raised tension between the Vatican and Qing dynasty's Emperors. Emperor Yongzheng was formally against Christian converts among Manchu people and banned the mission again.\n\nAfter the First Opium War (1839–1842), with the aid of several unequal treaties, Christian missionaries were allowed to evangelize in China and continue to import the Western civilization to China. Due to an impression that missionaries were allies with foreign colonial governments, many Chinese became hostile to Christianity. This further influenced the relationship between Christianity and politics. Many anti-missionary riots (\"Jiao'an\"), the Boxer Rebellion, and the anti-Christian movement can be considered as the consequences of such relationship.\n\nThe 20th century witnessed the emergence of new Chinese political thinkers. The May Fourth movement emphasized a climate of strong political engagement, under the mantra of \"Mr. Science\" and \"Mr. Democracy,\" and the growing ferment around the national salvation movement.\n\nKang Youwei advocated the idea of a Confucian church as the state religion of China. Taixu would seek to reform Chinese Buddhism, to contribute to the building of Chinese society and politics. Christian leaders like Y. T. Wu, in the face of the anti-Christian movement, appealed to revolutionary theory and constructed a Chinese Christian theology.\n\nAfter 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Protestant leaders encountered new challenges – the new regime of the communist government is based on atheistic ideology of Marxism. They had to decide how to deal with the relationship with the atheistic government. There were different attitudes and theologies among Chinese Christians. Some of them, such as Y. T. Wu, who were willing to support the new government, helped to pen the Christian Manifesto and initiated the Three-Self movement (TSPM) in 1950s; they reconstructed theology in terms of cooperation. Others, such as Wang Mingdao, were unwilling to endorse the radical TSPM and refused to support the new government, are regarded as the forerunners of the present-day house church.\n\nIn the 1950s Denunciation Campaigns, some Christian leaders, such as Wang Mingdao, Watchman Nee, from the opposing camp were arrested and sentenced in the name of counter-revolutionaries. During the ten years of Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), all the religious activities were banned and many Christians met and worshiped in the Christians' houses.\n\nIn 1980s, religious activities recovered and churches gradually opened. However, Christians who were unwilling to joined the TSPM churches and chose to gather in unregistered house churches which gather in personal houses or apartments. K. H. Ting and Wang Weifan were leaders and representatives of the TSPM church. Wang Mingdao and Wang Yi would be representatives of the house church; the latter Wang is the pastor in the urban church in Chengdu which is not a traditional house church, but who still claims the link to the house church.\n\nIn the 1950s, after Zhou Enlai saw the possibilities in Protestantism with the TSPM, a similar approach was taken with Catholicism leading to the formation in 1957 of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), severing ties with the Vatican. Those who chose not to affiliate with the CPCA and remain loyal to the Pope and the Vatican are often considered part of the underground church.\n\nIgnatius Kung Pin-Mei, the Catholic bishop of Shanghai, opposed the formation of the CPCA and, along with several hundred bishops and church leaders, was arrested on 8 September 1955. He viewed the CPCA as being schismatic and, therefore, not in union with the universal Roman Catholic Church. Kung criticized China's lack of religious freedom and reckoned that Chinese Catholics \"do not have the freedom to worship.\" When he was interviewed by the \"Soul Magazine\" in 1993, Kung expressed his sympathy for the underground Catholics and Bishops under the Communist government and claimed that, \"The government should understand from history that every time the Church was persecuted, the Church has always survived and grown out of the persecution.\"\n\nAnother significant figure was Aloysius Jin Luxian, who was arrested alongside Kung on 8 September 1955. However, after being released from prison in 1982, he took several leadership roles within the CPCA, including becoming founding rector of the Sheshan Seminary and bishop of Shanghai in 1988, without Vatican approval.\n\nDespite the Anti-Confucius developments of the Cultural Revolution, since the 1980s, there has been a restored interest in Confucianism as offering a renewed political ideology for mainland China. Part of this has included the introduction of New Confucianism from Taiwan and North America. Some have advocated for the building of new Confucian churches in the country. Others, such as Jiang Qing have advocated for a new form of constitutional Confucianism.\n\nSince the late 1980s there has been a growing interest in Christianity among academics in China's secular universities. Often described as Cultural Christians, many of whom are not self-identified Christians, these scholars have been drawn to Christianity as a source for the modernization of China. One of the key figures of this movement, Liu Xiaofeng at Renmin University of China, in the 2000s began to draw on the political theology of Carl Schmitt for engaging the Chinese political arena. Others, such as Xie Zhibin from Tongji University in Shanghai, has attempted to offer a public theological engagement based on the theology of Max Stackhouse. Most recently, Zhuo Xinping of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has advocated for the sinicization or Chinization () of Christianity both politically and culturally.\n\n\"The Christian Manifesto\" was published in July 1950 and its original title was \"Direction of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China.\" The founding group of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, including Y. T. Wu, drafted the document in consultation with Premier Zhou Enlai. During the 1950s, 400,000 Protestant Christians publicly endorsed and signed this document.\n\nIn August 2015 Wang Yi posted a document titled \"Reaffirming Our Stance on the House Churches: 95 Theses\" in an attempt to reaffirm the Chinese house church's position in the relationship between government and society. Echoing Martin Luther's 95 theses, these Chinese 95 theses demonstrate his opinion of the church-state relationship from the perspective of the house church.\n"}

{"id": "232299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232299", "title": "Society of Saint Pius X", "text": "Society of Saint Pius X\n\nThe Society of Saint Pius X (; also known as the SSPX or the FSSPX) is an international priestly fraternity founded in 1970 by Marcel Lefebvre, the French titular archbishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Synnada in Phrygia.\n\nThe Society is known for rejecting many of the ecclesiastical reforms both influenced or institutionalized by the Second Vatican Council, and maintaining the Tridentine Mass among its followers. The present superior general of the Society is Father Davide Pagliarani, succeeding Bishop Bernard Fellay.\n\nTensions between the society and the Holy See reached their height in 1988, when Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated four bishops without the Apostolic Mandate and against a personal warning by Pope John Paul II, known as the \"Écône consecrations, resulting in Rome issuing a declaration of excommunication against the bishops who consecrated or were consecrated. Though the priestly fraternity denied that the bishops incurred any penalty, claiming canon law in their defense, the declared excommunication of the surviving bishops was at their request removed in January 2009 with a hope expressed that all members of the society would quickly return to full communion.\n\nIn recent years, the Society has seen a growing recognition of its sacramental and pastoral activities by the Holy See. The Holy See extended, on 20 November 2016, permanent canonical recognition to confessions heard by Society priests (\"Misericordia et Misera, 12\") and later, on 4 April 2017, also allowed local ordinaries to grant delegation to priests of the Society for officially witnessing marriages. The significance of these recognitions is that, unique among the sacraments of the Catholic Church, both confession and marriage require canonical jurisdiction for their validity (it was a long-standing contention by the Society's critics that confessions could not be heard or marriages witnessed by a Society priest, due to defect-of-form). In addition, the Vatican named Bishop Fellay judge in a canonical trial against one of the Society's priests.\n\nLike the Traditionalist Catholicism in general, the SSPX was born out of opposition to changes in the Catholic Church that followed the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). The founder and central figure of the society was the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had served the Catholic Church as Apostolic Delegate for French-speaking Africa, Archbishop of Dakar, and Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, a missionary order of priests.\n\nIn May 1970, shortly after his retirement as Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, Lefebvre was approached by eleven members of the Pontifical French Seminary in Rome who had been criticized for their adherence to the traditional doctrines of the Catholic Church. They sought Lefebvre's advice on a conservative seminary where they could complete their studies. He directed them to the still conservative University of Fribourg, in Switzerland. However, soon the University had become as liberal as anywhere else.\n\nIn late 1970, at age 65, urged by the abbot of Hauterive Abbey and the Dominican theologian Father Marie-Dominique Philippe to teach the seminarians personally, Lefebvre, feeling too old to undertake such a large project, told them he would visit François Charrière, Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, with a request to set up a religious society. He told them, if he said to go through with it, he would see in it a sign of divine providence. Charrière granted Lefebvre's request and, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, he established the Society of St. Pius X as a \"pia unio\" (Latin, for \"pious, or holy, union\") on a provisional (\"ad experimentum\") basis for six years. \"Pia unio\" status was the first stage through which a Catholic organisation passed prior to gaining official recognition as a religious institute or society of apostolic life. (Since 1983, the term \"association of the faithful\" has replaced \"pia unio\".) The Society of Saint Pius X was formally founded, adhering to all canonical norms, and receiving the episcopal blessing and encouragement of the local ordinary. Some Swiss laymen offered the International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône to the newly-formed group, and in 1971 the first 24 candidates entered, followed by a further 32 in October 1972.\n\nNormally, after a suitable period of experience and consultation with the Holy See, a bishop would raise a \"pia unio\" to official status at diocesan level. Lefebvre attempted to bypass this stage, and contacted three different Vatican departments in order to secure early recognition for his society. He succeeded in obtaining a letter of encouragement from Cardinal John Wright, prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, but there was no approval from the Vatican congregation responsible for raising an association to the level desired by Lefebvre. Cardinal Wright's letter, dated 18 February 1971, said with regard to the field of competence of Cardinal Wright's own Congregation, that the association \"will be able to contribute much to accomplishing the plan drawn up by this Congregation for worldwide sharing of clergy\". Cardinal Wright was still recommending prospective seminarians to apply to Écône as late as 1973.\n\nThe establishment of the SSPX was unwelcome to a number of churchmen, most notably to the French bishops, whose theological outlook was quite different from that of Lefebvre and who had important connections with the Vatican Cardinal Secretary of State, Jean-Marie Villot. Much of the tension between Lefebvre and his critics must be seen in the context of long-term theological, cultural and political divisions between opposing elements of French society. According to Michael Davies, a defender of Lefebvre, at the meeting of the French episcopal conference at Lourdes in 1972, the seminary at Écône acquired the nickname \"le séminaire sauvage\" – the \"wildcat seminary\", and by November 1974 the French episcopate had indicated that they would not incardinate any of Lefebvre's priests in their dioceses. They also publicly criticised Catholics who remained attached to the Tridentine Mass. By this time, the SSPX had opened additional seminaries in Armada, Michigan, (1973) and in Rome (1974).\nThe first sign of intervention by curial authorities was a meeting held in the Vatican on 26 March 1974. By June 1974, a commission of cardinals had been formed to inquire into the SSPX. The cardinals decided that a canonical visitation of the seminary should be undertaken and, from 11–13 November 1974, two Belgian priests carried out a visitation. Franz Schmidberger, later superior general of the Society in 1990, said that their report was favourable. However, the seminarians and staff at Écône judged some theological opinions that the two priests expressed there to be excessively liberal and greatly shocking. In what he later described as a mood of \"doubtlessly excessive indignation\", Lefebvre wrote a \"Declaration\" in which he strongly attacked what he considered to be liberal trends apparent in the contemporary Church, which (he said) were \"clearly evident\" in the Council and in the reforms that had followed. This document was leaked and published in January 1975, in the French Traditionalist Catholic journal \"Itinéraires\".\n\nBy now, Lefebvre was in serious difficulties. In January 1975, Monsignor Pierre Mamie, the Bishop of Fribourg, wrote to Rome stating his intention to withdraw the \"pia unio\" status that his predecessor had granted. In the same month, Lefebvre was asked by the cardinals to come to the Vatican. He met with them twice, on 13 February and 3 March. To Lefebvre's declared surprise, the meetings were hostile in tone: at one point a French cardinal, Gabriel-Marie Garrone, reportedly called him a \"fool\".\n\nOn 6 May 1975, with the approval of the cardinals, Bishop Mamie withdrew the SSPX's \"pia unio\" status. Lefebvre instructed his lawyer to lodge appeals and he ultimately petitioned the Apostolic Signatura, the highest court of the Catholic Church, which turned down the complaint. From this point onwards, the SSPX was no longer recognised as a canonical organization.\nLefebvre and the leadership of the society have always maintained that he was treated unfairly by the Roman Curia, that the suppression of the SSPX was unjust and also that the procedures followed in its suppression violated the provisions of the 1917 Code of Canon Law.\n\nThe SSPX continued to operate in spite of its dissolution. In the consistory of 24 May 1976, Pope Paul VI rebuked Archbishop Lefebvre by name – reportedly the first time in 200 years that a pope had publicly reprimanded a Catholic bishop – and appealed to him and his followers to change their minds.\n\nLefebvre announced that he intended to confer ordination on some of his students at the end of June 1976. On 12 June 1976, the Nuncio in Switzerland was given instructions to inform Lefebvre that, by special order of Pope Paul VI, he was forbidden to do so. On 25 June 1976, Archbishop Giovanni Benelli, the deputy Secretary of State, wrote directly to Lefebvre, confirming, by special mandate of the Pope, the prohibition to administer the holy orders, and warning him of the canonical penalties for Lefebvre himself and those whom he would ordain. Lefebvre ignored the warnings, and went ahead with the ordinations on 29 June 1976.\n\nIn the sermon that he delivered on that occasion, Lefebvre explicitly recognized the possibility that he himself would be struck with suspension and the new priests with an irregularity that should theoretically prevent them from saying Mass. On the next day, 1 July 1976, the Press Office of the Holy See declared that in accordance with canon 2373 of the then Code of Canon Law, Lefebvre was automatically suspended for one year from conferring ordination, and that those whom he had ordained were automatically suspended from the exercise of the order received. It was also announced that the Holy See was examining Lefebvre's disobedience to the orders of the Pope that were communicated by the above-mentioned letters of the Secretariat of State dated 12 and 15 June 1976.\n\nOn 11 July 1976, Lefebvre signed a certificate of receipt of a letter from Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, intimating to him a canonical warning that further penalties would be inflicted on him in accordance with canon 2331 §1 of the then Code of Canon Law concerning obstinate disobedience to legitimate precepts or prohibitions of the Roman Pontiff, unless within ten days of receipt of the letter he took steps \"to repair the scandal caused\". In a letter of 17 July to Pope Paul VI, Lefebvre declared that he judged his action of 29 June to be legitimate. The Pope considered this response inadequate and on his instructions the Congregation for Bishops, on 22 July 1976, suspended Lefebvre for an indefinite time from all exercise of holy orders- he could not confer any of the Sacraments, save Reconciliation or Baptism in a dire emergency (suspension \"a divinis\").\n\nA central controversy surrounding the SSPX concerns the consecration by Archbishop Lefebvre and Brazilian bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer of four SSPX priests as bishops in 1988 in violation of the orders of Pope John Paul II.\n\nBy 1987, Archbishop Lefebvre was 81. At that point, if Lefebvre had died, the SSPX would have become dependent upon non-SSPX bishops to ordain future priests – and Lefebvre did not regard them as properly reliable and orthodox. In June 1987, Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate a successor to the episcopacy. He implied that he intended to do this with or without the approval of the Holy See. Under canons 1013 and 1382 of the Catholic Code of Canon Law, the consecration of a bishop requires papal approval. Consecration of bishops without papal approval had been condemned by Pope Pius XII in his encyclical \"Ad Apostolorum principis\", which described the sacramental activity of bishops who had been consecrated without such approval as \"gravely illicit, that is, criminal and sacrilegious\". The Roman authorities were unhappy with Lefebvre's plan, but they began discussions with him and the SSPX which led to the signing on 5 May 1988, of a skeleton agreement between Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the future Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nOn Pope John Paul II's instructions, Cardinal Ratzinger replied to Lefebvre on 30 May, insisting on observance of the agreement of 5 May and adding that, if Lefebvre carried out unauthorized consecrations on 30 June, the promised authorization for the ordination to the episcopacy would not be granted.\n\nOn 3 June, Lefebvre wrote from International Seminary of Saint Pius X, stating that he intended to proceed. On 9 June, the Pope replied with a personal letter, appealing to him not to proceed with a design that \"would be seen as nothing other than a schismatic act, the theological and canonical consequences of which are known to you\". Lefebvre did not reply and the letter was made public on 16 June. For the first time the Holy See stated publicly that Lefebvre was in danger of being excommunicated.\n\nOn 30 June 1988, Archbishop Lefebvre proceeded to ordain to the episcopate four priests of the SSPX. Monsignor Antônio de Castro Mayer, the retired Bishop of Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil, assisted in the ceremony. Those consecrated as Bishops were: Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Alfonso de Galarreta, and Richard Williamson.\n\nThe following day, the Congregation for Bishops issued a decree declaring that Archbishop Lefebvre and the four newly ordained bishops had incurred the automatic canonical penalty of excommunication reserved to the Holy See. On the following day, 2 July, Pope John Paul II issued an apostolic letter known as \"Ecclesia Dei\" in which he condemned the Archbishop's action. The Pope stated that, since schism is defined in the Code of Canon Law as \"withdrawal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or from communion with the members of the Church subject to him\" (canon 751), the consecration \"constitute[d] a schismatic act\", and that, by virtue of canon 1382 of the Code, it entailed ipso facto excommunication for all the bishops involved.\n\nLefebvre argued that his actions had been necessary because the traditional form of the Catholic faith and sacraments would become extinct without Traditionalist clergy to pass them on to the next generation. He called the ordinations \"opération survie\" (\"Operation Survival\"), citing in his defense canons 1323 and 1324 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the first of which says that \"a person who acted coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls\" is not subject to penalty for violating a law or precept, while the other says \"the perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed ... by a person who thought in culpable error that one of the circumstances mentioned in can. 1323, nn. 4 or 5 was present\".\n\nSome members of the SSPX disassociated themselves from the Society as a result of Lefebvre's actions and, with the approval of the Holy See, formed a separate society called the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter.\n\nDiscussions between the Holy See and the Society of Saint Pius X towards an eventual reconciliation have been ongoing. For years after the 1988 consecrations, there was little if any dialogue between the SSPX and the Holy See. This state of affairs ended when the Society led a large pilgrimage to Rome for the \"Great Jubilee\" of 2000.\n\nNine years later, on January 21, 2009 the Holy See remitted the excommunications of the Society's bishops that it had declared at the time of the 1988 consecrations and expressed the hope that all members of the society would follow this up by speedily returning to full communion with the Church.\n\nDiscussions since then have been complex, stemming from the Society's insistence that the teachings of the Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine, a claim that the Holy See views as unacceptable, but recent discussions have indicated the possibility of an understanding. In an interview on 4 March 2017 with DICI, the official news organ of the Society, Bishop Bernard Fellay stated \"Whether it is a question of religious liberty, collegiality, ecumenism, the new Mass, or even the new rites of the sacraments…. all of a sudden, on these points that have been stumbling blocks, the emissaries from Rome tell us that they are open questions.\" In the same month of March 2017, Archbishop Guido Pozzo, the prelate in charge of the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\", the Roman Curia's organ for traditionalist societies, stated that the Holy See and the Society were close to an agreement regularizing the Society's status. In a letter of the same month it was announced that Pope Francis authorized diocesan bishops to grant to SSPX priests faculties to officiate at a marriage valid in the Catholic Church in cases where no priest in good standing could do so.\n\nIn July 2017 Bishop Fellay signed a document along with a number of other clergy and academics labeled as a \"Fraternal Correction\" of Pope Francis. The twenty-five page document, which was made public in September after receiving no reply from the Holy See, criticized the Pope for allegedly promoting heresy through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate.\n\nThe canonical situation of the SSPX and of its clergy has been the subject of controversy since the 1988 Écône consecrations. While the Society is not listed in \"Annuario Pontificio\" as a recognized society of apostolic life, it has nonetheless benefited from many significant allowances normally granted only to recognized orders and societies. In the November–December 2017 edition of \"The Angelus\", Fr. Francois Knittel, SSPX, wrote \"The Church authorities have gradually recognized the liceity and the validity of the ministry performed by the priests of the SSPX.\"\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith communicated that Pope Francis had decided to grant local ordinaries the right to give to a priest in good standing the faculty to preside at the marriage of followers of the Society, immediately after which they will participate in a Mass celebrated by an SSPX priest, or, if no priest in good standing can receive the consent of the couple, to give the faculty instead to an SSPX priest. Previously, in 2008, the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\" had stated \"The priests of the Society of St. Pius X are... prohibited from exercising their priestly functions,\" going on to conclude that, in the case of matrimony, \"these sacraments are invalid,\" since a suspended priest lacks the proper delegation from the bishop. \n\nOn 20 November, 2016, Pope Francis personally extended an allowance he created during the Holy Year of 2015, whereby penitents confessing to priests affiliated with the SSPX \"shall validly and licitly receive the absolution of their sins.\" \n\nDuring an interview with \"TV Libertes\" on 29 January, 2017, Bishop Fellay announced that theological discussions with the Vatican had led to permission for the Society to licitly ordain priests: \"This summer it was confirmed that the Superior General can freely ordain the priests of the Society without having to ask permission from the local bishop.\"\n\nIn 2011, Father Edward McNamara, professor of liturgy and dean of theology at the Regina Apostolorum university in Rome, said that, for Catholics, assistance at Mass celebrated by priests of the Society is not necessarily a sin: \"It would only become so if a person attended this Mass with the deliberate intention of separating himself from communion with the Pope and those in communion with him.\" However, he concluded: \"Only if there is objectively no alternative should one attend the Mass celebrated by a priest from the Society of St. Pius X. If one has to do so, then I would say that one may go in good conscience.\"\n\nWhen told by a journalist of InfoVaticana, a provider of religious information founded in Madrid in October 2013, that what Pope Francis had decided in March 2017 was instead that, \"from now on, the weddings celebrated by the priests from the FSSPX are going to be recognized\", Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who had not seen the actual document, remarked: \"That is a very significant action of the Holy Father, and it also indicates that in some way there must be a reconciliation of the FSSPX because basically what the Pope is saying is that the priests in this society, when they witness marriages, are exercising jurisdiction in the Roman Catholic Church.\" In reality, it is local ordinaries, not the Society, that in the document are authorized, if they wish, to delegate jurisdiction to SSPX priests to assist canonically at some marriages.\n\nThe Society's view is that, before Pope Francis's authorizations, their priests held \"supplied\" jurisdiction (power of governance) for confessions and marriages. They received this supplied jurisdiction by law and not \"by delegation or by mandate of the Sovereign Pontiff or the diocesan bishops or of regularly appointed parish priests\".\n\nSince the grants by Pope Francis, the Society says, its priests have or can have ordinary jurisdiction for the sacraments of confession and marriage. It adds that, in cases where a diocesan bishop refuses to grant delegation for a marriage, SSPX priests can still use extraordinary jurisdiction.\n\nAs of 22 April 2018, the Society has 637 priests present in 37 countries and active in 35 more, 772 Mass centers, 167 priories, 123 religious brothers, 200 religious sisters, 79 oblates, 204 seminarians in six seminaries, 56 pre-seminarians in three pre-seminaries, more than 100 schools, 7 nursing homes, 4 Carmelite convents, 19 Missionary Sisters of Kenya, and 2 university-level institutes.\n\nThe Society is divided into two classes of territorial units called districts and autonomous houses, each headed by a superior. An autonomous house may become a district after three priories have been established within its jurisdiction. The most recent organizational addition of the Society is the Autonomous House of Central America and the Caribbean, formed from territory taken from the District of Mexico, erected on 1 October, 2017. Over 120 (>20%) of the Society's priests are stationed in the District of France.\n\nCurrently, the Society is sub-divided into 14 districts, and 5 autonomous houses:\n\nThe first seminary founded by the Society (St. Pius X Seminary) is located in Écône, Switzerland. Its largest, however, is located in the United States (St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary: Buckingham County, Virginia). The seminary, having outgrown its previous facilities, recently relocated from Winona, Minnesota; the former seminary complex continues to house the novitiate of the religious brothers. Other seminaries are located in France (Flavigny-sur-Ozerain), Germany (Zaitzkofen), Australia (Goulburn), and Argentina (La Reja). The Society also runs pre-seminaries for prospective priestly vocations in Italy (Albano Laziale), and the Philippines (Santa Barbara).\n\nIf the Society's canonical situation were to be regularized, it would be the Church's 4th largest society of apostolic life (similar to a religious order, but without vows), according to the three criteria published annually in \"Annuario Pontificio\": Number of erected houses (median 31; SSPX 167), number of members in the society (median 229; SSPX 971), and number of priests in the society (median 149; SSPX 640).\n\nThe SSPX has received explicit support from the following diocesan bishops:\n\nBishop Mayer resigned canonically on 20 August 1981; he later participated in the 1988 Écône consecrations, declaring \"my presence here at this ceremony is a matter of conscience: It is the duty of a profession of the Catholic Faith before the entire Church.\" After his retirement, Bishop Mayer founded the Priestly Union of St Jean-Marie Vianney, which remained closely associated with the SSPX until 2001, when it reconciled with the Holy See.\n\nThe Society now has close links with the Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat, led by Father Basil Kovpak, a priest formerly of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, who was definitively excommunicated from the Catholic Church in November 2007 after having Bishop Richard Williamson, then of the SSPX but expelled from the Society five years later, illicitly ordain two priests and seven deacons for his society in violation of canons 1015 §1 and 1017 of the Code of Canon Law.\n\nSeveral religious institutes, mostly based in France, are associated with the Society. A specific article, SSPX-affiliated religious orders, is devoted to them.\n\nThere have been two major kinds of splits from the SSPX. Two notable splits of the first kind involved priests who viewed the SSPX as too liberal and who use the form that the Mass had before Pope John XXIII. The other kind involved groups who have reconciled with the Holy See and who, like the SSPX, use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.\n\nGroups which broke with the SSPX and \"are not\" recognized by the Holy See include:\n\nGroups which broke with the SSPX and reconciled with Rome include:\n\nThe Society unequivocally condemn Nazism, confirming the principles in Pope Pius XI's 1937 encyclical \"Mit brennender Sorge\" which explicitly denounces the Nazis.\n\nThe Society also points out that Archbishop Lefebvre's own father, Renè Lefebvre, met his death in the concentration camp at Sonnenburg in February, 1944, three years after his arrest by the Gestapo; he died, \"his rosary in hand, a victim of Nazi insanity.\"\n\nAfter Bishop Richard Williamson, the subject of the complaint by the Anti-Defamation League, denied in an interview published in 2009 (for which he was later convicted of Holocaust denial by a German court) the use of Nazi gas chambers to massacre Jews, the superior general of the Society said that, if he repeated his denial, he would be expelled. His actual expulsion in 2012 was for refusing to show due respect and obedience to the SSPX authorities and calling on the superior general to resign.\n\nIt was in an SSPX priory that French Nazi collaborator and war criminal Paul Touvier was arrested. The superiors of the priory had granted him asylum as \"an act of charity to a homeless man\". They had no knowledge about the man’s background when he first appeared in the priory, and Touvier was indeed homeless at the time. On his death, in 1996, a Requiem Mass was offered for his soul, upon his request.\n\nOn 16 October 2013, the Society offered to perform a funeral for Nazi war-criminal Erich Priebke. However, Erich Priebke, who was baptized a Protestant, in the post-war years converted to Catholicism with his wife and had his children baptized. On the occasion of the public audience in front of the Military Tribunal of Rome held on April 3, 1996, he read a letter in the presence of the families of the victims, in which he manifested his grief, deploring the horrible act of obedience that he had had to perform in those circumstances:From the depths of my heart I feel the need to express my condolences for the sorrow of the relatives of the victims of the Ardeatine Caves... As a believer I have never denied this tragic fact; for me the order to participate in the action was a great personal tragedy... I think of the dead with reverence and I feel united with the living in their sorrow.\" He rejected the cult of race as a “mistake that led down a path of no return”.\nDespite all of that the ceremony did not take place due to protests by some 500 people, mostly unaware of the circumstances of his personal life, outside the Society's Italian district house in Albano, near Rome. The local authorities of the Catholic Church had refused him a public funeral, citing a rule of canon law that, unless they gave some signs of repentance before death, a public funeral must be refused to manifest sinners to whom it cannot be granted without public scandal of the faithful.\n\nOn April 5, 2017, Uppdrag granskning, a Swedish television program focused on investigative journalism, alleged that four members of the SSPX—three priests and a former seminarian—had molested at least a dozen young people in several countries. The program also stated that evidence of abuse was kept secret by the SSPX and that the priests were allowed to continue in ministry.\n\nKevin Gerard Sloniker, the former seminarian and the only person accused by name in the program, was expelled from the Society's St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in 2005, and began serving a life-sentence in 2015. The remaining three accusations regard priests whose names have been withheld (referred to in the program as Fathers P, S, and M); their accusers have likewise remained anonymous. Nonetheless, P was the subject of a canonical trial presided over by Bishop Fellay, authorized by the Vatican in 2013; he was found guilty, and subsequently ordered to retire to a monastery. Crux reports \"P refused to go and, according to officials of the SSPX, joined [Bishop] Williamson's Resistance.\" He along with \"Father S\" were expelled from the Society, and are now affiliated with Williamson's group. \"Father M\" is currently serving in France, though no criminal charges have been brought against him and the Society denies that they are aware of any credible accusations of abuse against the priest.\n\nMexican SSPX priest and former headmaster Fr. Uribe Silviano Bernabé was sentenced in September 2004 by a Bordeaux criminal court to one year for sexual assaults on a grown up woman and a 13-year old girl. He appealed the sentence and lost on March 17 2005. He then brought the case to the Court of Cassation in Paris, which upheld the sentence on April 26, 2006.\n\nOn December 13, 2017, Fr. Frédéric Abbet was sentenced to 5 years by a Brussels appeal court for sexual abuse on a young boy in an SSPX boarding school. He had already faced accusations in his native Switzerland in 2005 but had been acquitted by an unofficial SSPX tribunal.\n\nOn February 16, 2018, former school headmaster Fr. Christophe Roisnel was sentenced to 19 years by the Nanterre criminal court of appeal for multiple counts of rape and acts of torture on female school teachers .\n\n\n"}

Damascius dedicated his \"Life of Isidore\", also known as the \"Philosophical History\", to Theodora, having written it at her request.\n\nThe daughter of Kyrina and Diogenes, Theodora was, like Iamblichus, descended from royal line of Emesa.\n\nThe Athenian Neoplatonic school had developed a following among Syrian and Egyptian pagan students at the turn of the fifth century, and Theodora, along with her younger sisters, had studied philosophy at the school of Isidore in Alexandria. This could have been in the 480s when Isidore was already well established within the intellectual Alexandrian millieu, or in the 490s after his return from Athens. She was also accomplished at poetics and grammar, a mathematician versed in geometry and higher arithmetic.\n\nShe was a Neoplatonist of the Iamblichean type, so a devout pagan. According to Photius, writing three centuries later, she performed pagan rites and theurgical operations: he describes her as a ‘Hellene by religious persuasion,’ and her ancestors as ‘all of them first prize winners in idolatrous impropriety.’ \n\nDamascius’s \"Life of Isidore\" illustrates the ease with which the philosophical circle to which Theodora belonged moved in the late fifth and early sixth centuries between Athens, Alexandria and Aphrodisias.\n\nThere is no record of Theodora fleeing to Persia after Justinian’s order to close the Platonic school in Athens in 529, along with Isidore, Damascius, Simplicius, Priscianus Lydus, Eulamius of Phrygia, Hermias the Phoenician, and Diogenes the Phoenician.\n\nTheodora was also taught by Damascius, who was another disciple of Isidore and the last head of the Neoplatonic school in Athens.\nIt was at Theodora’s request that Damascius wrote the \"Life of Isidore\", and to her that he dedicated it. This work, also known as the \"Philosophical History\", was composed between 517-526, and provides an account of the lives and times of the pagan Neoplatonic communities in Alexandria and Athens at the very end of antiquity, structured around the biography of Isidore.\n\nAll that are left of its 60 chapters are excerpts, preserved in Photius’s \"Bibliotheca\" and \"Suda\", which, generally regarded as the revised version of notes that he had made in the course of his reading over the previous 20 years, are not necessarily accurate transcripts. Photius remarks that Damascius ‘does not so much write the life of Isidore, as that of many other people, both his contemporaries and his predecessors; he collects together their activities and also tales about them through a generous and even excessive use of digression’.\n\nPolymnia Athanadassi describes the work as ‘a critical, often humorous, appreciation of the character and achievement of individual men and women… Set firmly against a wide geographical, historical and political background, these people are shown to move in two disparate and often clashing worlds, those of paganism and Christianity.’ But Edward Watts claims that ‘Ancient philosophical culture was not defined exclusively by religious concerns and doctrinal ties… Platonists shaped themselves into an intellectual community held together by doctrinal commonalities, a shared history, and defined personal relationships.’\n"}

{"id": "30865015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30865015", "title": "Xing Yi Quan", "text": "Xing Yi Quan\n\nXing Yi Quan () is classified as one of the Wudang styles of Chinese martial arts. The name of the art translates approximately to \"Form-Intention Fist\", or \"Shape-Will Fist\".\n\nXing Yi is characterized by aggressive, seemingly linear movements and explosive power that's most often applied from a short range. A practitioner of Xing Yi uses coordinated movements to generate bursts of power intended to overwhelm the opponent, simultaneously attacking and defending. Methods vary from school to school, but always include bare-handed fighting training (mostly in single movements/combinations and sometimes in forms) and the training of weapons usage with similar or identical body mechanics to that used for bare-handed fighting. The most basic notions of movement and body mechanics in the art were heavily influenced by the practice of staffs and spears.\nHistorically and technically related martial arts include Dai Xin Yi Liu He Quan, Liu He Xin Yi Quan and Yi Quan.\n\nThe earliest written records of Xing Yi can be traced to the 18th century, and are attributed to Ma Xueli of Henan Province and Dai Long Bang of Shanxi Province. Legend credits the creation of Xing Yi to renowned Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) general Yue Fei, but this is disputed.\n\nAccording to the book \"Henan Orthodox Xingyi Quan\" written by Pei Xirong () and Li Ying’ang (), Xing Yi Dai Long Bang\"\"...wrote the Preface to Six Harmonies Boxing in the 15th reign year of the Qianlong Emperor [1750]. Inside it says, '...when Yue Fei was a child, he received special instructions from Zhou Tong. Extremely skilled in spearfighting, he used the spear to create fist techniques and established a skill called Yi Quan\" (意拳).\" Meticulous and unfathomable, this technique far outstripped ancient ones.\"\n\"於乾隆十五年為「六合拳」作序雲：「岳飛當童子時，受業於周侗師，精通槍法，以槍為拳，立法以教將佐，名曰意拳，神妙莫測，蓋從古未有之技也。\"\n\nAccording to legend, throughout the Jin, Yuan and Ming Dynasties few individuals had studied this art, one of them being \"Ji Gong\" (also known as Ji Longfeng and Ji Jike) of Shanxi Province. After Yue Fei's death, the art was 'lost' for half a millennium. Then, during the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Shaanxi Province's Zhongnan Mountains, Yue Fei's boxing manual was said to have been discovered by Ji Gong. It is more likely though that Ji Jike had created the art based on prior martial arts experience, or passed on an art that had already existed.\nYang Jwing-Ming (who is not a practitioner of the art) argues that aspects of Xing Yi Quan (particularly the animal styles) are identifiable as far back as the Liang Dynasty at the Shaolin Temple. According to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei therefore did not strictly invent Xing Yi Quan, but synthesized and perfected existing Shaolin principles into his own style of gongfu which he popularized during his military service. Nonetheless, according to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei is usually identified as the creator because of his considerable understanding of the art (as shown in the work \"The Ten Theses of Xingyiquan\", credited to Yue) and his cultural status as a Chinese war hero. It ought be noted that in Chinese culture, it is common to attribute the creation of great traditions to legendary individuals. In such a way, the art of Tai Ji Quan is attributed to the legendary Zhang Sanfeng, and Daoism to Laozi, even though as in the case with Yue Fei, there exists no proof for such claim.\n\nOther martial artists and Chinese martial art historians, such as Dan Miller, Cartmell, and Brian Kennedy, hold that this story is largely legendary; while Xing Yi Quan may well have evolved from military spear techniques, there is no evidence to support that Yue Fei was involved or that the art dates to the Song dynasty. These authors point out that the works attributed to Yue Fei's role long postdate his life, some being as recent as the Republican era, and that it was common practice in China to attribute new works to a famous or legendary person, rather than take credit for oneself. One source claims that the author of the \"preface\" is unknown, since no name is written on the manuscript. Most practitioners just assume it was written by Dai Long Bang. Some researchers of martial arts believe that it was actually written in Shanxi during the final years of the 19th century. In addition, historical memoirs and scholarly research papers only mention Zhou Tong teaching Yue archery and not spear play. Yue historically learned spear play from Chen Guang (陳廣), who was hired by the boy’s paternal grandfather, Yao Daweng (姚大翁).\n\nBeginning in the late Ming era and Ji Longfeng's time, evidence for the art's history grows firmer. Ji Longfeng, also known as Ji Jike, is the first person which all agree had both existed and practiced the art. Ji Longfeng's contributions to the art are described in the \"Ji Clan Chronicles\" (姬氏族譜; pinyin: Ji Shi Jiapu). Like the \"Preface\", the \"Chronicles\" describes Xing Yi Quan as a martial art based on the combat principles of the spear. The \"Chronicles\", however, attributes this stylistic influence to Ji himself, who was known as the \"Divine Spear\" (神槍; pinyin: Shén Qiāng) for his extraordinary skill with the weapon. Nowadays, many believe that the style Ji Longfeng was taught had been Shaolin Xin Yi Ba (a style which still exists today, and bears minute resemblance to XinYi LiuHe Quan). Ji Longfeng referred to his art as Liu He, The Six Harmonies, a reference to the most highly developed spear style practiced in the late Ming military.\n\nSome speculate that during that period in the development of the art, either Ji Longfeng or some of his students had a connection with monks at the famous Shaolin Temple on Song Mountain. There exists a martial art called 'Xin Yi Ba', which is still taught at the general location of the temple, and bears a few similarities to Xing Yi related styles. Some claim that Shaolin Xin Yi Ba had been taught to the Shaolin monks by Ji Longfeng's line, while others hold the view that Ji Longfeng was taught martial arts by the monks.\n\nFrom Ji Longfeng, the art was passed down to Cao Jiwu. From Cao Jiwu, the art split into its two biggest branches. One branch came down from Cao's student Ma Xueli, and became Xin Yi Liu He Quan - an art still widely practiced today, which compared to other lineages, have not undergone many changes over the generations. The other branch that came down from Cao Jiwu was through his other student, Dai Longbang. The latter passed the art into the Dai clan, which had made many changes to it, mixing it with several arts and skills that had already existed in the Dai family. The art remains in the Dai clan to this day, but has also spread elsewhere in China and around the world.\n\nThe art remained fairly obscure until Li Luoneng (also known as Li Nengran) learned the art from the Dai family in the 19th century. It was Li Luoneng and his successors — which include Guo Yunshen, Song Shirong, Che Yizhai, Liu Qilan and Li Taihe (who would popularize Xing Yi Quan across Northern China).\n\nIt is known that Li Luoneng was proficient in other martial arts before studying Dai clan's Xin Yi. Some claim his original art was \"Qimen Quan (奇門拳)\", perhaps his family's style, while others believe he actually studied Tongbei Quan and Gongli Quan. Li came to study under the Dai family either because he heard of their fame in the martial arts and business, or maybe as suggested by others, after having fought and lost to a practitioner of their art. It is generally agreed he then settled in the area of their village, and grew and sold vegetables, which earned him the nickname 'Li Lao Nong' 李老農 (Old Farmer Li, but also 'Respectable Farmer Li'). Initially, members of the Dai clan refused to teach him, but he eventually won over their trust, and he was taught by Dai Wenxiong, Guo Weihan, or both. After learning Dai Xin Yi for a number of years, perhaps over a decade, Li left the Dai territories and traveled across Shanxi and Hebei provinces, teaching for many years his own elaboration on the art, now called 'Xing Yi Quan'. No reasons were ever recorded for the many changes Li made to the art, but there are those who claim that Li wished to compete with the Dai clan's fame, perhaps because of some grudge. Li and many of his students and grand-students were famous for offering bodyguard and caravan escort services.\n\nA condensed version of Xing Yi Quan was taught to Chinese officers at the Military Academy at Nanjing during the Second Sino-Japanese War for close quarters combat. This included armed techniques such as bayonet and sabre drills alongside unarmed techniques.\n\nSun Lutang, a later exponent of the art, became famous in the early 20th century for his skills (chiefly in the Beijing and Tianjin areas), and for the martial books he had written about the Internal arts. During Sun Lutang's lifetime and martial 'career', he and several of his contemporaries began to classify Xing Yi, together with Taiji Quan and Bagua Zhang, as 'Wudang Martial Arts' style. Sun also exchanged knowledge with his friend and colleague Fu Zhensong, who subsequently took this branch of the art to southern China (after it had been mostly practiced in the northern parts of the country for centuries). Later, many others have spread the art across China and the world. Yi Quan, which had been evolved from Xing Yi Quan by Wang Xiangzhai, became especially widespread during the 20th century, in China and across the world.\n\nFollowing the Cultural Revolution in China, some Xing Yi forms have been adapted to fit the needs of modern practitioners of the competitive sport of Wushu. This meant that various movement forms from the art were adapted to a competitive format, in which the emphasis was put on aesthetics and flowery movements, rather than on fighting. The style is nonetheless relatively rare in wushu competitions because all wushu practitioners must compete in several mandatory events, which make Xing Yi, a non-mandatory art, a secondary priority in wushu competitive circles.\n\nAs there had never been a single organizational body governing the teaching of the art, several variant styles and sub-styles developed. Although there are classical texts which include specific encoded instructions and general guidelines for practice, many of these are ignored by most modern practitioners, and interpreted in different ways by those who follow their instruction (this is depicted in the lineage chart further down this page). As a result, over the decades and especially over the last few dozen years, branches of the art have considerably differentiated and diverged. This trend was strengthened by cross influences various Xing Yi teachers had from other martial arts and martial artists, and the spread of Xing Yi to the Western World.\n\nThe art began to be taught in the West somewhere along the 1960s-1970s. However, it only rose to prominence among martial arts communities worldwide during the first decade of the 21st century. Currently, it is still not well known among the general public. One explanation for this situation is that unlike other traditional oriental martial arts, Xing Yi was not a notable style in movies which became popular in the West (and though a modified 'wushu' version of it appeared in The One, starring Jet Li, this was not told or hinted to the viewers as part of that film's script).\n\nArguably, the most common Xing Yi Quan lineage in the West today is of the Yi Zong branch, which came down from Zhang Junfeng. Many of Zhang's students and grand-students, such as Kenneth Fish (martial artist), Hung I-Hsiang, Su Dongchen, Luo Dexiu, Xu Hongji and others have been teaching his Xing Yi to Westerners since the 1980s - especially Americans. This branch became the most popular because Taiwan was open to Westerners during the 20th century, while throughout much of that century, the Communist regime on mainland China did not allow Westerners to visit regularly, and thus people were not exposed to branches of the art from the mainland. Contrary to popular belief, spread by some Taiwanese teachers, the art had not 'died out' on the mainland, but was simply inaccessible to outsiders for several decades (proof of this is that many lineages of the art discussed and referenced on this page had survived The Great Leap Forward and The Cultural Revolution). Another popular Taiwanese branch in the West is Wang Shujin's lineage, which was chiefly transmitted by his student Wang Fulai.\n\nThere are also several lineages from Tianjin which are nowadays taught in the West, namely in Canada and Israel. Lines of Dai XinYi and XinYi LiuHe are still rare in the West, and can be said to even be relatively rare in China, though they are not at risk of becoming 'extinct'. In the United States, Dai XinYi is taught by Li Tailiang and several of his students. Yi Quan, on the other hand, has become exceedingly popular in the West, being taught in many schools, especially in Europe. There are no statistics as to the number of practitioners in any of these arts in either China or other countries.\n\nAncient Chinese texts, like those which make up the 'Xing Yi Classics', often contain characters whose meanings are obscure or have disappeared completely from the Chinese language. Specialized terms which describe historically specific concepts (names of ancient weapons for example) are commonly interpreted with regards for their closest, modern linguistic equivalent. The results can be problematic, producing translations which are linguistically correct but inconsistent within a fighting or martial context.\n\nThe recognized founder of Bagua Zhang, Dong Hai Chuan, was reputed to have fought Guo Yunshen with neither able to defeat the other - though it is possible that they were training together. It would have been controversial at the time for Dong Hai Chuan to have studied under Guo Yunshen, since Dong was the older of the two. The most neutral viewpoint would be to say that they trained \"together\", which may explain the stylistic similarities between Bagua Zhang and the Xing Yi Quan monkey shape. Frantzis argues that this encounter never took place and that Guo and Dong had little contact with each other. Frantzis argues that a Xing Yi - Bagua exchange was more likely to have occurred in Tianjin c. 1900 where xingyi masters Li Cunyi and Zhang Zhaodong, Bagua master Cheng Tinghua, and four other xingyi and bagua teachers lived together (Frantzis, 1998, p. 179).\nSun Lutang states in his autobiography that the legendary fight between Guo Yunshen and Dong Hai Chuan never happened. The book states that the truth of the matter is that Guo Yunshen actually fought one of his older xingyi brothers and lost. Sun Lutang was a student of both Guo Yunshen and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject seems to be one of the most accurate.\nTreating the story of Dong Hai Chuan and Guo Yunshen as allegory, however, reveals a common training protocol among Xing Yi Quan and Bagua Zhang practitioners. Often, because Bagua Zhang requires significantly more time for a practitioner's skill to mature, it is acceptable to learn Xing Yi Quan first or simultaneously. Such a practitioner develops a tactical vocabulary that is more readily apparent than the core Bagua Zhang movements.\nFor controversies concerning the teaching of one person by another, read under lineage chart further down this article.\n\nFrom Cao Jiwu, the art split into two branches:\n\nThese two branches survive to this day. Later, Li Luoneng developed Xing Yi Quan out of the Dai family branch. From Li Luoneng's time onward, the art has been said to have three main developmental branches:\n\nHowever, the identification of three separate branches is tenuous because of the extensive cross-training that occurred across their lineages. This suggests that the branches did not evolve in isolation, thus diluting any major differences between them.\n\nSchools of the Shanxi branch have a narrower stance, lighter footwork and tend to be more evasive. They emphasize the development of relaxation before the practice of intention (Yi). Schools of the Hebei branch emphasize Xing and Yi before developing a higher level of relaxed structure, and have a slightly different evasive footwork. Schools of the Henan branch are typically the most aggressive of the three.\n\nThe Henan branch is known as the Muslim branch because it was handed down within the Muslim community in Luoyang to which its founder, Ma Xueli, belonged. Henan branch is sometimes referred to by practitioners as XinYi LiuHe Quan instead of simply Xing Yi Quan. This may be attributed to the fact that the Muslim community of China was historically a very closed culture in order to protect themselves as a minority, thus retaining the older addition to the name of Xingyi. Liuhe means \"Six Harmonies\" and refers to the six harmonies of the body (three external harmonies: wrists-ankles, elbows-knees, shoulders-hips; three internal harmonies: xin-yi, yi-qi, qi-li i.e. spirit or \"emotional mind\" (xin) harmonises with your intention (yi), intention harmonises with your breath and physical momentum (qi), breath and physical momentum harmonise with your physical strength (li) that contribute to correct posture.) This is not to be confused with the separate internal art Liuhebafa.\n\nBoth the Shanxi and Hebei branches use a twelve animal system with five elements while the Henan branch uses ten animals. Depending on the lineage, it may or may not use five elements. Due to the historical complexity and vagueness of the lineages, it is uncertain which branch would constitute the \"authentic\" Xing Yi Quan.\n\nIn all of the following sections under this paragraph is chiefly discussed the art of Xing Yi Quan that had come down from Li Luoneng. These sections are not representative of Dai XinYi Quan or LiuHe XinYi Quan.\n\nXing Yi Quan features aggressive shocking attacks and direct footwork. Most of the training and footwork are practiced on straight lines. The linear nature of the art hints at both the military origins and the influence of spear technique alluded to in its mythology. The goal of the Xing Yi exponent is to reach the opponent quickly and drive power through them in a single burst. The analogy with spear fighting is useful here. This is achieved by coordinating one's body as a single unit, and the intense focusing of one's Intent (Yi 意) and coordinated power (Jin 勁) utilizing tight circles (usually in a forward direction). Issuing explosive power in Xing Yi is referred to as 'Fa Jin' (發勁), the same term used in many other traditional Chinese Martial Arts.\n\nDespite its hard, angular appearance, cultivating \"soft\" internal strength is essential to achieving power in Xing Yi Quan. Also, the advanced practitioner always contains tight spirals within his movements, so even the seemingly direct and linear ones are circular on a very small scale. Such circles and spirals also exist in other martial arts, but Xing Yi (like Southern Praying Mantis) likes to keep them smaller than others.\n\nEfficiency and economy of movement are the qualities of a Xing Yi stylist, and its direct fighting philosophy advocates simultaneous attack and defense. There are few kicks except for extremely low foot kicks (which avoids the hazards of balance involved with higher kicks) and some mid-level kicks, and techniques are prized for their working within key principles rather than aesthetic value.\n\nXing Yi Quan favours a fighting stance called Sān Tǐ Shì (三體勢 / 三体势), literally \"three bodies power,\" referring to how the stance holds the head, torso and feet along the same vertical plane (As a Zhan Zhuang method, this stance is trained lower). Though usually held shorter and higher in actual fighting, in training San Ti is more often trained at middle-low heights.\n\nLike other Internal Arts, much of the training in Xing Yi Quan is done in slow-motion. This is true for almost all the movements in the art, though the majority of them can and are also trained explosively.\n\nThis is a general name given to postures which one holds in place for prolonged periods of time - anywhere between 2 minutes and 2 hours. These postures are related to postures used in actual fighting, and are sometimes identical to them. Initially, these postures are taught as static training stances. After a short amount of time though, the practitioner would be taught how to move the muscles and connective tissues on a minute level from the inside of the body, making these stances very dynamic internally and more challenging to train. The most common Zhan Zhuang among all Xing Yi schools is San Ti Shi (it is the stance demonstrated by Sun Lutang in the picture at the beginning of the article). Other common stances are: Hun Yuan Zhuang, Wu Ji Zhuang, Fu Hu Zhuang, Xiang Long Zhuang and their many variants. There are many reasons for training Zhan Zhuang. Among them are, in general:\n\n- It is the simplest method to work on the training of one's Intent (Yi).\n\n- They are used to develop one's martial structure.\n\n- One can learn the bodily alignments of the art and perfect them in a more relaxed state.\n\n- Correct breathing can be trained more methodically while holding Zhan Zhuang.\n\n- There are certain health benefits involved in such training.\n\nSome teachers consider Zhan Zhuang to be the most important practice in Xing Yi; whereas, others neglect to train and teach them altogether. The use of the Santi Shi (三體勢) Zhan Zhuang as the main training method in Xing Yi dates back to Li Luoneng, the founder of modern version of the art. In Dai XinYi, the central and most important training method is called 'Squatting Monkey' - a dynamic movement exercise rather than a static posture held in place. In the Geng Jishan/Deng Yunfeng/Rose Li tradition, the phrase Santi is sometimes replaced by \"central equilibrium stance\".\n\nSince the 1980s, Zhan Zhuang has become more and more popular in other martial arts; many of which, such as some schools of Chen style Taiji, borrowed these methods from Xing Yi schools. Other martial arts sometimes had their own Zhan Zhuang methods beforehand. Today, the posture Hun Yuan Zhuang in particular has become a mainstay of many styles; its spread probably owing to the growing popularity of Yi Quan.\n\nAlso called 'Friction Stepping' (Mo Ca Bu; 摩擦步), This exercise is meant to ingrain in the practitioner the correct forward-stepping habits and methods of Xing Yi, which are different from those of other arts (though similar to those found in some styles of Bagua Zhang). Plow stepping is a precursor to Xing Yi's 'Chicken Stepping', which is the faster and more explosive stepping method in the art. In Yi Quan, Plow Stepping had been replaced with 'Mud Stepping'.\n\nIn many lineages, there is an intermittent stage between the stationary Zhan Zhuang and the more complex Five Elements (though this stage might also be taught following the Five Elements). The two names above are interchangeable for a few exercises developed to fulfill that purpose. Shi Li movements are basically simplified versions of the more advanced body mechanics and circles found in the Five Elements and the Animals. Their focus is on training one's structure and Yi, and can be thought of as 'Zhan Zhuang in movement'. They are usually trained very slowly, one movement at a time, repeating the same movement for many minutes on end. The more advanced practitioner many also spontaneously link up and flow between different Shi Li movements, or train them more explosively with Fa Jin (发劲). In Yi Quan, the original Five Elements and 12 Animals have all been 'condensed' and 'refined' into forms of Shi Li, which replace them as the core exercises in the art (together with Zhan Zhuang).\n\nThere also exists in certain lineages a type of Shi Li drill called Si Bu Pan Gen. It originated from Bagua Zhang, and is a form of tight Circle Walking - encircling a small square rather than a circle. The main purposes of it is to train evasive stepping and stretch the hip and groin regions (the Kua).\n\nXing Yi uses movements called the five classical Chinese elements to metaphorically represent five different states of combat. Also called the \"Five Fists\" or \"Five Phases,\" the Five Elements are related to Taoist cosmology although the names do not literally correspond to the cosmological terms. These five movements make the 'base' of the art, upon which all further combative knowledge and skill is built upon. Most schools will teach the five elements before the twelve animals because they are easier and shorter to learn (though eventually more difficult to master). The Five Elements do not appear in Henan XinYi LiuHe Quan, though similar movements and methods exist in that art's curriculum.\n\nEach of the Five Element movements has many vectors of movement contained within it. Together, they are used to explore all the useful ways through which one could advance on a straight line. Each of the Elements may be used as a Zhan Zhuang in-itself, and in some schools this is encouraged.\n\nA common saying originating from the Xing Yi classics is: \"The hands do not leave the heart and the elbows do not leave the ribs\". This is most evident in the Five Elements.\n\nSome Xing Yi practitioners also use the five elements as an interpretative framework for reacting and responding to attacks. This follows the five element theory, a general combat formula which assumes two types of cyclic interactions and three types of adverse interactions. The two cyclic interactions are the mutual nourishment (constructive) and mutual restraint (destructive) cycles. The adverse reactions are lesser known and rarely trained but exist from the understanding that nothing would exist if the mutual nourishment and restraint cycles existed alone, the adverse reactions are mutual over-restraint (overwhelming destructive interaction), mutual reverse restraint (reversal of the destructive cycle), and mutual burdening (unbalancing or reversal of the constructive cycle). Practitioners abiding by these concepts train to react to and execute specific techniques in such a way that a desirable cycle will form based on these interactions of the five element theory. Where to aim, where to hit and with what technique—and how those motions should work defensively, is determined by what point of which cycle they see themselves in. Each of the elements has many variant applications that allow it to be used to defend against all of the elements (including itself), so any set sequences are ultimately entirely arbitrary in real combat but present a frame work for developing a more practical skill, the destructive cycle is often taught to 'beginners' as it is generally easier to visualize and consists of easier applications.\n\nXing Yi Quan is based on twelve distinct Animal Shapes (of which, ten animals are more common - see table below). Present in all regional and family styles, these animal movements emulate the techniques and tactics of the corresponding animal rather than just their physical movements. Many schools of Xing Yi Quan have only small number of movements for each animal, though some teach extended sequences of movements.\n\nThese are 8 fighting combinations that exist in some lineages of the art. They emphasize direct combat applicability, and elaborate further on the movements vectors and powers explored and trained with the Five Elements. Sometimes, there exist two variations for the Ba Zi Gong - one for gongfu development, and another for actual fighting usage. There might also exist in a lineage a linking form for all 8 combinations. The eight Ba Zi Gong are: Zhǎn 斬 (Cutting Down/Severing), Jié 截 (Intercepting), Guǒ 裹 (Wrapping), Kuà 挎 (Carrying), Tiāo 挑 (Lifting/Raising), Dǐng 頂 (Pushing Upwards), Lìng 令 (Leading) and Yún 雲 (Cloud).\n\nAdditionally to the Five Fists and animal shapes, many lineages employ the training of several additional movement forms - from a handful to a few dozen. Some of the more common forms are partner forms, which simulate combat scenarios. Once the individual animal shapes are taught, a student is often taught an animal linking form (\"shi'er xing lianhuan\") which connects all the taught animals together in a sequence. Some styles have longer, or multiple forms for individual animals, such Eight Tiger Forms \"Huxing bashi\". Other forms often link movements from the Five Fists, the different animal shapes, or both, and commonly include additional movements and techniques not found elsewhere. There also exist a Ba Zi Gong linking form and many weapons forms.\n\nXing Yi Quan emphasizes a close relationship between the movements of armed/unarmed techniques. This technical overlap aims to produce greater learning efficiency.\n\nTraditionally Xing Yi was an armed art. Students would train initially with the spear, progressing to shorter weapons and eventually empty-handed fighting. This gradually changed throughout the 20th century, as the emphasis in most traditional Chinese Martial Arts shifted from the use of weapons to fighting empty-handed. Weapon diversity is great in many lineages, with the idea being that an experienced Xing Yi fighter would be able to pick up almost any weapon available (or an object to use as such) irrespective of its exact length, weight and shape.\n\nCommon weapons in the art:\n\n\nLess common weapons:\n\n\nA variety of Important texts have survived throughout the years, often called \"Classics\", \"Songs\" or \"Theories\". These texts use intentionally vague language to describe the principles and methods of practice in LiuHe XinYi Quan, Dai XinYi Quan and Xing Yi Quan. They are less relevant to more modern interpretations of these arts, such as Yi Quan. In the past, these text were copied by hand, and were kept secret.\n\nThe following is a list of the most commonly referred-to classical texts:\n\n\nMuch of these texts can be read in English.\n\nBelow is a picture of one book containing the classics, which belongs to Li Bo (李博) from Shijiazhuang, a teacher who claims to be a descendant of Li Luoneng, the founder of the art. This book is titled \"Wu Mu Quan Pu (武穆拳譜）\".\n\nGenerally speaking, it is accepted that in Xing Yi (at least in Hebei-derived lineages), there are three stages to a practitioner's development of power and overall skill.\nThese three stages develop and change in parallel to all other training methods, and dictate the quality of one's training methods. The following is a description of these three stages (a translation of classic texts by Devlin G. Horrinek):\n\n\nSince the validity of lineages are often controversial, this list is not intended to represent any lineage. Names are presented in alphabetical order using pinyin romanization.\n\nThe following chart, created by Shifu Jonathan Bluestein and Shifu Nitzan Oren, demonstrates the historical connections between most known lineages of Xing Yi Quan, and related martial arts. The chart is a collaborative project between Mr. Bluestein, who created the bulk of it, and several dozen Xing Yi Quan teachers from the West, who contributed information on their lineages and those of others. The chart project is well known in the Xing Yi Quan community, and the information contained in it has never been disputed (further contributions, suggestions and objections may be made by directly contacting Mr. Bluestein, at: jonathan.bluesteingmail.com). An attempt was made to include as many notable teachers as possible, but due to the obvious constraints of space, not all could have been included. Disciples are marked by a direct, full, downward-flowing line. Regular students are marked with a broken line.\n\nHerein is a list of references to sources specifying various lineages of Xing Yi Quan, supporting the content presented on the chart.\n\nPlease note that a few minor details on the chart concerning people who had lived and taught prior to the 20th century are still somewhat controversial. This is due to a lack of profound historical documentation.\n\nOne of the more debated questions in this regard is who had been the teacher of Li Luoneng, the founder of modern Xing Yi Quan. It is known that Li studied with the Dai clan, but remains unclear who taught him. Some people and lineages have traditionally claimed that he was taught by master Dai Longbang. However, many others point to the fact that Longbang had died before Luoneng was born, or when Luoneng was quite young. Combined with the fact that Luoneng only arrived at Dai territory as a traveling adult, others argue that it would have been impossible for him to have studied under Longbang, and suggest his teacher was actually Longbang's student, Guo Weihan.\n\nAnother historical controversy relates to who had been the teacher of the founder of Yi Quan, late master Wang Xiangzhai (~1886-1963). Most Yi Quan oral traditions have it that Guo Yunshen, a student of the founder of modern Xing Yi (Li Luoneng), had been Wang Xiangzhai's teacher. However, since Wang was not yet alive (or been a young child) by the time of Guo Yunshen's death, others suggest he must have learnt from Guo's other disciples (Li Bao 李豹 is thought to have been his true main teacher). The chart lists Li Bao as Wang's teacher, and Guo Yunshen as an indirect teacher due to the controversy surrounding the matter (until further historical evidence surfaces).\n\nDuring the course of the late 19th century and 20th century, there had been a lot of cross-fertilization between notable masters of Xing Yi, and those of Bagua Zhang and Taiji Quan. This has yielded many mutual influences.\n\nChen Panling's Taiji Quan (originating from Taiwan) has been influenced by Xing Yi and Bagua.\n\nShanxi style Xing Yi in the line of Song Shirong has incorporated Bagua's Circle Walking practice, in either a circle, or tight squares or triangles (the latter practice referred to as 'Si Bu Pan Gen' - Four Step Base Encirclement).\n\nCheng Tinghua, a famous student of Bagua founder Dong Hai Chuan, is said to have taught his Bagua to many Xing Yi masters (including Gao Yisheng, Geng Jishan and Sun Lutang, of whom is written in the paragraphs below).\n\nGao Yisheng's Gao Style Bagua Zhang has incorporated a lot of material from Xing Yi Quan, and his lineage, known as 'Yi Zong', includes the teaching of both arts.\n\nSun Lutang, one of the most famous practitioner of Xing Yi in the 20th century, had learnt Cheng style Bagua Zhang and Wu/Hao style Taiji Quan after many decades of practicing Xing Yi. He then later went to develop his own unique forms of Bagua and Taiji, which were heavily influenced by his former experience training in Xing Yi.\n\nMany martial arts lines, notably that of Chen style Taiji Quan from Chen village, have begun to practice the Zhan Zhuang posture known as Hun Yuan Zhuang (or Cheng Bao Zhuang) in recent decades. The origin of that posture in modern times is probably either Xing Yi Quan or Yi Quan, as it is basic in the arts' practices.\n\nContrary to some modern hypothesis proposed by Karate practitioners, Xing Yi was not \"created based on Baji Quan and did not \"influence greatly the development of Okinawan Karate\". Rather, Okinawan Karate was most heavily influenced by southern-Chinese arts. This is well substantiated in historical Karate literature, such as in the works of Patrick McCarthy sensei.\n\nLike all traditional Chinese martial arts, Xing Yi too features a strong bond to the military, religious, philosophical and cultural traditions of China.\n\nXing Yi's weapons are mostly ones which were used on Chinese battlefields throughout the centuries, with the dao and spear being the most prominent members of that group. Many consider the style to have originally been a 'military art' (as opposed to a sport like boxing, or an urban self-defense system like Wing Chun).\n\nXing Yi's Five Shapes ('Five Elements') are a borrowed concept from Traditional Chinese Medicine (which is turn had borrowed them from Daoism).\n\nThe 12 Animal shapes were influenced, in part, by the Chinese zodiac. The Dragon, being the Chinese mythical animal, begets its supposed physical description and attributes from Chinese lore.\n\nLike all Nei Jia arts, Xing Yi is heavily influenced by Daoism. Its combat meditation methods (Zhan Zhuang) existed in similar forms in Daoism before being integrated into martial arts in later centuries. The whole theory behind \"using softness to overcome hardness\" and similar ideas have their origins in the Dao De Jing. Daoist concepts are readily implemented into actual training in the practice of Xing Yi. This can be discerned in the following paragraph by Sun Lutang: “Before training, there is no thought or intention, no figure or image, no self or others, only Qi exists in the chaos of the body. The state is called WuJi in Xing Yi. Without knowing the principle of “inverse motion,” people always rigidly adhered to the principle of the “direct motion nature.” Hence the internal Qi is restrained and things cannot be properly realized due to an obscure mind that causes the body to be weak. They do not know the principle of health that extreme Yang leads to Yin and extreme Yin leads to death. However, sages can be versed in the way of inverse motion, and control the relation between Yin and Yang, manage the principal of creation, direct Liang Yi (another name for Yin and Yang), grasp the key points, and go back to the pre-natal from the post-natal realm to settle at the original position as the body becomes an integral unit. Its way is nothing more than the principle of stretching and contracting as in post-natal Wu Xing and Bagua boxing. This is called the generation of Qi from WuJi.”\n\nXing Yi Quan has been featured in various media through the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its most famous version was written in Persian language by Jami (1414-1492), in his Haft Awrang (\"Seven Thrones\").
