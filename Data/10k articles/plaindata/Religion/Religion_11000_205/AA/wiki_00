More information can be found by visiting alhidayah.nl\n\nIn 2005, Minhaj-ul-Quran UK began 'Al-Hidayah', a series of annual 3 day residential educational and spiritual retreats, targeted at British Muslims, and inviting the foremost Islamic scholars from around the world.\n\nAl-Hidayah 2005 was held in the picturesque surroundings of the Pioneer Centre, Shropshire under the spiritual guidance of his imminence Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri head of Minhaj ul Quran International.\n\nOver 300 young Muslims attended the 3 day event and due to its success the residential retreat has been held as an annual event. The aims and objectives of Al Hidayah were to provide British youth with true knowledge of Islamic teachings based on love, peace and humanity. \n\nAl-Hidayah 2006, was held between Friday 25 August to Monday 28 August 2006 in Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire. The main speaker at the event was Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. The event was also attended by Shaykh Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji, who was a great scholar from the Islamic world.\n\nThe main feature of the event was the keynote speech of Shaykh-ul-Islam on the Life and Travels of Imam Bukhari. The organisers attracted more than 600 participants from United Kingdom and Europe and as far as the United States.\n\nThe third annual Al-Hidayah Residential Spiritual and Educational Retreat took place at the same venue as the 2006 event, in Heythrop Park Oxfordshire.\n\nHundreds of participants from all over the United Kingdom and Europe came to benefit from the one in a lifetime opportunity of spending four days in the company of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.\n\nThe previous two retreats were life changing for the young participants who were blessed with the opportunity of elevating their spirituality and to purify their inner-selves from lusts of the material world, to be replaced by a longing for the Creator.\n\nAlongside being a Mufassir, Muhadith and Faqih; among a long list of responsibilities that Shaykh-ul-Islam has taken upon himself in order to carry out his work for the Ummah, he is also one of the greatest Sufi leaders of the time. He is the ultimate all-in-one entity perfectly qualified to meet all the needs of those who want to escape from the clutches of materialism. Knowledge alone is not sufficient for this, thus a mere scholar is unable to bring about these changes in his followers. It is only when oceans of knowledge merge with galaxies of spiritualism, does a person qualify to carry out such a task.\n\nThe venue selected by the Al-Hidayah organisers was the perfect environment for both gaining knowledge and also experiencing spiritual uplift. The peaceful and green surroundings together with the spiritual teachings and company\" \"of Shaykh-ul-Islam made the venue a practical fountain of Tazkiyyah, Ihsan and Tasawwuf. The venue also catered for all the needs of the participants including accommodating the needs of families with children, separate facilities for brothers and sisters such as gym, swimming pool, sports activities, excellent dining facilities and accommodation and much more.\n\nShaykh Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji, Damascus Syria, was the chief guest. Shaykh Abdurahman al-Hammami and Sayyid Muadh were also special guests from Syria. Shaykh Abdul-Hakim Murad (University of Cambridge), a renowned British scholar was a guest speaker.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran UK organised a three-day annual \"Al-Hidayah Youth Camp\" at the University of Warwick in August 2009, which was attended by more than 1200 participants, from across the world. The participants started arriving at 9am on 8 August 2009. After the computerised verification of all delegates, they were issued passes. Renowned Syrian scholar, Shaykh Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji, delivered the first lecture to the participants on the subject of \"Discipline & Morality\". Shaykh Abdul-Hakim Murad Murad of University of Cambridge, another British scholar of immense erudition, delivered his talk on the importance of relations with other religions in a non-Muslim society.\n\nThe proceedings of the first day were punctuated with the occasional recitation from the Quran and presentation of Nasheed to keep the participants spiritually energised. In addition to Shaykh Abdur Rahman and his companions, the \"Qawals\" of Hassan Minhaj Naat Council kept the audience spiritually ecstatic with their presentations in Arabic, Urdu and Punjabi languages. Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was given a standing ovation and huge round of applause upon his arrival in the hall as chief organiser Dr Zahid Iqbal, welcomed Shaykh-ul-Islam and invited him to deliver his keynote speech.\n\nShaykh-ul-Islam made \"Peace & Unity\" the subject of his address. Former minister of Egypt, Prof Yahya Jamal, attended the camp on the first day and delivered a special lecture. The pictorial exhibition of renowned British photographer, Peter Sanders, who embraced Islam in 1991, was also the focus of people's attention. His pictures highlighted religious, social and sociological behaviours and trends in different societies. The participants liked the exhibition very much.\n\nDr Raheeq Ahmad Abbasi, Secretary General of Minhaj-ul-Quran, gave comprehensive briefing to the participants about the organisations worldwide network. The office bearers of Minhaj Welfare Foundation also gave briefing about their activities whose chief highlight was the ongoing project of ‘Aagosh’ (Orphan Care Home), which is estimated to cost 34 million rupees. The briefing also included details of Minhaj Welfare Foundation activities in other areas etc.\n\nThe highlight of the camp was the question & answer session. The panel, which asked questions, included Canon Dr Christopher Lamb, representative of Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, Professor Ron Geaves, Professor of the Comparative Study of Religion, Liverpool Hope University, Dr Sophie Gilliat-Ray, Director, Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK, Cardiff University, Dr Tahir Abbas, Director of the Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Culture, University of Birmingham, Phil Rees, prominent journalist and producer, Maqsood Ahmed, Senior Advisor from Communities Ministry and Zahoor Niazi, Chief-Editor of Jang News London, Peter Sanders, prominent photographer. The thrust of every question revolved around the issue of terrorism, extremism and practical steps that could be taken to save the Muslim Youth from these scourges. The participants gave cheering applause and kept clapping in response to the answers given to these questions by Shaykh-ul-Islam, which speaks volumes of the satisfaction they must have derived from this informed discourse.\n\nShaykh-ul-Islam reminded the youth attending the camp that they should not allow their love and association with the worldly life to exceed a particular limit. Rather they should focus on their morality, character and values so that they could not feel embarrassed in front of Prophet Muhammad on the Day of Judgement. He urged the youth to start implementing the teachings of Islam and following Prophet Muhammad ideal life for both material and spiritual success.\n\nDenouncing extremism and terrorism, Shaykh-ul-Islam said that peace was the main message of Islam. He threw light on the difference between Jihad and Terrorism, saying that Prophet Muhammad prescribed guidelines to be followed during war etc. The Muslims were prohibited from bringing any harm to non-combatants such as children, women, old people, and destroying orchards, animals and buildings of the enemy etc. \"Whatever is being perpetrated in the name of religion is complete negation of what Islam stands for and it is clear violation of Islamic teachings,\" Shaykh-ul-Islam said while referring to Islamic history.\n\nShaykh-ul-Islam instructed the youth to devote themselves fully to obtaining an education and said that it is by playing positive role and making positive contribution to their respective societies that they can increase the esteem of their country and religion. He said that ideal character of forefathers was responsible for the spread of Islam around the globe, not the sword.\n\nShaykh-ul-Islam said that Minhaj-ul-Quran was promoting the real message of Islam through its network by engaging other religions and communities in constructive dialogue for better tomorrow. He urged the youth to stand up to the extremists and terrorist who were out to malign Islam through their practices in collaboration with their communities and government institutions. \"This is through joint action and understanding that we can eliminate extremism and terrorism,\" he held.\n\nThe three-day camp concluded on the determination to work collectively to spread awareness about Islamic teachings and defeat terrorists at intellectual levels.\n\nAl-Hidayah 2010 was held at The University of Warwick between 7 August and 9 August 2010 under the spiritual guidance of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. Al Hidayah held in 2010 was of great significance as it was the year Shaykh-ul-Islam released the world famous work titled Fatwa on Terrorism which is an Islamic edict condemning all forms of terrorism in the world.\n\nAt the opening press conference Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri shed light on the aims and objectives of the camp and emphasised on the reasons why he believes it is necessary to train the youth to tackle extremist ideologies. He said that this 3-day initiative is aimed at awakening the Muslim youth to challenge the arguments of the extremist and to promote the need of collective action for promotion of peace, interfaith dialogue, and harmony and addressing the misunderstandings and confusions the concepts of jihad, khilafah and democracy. Analysing the emergence of terrorism, he said that cancer of terrorism does not emerge from nowhere but it begins as an ‘ideological infection’ which is a narrow interpretation and vision of Islam. It is misinterpretation of the Quran, Hadith and classical authorities of Islam. He said this process begins in mosques, schools, Universities, and through the internet by extremist groups. They initially start persuading their argument which leads towards brainwashing. He said that \"terrorism is a cancer that begins from and an ideological infection.\"\n\nShaykh-ul-Islam said that following the publication of Fatwa on Terrorism, it put a stop to its practice of stereotyping the Muslims and conveyed the Islamic message of tolerance, harmony and interfaith dialogue to a wide range of people and regions. This step dealt a lethal blow to the extremists and encouraged the reformers.\n\nThe event attracted over 1200 youngsters from all over United Kingdom and Europe.\n\n‘Peace for Humanity’ Conference was held on 24 September 2011 at the Wembley Arena under the banner of Minhaj-ul-Quran UK. Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri presided over the Conference attended by 12,000 people, which was also attended by human rights and peace activists, religious scholars, opinion leaders and key leaders and followers of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism.\n\nIn his address, Shaykh-ul-Islam said that the world needed peace, security and brotherhood more than before. He said that after 9/11, the difficulties of the Muslims around the globe have increased manifold. The picture of Islam spread in the world has nothing to do with Islam and 99% of Muslims are peace-loving. He said that terrorism and extremism had affected the Muslims more than the world. He said that thousands of people were killed in terrorist incidents, affecting millions of families. Extremism, he said, divided people and produced pessimism and despondency. He congratulated MQI UK on holding such a grand and purposeful Conference.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran UK Al-Hidayah project team arranged Al-Hidayah 2016 with a relevant and much needed focus on developing future leadership. This year’s event was the first three day event since Al-Hidayah 2010, and the objectives of the event were geared towards nurturing and inspiring future leaders from amongst the youth.\n\nKeele University in Staffordshire, was chosen as the venue for the event, set in 600 acres of scenic greenery and with all accommodation, facilities and events on campus, it provided the ideal environment for three days of learning and development.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that this was Minhaj-ul-Qur’an International’s first three day residential event of this size organised anywhere in the world outside of Pakistan, without the direct participation of the founder of Minhaj-ul-Qur’an International, his eminence Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. However, the event was presided over by the main keynote speaker Shaykh Dr. Hussain Mohi-ud-Din Qadri (President of the Minhaj Education Society), eloquently and with an ideal blend of knowledge, inspiration and motivation.\n\nIn preparation for Al-Hidayah 2017 to be held at Keele University in Staffordshire between 26 August and 28 August, the Al-Hidayah team organised Al-Hidayah regional events in the cities of Glasgow, Luton, Walsall and Manchester. The events emphasised the importance of the work of Minhaj-ul-Quran in our times and how youngsters can participate in propagating the works of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.\n\nAl-Hidayah 2017 was held between the dates of 26–28 August 2017 at the historic Keele University in Staffordshire under the spiritual guidance of Shaykh-ul-Islam, Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.

She and Irene Lewisohn founded the Museum of Costume Art. Bernstein was the lover, patron, and muse of novelist Thomas Wolfe.\n\nShe was born in 1880 in New York City, the daughter of Rebecca (Goldsmith) and Joseph Frankau, an actor. Joseph was a cousin of London cigar importer Arthur Frankau and thus, by marriage, of novelist and art historian Frank Danby, whom Aline recalled visiting as a child when Joseph Frankau was performing in London. Her family was Jewish. By the time she was 17, both of her parents had died and she was raised by her aunt, Rachel Goldsmith. Goldsmith had a theatrical boarding house on West 44th Street in New York City.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1951, Bernstein would do set design, costuming, or both for 51 productions.\n\nBernstein was a theater set and costume designer for the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, volunteering her work to make her name.\n\nIn 1926 she struggled but prevailed in becoming the first female member of the designers union. This membership opened up opportunities for Broadway commissions. However, as a woman, she still found that it was much easier to find work as a costume designer rather than as a set designer. Her career ran in phases; early on, she focused largely on costume design. After about 14 years of work, in 1930, she was able to move into set design. For about a decade, she primarily did set design work, only to return to costume design again around 1940 for the final phase of her career.\n\nIn the 1930s she also began to write, with two books published by Knopf, a highly respected publisher at that time. She was personal friends with Arthur and Blanche Knopf.\n\nHer first book, \"Three Blue Suits\", helped to more firmly establish her as a designer in New York. The book included a series of three stories in which three very different men wear the same blue serge suit. The details regarding how each man wears – or drags (the jacket on the floor) – his suit, reveal aspects of each man's character in subtle ways. A common trope among costume designer is that costumes, if they are good, should ultimately not be noticed. In contrast, the blue suit stories reveal Bernstein's ability to discern how critical details of costume evoke, and interact with, a character, and ultimately her skill as a costume designer at making this happen effectively.\n\nSome of her publications include:\n\nIn 1950, Aline Bernstein finally won some hard earned recognition. In 1949 she had designed costumes for the opera \"Regina\". The music and libretto were written Marc Blitzstein but based on the play \"The Little Foxes\" by Lillian Hellman, a play for which Bernstein had previously designed costumes. Although that production of \"Regina\" (it would be regularly revived in the 20th century) only ran for a month and a half, Bernstein won a Tony for her costume design in 1950.\n\nAline married Theodore F. Bernstein, a Wall Street broker, on November 19, 1902. Bernstein and her husband had two children: Theodore Frankau Bernstein (1904–1949), and Edla Cusick (1906–1983). Her marriage remained intact throughout and despite her affair with Thomas Wolfe.\n\nBernstein died on September 7, 1955 in New York City, aged 74.\n\nBernstein meet Thomas Wolfe in 1925 aboard the RMS \"Olympic\" when Wolfe was 25 and Bernstein 44. Bernstein became Wolfe's lover and provided Wolfe with emotional, domestic, and financial support while he wrote his first novel, \"Look Homeward, Angel\", which he dedicated to Bernstein.\n\nWolfe immortalized Bernstein as the character Esther Jack in his novels \"Of Time and the River\", \"The Web and the Rock\", and \"You Can't Go Home Again\". Bernstein, in turn, centered her autobiographical novel \"The Journey Down\" around her affair with Wolfe. Bernstein's and Wolfe's affair ended after a few years, but their friendship continued. One of Wolfe’s last phone calls, when he was dying of a brain tumor at age 37, was to tell Bernstein he loved her. At the time of Wolfe's death in 1938, Bernstein possessed some of Wolfe's unpublished manuscripts.\n\nIn the 2016 biographical drama film \"Genius\", Bernstein was portrayed by Nicole Kidman, while Wolfe was portrayed by Jude Law.\n\n"}

In Majorca, the most famous water-woman is Maria Enganxa. According to tradition, she lives inside all the wells and cisterns and takes all the children that pass near them with her hook.\n\nWater-women symbolize the fertility and life-giving virtues of water and are said to possess oneiric beauty.\n\nThey are said to appear as small and innocent women, with a high self-esteem and very prideful of their beauty. They are good women and try to bring wealth and well-being to the areas they live in.\n\nAccording to myth, water-women are nocturnal; have shimmering gold or red hair, and emerald or deep blue eyes; wear fine, rich clothes; and enjoy viewing their reflections in lakes on full-moon nights. Some of them are said to have beautiful wings of various colors. Many are said to carry magic wands carved from hazel, which is considered to be the only wood capable of casting spells.\n\nThere are many legends about romance and marriage between water-women and humans. In order to marry a water-woman, a human must agree to the water-woman's conditions. Often, one of the conditions is that the husband cannot reveal that his wife is a water-woman. If he does, the water-woman leaves him and disappears with his fortune. However, it is also said that the water-woman will still comb her children's hair and dress them every morning.\n\nWater-women are purported to avoid any relations with humans, though this is not always possible. When contact with humans does occur, it often turns out ill for the humans.\n\n"}

The Amrit Sanchar is the initiation rite introduced by Guru Gobind Singh when he founded the Khalsa in 1699.\n\nA Sikh who has been initiated into the Khalsa is titled as \"Amritdhari\" or \"Khalsa\" after \"Singh\" (man) or \"Kaur\" (woman). Those who undergo initiation are expected to dedicate themselves to Waheguru and work toward the establishment of the Khalsa Raj.\n\nKhande di Pahul was initiated in the times of Guru Gobind Singh ji when the Guru established the Order of Khalsa at Anandpur Sahib on the day of Vaisakhi in 1699. Guru Gobind Singh addressed the congregation from the entryway of a tent pitched on a hill (now called Kesgarh Sahib). He drew his sword and asked for a volunteer who was willing to sacrifice his head. No one answered his first call, nor the second call, but on the third invitation, a person called Daya Ram (later known as Bhai Daya Singh) came forward and offered his head to the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh took the volunteer inside the tent, and emerged shortly, with blood dripping from his sword. He then demanded another head. One more volunteer came forward, and entered the tent with him. The Guru again emerged with blood on his sword. This happened three more times. Then the five volunteers came out of the tent unharmed. Everyone was very confused.\n\nThese five men came to be known as Panj Piare or the \"Beloved Five\". These five were initiated into the Khalsa by receiving Amrit. These five were Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Mukham Singh, Bhai Sahib Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh and Bhai Himmat Singh. Sikh men were then given the name \"Singh\" meaning \"lion\" and the women received the last name \"Kaur\" meaning \"princess\"\n\n\"Khande Di Pahul\" not only embodies the primary objects of Sikh faith and the promises connected therewith, but also is itself a promise to lead a pure and pious life to unite with Almighty Lord. It is about inward cleansing of the conscience and seeking unity with Supreme Lord through His Grace. The word \"Pahul\" is a derivative from the substantive \"Pahu\" – which is an agent which brightens, accelerates or sharpens the potentialities of a given object\n\nMax Arthur Macauliffe wrote:\n\n\nThe person being initiated \"Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh\". The salutation is repeated and the holy water is sprinkled on their eyes and hair, five times. The remainder of the nectar is shared by all receiving the initiation, all drinking from the same bowl.\n\nAfter this, all those taking part in the ceremony recite the Mool Mantra and they are inducted into the Khalsa.\n\n"}

There have been reports of mass rapes by the paramilitary Bangladesh Ansars, though these have been disputed.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International as of June 2013 the Bangladeshi government made \"praiseworthy progress\" in implementing the terms of the peace accord and in addressing the Jumma people's concerns over the return of their land. Amnesty estimate that there are currently only 900 internally displaced Jumma families.\n\nThe conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts dates back to when Bangladesh was the eastern wing of Pakistan. Widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to India. After the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who were against Bangladeshi independence such as the Chakma politician Manabendra Narayan Larma sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the Constitution of Bangladesh. It did not recognise the ethnic identity and culture of the non-Muslim, non-Bengali peoples of Bangladesh. The government policy recognised only the Bengali culture and the Bengali language, and designated all citizens of Bangladesh as Bengalis. In talks with a Chittagong Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman expressed that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts as citizen of Bangladesh should have the Bengali identity. Sheikh Mujib is also reported to have threatened to forcibly settle Muslim Bengalis in the Hill Tracts to reduce the native Buddhist and Hindu peoples into a minority,which later proved to be a false allegation.\n\nThe migrated hill Jummas were given with special treatment, as they were the minority after independence in 1971. The rebellion by the Jummas began after the 1971 independence of Bangladesh.\n\nLarma and others founded the Parbatya Chhatagram Jana Shanghatti Samiti (PCJSS) as a united political organisation of all native peoples and tribes in 1973. The armed wing of the PCJSS, the Shanti Bahini was organised to resist government policies. The crisis aggravated during the emergency rule of Sheikh Mujib, who had banned all political parties other than his BAKSAL and the successive military regimes that followed after his assassination in 1975. In 1977, the Shanti Bahini launched their first attack on a Bangladesh Army convoy. It is alleged that the Indian government helped the Shanti Bahini set up bases across the border from Bangladesh.\n\nThe Shanti Bahini divided its area of operations into zones and raised forces from the native people, who were formally trained. The Shanti Bahini attacked Bengali police and soldiers, government offices and personnel and the Bengali settlers in the region. The group also attacked any native believed to be opposing it and supporting the government. According to government sources between 1980 and 1991, 1,180 people were killed by the Shanti Bahini, and 582 were kidnapped.\n\n400 Chakmas including Anupam Chakma absconded to India to evade the Bangladesh Army in 1989. Chakmas dominate the Shanti Bahini. Chakmas raised the insurgency as they wanted autonomy in that region.\n\nBangladesh was under military rule for fifteen years and democracy was restored in 1990. During this period there were several massacres of Jumma peoples in the CHT, the main perpetrators of these acts of mass violence being the Bangladesh armed forces. The UN special rapporteur has reported on extrajudicial, arbitrary and summary executions and that he had received reports of numerous human rights violations.\n\n\nBetween 1981 and 1994 it is estimated that 2,500 Jumma women had been raped by Bangladesh armed forces and in 1995 it was estimated that of over 94% of rapes between 1991 and 1993 had been by the Bangladesh armed forces, with allegations that 80% of those raped were Jumma. According to Kabita Chakma and Glen Hill, the sexual abuse against Jumma women is endemic. During the conflict, the security forces had used a deliberate strategy of rape, torture, arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment and kidnapping against the Jumma.\n\nThe accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. Human rights violations continue with arbitrary arrests, killing and rapes occurring and human rights activists are targeted for questioning and arrests. According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. It was reported that a nine-month-old child was strangled after it was grabbed from its grandmother who the settlers raped.\n\nAs yet the Jumma peoples have not been given constitutional recognition and are known as \"backward segments of the population\"\n\nAt the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-President of Bangladesh Ziaur Rahman created a Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1962. Displaced peoples did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India. In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many natives and a significant alteration of demographics. Having constituted only 11.6% of the regional population in 1974, the number of Bengalis grew by 1991 to constitute 48.5% of the regional population.\n\nIn 1989, the government of then-president Hossain Mohammad Ershad passed the District Council Act created three tiers of local government councils to devolve powers and responsibilities to the representatives of the native peoples, but the councils were rejected and opposed by the PCJSS.\n\nPeace negotiations were initiated after the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991, but little progress was made with the government of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the Awami League, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib. The peace accord was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997.\n\nThe agreement recognised the special status of the hill residents. Chakma rebels were still in the Chittagong Hill Tracts as of 2002.\n\nChakmas also live in India's Tripura state where a Tripuri separatist insurgency is going on.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26211048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26211048", "title": "Dambana", "text": "Dambana\n\nThe dambana, in modern times, may refer to shrines of indigenous religions in the Philippines (mainly Tagalog areas), altar of Philippine churches, or monuments erected to remember Philippine history. However, before the introduction of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines, the dambana (Old Tagalog: lambana) was used as the main term for a sacred place (\"banal na pook\"), which is a home to a single deity, various deities (gods and goddesses), ancestor spirits, and beings aside from ancestor spirits and deities. Additionally, these \"dambanas\" were also traditionally called as simbahan, however, the latter's meaning was fully transformed by the Spanish in the 16th century until it only referred to 'Catholic church' by the 17th century. In traditional dambana beliefs, all deities, beings sent by Bathala, and ancestor spirits are collectively called \"anitos\". Supernatural non-anito beings are called \"lamang-lupa\" (beings of the land) or \"lamang-dagat\" (beings of the sea or other water bodies). The \"dambana\" is usually taken cared of by the \"katalonan\", the indigenous spiritual leader of the \"barangay\" (community), and to some extent, the \"datu\" (barangay political leader) and the \"lakan\" (barangay coalition political leader) as well. Initially unadorned and revered minimally, \"damabanas\" later on were filled with adornments centering on religious practices towards \"larauan\" statues due to trade and religious influences from various independent and vassal states. It is adorned with statues home to \"anitos\" traditionally-called \"larauan\", statues reserved for future burial practices modernly-called \"likha\", scrolls or documents with \"suyat\" \"baybayin\" calligraphy, and other objects sacred to \"dambana\" practices such as \"lambanog\" (distilled coconut wine), \"tuba\" (undistilled coconut wine), \"bulaklak\" or flowers (like sampaguita, santan, gumamela, tayabak, and native orchids), \"palay\" (unhusked rice), \"bigas\" (husked rice), shells, pearls, jewels, beads, native crafts such as \"banga\" (pottery), native swords and bladed weapons (such as \"kampilan\", \"dahong palay\", \"bolo\", and \"panabas\"), bodily accessories (like \"singsing\" or rings, \"kwintas\" or necklaces, and \"hikaw\" or earrings), war shields (such as \"kalasag\"), enchanted masks, battle weapons used in \"pananandata or kali\", charms called \"agimat\" or \"anting-anting\", curse deflectors such as \"buntot pagi\", native garments and embroideries, food, and gold in the form of adornments (gold belts, necklace, wrist rings, and feet rings) and barter money (\"piloncitos\" and gold rings).\n\nThe dambana can be a sacred structure built with different materials, depending on the locality, but the usual dambana structure is made from indigenous wood with nipa roofs. No metal nails are used in its construction. The wood pieces are shaped in a way that each block would stick tightly to each other. At the same time, the wood bonds are strengthened by rattan strips. Majority of these man-made \"dambana\" structures (along with the materials assigned to dambana traditions such as statues home to anitos called \"larauan\", statues reserved for burial practices in the future called \"likha\", and documents with \"baybayin\" writings and calligraphy) were unfortunately destroyed by the Spanish in the 16th century, while transforming the land where the \"dambana\" structures were built upon into Catholic cemeteries or locations for Roman Catholic churches. The purge against \"dambana\" structures and all things related to indigenous religion was continued by the Spanish until the 18th century to destroy \"Anitism\" or the indigenous religion of the Tagalog people, leaving no \"dambana\" structures left throughout areas subjugated by the Spanish Crown.\n\nIn addition, not all \"dambanas\" are house structures. Some dambanas may be traditional non-Western cemeteries (\"libingan\"), ancient ruins or old places (\"sinaunang pook\"), rivers (\"ilog\"), mountains (\"bundok\"), mounds (\"burol\"), seas (\"karagatan\"), caves (\"yungib\"), lakes (\"lawa\"), forests (\"gubat\") giant trees (\"malalaking puno\") such as \"balete\" (one of the three most sacred trees for the Tagalogs, the other two being \"kawayan\" or bamboo and \"buko\" or coconut tree), and other places known to the natural and spiritual world, except for swamps, which are called \"buhay na tubig\" (living waters) and are considered as sacred but dangerous to the Tagalog people in pre-colonial times due to the presence of life-threatening supernatural beings. The presence of these natural \"dambanas\" is one of the primary reasons why indigenous belief systems continued to exist despite the Spanish-imposed all-out destruction of \"dambana\" structures. The ethnic group that is usually associated with the dambana are the Tagalog people, although the majority of the Tagalogs have been converted into Christianity through forced religious Spanish rule between the 16th to 19th centuries. Due to this, majority of the indigenous Tagalog dambana practices have been lost, fragmented severely, or absorbed into Christian practices, such as the case in pilgrim devotion practices in Mount Makiling, which has Catholic and indigenous Tagalog practices involved. The unaltered \"dambana\" practices of the Tagalog people are similar to shrine practices in Asia, such as the shrine practices in Japan, Bali, and India.\n\n\"Dambana\" practices are performed through various means such as thanksgiving, wish prayers, or even memorializing an event. All deities, beings sent by Bathala, and ancestral spirits are collectively called \"anito\". The deity who is most invoked in \"dambana\" practices is Bathala, the supreme god of the Tagalog people who controls non-deity anitos and the tigmamanukan omens. Bathala is among the five primordial deities in the Tagalog pantheon. It is believed that he lives in an abode called \"Kaluwalhatian\" with other deities such as Amanikable, god of hunters and turbulent waters, Idiyanale, goddess of labor, Dimangan, god of good harvests, Lakapati, god/goddess of fertility and cultivated fields, Mapulon, god of seasons, Mayari, goddess of the moon, Tala, goddess of the stars, Hanan, goddess of morning, Dumakulem, god of mountains, Anitun Tabu, goddess of wind and rain, Anagolay, goddess of lost things, Apolaki, god of the sun, and Diyan Masalanta, goddess of love. Minor deities who live in Kaluwalhatian include Liwayway, a dawn goddess, Tag-ani, a harvest goddess, Kidlat, a lightning god, and Hangin, a wind god. The abode \"Kaluwalhatian\", however, is not to be associated as a place where ancestral spirits go to. The place where good ancestral spirits go to is located below the earth and is called \"Maca\", while the place where evil ancestral spirits go to is called \"Kasamaan\" (or \"Kasanaan\"), which is also below the earth. Unlike \"Kasanaan\", which is a 'village of grief and affliction', \"Maca\" is peaceful and filled with the joyous bounties good ancestral spirits deserve in the afterlife. \"Maca\" is ruled jointly by Bathala, who has the prowess to summon and order spirits from \"Maca\" (and \"Kasamaan\") if he pleases, and Sitan while \"Kasamaan\" is ruled solely by a deity named Sitan, keeper of all souls and master of four evil deities, namely, Manggagaway, causer of diseases, Manisilat, destroyer of families, Mangkukulam, causer of fires, and Hukluban, causer of deaths.\n\nDeities living with humans, and not in \"Kaluwalhatian\", \"Maca\", or \"Kasamaan\" are also known in the Tagalog pantheon of anitos. These deities include Aman Sinaya, god of oceans and one of the five primordial deities, Amihan, deity of peace and one of the five primordial deities, Sinaya, god of inventors and fisherfolks, Haik, god of calm waters, Lakambakod, god of protections, Lakambini, god of purity, food, and festivities, Lingga, god of medicine, Bibit, god of illness, Uwinan Sana, god of grasslands and forests, Melupa, crow god of the earth, Silagan, god of proper burial practices, Mananangal, goddess of fright, Bighari, goddess of rainbows, and Mankukutod, god of the coconut and direct descendant of the ashes of Ulilang Kaluluwa and Galang Kaluluwa, two of the five primordial deities.\n\nAnitos sent by Bathala to aid mankind, aside from the deities, are also called as anitos. These include Makiling, anito of Mount Makiling, and other community-based anitos. Ancestral spirits are also referred as anitos. These ancestral spirit anitos can be called upon by his or her descendants, relatives, friends, or stern followers in aid of a task. However, the approval of Bathala is needed first so that the ancestral spirit may be allowed to leave \"Maca\" and aid a person through dreams or apparitions. Popular ancestral spirits that are called upon are \"katalonans\", \"datus\", \"lakans\", expert craftsmen, and brave warriors who have passed away and are believed to have journeyed to \"Maca\" successfully.\n\nThe highest beings in Anitism are always the primordial deities, which is led by Bathala. Of these five primordial deities, only Bathala, Amihan, and Aman Sinaya are living deities. The other two, Ulilang Kaluluwa and Galang Kaluluwa, have turned into ashes during the first centuries of the cosmic creation. The next in rank are the deity anitos, whether they live in \"Kaluwalhatian\", \"Kasamaan\", or in the middle world. The third in rank are the anitos sent by Bathala to aid mankind. These anitos usually serve specific communities, and seldom spread their influence from their domain, such as the case of the anito, Makiling. Like mankind, these anitos are sometimes prone to misdeeds but are generally good. The fourth in rank are mankind's anito ancestral spirits (known as \"kaluluwa\", the second and last form of the soul). The last rank includes \"tao\" (mankind) which houses the \"kakambal\" (literally twin; the first form of soul known as the living soul who wanders when the body is asleep), \"mga hayop\" (animals), \"halaman at puno\" (plants and trees), \"lamang lupa\" (supernatural beings of the land), and \"lamang dagat\" (supernatural beings of the waters).\n\nMost of the remaining \"dambanas\" are natural, and not man-made, as majority of the man-made \"dambanas\" were completely destroyed by the Spanish during a 300-year Catholic-colonial period from the 16th century to the 19th century. However, remnants of man-made \"dambanas\" have been rediscovered since the middle of the 20th century, such as the Angono Petroglyphs in Rizal which was rediscovered in 1965 and the Limestone tombs of Kamhantik in Quezon province which was rediscovered in 2011. Other archaeological sites with traditional religious artifacts have been rediscovered in Calatagan, Batangas, Santa Ana, Manila, Bulacan, Marinduque, Cavite, and Laguna. Prominent natural \"dambanas\" include Mount Makiling, Mount San Cristobal, Mount Banahaw, Laguna de Bay, Taal Volcano and lake, the Seven Lakes of San Pablo, the southern chain of the Sierra Madre mountains, the Bathala caves of Marinduque, the Lobo mountain chain, and various falls, rivers, and bays in the southern Tagalog region and certain areas in central Luzon. Additionally, traditional Tagalogs also believe in a reappearing \"dambana\" called Mount Batala, which is Bathala's most sacred mountain and is filled with tigmamanukan omen birds. However, Bathala is said to disallow ordinary mortals from entering the realm. Additionally, some tigmamanukan omen birds living within the realm are colored 'yellow', and considered extremely sacred.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines, which is primarily governed by the Vatican, and other Christian churches are against the revitalization of \"Anitism\" since the 16th century as they view the indigenous Tagalog religion as 'less than European religions'. However, in recent years, a number of Tagalog people have reverted to Anitism, or the indigenous religion of pre-colonial Tagalogs, from colonially-imposed Roman Catholicism or other Christian religions. Today's practices are notably influenced by modernity, same as all religions in the world, due to an array of inevitable religious dynamisms. Although no expansive \"dambana\" structures have been built, natural dambanas such as Mount Makiling and Mount Banahaw are thoroughly used to preserve the ancient religion. There is no specific area in a room where the sacred \"larauan\" was placed on during the classical era, but in modern practices, the eastern areas within the house of Anitism adherents are used as dambanas through an altar form, while prayers are offered to Bathala and other Tagalog deities and anitos. One of the primary reasons for this is the influence from other Asian religions and the belief that the east represents a new morning or age (personified by Hanan), the sun (personified by Apolaki), and the moon (personified by Mayari), thus personifying Bathala, ruler of everything. Traditionally, the \"larauan\" and \"likha\" statues placed on the \"dambana\" altar inside a house \"dambana\" or outside within a natural \"dambana\" are 4-12 inches tall, 2-8 inches wide, and are made of coral stone, limestone, volcanic stone, clay, packed nipa, packed cogon, or hardwood. The \"larauan\" statues are always larger than the \"likha\" statues. Due to modern influences, some \"larauan\" statues have also been made in human sizes.\n\nMany ethnic groups throughout the Philippines have similar indigenous places of worship. Notable ethnic groups are the Bicolano people, who worship at least 18 unique gods and goddesses, along with various community anitos, the Visayan people, who worship more than 30 gods and goddesses, the T'boli people who worship more than 20 deities, the Ilokano people who worship 6, and many other ethnic groups. Each ethnic group has their own form of dambana or indigenous shrine. Majority have a shared 'mountain worship' culture.\n\n"}

{"id": "632362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=632362", "title": "Haftarah", "text": "Haftarah\n\nThe haftarah or (in Ashkenazic pronunciation) haftorah (alt. haphtara, Hebrew: הפטרה; \"parting,\" \"taking leave\", plural \"haftoros\" or \"haftorot\" is a series of selections from the books of \"Nevi'im\" (\"Prophets\") of the Hebrew Bible (\"Tanakh\") that is publicly read in synagogue as part of Jewish religious practice. The Haftarah reading follows the Torah reading on each Sabbath and on Jewish festivals and fast days. Typically, the \"haftarah\" is thematically linked to the \"parasha\" (Torah Portion) that precedes it. The \"haftarah\" is sung in a chant (known as \"trope\" in Yiddish or \"Cantillation\" in English). Related blessings precede and follow the Haftarah reading.\n\nThe origin of haftarah reading is lost to history, and several theories have been proposed to explain its role in Jewish practice, suggesting it arose in response to the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Maccabean revolt, wherein Torah reading was prohibited, or that it was \"instituted against the Samaritans, who denied the canonicity of the Prophets (except for Joshua), and later against the Sadducees.\" Another theory is that it was instituted after some act of persecution or other disaster in which the synagogue Torah scrolls were destroyed or ruined - it was forbidden to read the Torah portion from any but a ritually fit parchment scroll, but there was no such requirement about a reading from Prophets, which was then \"substituted as a temporary expedient and then remained.\" The Talmud mentions that a \"haftarah\" was read in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, who lived c.70 CE, and that by the time of Rabbah (the 3rd century) there was a \"Scroll of Haftarot\", which is not further described, and in the Christian New Testament several references suggest this Jewish custom was in place during that era.\n\nNo one knows for certain the origins of reading the haftarah, but several theories have been put forth. The most common explanation, accepted by some traditional Jewish authorities is that in 168 BCE, when the Jews were under the rule of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, they were forbidden to read the Torah and made do with a substitute. When they were again able to read the Torah, they kept reading the \"haftarah\" as well. However this theory was not articulated before the 14th century, when it was suggested by Rabbi David Abudirham, but this explanation has several weaknesses.\n\nAn alternative explanation, offered by Rabbis Reuven Margolies and Samson Raphael Hirsch (except where otherwise identified, this is the Hirsch cited throughout this article), is that the haftarah reading was instituted to fight the influence of those sects in Judaism that viewed the Hebrew Bible as consisting only of the Torah.\n\nHowever, all offered explanations for the origin of reading the haftarah have unanswered difficulties.\n\nCertainly the haftarah was read — perhaps not obligatorily nor in all communities nor on every Sabbath — as far back as circa 70 CE: The Talmud mentions that a \"haftarah\" was read in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, who lived at that time. The New Testament indicates that readings from the Prophets - but not necessarily a fixed schedule - was a common part of the Sabbath service (Luke 4:16-17; Act 13:15 & 13:27) in Jerusalem synagogues even earlier than 70 CE.\n\nOnly one person reads the haftarah portion. This differs from the procedure in Torah reading, wherein the text is divided into anywhere from three to seven portions, which may be read by one person or divided amongst several.\n\nThe haftarah is traditionally read by the \"maftir\", or the last person to be called up to the Torah scroll.\n\nTraditions varied or evolved with regard to which person could read the haftarah. As an indication that, perhaps to make clear that the haftarah reading was not the same status as the Torah reading, a minor (i.e., a boy not yet bar mitzvah age) was permitted to chant the haftarah (at least on an ordinary Sabbath), and there were even communities where the haftarah reading was reserved exclusively for minor boys. In recent centuries, when the attainment of bar mitzvah age is celebrated with a distinct ceremony, the bar mitzvah boy (now an adult) will read the \"maftir\" portion and the haftarah. In some other communities, the haftarah could only be read by one who had participated in the Torah reading (in some practices, the \"maftir\" - the last man to have read from the Torah), or even the whole congregation would read the haftarah to themselves from the available \"humashim\" - this evidently to avoid embarrassing a reader who might make a mistake.\n\nRabbi Yosef Karo (16th century) reported that for many years there were no set haftarot: the \"maftir\" chose an appropriate passage from the \"Nevi'im\". Over time, certain choices became established in certain communities; in contemporary Jewish observance one may not choose his or her own haftarah, explained Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, as that would run against accepted custom. Rabbi Karo's explanation, however, helps to explain why communities have varying customs regarding what to read as haftarah.\n\nUnlike the Torah portion, the haftarah is, nowadays, normally read from a printed book. This may be either a Tanakh (entire Hebrew Bible), a Chumash (or \"Humash\") (volume containing the Torah with haftarot) or, in the case of the festivals, the prayer book; there are also books containing the haftarot alone in large print. Even when a scroll of haftarah readings is used, that scroll - unlike the Torah scroll - may be made of paper and may include such embellishments as the vowel points and \"trope.\"\n\nHowever, according to most halakhic decisors (\"posqim\" ), it is preferable to read the haftarah out of a parchment scroll, and according to a small minority of posqim (mainly the followers of the Vilna Gaon), such a parchment scroll is an absolute requirement. This may take various forms.\n\nIt would seem that the initial resistance to using a printed book has diminished as the technology of printing, and therefore the accuracy and characteristics of the printed books, has improved. There were opinions that a haftarah scroll should not be stored in the holy ark, but other opinions (such as Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef) were that it was permitted; however the haftarah scroll is not decorated in the manner of the Torah scrolls but may be given distinctive (and inferior, such as copper) decorations.\n\nBlessings both precede and follow the haftarah reading. These blessings are derived from the minor (and uncanonical) Talmudic tractate \"Massekhet Soferim\" - also called, simply, \"Soferim\", which dates back to the 7th or 8th century CE. But it is possible that these blessings, or at least some of them, date from before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. At least some haftarah blessings were in use by the second century (Talmud Babli, \"Shabbat\" 24a). The blessings are read by the person designated to read the haftarah portion; the blessing before the haftarah is read in the tune of the haftarah. The Sephardic practice is to recite, immediately after the text of the haftarah and before the concluding blessings, the verse of Isaiah 47:4 (\"Our Redeemer! The Lord of Hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel!\"). The blessings following the haftarah are standard on all occasions the haftarah is read, except for the final blessing, which varies by date and is omitted on some days.\n\nThere are five blessings, one before, and the others after, the haftarah reading. These blessings may go back as far as the haftarah ritual itself. It will be immediately noticed that the haftarah has more, and longer, blessings than the reading of the Torah itself; it is plausible that the reading from the Prophets was given this distinction in order to emphasize the sacred nature of the Prophetic books in the face of Samaritan rejection. If the haftarah is read by the \"maftir\", then he had already recited two blessings for the Torah reading and the five haftarah blessings means he has recited a total of the significant number of seven blessings. The first blessing is not recited until the Torah scroll has been rolled shut. And, similarly, the haftarah text itself - whether a book or a scroll - remains open on the lectern until after the final haftarah blessing is concluded. The blessings have changed but only a little over the centuries, the current text apparently coming from the late 11th century \"Machzor Vitry\", with slight differences from the texts perpetuated in the tractate Massekhet Soferim (possibly 7th or 8th century), and the writings of Maimonides, dating back to the 12th century.\n\nThe first blessing, chanted before the haftarah portion read, uses the same melody as the haftarah chant itself, also in minor mode. For this reason, many prayerbooks print this first blessing with the cantillation marks used in the Bible itself for the books of the Prophets, possibly the only instance of a non-biblical text to be equipped with such marks. This initial blessing is only two verses, but both begin with blessing God, yet are not interrupted by an intervening Amen.\n\nThe blessings are as follows: The first blessing precedes the reading:\n\n<poem>Blessed are you, \"Lord\"   [YHVH], our God, King of the universe,\nWho has chosen good prophets,\nAnd was pleased with their words spoken in truth.\n\nBlessed are you, \"Lord\", who has chosen the Torah, and his servant Moses, \nAnd his people Israel,\nAnd the prophets of truth and righteousness.\n</poem>\nThis is a somewhat free translation from the very poetic Hebrew text which is the same in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic prayerbooks. This first blessing is straight from the minor tractate Massekhet Soferim, chapter 13, paragraph 7. The first verse praises God, \"who has chosen good prophets\" (presumably distinguished from false prophets not called by God), the second verse is one of the few places in the Sabbath liturgy that mentions Moses, also chosen by God as were the prophets. In this context, 'Israel' means world Jewry wherever they may be.\n\nImmediately after the last word of the haftarah has been read, many Sefardic, Mizrahi, and Italic congregations traditionally recite two Bible verses, which are then repeated by the maftir:\n<poem>Our Redeemer - \"the Lord\"   of Hosts is his name - the holy one of Israel.   [Isaiah 47:4]\nBlessed be \"the Lord\"   forever. Amen and Amen.   [Psalm 89:53] </poem><br>\n\nThe blessings that follow the reading of the haftarah are chanted in the pentatonic scale.\n\nThe second blessing follows the end of the Prophetic reading:<br>\n<poem>Blessed are you, \"Lord\", our God, King of the universe,\nRock of all the worlds, righteous through all eras,\nThe trustworthy God, who says and does, who speaks and fulfills,\nFor all his words are true and just.\n\nTrustworthy are you, \"Lord\", and trustworthy are your words,\nAnd not a single one of your words is recalled as unfulfilled,\nBecause you are God, king, trustworthy.\nBlessed are you \"Lord\", the God who is trustworthy in all his words.\n</poem>\nAgain, this is straight from Massekhet Soferim, paragraphs 8 and 10; Paragraph 9 set out a congregational response which seems not to have been adopted; after the first verse the congregation would rise and say \"Faithful are you \"Lord\" our God, and trustworthy are your words. O faithful, living, and enduring, may you constantly rule over us forever and ever.\" This response apparently was in use in antiquity - the Jews of the eastern diaspora would recite this while seated, the Jews of Eretz Yisrael would stand. This practice appears to have ceased during the Middle Ages (it is not in Amram's prayerbook of the 9th century although a phrase of it [\"Trustworthy are you \"Lord\" our God, living and enduring forever\", right after \"words are true and just\"] is in the \"Mahzor Vitry \", (ca. 1100), but in the 18th century Rabbi Jacob Emden criticized its omission. The second half of the blessing echoes Isaiah 45:23 and 55:11.\nThe third blessing follows immediately:<br>\n<poem>Be merciful to Zion, because it is the home of our life, \nAnd save the downtrodden soon, in our own days.\nBlessed are you \"Lord\", who makes glad the children of Zion [\"or\"   makes Zion to rejoice in her children].\n</poem>\nVery similar to Massekhet Soferim, paragraph 11, which begins \"Comfort   [\"Naham\", instead of \"rahaym\" ], \"Lord\"  our God, Zion your city...\"   and ends \"who comforts the children of Zion.\" Zion means Mount Zion, the hill in Jerusalem on which the Temple stood, although it had been destroyed centuries before this blessing was composed. It is possible that Mount Zion is mentioned deliberately to refute the Samaritans, who centered their devotion to Mount Gerizim instead of Mount Zion. Instead of \"save\" the downtrodden, Massekhet Soferim has \"avenge\"   [\"tenikum \", instead of \"toshiya\" ], which is used in the Yemenite version of the blessing. By the time of Amram Gaon (9th century) and Saadiah Gaon (10th century), as well as the \"Mahzor Vitry\" (ca. 1100), 'be merciful' had replaced 'comfort' - but 'avenge' was still part of the text—and into the last century was still part of both Romaniot and Yemenite versions. It has been suggested that \"save\" replaced \"avenge\" in so many communities because of Christian and Moslem censorship or intimidation.\n\nThe fourth blessing follows immediately:<br>\n<poem>Make us glad, \"Lord\"  our God,\nwith the Prophet Elijah, your servant,\nand with the kingdom of the house of David, your anointed,\nMay he arrive soon and bring joy to our hearts.\nLet no stranger sit upon his throne, \nNor let others continue to usurp his glory.\nFor you swore by your holy name that through all eternity his lamp will never go dark.\nBlessed are you \"Lord\", shield of David.\n</poem>\nThis is virtually identical to the text in Massekhet Soferim, paragraph 12, until the last line. Before the second \"Blessed are you\", Soferim contains this line (quoting Jeremiah 23:6): \"And in his days may Judah be made safe, and Israel to dwell securely, and he shall be called, \"'the Lord\"   is our vindicator'.\"   This line remained in Romaniot liturgy. Instead of \"Shield of David\", Soferim has \"who brings to fruition the mighty salvation of his people Israel.\" But by the 3rd century, \"shield of David\" was the text in use (Talmud Babli, \"Pesachim\" 117b), predating Soferim.<br>The lines \"let no stranger sit on his throne\" and \"others continue to usurp his glory\" might date back to the earliest Talmudic times, when the Hasmoneans and Herodians, rather than true descendants of the royal house of David, were rulers of the Holy Land.\n\nThe fifth (final) blessing follows immediately and is a bit longer than the previous one:\n<poem>For the Torah reading, and for the worship service, and for [the reading from] the Prophets,\nAnd for this Sabbath day [\"or\"   for this (\"holiday\" )], which you have given us, \"Lord\" our God,\nFor holiness and for respite, for honor and for splendor,\nFor all of this, \"Lord\" our God, \nWe gratefully thank you, and bless you.\nMay your name be blessed by every living mouth,\nAlways and forever.\nBlessed are you \"Lord\", who sanctifies the Sabbath.\n</poem>\nThis is from paragraph 13 of Soferim, which does not contain the phrase \"by every living mouth\", and which concludes with \"who sanctifies \"Israel and the Day of whatever \" \" (this last word to be replaced by the proper name of the holy occasion). Amram Gaon and Maimonides concluded with \"who rebuilds Jerusalem,\" but this appears to have been discarded by all factions. This final blessing is modified for the various festivals and holidays. In all traditions that last phrase, \"who sanctifies the Sabbath\", is replaced by the appropriate substitute when the occasion is something other than an ordinary Sabbath, if a holiday falling on a Sabbath the phrasing is \"And for this Sabbath day and for this day of this...\" (if not on a Sabbath, then merely \"and for this day of ...\"); e.g. (for Passover) \"Festival of Matzos\", (on Shavuous) \"Festival of Shavuous\", (on Succos) \"Festival of Succos, (on Shemini Atzeres or Simhas Torah) \"Festival of the Assembly\", (on Rosh Hashana) \"Day of Remembrance\", (on Yom Kippur) \"Day of Atonement\", - but it appears from Kol Bo (14th century) that Yom Kippur is the only fast day with a name and therefore this final blessing is not recited at all on other fast days, such as Gedaliah or Esther or Tisha B'Av, since they have no such names that can be inserted into the blessing - and then the festival version of the blessing concludes:\n<poem>\nFor all this \"Lord\" our God we thank you and praise you. \nMay your name be blessed by every living mouth, always and forever. \nBlessed are you \"Lord\", who sanctifies [the Sabbath and] Israel and the Festivals.\"\n</poem>\n\n\"And on Yom Kippur, replace the last line with\" :\n<poem>\nBlessed are you \"Lord\", \nKing over all the earth, who sanctifies [the Sabbath,] Israel, and the Day of Atonement.\n</poem>\n\nIn ancient times the haftarah, like the Torah, was translated into Aramaic as it was read, and this is still done by Yemenite Jews. The Talmud lays down that, while the Torah must be translated verse by verse, it is permissible to translate other readings (such as the Haftarah) in units of up to three verses at a time.\n\nSome generalities have been drawn from the haftarah choices, but they have exceptions. For example, that the haftarot have something in common, or some relevancy, with the Torah reading. But, for example, the relevance for the parsha \"Bamidbar\"   (Numbers 1:1-4:20) is the one word, \"wilderness\", in Hosea 12:16 (and, of course, the haftarot for special Sabbaths and holidays do not require any relation to the Torah reading for that week). Or, that the haftarah should be at least 21 verses in length, to match the minimal Torah reading (see Talmud Babli, \"Megilla\" 23a & 23b, which mentions this as a doubtful requirement), but, e.g., the haftarah for \"Ki Teitzei\"   (Deuteronomy 21:10-25:19) is, for Ashkenazim and Sephardim, only 10 verses; and the haftarah for \"Miketz\"   (Genesis 41:1-44:17) is, for Ashkenazim and Sephardim only 15 verses, and for Italic Jews only 14 verses. The Tosefta mentions a haftarah in antiquity (before the 2nd century C.E.) that was just one verse, namely Isaiah 52:3, and some others that were only four or five verses. Another, that the haftarah reading should not end on a macabre or distressing verse, and therefore either the penultimate verse is repeated at the very end or else verses from elsewhere (sometimes even from different prophetic books) are used as a coda, such as with the haftarah for \"Tzav\"   (Leviticus 6:1-8:36) (Ashkenazim and Sephardim skip ahead in the same prophet to avoid concluding with the description of the dire fate of the wicked, a total of 19 verses; Chabad and Yemenite also skip ahead to avoid concluding with a different disquieting verse, a total of 16 verses; Karaites and Romaniote go back and repeat the penultimate verse, promising the reappearance of Elijah, rather than end with the word \"desolation\" - and the same applies when everyone else reads the same passage on \"Shabbat Hagadol\" ). Among the consistent characteristics is that entire verses are read; never is only a part of a verse read.\n\nIn antiquity there was no prescribed list of haftarah readings for the year, although the Talmudic literature (including the Midrash and Tosefta) does report some recommendations for specific holidays. It would appear that, in antiquity, the choice of portion from the Prophets was made \"ad hoc\", without regard for the choice of previous years or of other congregations, either by the reader or by the congregation or its leaders; this is evidenced by recommendations in Talmudic literature that certain passages should not be chosen for haftarah readings, which indicates that, to that time, that a regular list for the year's readings did not exist. Further evidence of the lack of an ancient authoritative list of readings is the simple fact that, while the practice of reading a haftarah every Sabbath and most holy days is ubiquitous, the different traditions and communities around the world have by now adopted differing lists, indicating that no solid tradition from antiquity dictated the haftarah selections for a majority of the ordinary Sabbaths.\n\nThe \"haftarah\" is read with cantillation according to a unique melody (not with the same cantillation melody as the Torah). The tradition to read \"Nevi'im\" with its own special melody is attested to in late medieval sources, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic. A medieval Sephardic source notes that the melody for the \"haftarot\" is a slight variation of the tune used for reading the books of Nevi'im in general (presumably for study purposes), and Jews of Iraqi origin to this day preserve separate \"Neviim\" and \"Haftarah\" melodies.\n\nNote that although many selections from Nevi'im are read as \"haftarot\" over the course of the year, the books of Nevi'im are \"not\" read in their entirety (as opposed to the Torah). Since Nevi'im as a whole is not covered in the liturgy, the melodies for certain rare cantillation notes which appear in the books of Nevi'im but not in the \"haftarot\" have been forgotten. For more on this, see Nevi'im.\n\nAs a generality, although the Torah was chanted in a major key (ending in a minor key), the haftarah is chanted in a minor key (as is the blessing before the reading of the haftarah) and ends in a pentatonic mode (and the blessings following the haftarah reading are also pentatonic).\n\nThe Haftarot for the morning of Tisha b'Av, and for the Shabbat preceding it, are, in many synagogues, predominantly read to the cantillation melody used for the public reading of the Book of Lamentations, or \"Eicha.\"\n\nLeonard Bernstein employed the Haftarah cantillation melody extensively as a theme in the second movement (\"Profanation\") of his Symphony No. 1 (\"Jeremiah\").\n\nSome Rishonim, including \"Rabbenu\" Yaakov Tam, report that a custom in the era of the Talmud was to read a haftarah at the \"mincha\" service each Sabbath afternoon — but that this haftarah was from the \"Ketuvim\" rather than from the \"Nevi'im\". Most halachic authorities maintain that that was not the custom in Talmudic times, and that such a custom should not be followed. In the era of the Geonim, some communities, including some in Persia, read a passage from \"Nevi'im\" (whether or not in the form of a haftarah) Sabbath afternoons. Although this practice is virtually defunct, most halachic authorities maintain that there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nRabbi Reuven Margolies claims that the now-widespread custom of individuals' reciting Psalm 111 after the Torah reading Sabbath afternoon derives from the custom reported by \"Rabbenu\" Tam. Louis Ginzberg makes the analogous claim for the custom of reciting Psalm 91 in \"Motza'ei Shabbat\".\n\nIn many communities the \"haftarah\" is read by a Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah at his or her respective ceremonies, along with some, all, or, sometimes none of the Torah portion. This is often referred to, mainly in Hebrew schools and \"bar\" preparatory programs, as a \"haftarah portion\".\n\nThe reading of the \"haftarah\" by the Bar Mitzvah is a relatively new custom, since it is not derived from either Bible nor Talmud. According to the Talmud, the lesson from the Prophets may be read by a minor (i.e., a boy younger than 13), if he is sufficiently educated to do it. A tradition that might have dated back to medieval times was that a boy would read the \"haftarah\" on the Sabbath \"prior\" to his Bar Mitzvah, and on the day of his Bar Mitzvah read the portion from the Torah but not the \"haftarah\"; this custom changed, in the United States, in the late 19th century or early 20th century, when the Bar Mitzvah would read both the Torah and \"haftarah\" on the Sabbath immediately following his 13th birthday. The custom of the Bar Mitzvah reading the \"haftarah\" is so recent that the appropriate procedure for a \"haftarah\" reading when two boys are Bar Mitzvah on the same day is still unresolved.\n\nThe selections of haftarot readings for the various weeks, and holy days, of the year differs from tradition to tradition - Ashkenazic from Sefardic from Yemenite from Mizrachi, etc. And even within a tradition there is no one authoritative list, but a multitude of different lists from different communities and congregations, usually differing from each other by only one or two haftarot. A study of the antiquity of each of these lists, and how they differ from each other, is beyond the scope of this (or any other brief) article but may be most informative on the history (including the contacts and separations) of the various communities.\n\nThe selection from \"Nevi'im\" [the Prophets] read as the \"haftarah\" is not always the same in all Jewish communities. When customs differ, this list indicates them as follows: \"A\"=Ashkenazic custom (\"AF\"=Frankfurt am Main; \"AH\"=Chabad; \"AP\"= Poland); \"I\"=Italian custom; \"S\"=Sephardic and Mizrahi custom (\"SM\"=Maghreb [North Africa]; \"SZ\"= Mizrahi [Middle and Far East]); \"Y\"=Yemenite custom; \"R\"=Romaniote (Byzantine, eastern Roman empire, extinct) custom; and \"K\"=Karaite custom. In some instances \"Isr.Wikip\" = the Israeli version of Wikipedia (in Hebrew) of this article had different readings in its list. In several instances, authorities did not agree on the readings of various communities.\n\nBecause, in the Diaspora, certain holy days and festivals are observed for an additional day, which day is not so observed in Eretz Yisrael, sometimes different haftarot are read simultaneously inside and outside Eretz Yisrael.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, on the dates below, the haftarot below are read, even if that entails overriding the haftarah <br> for a Sabbath Torah portion. However, in certain communities, the first two haftarot below <br> (that for Rosh Hodesh and that for the day preceding Rosh Hodesh) are replaced by the regular <br> weekly haftarah when the weekly reading is \"Masei\"   (occurring in mid-summer) or later.<br> Some of these occasions also have specific Torah readings, which (for A and S) are noted parenthetically. <br>\n\n<br>\n[The holidays and special Sabbaths are listed in their usual sequence during the year, starting with \"Rosh Hashanah\" ]\n    (not an actual haftarah) some A repeat the reading of Lamentations, ending with a repeat of verse 5:21; some S read the entire Book of Job\n\nIt was customary in many communities to read Isaiah 61:10 - 62:8  (Italic would read 61:9 - 62:9)   if a bridegroom (who had married within the previous week) was present in the synagogue.<br>\nCustoms varied:\n\nWhen a Talmudically specified haftarah was to be read on a certain Sabbath (e.g., on Sabbath of Hanukkah), some communities <br>        did not read the bridegroom's haftarah, preferring to keep to the standard haftarah of the week. Again, customs varied:\nNowadays, this custom has virtually disappeared. No one reads a special haftarah for a bridegroom any longer, except the Karaites and perhaps intensely Orthodox congregations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2866262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2866262", "title": "Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor", "text": "Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor\n\nThe Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor was an initiatic occult organisation that first became public in late 1894, although according to an official document of the order it began its work in 1870. According to this document, authored by Peter Davidson, the order was established by Max Theon, who when in England was initiated as a Neophyte by \"an adept of the serene, ever-existing and ancient Order of the original H. B. of L.\" \n\nThe Order's relation, if any, with the mysterious \"Brotherhood of Luxor\" that Helena Blavatsky spoke of is not clear.\n\nTheon thus became Grand Master of the Exterior Circle of the Order. However, apart from his initiatory role, he seems to have little to do with the day to day running of the order, or of its teachings. He seems to have left these things to Peter Davidson, who was the Provincial Grand Master of the North (Scotland), and later also the Eastern Section (America). \n\nThe order's teachings drew heavily from the magico-sexual theories of Paschal Beverly Randolph, who influenced groups such as the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) (later headed by Aleister Crowley) (Greenfield 1997) although it is not clear whether or not Randolph himself was actually a part of the Order.\n\nPrior to the rise of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1888 the HBoL was the only order that taught practical occultism in the Western Mystery Tradition. Among its members were a number of occultists, spiritualists, and Theosophists. Initial relations between the Order and the Theosophical Society were cordial, with most members of the order also prominent members of the T.S. \n\nLater there was a falling out, as the Order was opposed to the eastern-based teachings of the later Blavatsky (Davidson considered that Blavatsky had fallen under the influence of \"a greatly inferior Order, belonging to the Budhist [sic] Cult\"). Conversely, the conviction in 1883 of the Secretary of the Order, Thomas Henry Burgoyne for fraud, was claimed by the Theosophists to show the immorality of the Order.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "232343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232343", "title": "Hong Xiuquan", "text": "Hong Xiuquan\n\nHong Xiuquan (洪秀全) (1 January 1814 – 1 June 1864), born Hong Huoxiu and with the courtesy name Renkun, was a Hakka Chinese leader of the Taiping Rebellion against the Qing Dynasty. He established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom over varying portions of southern China, with himself as the \"Heavenly King\" and self-proclaimed brother of Jesus Christ.\n\nHong Xiuquan (洪秀全), born \"Hong Huoxiu\", was the third and youngest son of a poor Hakka family. Some sources claim his family was \"well to do\". He was born in Fuyuan Springs, Hua county (now part of Huadu District, Guangzhou), Guangdong to Hong Jingyang, a farmer and elected headman, and Madam Wang. He and his family moved to Guanlubu Village shortly after his birth. Upon marrying his wife Lai Xiying, Hong received the courtesy name \"Renkun.\"\n\nHong showed an interest in scholarship at an early age, so his family made financial sacrifices to provide a formal education for him, in the hope that he could one day complete all of the civil service examinations. Hong began studying at a primary school in his village at the age of five. He was able to recite the Four Books after five or six years. He then took the local xiucai preliminary civil service examinations and placed first. A few years later, he traveled to the nearby city of Guangzhou to take the imperial examinations. He was unsuccessful and, his parents being unable to afford to continue his education, he was forced to return to agricultural work. The next year, he accompanied a wealthy schoolmate elsewhere for a year of study and became a village schoolteacher upon his return.\n\nIn 1836, at the age of 22, Hong returned to Guangzhou to retake the imperial examinations. While in Guangzhou, Hong heard Edwin Stevens, a foreign missionary, and his interpreter preaching about Christianity. From them, Hong received a set of pamphlets entitled \"Good Words for Exhorting the Age\", which were written by Liang Fa, Stevens's assistant, and contained excerpts from the Bible along with homilies and other material prepared by Liang. Supposedly, Hong only briefly looked over these pamphlets and did not pay much attention to them at the time. Unsurprisingly, he again failed the imperial examinations, which had a pass rate of less than one percent.\n\nIn 1837, Hong attempted and failed the imperial examinations for a third time, leading to a nervous breakdown. He was delirious for days and his family feared for his life. While convalescing, Hong dreamt that he visited Heaven and discovered that he possessed a celestial family distinct from his earthly family, which included a heavenly father, mother, elder brother, sister-in-law, wife, and son. His heavenly father, wearing a black dragon robe and high-brimmed hat with a long golden beard, lamented that men were worshiping demons rather than him and presented Hong with a sword and golden seal with which to slay the demons infesting Heaven. Hong dreamt that he did so with the help of his celestial older-brother and a heavenly army. The father figure later informed Hong that his given name violated taboos and must be changed, suggesting as one option the \"Hong Xiuquan\" moniker ultimately adopted by Hong. In later embellishments, Hong would declare that he also saw Confucius being punished by Hong's celestial father for leading the people astray. His acquaintances would later claim that after awakening from his dreams Hong became more careful, friendly, and open, while his pace became imposing and firm and his height and size increased. Hong stopped studying for the imperial examinations and sought work as a teacher. For the next several years Hong taught at several schools around the area of his hometown.\n\nIn 1843, Hong failed the imperial examinations for the fourth and final time. It was only then, prompted by a visit by his cousin, that Hong took time to carefully examine the Christian pamphlets he had received. After reading these pamphlets, Hong came to believe that they had given him the key to interpreting his visions: his celestial father was God the Father (whom he identified with Shangdi from Chinese tradition), the elder brother that he had seen was Jesus Christ, and he had been directed to rid the world of demon worship. This interpretation led him to conclude that he was the literal son of God and younger brother to Jesus. In contrast to some of the later leaders of his movement, Hong appears to have genuinely believed in his ascent to Heaven and divine mission. After coming to this conclusion Hong began destroying idols and enthusiastically preaching his interpretation of Christianity. As a symbolic gesture to purge China of Confucianism, he and the cousin asked for two giant swords, three \"chi\" (about 1 metre) long and nine \"jin\" (about 4.5 kg), called the \"demon-slaying swords\" (斬妖劍), to be forged.\n\nHong began by burning all Confucian and Buddhist statues and books in his house, and began preaching to his community about his visions. Some of his earliest converts were relatives of his who had also failed their examinations and belonged to the Hakka minority, Feng Yunshan and Hong Rengan. He collaborated with them to destroy holy statues in small villages, to the ire of local citizens and officials. Hong and his converts' acts were considered sacrilegious and they were persecuted by Confucians who forced them to leave their positions as village tutors. In April 1844, Hong, Feng Yunshan, and two other relatives of Hong left Hua county to travel and preach. They first journeyed to Guangzhou and preached in the outlying areas before heading northwest to White Tiger Village. There, Hong and Feng Yunshan split off and traveled some 250 miles to the southwest to the village of Sigu, Guiping county, Guangxi, where distant relatives of Hong's resided, including two early converts who had returned home. It is in or near Sigu that Hong begins to draft \"Exhortations to Worship the One True God,\" his first substantial work. In November 1844, after having preached in Guangxi for five months, Hong returned home without Feng and resumed his previous job as a village teacher, while continuing to write religious tracts.\n\nIn 1847, Hong Xiuquan was invited by a member of the Chinese Union to study with the American Southern Baptist missionary, Reverend Issachar Jacox Roberts. Hong accepted and traveled to Guangzhou with his cousin Hong Rengan. Once there, Hong studied Karl Gützlaff's translations of the Old and New Testaments and requested to be baptized by Roberts. Roberts refused to do so, possibly due to Hong being tricked by the other converts into requesting monetary aid from Roberts. Hong left Guangzhou on July 12, 1847 to search for Feng Yunshan. Although robbed of all of his possessions, including his demon-slaying sword, by bandits in the town of Meizixun, he eventually reached Thistle Mountain on August 27, 1847. There, he reunited with Feng and discovered the Society of God-Worshippers Feng had founded.\n\nIn January 1848, Feng Yunshan was arrested and banished to Guangdong, and Hong Xiuquan left for Guangdong shortly thereafter to once again reunite with Feng. In Feng and Hong's absence, Yang Xiuqing and Xiao Chaogui emerged to lead the God Worshippers. Both claimed to enter trances which allowed them to speak as a member of the Trinity; God the Father in the case of Yang and Jesus Christ in the case of Xiao. When Hong and Feng returned in the summer of 1849, they investigated Yang and Xiao's claims and declared them to be genuine. Hong administered to the faithful in outdoor meetings strongly resembling the Baptist tent revivals he had witnessed with Issachar Roberts.\n\nMost of Hong Xiuquan's knowledge of the scriptures came from the books known as \"Good Words to Admonish the Age\" by the Chinese preacher Liang Fa and a localized Bible translated into Chinese. Many Western missionaries grew jealous of Hong and his local ministry. These missionaries were fond of spreading rumors about him, one such rumor being that he had not been baptized (Hong and his cousin were in fact both baptized according to the way prescribed in the pamphlet \"Good words to admonish the age\").\n\nIn 1847, Hong began his translation and adaptation of the Bible, what came to be known as \"Authorized Taiping Version of the Bible, or \"The Taiping Bible\", which he based on Gutzlaff's translation. He presented his followers with the Bible as a vision of the authentic religion that had existed in ancient China before it was wiped out by Confucius and the imperial system. The deity of the Old Testament punished evil nations and rewarded those who followed his commandments, even music, food, and marriage laws. \n\nHong made some minor changes in the text, such as correcting misprints and improving the prose style, but adapted the meaning elsewhere to fit his own theology and moral teachings. For instance, in Genesis 27:25 the Israelites did not drink wine, and in Genesis 38:16-26 he omitted the sexual relations between the father and his son's widow. Hong preached a mixture of communal utopianism, evangelism, and Christianity. While proclaiming sexual equality, the sect segregated men from women and encouraged all its followers to pay their assets into a communal treasury.\n\nWhen Hong returned to Guangxi, he found that Feng Yunshan had accumulated a following of around 2,000 converts. Guangxi was a dangerous area at this time with many bandit groups based in the mountains and pirates on the rivers. Perhaps due to these more pressing concerns, the authorities were largely tolerant of Hong and his followers. However, the instability of the region meant that Hong's followers were inevitably drawn into conflict with other groups, not least because of their predominately Hakka ethnicity. There are records of numerous incidents when local villages and clans, as well as groups of pirates and bandits, came into conflict with the authorities, and responded by fleeing to join Hong's movement. The rising tension between the sect and the authorities was probably the most important factor in Hong's eventual decision to rebel.\n\nBy 1850 Hong had between 10,000 and 30,000 followers. The authorities were alarmed at the growing size of the sect and ordered them to disperse. A local force was sent to attack them when they refused, but the imperial troops were routed and a deputy magistrate killed. A full-scale attack was launched by government forces in the first month of 1851, in what came to be known as the Jintian Uprising, named after the town of Jintian (present-day Guiping, Guangxi) where the sect was based. Hong's followers emerged victorious and beheaded the Manchu commander of the government army. Hong declared the founding of the \"Heavenly Kingdom of Transcendent Peace\" on 11 January 1851.\nDespite this evidence of planning, Hong and his followers faced immediate challenges. The local Green Standard Army outnumbered them ten to one, and had recruited the help of the river pirates to keep the rebellion contained to Jintian. After a month of preparation the rebels managed to break through the blockade and fight their way to the town of Yongan (not to be confused with Yong'an), which fell to them on 25 September 1851.\n\nHong and his troops remained in Yongan for three months, sustained by local landowners who were hostile to the Manchu-ruled Qing Dynasty. The imperial army regrouped and launched another attack on the rebels in Yongan. Having run out of gunpowder, Hong's followers fought their way out by sword, and made for the city of Guilin, to which they laid siege. However, the fortifications of Guilin proved too strong, and Hong and his followers eventually gave up and set out northwards, towards Hunan. Here, they encountered an elite militia created by a local member of the gentry specifically to put down peasant rebellions. The two forces fought at Soyi Ford on 10 June 1852 where the rebels were forced into retreat, and 20% of their troops were killed. However, in March 1853, Hong's forces managed to take Nanjing and turned it into the capital of their movement.\n\nAfter establishing his capital at Nanjing Hong implemented an ambitious programme of reforms. He created an elaborate civil bureaucracy, reformed the calendar used in his kingdom, outlawed opium use, and introduced a number of reforms designed to make women more socially equal to men. Hong ruled by making frequent proclamations from his Heavenly Palace, demanding strict compliance with various moral and religious rules. Most trade was suppressed, and some communal land ownership was introduced. Polygamy was forbidden and men and women were separated, although Hong and other leaders maintained groups of concubines.\n\nYang Xiuqing, also known as the \"East King\", was a fellow Taiping leader who had directed successful military campaigns and who often claimed to speak with the voice of God. Hong became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions and his network of spies. In 1856, he and others in the Taiping élite had Yang and his family murdered in a purge that spiralled out of control, resulting in the further purge of its main perpetrator Wei Changhui.\n\nFollowing a failed attempt by the Taiping rebels to take Shanghai in 1860, Qing government forces, aided by Western officers, slowly gained ground.\n\nIn the spring of 1864, Nanjing was besieged and dangerously low on food supplies. Hong's solution was to order his subjects to eat manna, which had been translated into Chinese as sweetened dew and a medicinal herb. Hong himself gathered weeds from the grounds of his palace, which he then ate. Hong fell ill in April 1864, possibly due to his ingestion of the weeds, and died on June 1, 1864. Although Hong likely died of his illness, suicide by poison has also been suggested. He was buried in a yellow-silk shroud without a coffin in the bare ground, per Taiping custom., near the former Ming Imperial Palace, He was succeeded by his teenage son, Hong Tianguifu.\n\nOn July 30, 1864, Qing forces exhumed, beheaded, and burned his body. His body was later exhumed on orders of Zeng Guofan to verify his death, and then cremated. Hong's ashes were later blasted out of a cannon in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising. The Taiping Rebellion was suppressed by Qing forces later in 1864.\n\n\nThe following poem, titled \"Poem on Executing the Evil and Preserving the Righteous\" (斬邪留正詩), written in 1837 by Hong, illustrates his religious thinking and goal that later led to the establishment of the \"Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping\". Note that in the seventh line, the name of the then yet-to-come kingdom is mentioned.\n\nViews and opinions on Hong differ greatly. The Communists under Mao Zedong generally admired Hong and his movement as a legitimate peasant uprising that anticipated their own. Sun Yat-sen came from the same area as Hong and was said to have identified with Hong since his childhood days.\n\nIn 1959, the People's Republic of China established a small museum, Hong Xiuquan's Former Residence Memorial Museum (洪秀全故居紀念館), in his birthplace, where there is a longan tree planted by him. The museum's plate is written by the famous literary figure Guo Moruo (1892–1978). The residence and Book Chamber Building were renovated in 1961.\n\nThere has been an active academic debate on the degree to which Hong is similar or dissimilar to Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi. Scholars that promote the opinion that a strong similarity exists between Li and Hong note that both rallied a large number of people behind a religious or spiritual cause in order to challenge the \"status quo\". Scholars disputing a close relationship note that Li's political intentions are debatable.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53066878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53066878", "title": "Indochristian art", "text": "Indochristian art\n\nIndochristian art, or arte indocristiano, is a type of Latin American art that combines European colonial influences with Indigenous artistic styles and traditions.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonization of the Americas, Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian monks extensively converted indigenous peoples to Christianity, introducing them to European arts and aesthetics. The arts of this period reflect a fusion of European and indigenous religious beliefs, aesthetics, and artistic traditions.\n\nThe term Indochristian art was coined by Constantino Reyes-Valerio, a scholar of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture and arts, in his book, \"Indochristian Art, Sculpture and Painting of 16th Century Mexico\". Reyes-Valerio's work focused on the painting and sculpture of churches and monasteries in New Spain, but had broader implications for the analysis of art throughout Latin America.\n\nThe term \"indochristian art\" was coined by Constantino Reyes-Valerio in his 1978 work, \"Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México\"\".\" This work was followed by an analysis of indochristian mural painting, and the two books were re-published in combined form in 2000. In this work, Reyes-Valerio defines indochristian art as art that is indigenous in its production but Christian in its themes, using the term as a designation for artwork that blended symbolic elements of Christian and pre-Hispanic cultures. An expert in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture, Reyes-Valerio focuses his studies on art produced in monastic settings in New Spain, primarily examining sculptures and paintings that ornament monasteries and convents, and identifying iconographic connections to earlier indigenous works.\n\nReyes-Valerio's coinage of the term indochristian art was based on his 45 years of experience studying pre-Columbian and colonial monuments throughout Mexico. In tracing the indigenous influence on colonial art, Reyes-Valerio relies primarily on close analysis of artistic details and motifs, a process he calls “speaking to the art”, but supports this analysis with documentary sources such as the journals of Augustinian, Franciscan, and Dominican friars.\n\nReyes-Valerio not only discusses indigenous artistic production, but ties this art to the educational systems created by European monks. He argues that the use of traditional native religious imagery by Indian artists is a form of rebellion intended to keep their traditions alive. \n\nAlthough the significance of Reyes-Valerio's contribution to the identification of indigenous iconography within colonial monastic art is widely recognized, a number of art historians have criticized the implications of the word \"indochristian\" as well as Reyes-Valerio's analysis of the cultural context in which the art was produced.\n\nIn the book, \"Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power,\" Stefanie Wickstrom argues against the use of the term \"indochristian\". Wickstrom claims that the term oversimplifies colonial monastic art and the intentions of the artists by categorizing each element as either Indian or Christian in symbolism, failing to account for the evolution of a mestizo art form as Christian symbolism made contact with new cultures and evolved.\n\nOthers have objected to Reyes-Valerio's discussion of colonization; in discussing the colonization of New Spain, Reyes-Valerio makes the controversial claim that the spiritual conquest of Europeans over indigenous people was more damaging than the armed conquest. Further, in his descriptions of the interactions between monks and indigenous people, Reyes-Valerio focuses primarily on the psychological harm done to the indigenous people as they lost their ancestral religious beliefs, and tends to overlook the physical harm inflicted upon them by Christian leaders. \n\nThroughout the twentieth century, there were a number of movements to re-evaluate the role of indigenous peoples in creation of Latin American national identities. In Mexico following the revolution, the Indigenismo movement placed increased value on indigenous culture and historical significance. This shift was reflected in a shift in art historian’s attitudes towards indigenous art and aesthetics. These influences on colonial art had largely been overlooked up until this point.\n\nRecognition of indigenous artistic influences varied widely, with art historians only gradually recognizing the existence of an indigenous influence on Mexican colonial art. In 1939, Agustin Velazquez Chavez described the art of New Spain as the product of a mixing of Indian and Spanish cultures in conflict, placing special significance on the “Mexican” nature of this entwining of cultures. In describing the Churrigueresque art of Mexico, Miguel Toussaint used the term “mestizo,” recognizing the participation of Indigenous people in the art of colonial Mexico.\n\nThe term “Tequitqui” was created by Jose Moreno Villa to categorize artistic works with a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous elements. With this term, which in Nahuatl means “tributary,” Moreno Villa drew a comparison between the art of colonial Mexico and the Mudéjar art of Muslims in Spain during the Reconquista. Tequitqui was the first term used specifically to identify art combining colonial and indigenous influences, however, Moreno Villa limited its application to works in which the indigenous artist represents atavistic religious symbols. In later works Moreno Villa elaborates on his interpretation of Mexican colonial art, stating that the indigenous contribution to the genre was limited to the non-Christian deities represented, while claiming that the artistic style of colonial artworks was not tied to indigenous artistic traditions.\n\nAlthough the term \"indochristian art\" was originally only used to describe Mexican monastic sculpture and murals, by definition, it applies to any art that is created by indigenous artists and contains Christian themes. It can be applied to a wide variety of artistic traditions from colonial Latin America. The term becomes increasingly difficult to apply to art in the late colonial and post-colonial periods, however, as it relies upon a clearly defined opposition between indigenous artist and Euro-Christian themes. The way that indochristian art is defined overlooks the entanglement of Native and European identities and the mixing of cultures that gradually developed throughout Latin America.\n\nReligious artworks from colonial Latin America often demonstrate indochristian influence in a variety of ways. Indochristian art often includes depictions of atavistic deities and religious symbols, hieroglyphs, figures with indigenous features and traditional indigenous dress, and native flora and fauna. In addition, it may use traditional artistic styles of representation.\n\nIn the early years of colonization, art was primarily commissioned by the church. As Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries attempted to convert the native populations of the Americas, their techniques varied widely, but frequently involved threats of violence. Missionaries generally attempted to eliminate indigenous culture, converting native people not only to Christianity, but also to European social practices.\n\nMuch Latin American monastic art of the colonial period could be designated as indochristian. Murals, paintings, architectural designs, sculptures, and ornamental objects all were frequently created by native craftspeople and incorporated indigenous iconography.\n\nThe Cuzco School was an artistic tradition associated with Cusco, Peru. Following the Spanish conquest of the Incan empire, a group of Spanish religious artists were sent to Cusco to aid in the conversion of Inca people to Catholicism. This group of artists began a school, teaching Quechua and mestizo people to draw and use oil paints according to European styles.Based on pre-columbian artistic traditions, Cusqueño painters created artworks anonymously and included native flora and fauna in their works. They also created a tradition of painting Inca monarchs – a departure from Christian religious themes and an expression of cultural pride.\n\nÁngel arcabucero is a genre of painting tied to the Cuzco school. These paintings depict angels holding an arquebus, or early firearm, and dressed in clothing reminiscent of that worn by Andean nobility. These angels are believed to be connected to pre-Hispanic winged warriors.\n\nMonja Coronada (Crowned nun) is a genre of portrait paintings common among Mexican convents. These commemorative portraits of nuns wearing bridal clothes and floral crowns were common in the 18th century. From a Euro-Christian perspective, the nuns' bridal trappings allude to the Virgin Mary crowned, symbolizing mystical marriage to God and victory over sin. This Christian symbolism is, however, combined with Mesoamerican imagery; the paintings frequently replace the traditional European palm frond with a Mesoamerican flower staff, and ornament the crown with flowers according to traditional flower art practices. In addition, the bird and butterfly imagery that is frequently included in crowned nun portraits may symbolize indigenous beliefs regarding the soul and the afterlife.\n"}

She has presented three television series for the BBC and has opened her own retail outlet in London selling baked goods.\n\nPascale was born to African-Caribbean parents in Hackney at The Mothers' Hospital and was fostered shortly after she was born. She was adopted at 18 months old and brought up in Oxfordshire by an ethnically English family. When her adoptive parents divorced when she was three years old, Pascale remained with her mother, who subsequently became ill. At this point, at age seven, she was fostered to more than one family, with differing degrees of 'fit'. Eventually she returned to her mother. She won a full scholarship given by the Buttle Trust and so was educated at a boarding school in Devon.\n\nPascale has an elder adoptive brother and a half-sister (her adoptive father had a daughter after the divorce). She knows her biological parents' identity and their four other children, but she does not wish to re-establish contact.\n\nPascale was married to Polish musician Count Kazimierz Balinski-Jundzill and the couple had a daughter, actress Ella Balinska. The couple separated in 2000 and subsequently divorced.\n\nAt age 16, Pascale was spotted as potential model by the agent who had found Naomi Campbell. Based in New York, she achieved recognition as the first black British model to appear on the cover of American \"Elle\". She appeared in the 1998 \"Sports Illustrated\" swimsuit issue, and featured as one of the 'Bond Girls' in Robbie Williams \"Millennium\" video.\n\nPascale recognised the need to ensure her future after modelling and embarked on a series of career \"try-outs\", including hypnotherapy and car mechanics. She took a diploma cookery course at Leith's School of Food and Wine in 2005 and found that cookery fitted her \"like a pair of old jeans\". After gaining her diploma, she did a series of 'stages' in some London restaurants but, realising that restaurant hours would not suit her, Pascale established herself as a specialist cakemaker, with a contract with Selfridges. Her introduction to Selfridges was at the suggestion of chef Marco Pierre White and in 2008 and 2010 she supplied the London store with over 1000 Christmas cakes. Pascale has opened her own cupcake shop in Covent Garden. She also studied Culinary Arts at Thames Valley University (now University of West London) and in March 2012 graduated with a first class degree.\n\nIn 2015, Pascale said she practises Transcendental Meditation to relax after work.\n\nIn January 2011, Pascale presented a television bakery programme in 2011, \"Baking Made Easy\", on BBC television and published a bakery book based upon this series. Later that year, a second series, \"Home Cooking Made Easy\", was broadcast in September and October, with an accompanying book. A \"Last Minute Christmas\" programme aired on BBC Two on 22 December 2011. A third book was published in 2012 and a series based upon it, called \"Fast, Fresh & Easy Food\", aired in August and September 2012 on BBC Two.\n\nSince January 2014, Pascale co-presents and judges the UK version of \"My Kitchen Rules\" with Jason Atherton on Sky Living. In early 2014, it was announced that Pascale was to host a new six-part television series called \"Lorraine Pascale: How to be a Better Cook\" that would air later in the year on BBC Two.

The remote occasion lacks these elements. All theologians are agreed that there is no obligation to avoid the remote occasions of sin both because this would, practically speaking, be impossible and because they do not involve serious danger of sin.\n\nThe proximate occasion may be necessary, that is, such as a person cannot abandon or get rid of. Whether this impossibility be physical or moral does not matter for the determination of the principles hereinafter to be laid down. A proximate occasion may be deemed necessary when it cannot be given up without grave scandal or loss of good name or without notable temporal or spiritual damage. \n\nIt may be voluntary, within the competency of one to remove. Moralists distinguish between a proximate occasion which is continuous and one which, whilst it is unquestionably proximate, yet confronts a person only at intervals. Someone who is in the presence of a proximate occasion at once voluntary and continuous is bound to remove it. \n\nIn confession, a refusal on the part of a penitent to do so would make it imperative for the confessor to deny absolution. It is not always necessary for the confessor to await the actual performance of this duty before giving absolution; he may be content with a sincere promise, which is the minimum to be required.\n\nIn root cause analysis the occasion of sin is identical to the idea of \"set-up factors\", i,e, situations in which it is likely for a person to perform dysfunctionally. In the nuclear industry community there is a set of ideas called \"Event Free tools\" that includes the idea of avoiding \"Error Likely Situations\", which are also called \"Human Error Precursors.\" \n\nIn social counseling there is the acronymic advice, HALT (Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?) relating to situations in which judgment is impaired. These may be regarded as \"occasions of sin.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "6199207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6199207", "title": "Religion in Cuba", "text": "Religion in Cuba\n\nCuba's prevailing religion is Christianity, primarily Roman Catholicism, although in some instances it is profoundly modified and influenced through syncretism. A common syncretic religion is Santería, which combined the Yoruba religion of the African slaves with Catholicism and some Native American strands; it shows similarities to Brazilian Umbanda and has been receiving a degree of official support.\nThe Roman Catholic Church estimates that 60 percent of the population is Catholic, but only 5% of that 60% attends mass regularly, while independent sources estimate that as few 1.5% of the population does so.\n\nMembership in Protestant churches is estimated to be 5 percent and includes Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Methodists, Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and Lutherans. In recent decades Cuba has seen a rapid growth of Evangelical Protestants: \"Cuba’s Christians have thrived despite the island’s politics and poverty. Their improbable, decades-long revival is often described as being rivaled only by China’s. “It’s incredible. People just come on their own, looking for God,” says a Western Baptist leader.\" Other Christian denominations include the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). \n\nNon-Christian minority religions in Cuba include Hinduism and Chinese folk religion, which each account for 0.2% of the population, as well as the Bahá'í Faith, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, and Neoreligions, which all have non-negligible numbers of followers accounting for less than 0.1% of Cuba's population. In addition to the above, 18.0% of Cubans declared themselves to be agnostic and 5.1% claimed to be atheists.\n\nCuba is home to a variety of syncretic religions of largely African cultural origin. According to a US State Department report, some sources estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population consults with practitioners of religions with West African roots, such as Santeria or Yoruba. Santería developed out of the traditions of the Yoruba, one of the African peoples who were imported to Cuba during the 16th through 19th centuries to work on the sugar plantations. Santería blends elements of Christianity and West African beliefs and as such made it possible for the slaves to retain their traditional beliefs while appearing to practice Catholicism. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (Our Lady Of Charity) is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and is greatly revered by the Cuban people and seen as a symbol of Cuba. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess Ochún. The important religious festival \"La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre\" is celebrated by Cubans annually on 8 September. Other religions practised are Palo Monte, and Abakuá, which have large parts of their liturgy in African languages.\n\nAlthough restrictions on religion in Cuba were minimal compared to other communist nations like the Soviet Union or China, the large atheist population was most likely caused by the communist atmosphere of Marxist-Leninist atheism.\n\nAfter the communist revolution of 1959, the government of Cuba restricted religious practice. Religious people were not allowed to join the Cuban Communist Party due to religion being contradictory to the party's Marxist philosophy. In August 1960, several bishops signed a joint pastoral letter condemning communism and declaring it incompatible with Catholicism, and calling on Catholics to reject it. Castro gave a four-hour speech the next day, condemning priests who serve \"great wealth\" and using fears of Falangist influence to attack Spanish born priests, declaring \"There is no doubt that Franco has a sizeable group of fascist priests in Cuba.\"\n\nHowever, the stance of the Cuban Communist Party has shifted. Raúl Castro said in a 2015 televised news conference in which he discussed Pope Francis's September 2015 visit, \"I am from the Cuban Communist Party that doesn't allow believers, but now we are allowing it. It's an important step.\" Castro indicated he might return to being a practicing Catholic and that he would attend the Masses that the pope celebrates in Cuba.\n\nStudies appeared that attempted to link Afro-Cuban religions with mental illness. The campaign for the eradication of racial discrimination in Cuba was (and still is) used as grounds to forbid the creation of Afro-Cuban institutions, because doing so was labelled as racially divisive.\n\nPastor Clara Rodes Gonzalez claims \"we suffered discrimination in the schools and at work.\"\n\nThe decade following the 1960s was turbulent, and many people lost interest in religion because much of the religious hierarchy opposed the popular revolution. The Archdiocese of Havana in 1971 reported only 7000 baptisms. In 1989 this figure had increased to 27,609 and in 1991 to 33,569.\n\nIn 1985 the Council of State in Havana published a best-selling book called \"Fidel y la Religion\", which was the condensed transcription of 23 hours of interviews between Fidel Castro and a Brazilian liberation theology friar named Frei Betto, O.P. He claimed responsibility for excluding non-atheists from Communist Party membership on grounds that:\n\nIn the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the state adopted a more conciliatory position towards religion and lessened its promotion of atheism. In November 1991 the Communist Party began to allow believers into its ranks. In July 1992, the constitution was amended to remove the definition of Cuba as being a state based on Marxism–Leninism, and article 42 was added, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of religious belief. Small worship centers were legally permitted to exist again. In the early 1990s, weekly church-attendance on the island of 11 million was estimated at around 250,000 or about 2% of the population (with an even division between Catholics and Protestants). Cuba had fewer priests per inhabitant than any other Latin American country.\n\nSince 1992, restrictions have been eased, and direct challenges by state institutions to the right to believe eased somewhat, though the Roman Catholic church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources. The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the Cuban Catholic Bishops' Conference (CCBC), led by Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino, Cardinal Archbishop of Havana. It has eleven dioceses, 56 orders of nuns and 24 orders of priests.\n\nThe Cuban Bishops' Conference has severely criticized the US embargo against Cuba and has claimed that the entire population has suffered from it. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has been influenced by this and has argued for the exclusion of food and medicine from the embargo.\n\nIn January 1998, although he was an anti-communist, Pope John Paul II paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and the Catholic Church in Cuba. The pope criticized the US embargo during his visit. Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 2012 and Pope Francis visited in 2015. In a shift in policy, the Cuban government has issued permits to allow the construction of a new church in Cuba, the first since 1959.\n\nOn October 20, 2008, the first Russian Orthodox Church in Cuba opened during an official ceremony attended by Raul Castro.\n\nThe arrival and endurance of Santeria (also known as \"Regla de Ocha\") in Cuba results from multiple contributing factors. The roots of Santeria stem from Nigeria and were transported to Cuba by way of the Lucumí people. However, the Lucumi people only consisted of about 8% of the overall slave population in Cuba from 1760 until about 1850.\nWith such low numbers to draw upon, the religion was under constant attack in the form of dilution through more dominant numbers in the form of reproductive outsourcing and the cruelty inflicted through the employment of slavery.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1850 almost the entire population in Cuba consisted of people of African descent. This factor created a sense of uncertainty for plantation owners because of tensions amongst the slave population. The slave rivalries eventually resulted in an ever rising loss in production. The method for combating the losses yielded that an increase in the Lucumi population would serve the plantation best. Lucumi people were known to be hard workers and mild-mannered.\n\nAs result of increasing import of slaves the population of the Lucumi rose sharply to about 34%. Attributing to the increase of Santeria was that many other slaves and freemen began to practice the religion of Santeria, thereby increasing the span of influence and affiliation in a more diverse manner. The disposition of colonialism brought a significant strain on all religions outside of Catholicism. Over the course of a 90-year span, the Lucumi maintained the practice of the religion of Santeria. The religion of Santeria encompasses sacrificial food, song, dance, costumes, spiritual deities and the use of artifacts. In the beginning the Lucumi and other worshippers of Santeria would have to practice in secret.\n\nThey would create hasty areas in which they would conduct structuralized practice of Santeria and return to their colonial life after. However, the practice of Santeria on a more regular basis takes place not on the sugar plantations but in the urban areas. The syncretism that modernized Santeria was introduced when high-class mulattoes needed to find ways to alleviate ailments such as stress or sickness. There was no formal medical aid available to the community at the time. In light of this disposition high-class Mulattoes pulled from whatever resources that they could find. They employed the practices of Christian-educated slaves with Afro-Cuban healers and Spanish curanderos.\n\nThe Afro-Cuban healers and Spanish curanderos served as the only medical practitioners in Cuba and were responsible for treating both the black and white population. The distance between the city and the countryside made it very difficult for slaves to participate in the syncretism of Santeria with Catholicism and Christianity. This was due to geography. Most of the European religious churches were located the urban areas or towns and to attend services would require traveling over long distances, which would interfere with the sugar production. In the urban areas slaves worked alongside freemen and White Cubans in a less restricted atmosphere.\n\nThey were educated and trusted to perform skilled labor and given a great deal of responsibility. They served in a number of diverse jobs, which acted as a catalyst for the syncretism of Santeria with Catholicism and Christianity. Not every slave in Cuba complied with the employment of slavery. \"Cimarrones\", as the Cuban slave owners labeled them, were a group of slaves who fled captivity and formed communities consisting of thousands of people. They took refuge in the wilderness and the mountains of Cuba where they maintained the practice of Santeria. They were considered a very serious threat to the colonial government's hold on slavery and oppression.\n\nThe Cimarrones were able to elude capture and to provide aid and shelter to other escaped slaves. Over the course of time they developed the means to communicate with other surrounding secret camps via the plantation slaves and friendly White Cubans. Other slaves and freemen who lived in rural areas formed secret societies and groups in which they exercised their religious beliefs of Santeria out of public view to avoid colonial reform and oppression. After the abolishment of slavery Palenque, the Cimarrones establishment was converted into a town named El Cobre after surviving for fifty years.\n\nIn the religion of Santeria the emphasis of conscious existence binds the understanding of nature, the higher powers, and the channels of lineage together through ritual practice and clairvoyance. The circle is a symbol that is divided into three sections that begin at the core with people and extend out into two other sections being ancestors and finally divinities. The significance of people at the inner core stand to represent the present day of existence and understanding in the form of perception within the individual as he or she can interpret the information surrounding them.\n\nThe outer layer of the ancestor represents the heritable understanding that the individual carries with them as a source of how and why to interpret values of perception within a given realm. The outmost layer represents divinity is the value of knowledge, direction and understanding that is acquired from Orishas and personal experience. The existence the circle represents is not a fixed plain of understanding but stands as an interchangeable ever-evolving and rotating sense of awareness and being. Santeria lineage is structured in the connection through Sibs (a group of kin) with each Sib being traced back to a common male ancestor linking the bloodlines to the religion. \"There were three different routes for the transmission of Orisha worship. A child could inherit an Orisha from either its mother or father and continue their worship of it. In this case a triangular relationship existed between the child, the parent, and the Orisha.\"\n\nAs of 2016, there were about 96,000 active Jehovah's Witnesses in Cuba (about 0.85% of the population). From 1938 to 1947, the number of Jehovah's Witnesses in Cuba increased from about 100 to 4,000. After World War II, membership in Cuba increased to 20,000, and by 1989 there were approximately 30,000 members. The movement was banned in Cuba in 1974, and members have been imprisoned for their refusal of military service. During the Mariel boatlift in 1980, about 3,000 Witnesses left Cuba. In 1994, the Cuban government released representatives of the Watch Tower Society, and members were permitted to meet in groups of up to 150 at Kingdom Halls and other places for worship. A branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses, with a print shop, was opened in Havana in the same year. In 1998, Witnesses were permitted to meet at larger conventions in major cities in Cuba.\n\n\n"}

It is also used to describe the four branches of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist). Within Islam, it can refer to the branches or sects (such as Sunni, Shia, and Ahmadiyya), as well as their various subdivisions such as sub-sects, schools of jurisprudence, schools of theology and religious movements.\n\nThe world's largest religious denomination is Sunni Islam, followed by Roman Catholicism.\n\nA Christian denomination is a generic term for a distinct religious body identified by traits such as a common name, structure, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by doctrine and church authority; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy often separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are known as branches of Christianity.\n\nIn Hinduism, the major deity or philosophical belief identifies a denomination, which also typically has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism and Smartism.\n\nHistorically, Islam was divided into three major sects well known as Sunni, Khawarij and Shī‘ah. Nowadays, Sunnis constitute more than 85% of the overall Muslim population while the Shi'as are slightly more than 12%. Today, many of the Shia sects are extinct. The major surviving Imamah-Muslim Sects are Usulism \"(with nearly more than 10%),\" Nizari Ismailism \"(with nearly more than 1%),\" Alevism \"(with slightly more than 0.5% but less than 1%).\" The other existing groups include Zaydi Shi'a of Yemen whose population is nearly more than 0.5% of the world's Muslim population, Musta’li Ismaili \"(with nearly 0.1% whose Taiyabi adherents reside in Gujarat state in India and Karachi city in Pakistan. There are also significant diaspora populations in Europe, North America, the Far East and East Africa),\" and Ibadis from the Kharijites whose population has diminished to a level below 0.15%. On the other hand, new Muslim sects like African American Muslims, Ahmadi Muslims \"(with nearly around 1%),\" non-denominational Muslims, Quranist Muslims and Wahhabis \"(with nearly around 0.5% of the world's total Muslim population)\" were later independently developed.\n\nJewish religious movements, sometimes called \"denominations\" or \"branches\", include different groups which have developed among Jews from ancient times. Today, the main division is between the Orthodox, Reform, and Conservative lines, with several smaller movements alongside them. This threefold denominational structure is mainly present in the United States, while in Israel the fault lines are between the religious Orthodox and the non-religious.\n\nThe movements differ in their views on various issues. These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding Jewish law, biblical authorship, textual criticism, and the nature or role of the messiah (or messianic age). Across these movements there are marked differences in liturgy, especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews who adhere to other denominations, such that the non-Orthodox movements are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"liberal denominations\" or \"progressive streams.\"\n\nThe term \"multi-denominational\" may describe (for example) a religious event that includes several religious denominations from sometimes unrelated religious groups. Many civic events include religious portions led by representatives from several religious denominations to be as inclusive or representational as possible of the expected population or audience. For example: the Sunday thanksgiving mass at Campamento Esperanza (English: Camp Hope) in Chile, where services were led by both a Roman Catholic priest and by an Evangelical preacher during the Chilean 2010 Copiapó mining accident.\n\nChaplains - frequently ordained clergy of any religion - are often assigned to secular organizations to provide spiritual support to its members who may belong to any of many different religions or denominations. Many of these chaplains, particularly those serving with the military or other large secular organizations, are specifically trained to minister to members of many different faiths, even faiths with opposing religious ideology from that of the chaplain's own faith.\n\nMilitary organizations that do not have large numbers of members from several individual smaller but related denominations will routinely hold multi-denominational religious services, often generically called \"Protestant\" Sunday services, so minority Protestant denominations are not left out or unserved.\n\n"}

Due to the Great Depression, his family would move when he was two years old to Colombia, where he would grow up. He would later pursue a BA in philosophy and a MA in theology at Wheaton College, before continuing on to complete a PhD in the New Testament from the University of Manchester, under F. F. Bruce.\n\nHis education and experiences with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship underscored Padilla's evangelical foundations and the priority he would place on the historical-critical approach to hermeneutics. However, in 1959, Padilla was appointed a traveling secretary in Latin America for International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. In his work with universities throughout Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, Padilla would be faced with a tense sociopolitical context. Students were immersed in Marxist writings and grappled with the possibility of revolution. This would be the context which produced not only Catholic liberation theology, but also challenged Padilla to develop a new evangelical social theology which he would later term \"integral mission.\"\n\nPadilla would bring his ideas to the global stage at the Lausanne Conference of 1974. This would have a significant effect on the nature of global evangelicalism and the growing priority of evangelicals in both evangelicalism and social activism.\n\nIn 1992, Padilla would receive an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Wheaton College.\n\nHe is the father of the theologian Ruth Padilla DeBorst.\n"}

{"id": "277825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277825", "title": "Tarantella", "text": "Tarantella\n\n' () is a group of various folk dances characterized by a fast upbeat tempo, usually in time (sometimes or ), accompanied by tambourines. It is among the most recognized forms of traditional southern Italian music. The specific dance-name varies with every region, for instance \"tammurriata\" in Campania, \"pizzica\" in the Salento region, \"Sonu a ballu\" in Calabria. Tarantella is popular in Southern Italy and Argentina. The term may appear as ' in a linguistically masculine construction.\nIn the Italian province of Taranto, Apulia, the bite of a locally common type of wolf spider, named \"tarantula\" after the region, was popularly believed to be highly venomous and to lead to a hysterical condition known as tarantism. This became known as the Tarantella. R. Lowe Thompson proposed that the dance is a survival from a \"Dianic or Dionysiac cult\", driven underground. John Compton later proposed that the Roman Senate had suppressed these ancient Bacchanalian rites. In 186 BC the tarantella went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.\n\nThe stately courtship tarantella danced by a couple or couples, short in duration, is graceful and elegant and features characteristic music. On the other hand, the supposedly curative or symptomatic tarantella was danced solo by a victim of a \"Lycosa tarantula\" spider bite (not to be confused with what is commonly known as a tarantula today); it was agitated in character, lasted for hours or even up to days, and featured characteristic music. However, other forms of the dance were and still are couple dances usually either mimicking courtship or a sword fight. The confusion appears to arrive from the fact that the spiders, the condition, its sufferers ('tarantolati'), and the dances all have similar names to the city of Taranto.\n\nThe dance originated in the Apulia region, and spread throughout the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\nThe Neapolitan tarantella is a courtship dance performed by couples whose \"rhythms, melodies, gestures, and accompanying songs are quite distinct\" featuring faster more cheerful music. Its origins may further lie in \"a fifteenth-century fusion between the Spanish Fandango and the Moresque 'ballo di sfessartia'.\" \nThe \"magico-religious\" tarantella is a solo dance performed supposedly to cure through perspiration the delirium and contortions attributed to the bite of a spider at harvest (summer) time. The dance was later applied as a supposed cure for the behavior of neurotic women ('Carnevaletto delle donne').\n\nThere are several traditional tarantella groups: 'Cantori di Carpino', 'Officina Zoé', 'Uccio Aloisi gruppu', 'Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino', 'Selva Cupina', 'I Tamburellisti di Torrepaduli'.\n\nThe tarantella is most commonly played with a mandolin, a guitar, an accordion and tambourines. Flute, fiddle, trumpet and clarinet are also used.\n\nThe tarantella is a dance in which the dancer and the drum player constantly try to upstage each other by playing faster or dancing longer than the other, subsequently tiring one person out first.\n\nTarantism, as a ritual, has roots in the ancient Greek myths. Reportedly, victims who had collapsed or were convulsing would begin to dance with appropriate music and be revived as if a tarantula had bitten them. The music used to treat dancing mania appears to be similar to that used in the case of tarantism though little is known about either. Justus Hecker (1795–1850), describes in his work \"Epidemics of the Middle Ages\": A convulsion infuriated the human frame [...]. Entire communities of people would join hands, dance, leap, scream, and shake for hours [...]. Music appeared to be the only means of combating the strange epidemic [...] lively, shrill tunes, played on trumpets and fifes, excited the dancers; soft, calm harmonies, graduated from fast to slow, high to low, prove efficacious for the cure. The music used against spider bites featured drums and clarinets, was matched to the pace of the victim, and is only weakly connected to its later depiction in the tarantellas of Chopin, Liszt, Rossini, and Heller.\n\nWhile most serious proponents speculated as to the direct physical benefits of the dancing rather than the power of the music a mid-18th century medical textbook gets the prevailing story backwards describing that tarantulas will be compelled to dance by violin music. It was thought that the \"Lycosa tarantula\" wolf spider had lent the name \"tarantula\" to an unrelated family of spiders, having been the species associated with Taranto, but since \"L. tarantula\" is not inherently deadly, the highly venomous Mediterranean black widow, \"Latrodectus tredecimguttatus\", may have been the species originally associated with Taranto's manual grain harvest.\n\nThe Balanchine ballet \"Tarantella\" is set to the \"Grande Tarantelle for Piano and Orchestra\", Op. 67 (ca. 1866) by Louis Moreau Gottschalk, reconstructed and orchestrated by Hershy Kay. The profusion of steps and the quick changes of direction that this brief but explosive pas de deux requires typify the ways in which Balanchine expanded the traditional vocabulary of classical dance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11582552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11582552", "title": "Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan", "text": "Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan\n\nTemperance \"Bones\" Brennan, Ph.D. (born Joy Keenan) is a fictional character portrayed by Emily Deschanel in the American Fox television series \"Bones\". An anthropologist, forensic anthropologist, and kinesiologist, she is described in the series as a leading authority in the field of forensic anthropology. Brennan first appeared on television, along with other series characters, in the \"Pilot\" episode of \"Bones\" on September 13, 2005. She is the main protagonist of the series along with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz).\n\nBrennan is loosely based on author Kathy Reichs. Her name originates from the heroine in Reichs's crime novel series, also named Temperance Brennan. The main similarity the two share is their occupation as forensic anthropologists. Brennan appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters. She was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Her relationship with Seeley Booth was listed in \"Entertainment Weekly\" \"30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples\".\n\nTemperance \"Bones\" Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works in the Medico-Legal lab at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She received her Ph.D. from Northwestern University, as stated in \"The Girl in the Fridge\". She has three doctorates, as referred to by Dr. Jack Hodgins in the episode \"The Parts of the Sum in the Whole\", in anthropology, forensic anthropology and kinesiology; it is implied that most of her work at the lab was related to either long-dead bodies or victims of genocide.\n\nHer occasional contract work for the FBI shifted the focus of her work. She was paired with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, and helped to solve two difficult cases; since then, they have worked together almost exclusively on modern-day murder cases.\n\nBrennan works with a group of other well-qualified colleagues, including the entomologist Jack Hodgins, her boss and forensic pathologist Camille Saroyan, forensic artist Angela Montenegro, and a host of eager graduate students. Booth refers to her crew of colleagues as \"squints\", because they come to crime scenes and squint at evidence. He is also responsible for her nickname, \"Bones\", which she initially detested.\n\nIn the first-season finale (which aired on May 17, 2006), Brennan stated that she was born in 1976, which would have made her either 29 or 30 (approximately the same age as Deschanel, who was born on October 11, 1976). In the fifth-season episode \"The Death of the Queen Bee\" (which aired nearly four years later, on April 15, 2010), it is implied that her then-current age was 33 years (based on Brennan's identification of a former high school classmate as the victim and statement that the classmate was 33).\n\nFirst mentioned in season 1, Brennan has a love of dolphins, which she shared with her late mother: in the season one finale, \"The Woman in Limbo\", Brennan examines a custom-made belt with a dolphin on the buckle, which had belonged to her mother, and which she mentions having once borrowed without asking first. Brennan's love of dolphins is highlighted again in season 2 episodes \"The Titan on the Tracks\", \"The Killer in the Concrete\" and \"Stargazer in a Puddle\", when she mentions the constellation Delphinus, (the Dolphin), her and her mother's favorite. In season 6, \"The Doctor in the Photo\", she is shown to wear a dolphin ring.\n\nIn \"Mummy in the Maze\", Brennan exhibited ophidiophobia when confronted with snakes, but later only shows a moment of fright when confronted with another snake in \"The Mastodon in the Room\". She takes note of this, voicing her observation that she only seems to lose her head around snakes when Booth is also \"there to be jumped upon\", and also she mentions that she once had a pet snake during high school. It should also be noted that, in \"The Man in the Morgue,\" Brennan handled a snake without any trace of fear, even while Booth is in the room.\n\nIn season one, in \"A Man on Death Row\", Dr. Brennan expresses her stance on the death penalty; \"I believe in the death penalty. There are certain people who shouldn't be in this world. The people who hacked hundreds of innocent children to death in Rwanda; beheaded them at their desks at school! The people who did that, they should be executed.\" In \"The Woman at the Airport\", Dr. Brennan is shown to have a strong dislike for plastic surgeons, believing them to be no more than \"glorified butchers with medical degrees\", and this dislike is voiced again in season 4, in \"Cinderella in the Cardboard\". In \"The Woman in the Car\", Dr. Brennan reveals that her third doctorate is in kinesiology, a field that would allow her and Angela to unravel how one of the bodies that had been found had been killed.\n\nIn season two, she expressed the desire to get a pet pig, whom she would have named \"Jasper\". Brennan's expertise in kinesiology would again prove its worth in \"The Truth in the Lye\" (she could tell that one of the murder suspects was pregnant just from having observed her gait), in \"The Girl with the Curl\" (she could tell if one of the young beauty pageant contestants was suffering from scoliosis just by watching them perform on stage), and in \"The Woman in the Sand\" (while undercover with Booth, she was able to tell Booth exactly how to beat his opponent from just having watched his moves). In \"Judas on a Pole\", she and her brother are identified as having the same blood type, blood type O. In \"Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\", she is shown to be a good cook: Booth's comment on her mac and cheese is that he'd \"like to be alone with it\".\n\nIn the season 3 episode, \"Mummy in the Maze\", it is revealed that Brennan's favorite superhero is Wonder Woman, and that she always goes as Wonder Woman to the Jeffersonian's Halloween party. In \"The Baby in the Bough\", it is revealed that Brennan is a registered foster parent, at her brother's request, to take in his stepdaughters in case anything should happen to him and his girlfriend. In the season 3 episode, \"Intern in the Incinerator\", Booth reveals that Brennan's favorite flower is a Daffodil, her second favorite flower is a Daisy, and her favorite planet is Jupiter.\n\nIn season 5, in \"The Death of the Queen Bee\", when asked if she'd had a pet rat, Brennan discloses that she, in fact, had a pet mouse, snake and some spiders. During her time at Burtonsville high school, her only friend was the school custodian, Ray Buxley, with whom she would enjoy long, in-depth conversations on life and death, and who would also provide her with dead animals to dissect (Brennan having set out to become a forensic anthropologist,) and who would later be one of her books' biggest fans (she having named the killer in her first book, \"Bred in the Bone\", after him). According to the Burtonsville high school on-line yearbook entry on Brennan, in her senior year, she was a member of the Chemistry club and Math club, her interests were chemistry and mathematics, and she was a National Merit Scholar and an Academic All Star.\n\nIn the season 6 episode, \"The Blackout in the Blizzard\", Brennan mentions her pet iguana for the first time. This same episode show that one of the number of scientific publications that Brennan reads is \"Medicinal Physics Quarterly\", with one article on electrostatics and triboluminescence proving useful during the lab's power outage. Further concerning her pet iguana in \"The Truth in the Myth\", as a part of his rehab from alcohol abuse, Vincent Nigel-Murry made apologies for, among other things, having borrowed her iguana one night, wearing him as a hat for a party. She comments that he must have taken good care of her iguana as she has observed nothing wrong with him and further expresses some surprise that Vincent Nigel-Murry was able to get her iguana to stay perched atop his head, to which he replies that he was good with ribbons.\n\nIn season 8, \"The Tiger in the Tale\", Booth mentions to Sweets that Dr. Brennan once took Peyote with Native Americans.\n\nIn season 11, \"The Senator in the Street Sweeper\", Dr. Brennan is mentioned to be a member of the Green Party of the United States along with Dr. Hodgins.\n\nAlthough Brennan seemed to have a relatively normal childhood, her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old. Her older brother Russ, himself still an adolescent, was unable to care for her and she was put in the foster care system. By the time she started college she had been to twelve different schools and has specifically said that she hated the lack of consistency.\n\nThere has been contradictory evidence about her time in the system; in one episode, Brennan stated that her grandfather got her out of the foster system, but in a later episode, she indicates that she never knew her grandparents (possibly the two references are to two separate sets of grandparents, paternal and maternal). However, taking into consideration the fact that Brennan's parents had assumed new identities when she was 3-years-old, the grandfather who had taken her in from her time in the foster system may not have been her biological grandfather.\n\nHer time in foster care was quite traumatic and abusive; Brennan indicated that she was once locked in the trunk of a car for two days because she broke a plate, and in the episode \"The Finger in the Nest\", she reveals to Booth that she walked into her elderly neighbor's house to find the woman dead. In the same episode, she also mentions to Booth that her parents were very concerned about her afterwards, because she started faking her own death. In Season 2, she mentions that during her time in the foster care system, she kept a list of foster homes she had been kicked out of on the bottom of her shoe.\n\nIn the first season she hands Booth the file on her parents' disappearance and he agrees to look into it as a personal favor. It is later revealed in Season 2 that her parents, who were bank robbers specializing in safety deposit boxes, changed the family's identity after they stole some damaging FBI documents regarding the murder of an FBI agent and the false imprisonment of civil rights activist Marvin Beckett. Brennan's birth name was Joy Keenan. Her mother (real name Ruth Keenan, known under the assumed identity of Christine Brennan) had hoped to someday return to her children and family, but made a tape for Brennan to watch on her 16th birthday in case that never happened. Brennan later discovered that Ruth/Christine was murdered in 1993, two years after she and her husband went on the run.\n\nHer father Max Keenan re-entered Brennan's life when she and her brother were being threatened by an old acquaintance, who turned out to be Booth's boss, Deputy Director Kirby. Max evades capture after killing Kirby, and takes Russ into hiding to protect him. Later, Max allows Booth to arrest him in order to improve his relationship with his daughter. At trial, Max is acquitted of murdering Director Kirby (due in large part to a defense Booth indirectly came up with, positing an alternate theory of the crime in which Temperance was the killer instead, creating reasonable doubt), and he begins to rebuild his life.\n\nHe temporarily works at the Jeffersonian as a guide for children visiting the place and demonstrates his brilliant talent as a former science teacher. However, Brennan is concerned about a convicted felon having access to a lab that investigates crimes. Max also introduces Brennan to her cousin Margaret Whitesell, portrayed by Deschanel's real-life sister Zooey Deschanel.\n\nBrennan is best friends with her coworker, Angela, saying in the 6th-season premiere she loves Angela \"like a sister\" and is going to be an aunt to Hodgins' and Angela's newborn child. It is revealed at the end of the season six finale \"The Change in the Game\" that Brennan is pregnant and the father is Booth.\n\nIn Season 7, episode 2 \"The Hot Dog in the Competition\", Brennan and Booth found out they were having a baby girl. Their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named for Brennan's mother and her best friend), was born in a stable during the episode \"The Prisoner in the Pipe\". In the Season 7 finale, \"The Past in the Present\", key evidence in the death of her friend, Ethan Sawyer, is linked to Brennan. Max convinces her to go on the run along with Christine, saying that if she is arrested, even if she is found innocent, she may never see her daughter again.\n\nIn Season 8 premiere, it is revealed that while on the run, Brennan was communicating with Angela, via flowers, and eventually used this as a way to communicate with Booth. Despite being on the run, Brennan risks her safety and decides to meet directly with Booth in a hotel room after months of being a single mother. Eventually, they arrest Christopher Pelant, who was the real murderer of Ethan Sawyer, and Brennan is allowed to return to her family. Although Pelant blackmails Booth to prevent him from accepting Brennan's proposal by threatening to kill five innocent people if Booth accepted, also warning Booth not to give a reason for his refusal, this threat is removed when the team manage to kill Pelant, and Booth and Brennan marry in the Season 9 episode 'The Woman in White'.\n\nIn the Season 10 episode, \"The Eye in the Sky\", Brennan learns that she is pregnant with her and Booth's second child.\n\nThroughout the course of the series, Brennan is portrayed as a straightforward, brilliant anthropologist, who lacks social skills. Her social ineptitude is especially apparent when it comes to sarcasm, metaphors which she often interprets literally, and pop culture jokes and is often the source of comedy in the show. An example of this is when she mistakes Colin Farrell for Will Ferrell. In earlier seasons, she was characterized as straightforward and unable to detect social cues – she states that Booth once told her that she \"stinks at non-verbal communication\" – and was well-known within the FBI for being extremely difficult to work with. She began to acknowledge her lack of sensitivity after Booth bluntly told her outright that she was \"bad with people\" in \"A Boy in a Tree\". Her lack of \"political savvy\" and social skills was also a reason why she was passed over for Dr. Camille Saroyan as head of the Jeffersonian in Season 2. Other characters have described her as \"no fun\" and \"a rigid traditionalist\".\n\nShe had a difficult adolescence, and it is implied, often by Sweets, that her withdrawn social tendencies are a defense mechanism. She also sometimes struggles in identifying and explaining her emotions, and takes comfort in the rationality of her anthropological discipline. Although it has been stated that Brennan was based on a person with Asperger syndrome, this has never been confirmed in the plot of the series. The creator of the series has stated that the character was never labeled as having the syndrome in order to increase the appeal of the show on network television. This influence on her character also helps to explain her extreme rationality in early seasons, as well as some of her social difficulties. Brennan is a self-proclaimed atheist and often points out what she believes to be the irrationality of religious and spiritual beliefs. This has led to more than one argument with Booth, who is a devout Roman Catholic; he becomes particularly irate when she compares less common religions, such as voodoo, to Christianity. During the \"Sleepy Hollow\" crossover episode \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\", \"Sleepy Hollow\" protagonist Ichabod Crane notes that Brennan is so sceptical that she would dismiss the demon Moloch — the primary antagonist in the first two seasons of \"Sleepy Hollow\" — as nothing more than a tall man with a skin condition, although this does leave him reassured that she will not realise the nature of the secret tomb they have uncovered underneath the White House.\n\nBrennan is a bestselling author, who has been on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List for 18 weeks. She is trained in three types of martial arts, has hunting licenses in four states, and has a legally registered gun as well as a diving certificate. She promised to consider becoming a vegetarian after seeing how pigs were slaughtered (which was also the way her mother had been killed). However, in \"The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken\" (season 5, episode 6) Angela cites health reasons for Brennan's vegetarian diet. Brennan is also a trained amateur highwire performer, and speaks at least seven other languages, including Spanish, French, Latin, Chinese, Pashto Japanese, Norwegian (although she says only \"skull\" and avers that, as a forensic anthropologist, this is a word she knows \"in just about every language\"), Farsi, and German. She has also admitted to knowing a bit of Russian. She often says she does not \"put much stock in psychology\" and makes a point of noting that Dr. Sweets is not a real scientist as he \"bases his life on the vagary of psychology and emotions\".\n\nBrennan's personality undergoes significant changes throughout the course of the series. Her thinking becomes less rigid in later seasons, something which is observed by Dr. Gordon Wyatt, who notes that she is now able to distinguish the difference between accuracy and truth. In season 4, Booth takes her along to his interrogations and helps her learn how to set aside her scientific perspective and relate with the victim's family and suspects on a more interpersonal level. She is also able to put aside her rationality to support her friends in sometimes irrational pursuits, such as Angela's quest to raise money to save a pig from slaughter, and to comfort Booth, even using science or quoting directly from the Bible to rationalize his religious beliefs. Her sensitivity and empathy towards others are also much improved, seen quite strongly when she comforts his grandfather, and when she attends a funeral so that the victim's single mother won't be alone. She also displays more \"typical\" human emotions when in extreme stress. One example of this is her fear of snakes in \"The Mummy in the Maze,\" when a girl is in the process of being scared to death in a room, the floor teeming with snakes. This goes against her empirical nature, as, when Booth tells her that the snakes aren't venomous, she states that she is aware, but still refuses to step in the room, causing Booth to carry her on his back.\n\nBrennan begins to feel both dissatisfaction and discomfort with her work toward the end of the fifth season. She also sees some futility in her work, stating that no matter how many killers they catch, there will always be more. To help her gain new perspective, she later decides to head up an anthropological expedition to Indonesia for a year to identify some ancient proto-human remains, after mulling it over during the episode. However, 7 months later, she and everyone else return to D.C. in order to save Cam's job, and they all decide to stay.\n\nAs season 6 progresses, Brennan must confront her feelings for Booth, whom she rejected in the 100th episode from the previous season. Having returned from 7 months of introspection, she has come to terms with her romantic affection towards him, even admitting that she regretted not having given them a chance together, midway through the season. However, Booth returns from Afghanistan with a new love interest, war correspondent Hannah Burley, whom Brennan befriends. When Hannah rejects Booth's marriage proposal, Brennan must help him through the emotional fallout.\n\nIn the second to last episode of season 6 Booth and Brennan had sex, consummating their relationship, and it is revealed in the last few moments of the season finale that as a result, Brennan has become pregnant, with Booth the father. Throughout the episode (\"The Change in the Game\") Brennan has been seen asking Angela questions and making comments that make her seem excited and apprehensive; when she sees that Booth is happy with the news, she also seems overjoyed. This reflects her earlier desire to become a mother, circa season 4, as well as her desire that Booth be the father of the baby.\n\nIn the Season 8 episode \"The Shot in the Dark\", Brennan is shot while working in the lab late at night. While undergoing emergency surgery, she experiences a vision of meeting with her deceased mother, Christine Brennan. Initially dismissing this as a hallucination, Brennan experiences several more visions throughout the episode. During these discussions, it's revealed that Brennan's hyper rationalization originates from the very last piece of advice her mother gave to her (before going on the run) which was to use her brain instead of her heart. While that advice enabled Brennan to survive all these years, the vision of her mother explains, it's now time for Brennan to do more than just survive.\n\nSince entering a relationship with and marrying Booth and then having children, the character has undergone development personally and is shown to be a caring wife and protective mother. She would often put aside her own atheistic views and uses her hyper-rationality to justify Booth's religious beliefs, as shown in season 8 where she references the Bible in order to persuade Booth to forgive his mother and in the season finale where she agrees to a church wedding, rationalizing that she could appreciate the \"beauty\" of the ceremony and its significance to Booth.\n\nBrennan has had a number of relatively short relationships, including an ill-fated date with a man who turned out to be a murderer and the re-kindling of a romance with her former thesis supervisor. She has stated that although she does not always feel the need for a committed emotional relationship, she has engaged in casual relationships to \"satisfy biological urges\". In one episode, she was spending time with two men, one for his intelligence and the other for his sexual skills. In Season 5, episode \"The Plain in the Prodigy\", she tells Booth she lost her virginity at the age of 22 and when asked why she waited so long, she said it was because the decision was \"important to her\". FBI psychologist Lance Sweets postulates in a number of episodes that Brennan's apprehension over having relationships is largely due in part to the abandonment and abuse she experienced as a teenager after her parents disappeared. It is said that she \"hides\" herself behind a front of hyper-rationalism and she always keeps people at arms' length, except for those closest to her (namely FBI partner Seeley Booth and best friend Angela Montenegro). After much character growth, Temperance Brennan is now married to her principal love interest of the series Seeley Booth, and they have a daughter (Season 7) and a son together.\n\nFBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is Brennan's husband and partner, and the principal liaison between the Jeffersonian and law enforcement agencies. Prior to their marriage, he is also Brennan's principal love interest throughout the series. Although his working style initially clashed with Brennan's, they have since become full-fledged partners. Their compatibility has become one of the central points of the show, with many new characters mistaking them for a couple and co-workers, especially Angela, constantly speculating that they were \"more than partners\". Booth and Brennan have repeatedly risked their safety to save each other, including when Booth took a bullet meant for Brennan. After Booth rescues Brennan from the corrupt Agent Kenton, Booth lifts her off the hook she was hung on by putting her tied hands around his neck even though he himself was severely injured. In \"Two Bodies in the Lab\", in season 1, and in \"The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle\", in season 5, Brennan and Booth's mutual love for Foreigner's Hot Blooded is mentioned; Booth even refers to it as 'their song' in \"The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle\". Brennan once commented to Dr. Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) that she \"[couldn't] think of anything [she] wouldn't do to help Booth.\" Brennan's novels are also dedicated to him and the character Special Agent Andy Lister is based on him even though she still denies it.\n\nInitially Brennan was mostly dismissive of Booth due to their opposing worldviews and work styles – which is a source of friction and banter between them. Although she refused to admit it at first, Brennan enjoyed working with him from the beginning, even after their falling out when Booth got her drunk and \"fired\" her, and, in Season 1, she cajoled him into launching an investigation after finding three bone fragments on a golf course so he could work with the Jeffersonian team on the case despite the fact that the FBI technically had no jurisdiction. She often unknowingly offends him on a number of occasions during the first few seasons with her tactlessness, only realizing after being gently admonished by Angela or another member of the team. She comes to admire his ability to connect with people and read behavioral cues when interrogating suspects after coming to terms with her own lack of social skills. After finding out about his abusive childhood and haunted past in the Army, she also begins to respect him as a person. Booth, who is particularly taciturn in revealing emotions or speaking about his past, begins to open up to and confide in her. Since entering a relationship with (and eventually marrying) Booth, she is shown to be extremely supportive of him, even at the expense of her friendship with Angela. Additionally, she put aside her own misgivings several times for Booth's benefit; for example, she agrees to have Christine christened into the Catholic church and referenced the Bible when trying to talk Booth into forgiving his mother.\n\nBrennan acquired the nickname \"Bones\" from Booth. She initially disliked it but comes to regard it with affection. Booth and his son Parker are the only characters in the show she permits to use it and the former rarely addresses her by her first name or \"Tempe\".\n\nIn Season 2 Brennan shot and killed a person for the first time while working on a string of murders connected to serial killer Howard Epps. She was forced to pull the trigger after Epps' accomplice attacked and injured Booth with a pipe. At the end of the episode she confides in Booth of her conflicted feelings and finds comfort in the fact that Booth understood how she felt.\n\nThe relationship between Brennan and Booth has often become strained when either partner has a significant other. For example, Booth was quite irritable when Brennan dated Agent Sully, and their relationship was also strained when Booth's brother Jared was showing an interest in Brennan. Brennan constantly needled Booth while he was dating Tessa.\n\nWhen Brennan decided that she wanted to have a baby, she asked Booth if he would be the sperm donor. He agrees to Brennan's request at first, but subsequently struggles with the thought of not being involved in the life of his prospective child. Eventually he tells Brennan he cannot let her have his child if he is not allowed to be a father to it. Soon thereafter, it is discovered that he has a (benign) brain tumour. He has to undergo surgery, and though the surgery is successful, a poor reaction to anesthesia left him in a coma for several days. While in his coma, Brennan reads to him from her new novel, and he has an elaborate dream in which Brennan is his wife and that she is pregnant, and that the staff at the Jeffersonian play the characters in the novel. When he awakens, he initially suffers from amnesia, not recognizing Brennan.\n\nAlthough for the majority of the series Booth and Brennan denied that their relationship was anything more than friendly professionalism, they admitted to Dr. Sweets that they kissed and nearly spent the night together after their very first case together. After this discussion, Booth attempted to convince Brennan to give a relationship a try. However, she declined, telling him that she, unlike him, is not a gambler, and isn't able to take that kind of a chance. They have subsequently attempted to date other people, although the fact that Booth once comments that he regards Brennan as his \"standard\" for other women suggests that he, at least, has not completely moved on. Brennan does admit to her best friend Angela Montenegro that as time has gone on, she is unsure if she wants to keep doing consulting work for the FBI, citing that she is tired of murderers and victims, and is constantly worried that something will happen to Booth and she will be unable to save him. In the climax of Season Five, Brennan and Booth part ways for a year – he goes to Afghanistan while she leaves for the Maluku Islands in Indonesia – but they promise to meet, one year from that day, at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nIn the beginning of season six (7 months later), they reunite in the stated place. Booth came back from Afghanistan, along with everyone else from various places, to help save Cam's job. They all decided to stay. Booth has a serious new girlfriend, Hannah, and despite the hints of her colleagues at Brennan's unconscious jealousy of their relationship, she vehemently denies feeling uncomfortable with the new situation. Through subsequent episodes her jealousy and resentfulness began becoming more apparent as Hannah and Booth started becoming more serious. In the episode \"The Doctor in the Photo\", Brennan realizes she is in love with Booth and confronts him, but she is let down when Booth says that he loves Hannah and she is not a \"consolation prize\", prompting Brennan to conclude that she has missed her chance, later reflecting that she should move on. In episode 10 of the sixth season \"The Body in the Bag\", Booth tells his girlfriend about the incident, stating that it (his love for Temperance) was all in the past and whatever he felt, he does not feel it anymore, except for Hannah. However it was clear in the following episode that he still has feelings for Brennan.\n\nDespite her apparent resolve to move on, Brennan later showed sorrow when her father noted that he always thought she and Booth would end up together. During a subsequent case involving a polygamist who would spend the night with his first wife on the night he was scheduled to sleep alone, Booth commented that, while you can love several people, there is only ever one person you love the most, prompting Brennan to ask what happens when you push that person away, something Booth answered saying that it never truly leaves, adding further weight to the implication that he still has feelings for Brennan. Following Hannah's departure, the two have begun to reconnect, to the point that, during a case that saw the two trapped in an elevator during a blackout for several hours, Booth and Brennan admitted that they are each interested in a relationship, but require more time to sort out their own feelings before they make such a commitment.\n\nIn episode 22 of season 6, \"The Hole in the Heart\", which saw the death of Vincent Nigel-Murray (Brennan's favorite intern) at the hands of renegade sniper Jacob Broadsky, Booth has Brennan stay at his apartment for her safety. Later that night, Brennan, still overcome with shock and grief over Vincent's death, goes into Booth's bedroom and they talk about the events of that day, and then allows Booth to hold her in bed. It is implied in the following day that they had sex. In the last scene of the season 6 finale, \"The Change in the Game\", after the birth of Angela and Hodgins' son, Brennan tells Booth that she is pregnant and that he is the father.\n\nAt the start of Season 7, a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are a couple but are going back and forth between apartments. Booth suggests that they should have their own place, whereas Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment. It causes a minor rift between them, but is resolved when Booth admits why he wants to move into a new house and Brennan having some time to think over it says it's a good idea because she'd need him practically, emotionally and sexually. In episode 6, \"The Crack in the Code,\" they decide to buy a two-story house in the suburbs—which they jokingly called \"The Mighty Hut\"—that Booth found at a police auction and renovate it, (according to a mailed check sent to Brennan in \"The Heiress in the Hill\", in season 9, the \"Mighty Hut\"'s address is \"1297 Janus Street, Washington DC, 20002\"). In episode 7, \"The Prisoner in the Pipe\", Brennan goes into labor inside a prison just as she discovers who killed in an inmate there and Booth rushes her out with the intention to take her to the nearest hospital, but they both know she won't make it in time. This leads them to driving to an inn close to the prison. At first, they are rejected and are told to leave, but after some desperate pleading from an agonized Brennan, the two of them are led to a stall where she gives birth to their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named after Temperance's mother, Christine Brennan, and Temperance's best friend Angela Montenegro). Some time after the delivery, Temperance and Seeley both go back to their home where they celebrate with their friends from the Jeffersonian, who brought dinners that would last a few nights as well as a few baby supplies. In \"The Past in the Present\", Brennan becomes the prime suspect in the murder of her schizophrenic friend, Ethan Sawyer, after supposedly threatening to kill Christine. Max advises Brennan to get off the grid and go into hiding, but she and Booth do not follow up at this suggestion. However, at the end of the episode, after Christine is christened in a Catholic church, it is revealed Brennan decided to take her father's advice and flee with her daughter until her name is cleared. Just before Brennan flees town with Christine, she tells Booth she loves him and not just because of their daughter. After she is cleared of Sawyer's murder, Brennan, Booth and Christine resume their family life.\n\nAt the end of Season 8, Brennan finally decides to marry Booth. However, their plans are ruined when a vengeful Christopher Pelant blackmails Booth, threatening to kill five random people if Booth marries Brennan. Booth calls off the wedding, but does not explain the real reason to Brennan. Brennan is devastated but pretends to be fine with this. In the season 9 premiere, Brennan fears that since Booth turned down her proposal, she fears that the love from their life is fading. After talking with bartender Aldo Clemens, a former priest and Army chaplain Booth confessed to, she realizes that it was uncharacteristic for Booth to suddenly cancel the wedding as he believed in marriage and that he likely had a legitimate reason to do so. Despite her colleagues' anger at Booth, she decides to stay with him, telling him that she understands that he has his reasons and has faith that he will resolve the issue. In the episode 4, \"The Sense in the Sacrifice\", after Booth singlehandedly tracks Pelant down through an abandoned building and kills him with a single gunshot, he reveals to her that Pelant had blackmailed him. Pelant had threatened to kill five innocent people if Booth continued with the wedding or went to the police or FBI. At the end of the episode he proposes and she happily accepts; unknown to them, Caroline, Angela and Hodgins witnessed it via the security cameras. In \"The Woman in White\", Booth and Brennan marry at a small garden ceremony outside the Jeffersonian.\n\nTheir infant son Hank Jr. (named after Booth's grandfather) was born off-screen sometime after season 10 and before the beginning of season 11.\n\nBrennan had a brief relationship with FBI Agent Tim Sullivan (Eddie McClintock), also known as Sully, whom she met while on a case when Booth was in therapy due to his grief-induced rage over his self-perceived role in the death of serial killer Howard Epps. Sully asked Dr. Brennan out on a date after their case was completed, and they began a relationship.\nTheir relationship ended, however, when Sully decided to sail a boat down to the Caribbean, and Brennan declined to leave the Jeffersonian to go with him despite Angela trying to persuade her to follow him; psychiatrist Doctor Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) speculated that this was due to Brennan being unable to live a life without purpose.\nDespite Dr. Wyatt's original perception as to why she stayed, there exist strong indications, especially through Angela's observations of the situation, that the real reason she stayed was because of Booth. Sully returns in Season 12.\n"}
{"id": "4504155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4504155", "title": "Tengrism", "text": "Tengrism\n\nTengrism, also known as Tengriism, Tenggerism, or Tengrianism, is a Central Asian religion characterized by shamanism, animism, totemism, poly-, and monotheism, and ancestor worship. It was the prevailing religion of the Turks, Mongols, Hungarians, Xiongnu and possibly Huns, and the religion of the five ancient Turkic states: Göktürk Khaganate, Western Turkic Khaganate, Great Bulgaria, Bulgarian Empire, and Eastern Tourkia (Khazaria). In \"Irk Bitig\", Tengri is mentioned as \"Türük Tängrisi\" (God of Turks).\n\nTengrism has been advocated in intellectual circles of the Turkic nations of Central Asia (including Tatarstan, Buryatia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan) since the dissolution of the Soviet Union during the 1990s. Still practiced, it is undergoing an organized revival in Sakha, Khakassia, Tuva and other Turkic nations in Siberia. Burkhanism, a movement similar to Tengrism, is concentrated in Altay.\n\n\"Khukh tengri\" means \"blue sky\" in Mongolian, Mongolians still pray to \"Munkh Khukh Tengri\" (\"Eternal Blue Sky\") and Mongolia is sometimes poetically called the \"Land of Eternal Blue Sky\" (\"Munkh Khukh Tengriin Oron\") by its inhabitants. In modern Turkey, Tengrism is known as the \"Göktanrı dini\" (\"Sky God religion\"); the Turkish \"Gök\" (sky) and \"Tanrı\" (God) correspond to the Mongolian \"khukh\" (blue) and \"Tengri\" (sky), respectively. According to Hungarian archaeological research, the religion of the Hungarians until the end of the 10th century (before Christianity) was Tengrism.\n\nThe word \"Tengrism\" is a fairly new term. It is conventionally used to describe a form of Tengri-centered shamanism that prevailed on the Eurasian steppes mostly among early Turkic and Mongol Khanates. Tengrism differs from Siberian shamanism in that the polities practicing it were not small bands of hunter gatherers like the Paleosiberians but a continuous succession of pastoral, semi-sedentarized Khanates and empires from the Xiongnu Empire (founded 209 BC) till the Mongol Empire (13th century). Among Turkic peoples it was radically supplanted by Islam while in Mongolia it survives as a synthesis with Tibetan Buddhism while surviving in purer forms around Lake Khovsgol and Lake Baikal. Unlike Siberian shamanism which has no written tradition, Tengrism can be identified from Turkic and Mongolic historical texts like the Orkhon inscriptions, Secret History of the Mongols and Altan Tobchi. However, these texts are more historically oriented and are not strictly religious texts like the scriptures and sutras of sedentary civilizations which have elaborate doctrines and religious stories. On a scale of complexity Tengrism lies somewhere between the Proto-Indo-European religion (a pre-state form of pastoral shamanism on the western steppe) and its later form the Vedic religion. The eastern steppe where Tengrism developed had more centralized, hierarchical polities than the western steppe. Tengrism has been noted as more centralized, less polytheistic, less myth-intensive and more historically focused than the paganism that grew out of the western Proto-Indo-European religion. Nonetheless, the chief god Tengri (Heaven) is considered strikingly similar to the Indo-European sky god *Dyeus and the structure of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to that of the early Turks than to the religion of any people of Near Eastern or Mediterranean antiquity.\n\nTengrists view their existence as sustained by the eternal blue sky (Tengri), the fertile mother-earth spirit (Eje) and a ruler regarded as the holy spirit of the sky. Heaven, earth, spirits of nature and ancestors provide for every need and protect all humans. By living an upright, respectful life, a human will keep his world in balance and perfect his personal Wind Horse, or spirit. The Huns of the northern Caucasus reportedly believed in two gods: Tangri Han (or Tengri Khan), considered identical to the Persian Aspandiat and for whom horses were sacrificed, and Kuar (whose victims are struck by lightning). Tengrism is practised in Sakha, Buryatia, Tuva and Mongolia in parallel with Tibetan Buddhism and Burkhanism.\n\n\"Kyrgyz\" means \"we are forty\" in the Kyrgyz language, and Kyrgyzstan's flag has 40 uniformly-spaced rays. Tengrist Khazars aided Heraclius by reportedly sending 40,000 soldiers during a joint Byzantine-Göktürk operation against the Persians.\n\nSeveral Kyrgyz politicians are advocating Tengrism to fill a perceived ideological void. Dastan Sarygulov, secretary of state and former chair of the Kyrgyz state gold-mining company, established the (Army of Tengri): a civic group promoting the values and traditions of Tengrism. Sarygulov also heads a Tengrist society in Bishkek claiming nearly 500,000 followers and an international scientific center of Tengrist studies.\n\nArticles on Tengrism have been published in social-scientific journals in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev and former Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev have called Tengrism the national, \"natural\" religion of the Turkic peoples.\n\n\nTengrism was brought to Eastern Europe by the Bulgars. It lost importance when the Uighuric kagans proclaimed Manichaeism the state religion in the eighth century.\n\nTengrism also played a large role in the religion of the Gok-Turk and Mongol Empires. \"Gok-Turk\" translates as \"celestial Turk\". Genghis Khan and several generations of his followers were Tengrian believers until his fifth-generation descendant, Uzbeg Khan, turned to Islam in the 14th century.\n\nThe original Mongol khans, followers of Tengri, were known for their tolerance of other religions. Möngke Khan, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, said: \"We believe that there is only one God, by whom we live and by whom we die, and for whom we have an upright heart. But as God gives us the different fingers of the hand, so he gives to men diverse ways to approach him.\" (\"Account of the Mongols. Diary of William Rubruck\", religious debate in court documented by William of Rubruck on May 31, 1254).\n\nAs in most ancient beliefs, there is a \"celestial world\" and an \"underground world\" in Tengrism. The only connection between these realms is the \"Tree of Worlds\" that is in the center of the worlds.\n\nThe celestial and the subterranean world are divided into seven layers (the underworld sometimes nine layers and the celestial world 17 layers). Shamans can recognize entries to travel into these realms. In the multiples of these realms, there are beings, living just like humans on the earth. They also have their own respected souls and shamans and nature spirits. Sometimes these beings visit the earth, but are invisible to people. They manifest themselves only in a strange sizzling fire or a bark to the shaman.\n\nThere are many similarities between the earth and the underworld and its inhabitants resemble humans, but have only two souls instead of three. They lack the \"Ami soul\", that produces body temperature and allows breathing. Therefore, they are pale and their blood is dark. The sun and the moon of the underworld give far less light than the sun and the moon of the earth. There are also forests, rivers and settlements underground.\n\nErlik Khan (Mongolian: Erleg Khan) one of the sons of Tengri, is the ruler of the underworld. He controls the souls here, some of them waiting to be reborn again. If a sick human is not dead yet, a shaman can move to the underworld to negotiate with Erlik to bring the person back to life. If he fails, the person dies.\n\nThe celestial world has many similarities with the earth,as if there would be no humams. There is a healthy, untouched nature here, and the natives of this place have never deviated from the traditions of their ancestors. This world is much righter than the earth and is under the auspices of Ulgen another son of Tengri. Shamans can also visit this world.\n\nOn some days, the doors of this heavenly world are opened and the light shines through the clouds. During this moment, the prayers of the shamans are most influential. A shaman performs his imaginary journey, which takes him to the heavens, by ridig a black bird, a deer or a horse or by going into the shape into these animals. Otherwise he may scale the World-Tree or pass the rainbow to reach the heavenly world.\n\nAccording to the adherence of Tengrism, the world is not only a three-dimensional environment, but also a rotating circle. Everything is bound by this circle and the tire is always renewed without stopping. The three dimensions of the Earth consists of the movement of the sun, the season which are constantly moving, and the souls of all creatures that are born again after death.\n\nIt is believed that people and animals have many souls. Generally, each person is considered to have three souls, but the names, characteristics an numbers of the souls may be different among some of the tribes: For example, for Samoyets, a Mongol tribe living in the north of Siberia, believe that women consist of four and men of five souls. Since animals also have souls, humans must respect animals.\n\nAccording Paulsen and Jultkratz, who conducted research in North America, North Asia and Central Asia by Paulsen and Jultkratz, explained two souls of this belief are the same to all people:\n\nThere are many different names for human souls among the Turks and the Mongols, but their features and meanings have not been adequately researched yet.\n\nIn addition to these spirits, Jean Paul Roux draws attention to the \"Özkonuk\" spirit mentioned in the writings from the Buddhist periods of the Uighurs.\n\nJulie Stewart, who devoted her life to research in Mongolia described the belief in the soul in one of her articles:\n\nA revival of Tengrism has played a role in Central Asian Turkic nationalism since the 1990s. It developed in Tatarstan, where the Tengrist periodical \"Bizneng-Yul\" appeared in 1997. The movement spread during the 2000s to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan and, to a lesser extent, Buryatia and Mongolia.\n\nThe term \"shamanism\" was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions across the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense. The term was used to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.\n\nSince the 1990s, Russian-language literature uses (\"Tengrism\" or \"Tengrinity\") in the general sense of Mongolian shamanism. Buryat scholar Irina S. Urbanaeva developed a theory of Tengrianist esoteric traditions in Central Asia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the revival of national sentiment in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia.\n\nAlthough Tengrism has few active adherents, its revival of a national religion reached a larger audience in intellectual circles. Presenting Islam as foreign to the Turkic peoples, adherents are found primarily among the nationalistic parties of Central Asia. Tengrism may be interpreted as a Turkic version of Russian neopaganism. A related phenomenon is the revival of Zoroastrianism in Tajikistan.\n\nBy 2006, a Tengrist society in Bishkek, an \"international scientific centre of Tengrist studies\" and a civic group (Tengir Ordo, the \"army of Tengri\") were established by Kyrgyz businessman and politician Dastan Sarygulov. His ideology incorporated ethnocentrism and Pan-Turkism, but did not receive strong support. After the Kyrgyzstani presidential elections of 2005, Sarygulov became state secretary and set up a workgroup dealing with ideological issues.\nAnother Kyrgyz proponent of Tengrism, Kubanychbek Tezekbaev, was prosecuted for inciting religious and ethnic hatred in 2011 with statements in an interview describing Kyrgyz mullahs as \"former alcoholics and murderers\".\n\nArghun expressed the association of Tengri with imperial legitimacy and military success. The majesty (\"suu\") of the khan is a divine stamp granted by Tengri to a chosen individual through which Tengri controls the world order (the presence of Tengri in the khan). In this letter, \"Tengri\" or \"Mongke Tengri\" (\"Eternal Heaven\") is at the top of the sentence. In the middle of the magnified section, the phrase \"Tengri-yin Kuchin\" (\"Power of Tengri\") forms a pause before it is followed by the phrase \"Khagan-u Suu\" (\"Majesty of the Khan\"):\n\nArghun expressed Tengrism's non-dogmatic side. The name \"Mongke Tengri\" (\"Eternal Tengri\") is at the top of the sentence in this letter to Pope Nicholas IV, in accordance with Mongolian Tengriist writing rules). The words \"Tngri\" (Tengri) and \"zrlg\" (zarlig, decree/order) are still written with vowel-less archaism:\nTurkic worship of Tengri was mocked by the Muslim Turk Mahmud al-Kashgari, who wrote: \"The infidels - may God destroy them!\" According to Kashgari, Muhammad assisted in a miraculous event where 700,000 Yabāqu infidels were defeated by 40,000 Muslims led by Arslān Tegīn; fires shot sparks at the Yabāqu from gates on a green mountain (the Yabaqu were a Turkic people).\n\n\nTengrism has been called Nestorianism by Christian sources. Turkish Nestorian manuscripts with the same rune-like characters as Old Turkic script have been found in the oasis of Turfan and the fortress of Miran. It is unknown when and by whom the Bible was first translated into Turkish. Most records in pre-Islamic Central Asia are written in the Old Turkic language. Nestorian Christianity had followers among the Uighurs. In the Nestorian sites of Turfan, a fresco depicting Palm Sunday has been discovered.\n\nThe 17th century Mongolian chronicle Altan Tobchi (\"Golden Summary\") contains references to Tengri. Tengrism was assimilated into Mongolian Buddhism while surviving in purer forms only in far-northern Mongolia. Tengrist formulas and ceremonies were subsumed into the state religion. This is similar to the fusion of Buddhism and Shinto in Japan. The Altan Tobchi contains the following prayer at its very end: \n\nTengri is mentioned many times in the Secret History of the Mongols written in 1240. The book starts by listing the ancestors of Genghis Khan starting from Borte Chino (Blue Wolf) born with \"destiny from Tengri\". Bodonchar Munkhag the 9th generation ancestor of Genghis Khan is called a \"son of Tengri\". When Temujin was brought to the Qongirat tribe at 9 years old to choose a wife, Dei Setsen of the Qongirat tells Yesugei the father of Temujin (Genghis Khan) that he dreamt of a white falcon, grasping the sun and the moon, come and sit on his hands. He identifies the sun and the moon with Yesugei and Temujin. Temujin then encounters Tengri in the mountains at the age of 12. The Taichiud had come for him when he was living with his siblings and mother in the wilderness, subsisting on roots, wild fruits, sparrows and fish. He was hiding in the thick forest of Terguun Heights. After three days hiding he decided to leave and was leading his horse on foot when he looked back and noticed his saddle had fallen. Temujin says \"I can understand the belly strap can come loose, but how can the breast strap also come loose? Is Tengri persuading me?\" He waited three more nights and decided to go out again but a tent-sized rock had blocked the way out. Again he said \"Is Tengri persuading me?\", returned and waited three more nights. Finally he lost patience after 9 days of hunger and went around the rock, cutting down the wood on the other side with his arrow-whittling knife, but as he came out the Taichiud were waiting for him there and promptly captured him. Toghrul later credits the defeat of the Merkits with Jamukha and Temujin to the \"mercy of mighty Tengri\" (paragraph 113). Khorchi of the Baarin tells Temujin of a vision given by \"Zaarin Tengri\" where a bull raises dust and asks for one of his horns back after charging the ger cart of Jamukha (Temujin's rival) while another ox harnessed itself to a big ger cart on the main road and followed Temujin, bellowing \"Heaven and Earth have agreed to make Temujin the Lord of the nation and I am now carrying the nation to you\". Temujin afterward tells his earliest companions Boorchi and Zelme that they will be appointed to the highest posts because they first followed him when he was \"mercifully looked upon by Tengri\" (paragraph 125). In the Battle of Khuiten, Buyuruk Khan and Quduga try using zad stones to cause a thunderstorm against Temujin but it backfires and they get stuck in slippery mud. They say \"the wrath of Tengri is upon us\" and flee in disorder (paragraph 143). Temujin prays to \"father Tengri\" on a high hill with his belt around his neck after defeating the Taichiud at Tsait Tsagaan Tal and taking 100 horses and 50 breastplates. He says \"I haven't become Lord thanks to my own bravery, but I have defeated my enemies thanks to the love of my father mighty Tengri\". When Nilqa Sengum the son of Toghrul Khan tries to convince him to attack Temujin, Toghrul says \"How can I think evil of my son Temujin? If we think evil of him when he is such a critical support to us, Tengri will not be pleased with us\". After Nilqa Sengum throws a number of tantrums Toghrul finally relents and says \"I was afraid of Tengri and said how can I harm my son. If you are really capable, then you decide what you need to do\".\n\nWhen Boorchi and Ogedei return wounded from the battle against Toghrul, Genghis Khan strikes his chest in anguish and says \"May Eternal Tengri decide\" (paragraph 172). Genghis Khan tells Altan and Khuchar \"All of you refused to become Khan, that is why I led you as Khan. If you would have become Khan I would have charged first in battle and brought you the best women and horses if high Khukh Tengri showed us favor and defeated our enemies\". After defeating the Keraits Genghis Khan says \"By the blessing of Eternal Tengri I have brought low the Kerait nation and ascended the high throne\" (paragraph 187). Genghis sends Subutai with an iron cart to pursue the sons of Togtoa and tells him \"If you act exposed though hidden, near though far and maintain loyalty then Supreme Tengri will bless you and support you\" (paragraph 199). Jamukha tells Temujin \"I had no trustworthy friends, no talented brothers and my wife was a talker with great words. That is why I have lost to you Temujin, blessed and destined by Father Tengri.\" Genghis Khan appoints Shikhikhutug chief judge of the Empire in 1206 and tells him \"Be my eyes to see and ears to hear when I am ordering the empire through the blessing of Eternal Tengri\" (paragraph 203). Genghis Khan appoints Muqali \"Gui Wang\" because he \"transmitted the word of Tengri when I was sitting under the spreading tree in the valley of Khorkhunag Jubur where Hotula Khan used to dance\" (paragraph 206). He gives Khorchi of the Baarin 30 wives because he promised Khorchi he would fulfill his request for 30 wives \"if what you say comes true through the mercy and power of Tengri\" (paragraph 207). Genghis mentions both Eternal Tengri and \"heaven and earth\" when he says \"By the mercy of Eternal Tengri and the blessing of heaven and earth I have greatly increased in power, united all the great nation and brought them under my reins\" (paragraph 224). Genghis orders Dorbei the Fierce of the Dorbet tribe to \"strictly govern your soldiers, pray to Eternal Tengri and try to conquer the Khori Tumed people\" (paragraph 240). After being insulted by Asha Khambu of the Tanguts of being a weak Khan Genghis Khan says \"If Eternal Tengri blesses me and I firmly pull my golden reins, then things will become clear at that time\" (paragraph 256). When Asha Khambu of the Tangut insults him again after his return from the Khwarezmian campaign Genghis Khan says \"How can we go back (to Mongolia) when he says such proud words? Though I die I won't let these words slip. Eternal Tengri, you decide\" (paragraph 265). After Genghis Khan \"ascends to Tengri\" (paragraph 268) during his successful campaign against the Tangut (Xi Xia) the wheels of the returning funeral cart gets stuck in the ground and Gilugdei Baatar of the Sunud says \"My horse-mounted divine lord born with destiny from Khukh Tengri, have you abandoned your great nation?\" Batu Khan sends a secret letter to Ogedei Khan saying \"Under the power of the Eternal Tengri, under the Majesty of my uncle the Khan, we set up a great tent to feast after we had broken the city of Meged, conquered the Orosuud (Russians), brought in eleven nations from all directions and pulled on our golden reins to hold one last meeting before going our separate directions\" (paragraph 275).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "92567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92567", "title": "Tohil", "text": "Tohil\n\nTohil () (also spelled Tojil) was a deity of the K'iche' Maya in the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerica.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish Conquest, Tohil was the patron god of the K'iche'. Tohil's principal function was that of a fire deity and he was also both a sun god and the god of rain. Tohil was also associated with mountains and he was a god of war, sacrifice and sustenance. In the K'iche' epic Popul Vuh, after the first people were created, they gathered at the mythical Tollan, the Place of the Seven Caves, to receive their language and their gods. The K'iche', and others, there received Tohil. Tohil demanded blood sacrifice from the K'iche' and so they offered their own blood and also that of sacrificed captives taken in battle. In the Popul Vuh this consumption of blood by Tohil is likened to the suckling of an infant by its mother.\n\nTohil may originally have been the same god as Q'uq'umatz, and shared the attributes of the feathered serpent with that deity, but they later diverged and each deity came to have a separate priesthood. Sculptures of a human face emerging between the jaws of a serpent were common from the end of the Classic Period through to the Late Postclassic and may represent Q'uq'umatz in the act of carrying Hunahpu, the youthful avatar of the sun god Tohil, across the sky. The god's association with human sacrifice meant that Tohil was one of the first deities that the Spanish clergy tried to eradicate after the conquest of Guatemala.\n\nThere is disagreement over the meaning of the name of the deity. It has been interpreted as meaning \"obsidian\", as deriving from the word \"toh\" (\"rain\") and as meaning \"tribute\" or \"payment\". Tohil was one of a trinity of gods worshipped by the K'iche' elite, together with Awilix and Jacawitz. The concept of a triad of deities was ancient in Maya religion, dating as far back as the Late Preclassic. The triad of K'iche' gods were sometimes referred to collectively as Tohil. Tohil has been equated with the Classic Period God K. The deity also possesses attributes that suggest a link with Mixcoatl, a hunting god of the Aztecs.\n\nTohil was the patron deity of the Kaweq lineage of the K'iche'. He was associated with a sacred deerskin bundle that was said to embody him, and one of his titles was \"Qajawal Kej\" (\"Our Lord Deer\"). The deity was associated with thunder, lightning and the sunrise.\n\nThe Kaweq lineage of the K'iche' built a temple to Tohil at their first capital Jacawitz, identified as the archaeological site of Chitinamit. Jacawitz was overlooked by a shrine to the god placed on a neighbouring peak, this shrine was known as Pa Tohil. Later the K'iche' built their main temple to Tohil at Q'umarkaj, their new capital. They made him offerings on the day \"Toh\", one of the days of their 20-day calendar cycle. The K'iche' performed the Great Dance of Tohil in honour of the deity in the month of \"Tz'ikin Q'ij\", prior to the maize harvest (which takes place in November). This dance took place at Q'umarkaj and involved a gathering of all the principal lineages subject to the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj, and as is described in the K'iche' chronicle \"Título de Totonicapán\", they were expected to bring tribute, slaves and sacrifices.\n\nThe priests of Tohil were known as \"Aj Tohil\" and were selected from the ruling Kaweq lineage of Q'umarkaj. During their ceremonies to Tohil, the K'iche' would offer quetzal feathers to the god. Writing at the end of the 17th century, Francisco Ximénez described the tradition that upon the temple human sacrifices were tied before the representation of Tohil, where the priest would open the victim's chest and cut out his heart. After sacrifice, the victim's body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a skull rack that was located in front of the temple.\n\nEquivalents to Tohil were worshipped by other groups closely related to the K'iche'. These included Belehe Toh of the Kaqchikels and Hun Toh of the Rabinal, this last name meaning \"One Rain\", a calendrical date. The Kaqchikel and the Rabinal did not merely think their own patrons were \"equivalent\" to Tohil, they claimed that they were the same deity under a different name. The K'iche' themselves claimed in the Popul Vuh that their patron Tohil was the same as Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs.\n\nThe Temple of Tohil at Q'umarkaj was the tallest structure in the city. The rubble core of the building still stands but the stone facing has been looted. The temple was originally a pyramid with stairways on all four sides, the summit shrine faced towards the rising sun in the east. This form of radial pyramid temple was built by the Maya since the Late Preclassic with examples at many archaeological sites such as Tikal, Copán and Chichen Itza, among others. According to John Lloyd Stephens, who visited the site in the 1830s, the temple base measured square and it stood high. At that time the radial stairways were more-or-less intact. The temple was originally covered in painted stucco, with the decoration including the painted image of a jaguar.\n\nDeerskins, the symbol of Tohil, are to this day venerated in many highland Maya communities and are used in dances. In the modern village of Santiago Atitlán in the Guatemalan highlands, a traditional Maya priesthood performs rites to a powerful deity addressed as \"King Martin, Lord of the Three Levels, Lord of Rain, Lord of Maize, and Lord of all the Mountains\". This priest blesses deerskins prior them being worn, with head and antlers attached, during the Dance of Martin on November 11 prior to the maize harvest. King Martin is probably a blend of Tohil and his deerskin bundle with the Roman Catholic St Martin of Tours, whose feast falls on the same day. In Rabinal, Tohil was merged with St Paul while still retaining many of his characteristics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2884509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2884509", "title": "Toypurina", "text": "Toypurina\n\nToypurina (1760–1799) was a Medicine woman of the Tongva nation—a nation also known as the Gabrieliño, due to their association with the Spanish mission San Gabriel. She is famous for her opposition of the colonial rule by Spanish Missionaries in California, and for her part in the planned 1785 rebellion against the mission San Gabriel, where she recruited 6 of the 8 villages which participated in the attack.\n\nThe causes of the San Gabriel rebellion were complex. The rebellion originated from both the Togva people's frustration at the Spanish mission's imposition on their traditional territory, as well as their oppressive rule over the Tongva's culture, language, labor, and sexual life, and the dissatisfaction and anger of the Neophytes (the Spanish term for newly Baptized Indigenous people) due to both poor treatment at the hands of the Spanish, and legal suppression of their culture and ceremonies.\n\nThe tangible threat imposed by the Spanish colonies to the Tongva nation's territorial boundaries and settlements was a primary factor for growing anger among the Tongva. There was also a rapid growth in the population of new Neophytes at Mission San Gabriel, some of whom were from villages who had had previous conflicts with the Tongva. Their presence, along with the rapid increase in livestock numbers in the area which which increased pressure on the Tongva’s ability to survive off their land, created further tension and resentment of the Mission.\n\nBaptized Indigenous peoples within Spanish missions experienced exploitation of labour and second-class citizenship under the Spanish. Tensions and resentment rose further, however, when in 1782, the Spanish governor ordered soldiers inside the missions to never allow baptized Indigenous people to have dances in their villages. In the fall, the season of the rebellion, the Tongva held their annual Mourning Ceremony, a culmination of a series of death rituals, and through its performance the souls of the deceased achieved release from the earth and entrance into the land of the dead. By the end of October 1785, Nicolás José—a Neophyte and key figure in the 1785 rebellion— and others at the mission seem to have concluded that the ban on dances was intolerable and that it jepordized the repose of their dead relative’s spirits.\n\nNicolás José approached Toypurina, who was widely renowned as a wise and talented Medicine person and whose brother was the head of her village—a kinship connection which was another likely reason for José coming to ask for her aid. José reportedly gave her beads—as for Tongva people it is customary to give a gift to doctors in return for their services —in exchange for her calling together a meeting of unbaptized Indigenous peoples from the area Toypurina agreed, and went on to contact leaders of other villages to convince them to join the revolt.\n\nOn the night of the attack, the men involved in the attack went to the mission armed with bows and arrows, Toypurina coming along unarmed with the intention of encouraging the men’s will to fight. However, someone had betrayed the Tongva to the Mission guards, and the participants and ringleaders, Toypurina included, were captured. Spanish officials sentenced five of the attack’s participants to twenty-five lashes, and another twelve to fifteen or twenty lashes. The punishments were carried out in public as a warning and lesson to all members of the mission. Toypurina, Nicolás José and two other leaders of the rebellion, Chief Tomasajaquichi of Juvit village and a man named Alijivit, from nearby village of Jajamovit, were put on trial.\n\nWhen questioned about the attack, Toypurina is famously quoted in as saying that she participated in the instigation because “[she hated] the padres and all of you, for living here on my native soil, for trespassing upon the land of my forefathers and despoiling our tribal domains. . . . I came [to the mission] to inspire the dirty cowards to fight, and not to quail at the sight of Spanish sticks that spit fire and death, nor [to] retch at the evil smell of gunsmoke—and be done with you white invaders!’ This quote, from Thomas Workman Temple II’s article “Toypurina the Witch and the Indian Uprising at San Gabriel” is arguably a mistranslation and embellishment of her actual testimony. According to the soldier who recorded her words, she stated simply that she ‘‘was angry with the Padres and the others of the Mission, because they had come to live and establish themselves in her land.’’ \n\nSpanish officials found her and the three other men on trial to be guilty of leading the attack. The three men were held at the prison (presidio) in San Diego, and Toypurina was imprisoned at the prison in San Gabriel while they awaited word of their punishment. In June 1788, nearly three years later, their sentences arrived from Mexico City: Nicolás José was banned from San Gabriel and sentenced to six years of hard labour in irons at the most distant penitentiary in the region. Toypurina was banished from Mission San Gabriel and sent to the most distant Spanish mission.\n\nAccording to trial records, Toypurina was forcibly coerced into being baptized in 1787 at Mission San Gabriel. Shortly after, she was moved to Mission San Carlos Borromeo. Two years after her Baptism, she married a Spaniard and soldier named Mañuel Montero, who had been serving at el Pueblo de Los Angeles, and received a tract of land from the governor. They lived in Monterey and had 3 children together (Cesario, Juana de Dios, and Maria Clementina). There is debate between scholars over whether her marriage to this soldier was a sign of her accepting Spanish religion and ways of life, or whether the marriage was one of convenience; Toypurina seeking marriage as a way to protect herself from the often harsh conditions of Spanish missions. On May 22, 1799, Toypurina died at Mission San Juan Bautista in northern Alta California at age 39.\n\nFollowing the Spanish authorities’ arrest of twenty-one Gabrieliños on the night of the rebellion, four of the Indians identified by the guards as the revolt’s leaders were interrogated in early January 1786. Genealogist and descendant of some of the first Spanish partakers at the mission in Alta California, Thomas Workman Temple II, was the first scholar to study this interrogation’s testimony, and published an article in 1958, “Toypurina the Witch and the Indian Uprising at San Gabriel”. To this day, despite the book's exaggeration of events it is one of the most complete accounts of the rebellion organized by Toypurina, used as a major reference in subsequent articles and books.\n\nToypurina's popularity has stretched beyond the academic realm to Californians and Americans who now regard her as a symbol of Gabrieliño resistance to the missions, as well as a primordial figure among California Native women’s protests against Spanish colonialism.            \n\nHer rebellion against Spanish missionaries was inspired by a matriarchal power structure in which women were at the center of a tribe’s ritual and spiritual life. After Toypurina’s death, Native American women continued to resist colonialism by forming a religious-political movement that awarded power and influence to female deities and entrusted women with maintaining the health and well-being of their own communities. As William Bauer writes in \"Toypurina\", she “emerges from the historical record as a woman who not only confronted Spanish expansion in southern California but also charted a path for her survival and the endurance of her people.”\n\nWell-known accounts of Toypurina’s rebellion often depict her as a treacherous witch or seductive sorceress, including Temple’s article, regarded as one of the most influential for subsequent writings on the Native woman. Nonetheless, Toypurina’s resistance against the colonial authorities through medicine and dialogue was coherent with the women’s “other means of creating counter-histories,” such as through “oral and visual traditions”. These are how subjected women under the Spanish missions succeeded in remaining within the collective memories and resist throughout generations. In “Engendering the History of Alta California, 1769-1848,” Castañeda suggests that “women themselves used witchcraft as a means of subverting the socio-sexual order sanctioned by religion and enshrined in the colonial honor code.\" Using “sexualized magic to control men and subvert the male order by symbolically using their own bodies” was their way of re-asserting their power physically, in face of the overbearing colonial rule, manifested through torture, cruelty, and cultural repression and eradication.  \n\nThe ongoing portrayals of Toypurina’s revolutionary endeavor as being shrouded in dark magic and ominous mystery testify to the consistent undermining of Native women’s own resistance feats and tools, from the onset of colonial rule to the present.\n\nToypurina has become somewhat of a pop icon for Native American female resistance in her region today, with many sketches and cartoons of her appearing on Google Images.  \n\nOn either side of El Monte, Toypurina is celebrated through monumental public works of art: Raul González, Ricardo Estrada, and Joséph “Nuke” Montalvo painted a 60-by-20-foot mural entitled \"Conoce Tus Raíces\" (2009) (Spanish for “Know Your Roots”) in East Los Angeles. The mural was completed on the main wall of Ramona Gardens, a public housing complex historically inhabited by Latin-American families. The radiant visage placed at the center of the work of Art, flashing a defiant stare and proud posture, is that of Toypurina. She is surrounded by the Ramona Gardens’ community’s numerous activities, such as children enjoying the recent library at the time of the mural’s creation, and the young residents’ sporting activities. One of the mural’s creators qualified Toypurina as incarnating “the ultimate strength, the woman fighter, the mother who protects her children from harm at Ramona Gardens.”\n\nGabrieliño traditionalist and Chicana artist, Judy Baca, also designed a 20-foot arch and a 100-foot plaza prayer mound named “Danzas Indígenas” (Indigenous Dances) in 1993, on a Metrolink commuter train platform in Baldwin Park. It was conceptualized as a public memorial dedicated to Toypurina, and as an artistic recreation of the nearby San Gabriel Mission’s historical archway. Baldwin Park also is known as a working class Latino suburb of Los Angeles, which speaks to the present relevance of Toypurina’s original struggle and her efforts’ universal appeal to all those who feel estranged from their cultures and lands under another civilization’s powerful influence, and seek to reconnect with and celebrate their roots. Some have hinted at the irony of the memorial’s location, a commuter train platform, which is typically associated with anonymity, unfamiliarity, transience, and separation of family, home, and work, in contrast with Native tribes’ communitarian organization. Baca described her work as seeking to “put memory back into a piece of the land.” A stone mound in her installation specifically was created as a replica of an original stone mound which Gabrieliños would have used for prayer.\n\nBaca’s reminder of these monuments as active efforts to incorporate Toypurina’s memory in the land may be related to the ongoing legacy of Toypurina and other resistant Native women’s own protests against colonial rule through oral and visual transmissions that became absorbed in their people’s collective memory that was constantly acted upon as it was passed down from generation to generation after their disappearance. The artworks’ remoteness from the San Gabriel Mission’s original location also attest to the relevance and celebration of her fight among various communities.\n\nOn January 13, 2007, the Studio for Southern California History included Toypurina as one of the many women who made significant contributions to California history.\n\nIn 2014 the play \"Toypurina\", about her life, premiered at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse, 320 South Mission Drive, San Gabriel, California.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24874774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24874774", "title": "Tulsi Vivah", "text": "Tulsi Vivah\n\nTulsi Vivah is the ceremonial marriage of the Tulsi (holy basil) plant to the Hindu god Shaligram or Vishnu or to his avatar, Sri Krishna. The Tulsi wedding signifies the end of the monsoon and the beginning of the wedding season in Hinduism.\n\nThe ceremonial festival is performed anytime between Prabodhini Ekadashi (the eleventh or twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik) and Kartik Poornima (the full moon of the month). The day varies regionally.\n\nTulsi is venerated as a goddess in Hinduism and is sometimes considered as a wife of Vishnu, with the epithet, \"“Vishnupriya”\", “the beloved of Vishnu”. The legend behind Tulsi Vivah and its rites are told in the scripture, \"Padma Purana\".\n\nAccording to the Hindu scripture’s, the Tulsi plant was a woman named “Vrinda” (Brinda; a synonym of Tulsi). She was married to the Asura king Jalandhar, who due to her piety and devotion to Vishnu, became invincible. Even Shiva could not defeat Jalandhar, so he requested Vishnu - the preserver in the Trinity - to find a solution. Vishnu disguised himself as Jalandhar and tricked Vrinda by touching her. She realized it was not her husband but vishnu. This destroyed her chastity.\n\nWith her chastity destroyed, Jalandhar lost his power and was killed by Shiva. Vrinda cursed Vishnu to become black in colour and to be separated from his wife, Lakshmi. This was later fulfilled when he was transformed into the black Shaligram stone (actually a fossil), and in his Rama avatar, was separated from his wife Sita, who was kidnapped by the asura king Ravana. Vrinda then drowned herself in the ocean, and the gods (or Vishnu himself) transferred her soul to a plant, which was henceforth called Tulsi. \n\nAs per a blessing by Vishnu to marry Vrinda in her next birth, Vishnu – in form of Shaligram - married Tulsi on Prabodhini Ekadashi. To commemorate this event, the ceremony of Tulsi Vivah is performed.\n\nAnother minor legend narrates that Lakshmi slew a demon on this day and remained on earth as the Tulsi plant.\n\nThe marriage of Tulsi with Vishnu/Krishna resembles the traditional Hindu wedding. The marriage ceremony is conducted at homes and at temples where a fast is observed on the Tulsi Vivah day until evening when the ceremony begins. A \"mandap\" (marriage booth) is built around the courtyard of the house where the Tulsi plant is usually planted in centre of the courtyard in a brick plaster called the \"Tulsi vrindavana\". It is believed that the soul of Vrinda resides in the plant at night and leaves in the morning. The bride Tulsi is clothed with a sari and ornaments including earrings and necklaces. A human paper face with a bindi and nose-ring may be attached to Tulsi. The groom is a brass image or picture of Vishnu or Krishna or sometimes Balarama or more frequently the Shaligram stone - the symbol of Vishnu. The image is clothed in a dhoti. Both Vishnu and Tulsi are bathed and decorated with flowers and garlands before the wedding. The couple is linked with a cotton thread (mala) in the ceremony.\n\nAt Prabhu Dham in Saunja, India, the festival is collectively celebrated by whole village which makes it a significant point of attraction. Here it is celebrated as three day festival in the hindi month of Kartik from Ekadashi to Trayodashi. The festival is started with the vedic chanting of Ramcharitmanas or Ramayana by the villagers itself. The second day is celebrated as Sobha Yatra which is of significat importance in which the special prasad is Pongal, and the third day is celebrated as Tilakotsav and Vivahotsav of Lord Vishnu and Devi Brinda. The villagers prepare 56 types of prasad known as Chapan Bhog and distributed to all. All caste takes participation in this village accordingly. Devoties including saints and mahants all over from Bihar visit this place to celebrate this festive occasion.\n\nIn Maharashtra, an important ritual in the ceremony is when the white cloth is held between the bride and the groom and the priest recites the \"Mangal Ashtaka\" mantras. These mantras formally complete the wedding. Rice mixed with vermilion is showered by the attendees on Tulsi and Vishnu at the end of the recitation of the mantras with the word \"Savadhan\" (literally \"be careful\" implying \"You are united now\". The white curtain is also removed. The attendees clap signifying approval to the wedding. Vishnu is offered sandalwood-paste, men's clothing and the sacred thread. The bride is offered saris, turmeric, vermilion and a wedding necklace called \"Mangal-sutra\", worn by married women. Sweets and food cooked for an actual wedding are cooked for Tulsi Vivah too. This ceremony is mostly performed by women. The prasad of sugar-cane, coconut chips, fruits and groundnut is distributed to devotees.\n\nThe expenses of the wedding are usually borne by a daughter-less couple, who act as the parents of Tulsi in the ritual wedding. The giving away of the daughter Tulsi (\"kanyadaan\") to Krishna is considered meritorious to the couple. The bridal offerings to Tulsi are given to a Brahmin priest or female ascetics after the ceremony.\n\nIn two Rama temples in Saurashtra, the ceremony is more elaborate. An invitation card is sent to the groom's temple by the bride's temple. On Prabodhini Ekadashi, a \"barat\" bridal procession of \"Lalji\" - an image of Vishnu - sets off to the bride's temple. Lalji is placed in a palanquin and accompanied by singing and dancing devotees. The barat is welcomed on the outskirts of Tulsi's village and the ceremonial marriage is carried at the temple. At the bride's side, Tulsi is planted in an earthen pot for the ceremony. People desirous of children perform \"Kanyadaan\" from Tulsi's side acting as her parents. Bhajans are sung throughout the night and in the morning the barat of Lalji returns to their village with Tulsi.\n\n\n[Tulasi kalyana ]"}

It was designed and the construction overseen by one of New Zealand’s most famous architects, and a senior member of the Order, James Walter Chapman-Taylor.\n\nWhare Ra was one of the last surviving Temples that could trace its lineage back to the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. It was the only Temple to operate in a permanent, purpose-built building.\n\nThe foundations for the Order in New Zealand were laid by Reginald Gardiner (1872-1959). Born in New South Wales, Australia, he was the son of an Anglican vicar and brother of the Anglican vicar of St Luke's Church, Havelock North, New Zealand, where he finally settled in 1907. He formed about him an artistic, cultural and spiritual group whose activities became known as the \"Havelock Work\", and produced a publication called “The Forerunner”. The Havelock Work grew and in time the group became known as the Society of the Southern Cross.\n\nIn 1910, Revd. Father J. Fitzgerald travelled to New Zealand on Church business, and was introduced to the group. He was suitably impressed, and prior to his return to Britain, promised to stay in touch and to do what he could to help. One of the last G.H. Chiefs of the Order later recollected:\n\nIn due course he wrote that if further progress were to be made, that certain people of his acquaintance would need to come out from England.\n\nIn 1912 Dr. Robert Felkin, Chief of the Order of the Stella Matutina arrived, assisted by his appointment as Inspector of the Australasian Colleges of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia by William Wynn Westcott, one of the original Chiefs of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Supreme Magus of the S.R.I.A.\n\nTravelling with his wife and daughter, he initiated a group of twenty-four members into the Order, twelve of whom were advanced to the \"Second Order\". A sizeable piece of land was donated, and a home for the Order constructed, which they named “Whare Ra”, or House of the Sun. It was in the basement of this house, that the large Temple was built.\n\nDuring their three-month stay, sufficient members had been initiated to make a beginning, and the building commissioned and sufficiently advanced to enable its Consecration. Before leaving New Zealand to return to England, a Warrant was issued establishing the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No. 49 of the Order of the Stella Matutina. The three Chiefs that appeared on the Warrant were Reginald Gardiner, Mason Chambers, and probably Harold Large (or possibly Thomas Chambers).\n\nA trust had been set up to manage the monetary affairs of the Order, with the trustees being Mason Chambers, his wife Margaret Chambers, the younger John Chambers, and Reginald Gardiner. The trust deed stated that the group was formed:\n\nJohn von Dadelszen, who spent most of his adult life in the Order, and who had been a Temple Warden and one of its last Chiefs, stated that the Order:\n\nA contemporary of John von Dadelszen, and fellow Chief Archie Shaw, wrote of the role of the three Chiefs, in his 1960 address to members:\n\nIn 1916, at the invitation of the members of the New Zealand branch, and with the offer of life tenancy of “Whare Ra”, Dr Felkin and his family returned to New Zealand for good. He issued a new constitution for the Order of the Stella Matutina in the same year, informing members that the Mother Temple of the Order was now in New Zealand. The Order, governed by three ruling Chiefs, prospered under their leadership. By the time of the death of Dr Felkin in 1926, it had a very active membership and was well established – its membership included two Anglican Bishops, General Sir Arthur Russell, Lord Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand, members of Parliament, and local dignitaries and officials.\n\nEntrance to the Temple, by the candidate for initiation, was via a secret staircase behind a wardrobe, located in Dr Felkin's surgery.\n\nIn 1931 a devastating earthquake hit the area, and many buildings were levelled or damaged. With its fortress like construction, Whare Ra was unscathed.\n\nMr Gardiner replaced Dr Felkin as a Greatly Honoured Chief of the Order, and with Mrs and Miss Felkin, ruled for a further stable period of 33 years.\n\nIn its heyday during the 1930s, it has been estimated that its membership numbered some 300 men and woman, and during its 60-plus-year history that approximately 400–500 people had been initiated. It was during this time that the Temple distanced itself from the affairs of the Stella Matutina in Britain, and renamed itself simply the Order of Smaragdum Thallasses.\n\nIn 1949, in the last issue of The Lantern, Mrs. Felkin stated:\n\nIn the Annual Report for year ending 31 December 1959, the Order's Cancellarius reported that:\n\nIn 1959 Mr Gardiner and Mrs Felkin died, followed by Miss Felkin three years later.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus Research Society visited Whare Ra. He reported this visit to members of the society in one of their bulletins.\n\nHowever, by 1978 it was clear that Whare Ra was a spent force. On 24 August 1978 a letter was circulated to members announcing the closure:\n\nMuch to the regret of many esoteric historians they burnt most of the group's regalia, Temple furnishings and records. Fortunately some things survived, including the Temple's pillars, the two sphinxes which flanked either side of the dais steps, and many copies of the rituals and lectures were passed on and preserved.\n\nWhare Ra is now in private hands, and has been registered as a category \"I\" protected building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.\n"}
