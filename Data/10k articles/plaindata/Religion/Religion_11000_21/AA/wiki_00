{"id": "1733114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1733114", "title": "Abakuá", "text": "Abakuá\n\nAbakuá is an Afro-Cuban men's initiatory fraternity, or secret society, which originated from fraternal associations in the Cross River region of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon. Known generally as Ekpe, Egbo, Ngbe, or Ugbe among the multi-lingual groups in the region. It was believed that \"Ñáñigos\", as the members are known, could be transformed into leopards to stalk their enemies. In contemporary Haiti, where secret societies have remained strong, an elite branch of the army that was set up to instill fear in the restless masses was named The Leopards. Among the less mystical \"Ñáñigo\" revenges was the ability to turn people over to slavers. In Africa they were notorious operators who had made regular deals for profit with slavers.\n\nAbakuá has been described as \"an Afro-Cuban version of Freemasonry\".\n\nThe creolized Cuban term \"Abakuá\" is thought to refer to the Abakpa area in southeast Nigeria, where the society was active. The first such societies were established by Africans in the town of Regla, Havana, in 1836. This remains the main area of Abakuá implantation, especially the district of Guanabacoa in eastern Havana, and in Matanzas where Afro-Cuban culture is vibrant.\n\nAbakuá members derive their belief systems and traditional practices from the Igbo, Efik, Efut, and Ibibio spirits that lived in the forest. Ekpe and synonymous terms were names of both a forest spirit and a leopard related secret society.\n\nMembers of this society came to be known as \"ñañigos\", a word used to designate the street dancers of the society. The \"ñañigos\", who were also called \"diablitos\", were well known by the general population in Cuba through their participation in the Carnival on the Day of the Three Kings, when they danced through the streets wearing their ceremonial outfit, a multicolored checkerboard dress with a conical headpiece topped with tassels.\n\nThe oaths of loyalty to the Abakuá society’s sacred objects, members, and secret knowledge taken by initiates are a lifelong pact which creates a sacred kinship among the members. The duties of an Abakuá member to his ritual brothers at times surpass even the responsibilities of friendship, and the phrase \"Friendship is one thing, and the Abakuá another\" is often heard. One of the oaths made during initiation is that one will not reveal the secrets of the Abakuá to non-members, which is why the Abakuá have remained hermetic for over 160 years.\n\nBesides acting as a mutual aid society, the Abakuá performs rituals and ceremonies, called \"plantes\", full of theatricality and drama which consists of drumming, dancing, and chanting in the secret Abakuá language. Knowledge of the chants is restricted to Abakuá members, but Cuban scholars have long thought that the ceremonies express Abakuá cultural history. Other ceremonies such as initiations and funerals, are secret and occur in the sacred room of the Abakuá temple, called the \"famba\".\n\nThe rhythmic dance music of the Abakuá combined with Bantu traditions of the Congo contributed to the musical tradition of the rumba.\n\nAlthough hermetic and little known even within Cuba, an analysis of Cuban popular music recorded from the 1920s until the present reveals Abakuá influence in nearly every genre of Cuban popular music. Cuban musicians who are members of the Abakuá have continually documented key aspects of their society’s history in commercial recordings, usually in their secret Abakuá language. The Abakuá have commercially recorded actual chants of the society, believing that outsiders cannot interpret them. Because Abakuá represented a rebellious, even anti-colonial, aspect of Cuban culture, these secret recordings have been very popular.\n\nIreme is the Cuban term for the masked Abakuá dancer known as \"Idem\" or \"Ndem\" in the Cross River region. The masquerade dancer is carefully covered in a tight-fitting suit and hood, and dances with a broom and a staff. The broom serves to cleanse faithful members, while the staff chastises enemies and Abakuá traitors. During initiation ceremonies, the staff is called the \"Erí nBan nDó\", while during mournings and wakes it is called AlanManguín Besuá.\n\nDue to the secrecy of the society, little is known of the Abakuá language. It is assumed to be a creolized version of Efik or Ibibio, both closely related languages or dialects from the Cross River region of Nigeria, because this is the cultural region and ethnic groups where the society originated.\n\nIf it is indeed a creolized version of either Efik or Ibibio, it could be compared in purpose and in its formation and origins to other African languages, or specialized vocabularies derived from African languages, used in other Afro-American religions, such as:\n\n\"Abacuá\" also describes a group of Afro-Cuban people of the carabalí as well as their style of music and their percussion instruments.\n\nThe Abakuá Afro-Latin Dance Company, a dance company based in New York City, draws its namesake from this origin. The purpose for selecting this name was to recognize the company's link to the origins of the type of music the company performs to. The company does not claim to be an authentic representation of the specific style native to Abakuá but rather, an amalgamation of movements native to Afro-Cuban/Caribbean culture and the development of the company's own unique style entitled Afro-Latin Funk. The selection of the name \"Afro-Latin\" was done in order to identify the company's presence within Latin and Hispanic culture as a whole.\n\n\n"}

Fortified Crusader castles, Islamic madrassas, Byzantine churches, Templer houses, Arab arches and minarets, Russian Orthodox onion domes, Bauhaus-style modernist buildings, sculptural concrete Brutalist architecture, and soaring glass-sided skyscrapers all are part of the architecture of Israel.\n\nThe Arabs built small stone houses on the hillsides with flat or dome roofs. The Crusaders built fortresses on strategic hilltops. The Christians built churches to mark sites where Jesus walked. The Templers built homes with tiled roofs like those in the German countryside. The British Mandatory authorities passed a law requiring all construction in Jerusalem to be of Jerusalem stone and introduced the idea of garden suburbs. In the early years of statehood, Israel built rows of concrete tenements to accommodate the masses of new immigrants to replace the huts, tents and packing crates of the maabarot.\nFirst named the \"White City\" in 1984, the White City of Tel Aviv has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As property values have risen, skyscrapers are going up around the country. The Azrieli Sarona Tower in Tel Aviv is the tallest building in Israel to date.\n\nSensing the political changes taking place in central Europe around the time of the First World War, as well as the stirrings of Zionist ideals about the re-establishment of a homeland for Jews, numerous Jewish architects from around Europe emigrated to Palestine during the first three decades of the 20th century. While much innovative planning occurred during the time of the British Mandatory authorities, 1920-1948, in particular the town plan for Tel Aviv in 1925 by Patrick Geddes, it would be architecture designed in the modernist \"Bauhaus\" style that would fill the plots of that plan; among the architects who emigrated to Palestine at that time, and who went on to establish formidable careers were: Yehuda Magidovitch, Shmuel Miestechkin, Lucian Korngold, Jacov Ornstein, Salomon Gepstein, Josef Neufeld and Genia Gideoni.\n\nDov Karmi, Zeev Rechter and Arieh Sharon were among the leading architects of the early 1950s. Rudolf (Reuven) Trostler played an important role in designing the country's early industrial buildings. Dora Gad designed the interiors of the Knesset, the Israel Museum, the country's first large hotels, the Jewish National and University Library, El Al planes and Zim passenger ships.Amnon Niv designed Moshe Aviv Tower, Israel's tallest building. David Resnick was a Brazilian-born Israeli architect who won the Israel Prize in architecture and the Rechter Prize for iconic Jerusalem buildings such as the Israel Goldstein Synagogue and Brigham Young University on Mount Scopus. \nUntil the end of the 19th century, the traditional Arab rural house in the villages of what was then Palestine consisted of a single room without partitions, divided into levels in accordance with various functions carried out in the house:\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, a residential story characterized by a cross-vault was added above the traditional house, creating a space between the floor with the livestock in the bottom room and the residential story. A separate entrance was installed in each story.\n\nFortified houses were built outside the village core and had two stories: a raised ground floor with tiny windows used for raising livestock and storage, and a separate residential floor with large windows and balconies. In the courtyard was a small structure used for storage. Sometimes a tabun baking oven would be located inside it.\n\nThe first modern building technology was evident in the farmhouses. Iron beams were used and the roofs were made of concrete and roof tiles. These structures had balconies with a view and wide doorways.\n\nModern housing built during the British Mandate was urban in character, with flat roofs, rectangular doorways and painted floor tiles.\n\nThe Pavie House in Neve Daniel is a rare case of non geometric biomorphic architecture (blobitecture) in Israel. Yonatan Kanti of the Israeli daily \"Ma'ariv\" compared Pavie architectural style to the futurism of Eero Saarinen's TWA Flight Center.\n\nThe architecture of Tel Aviv's movie theaters can be seen as a reflection of Israeli architectural history: The first cinema, the Eden, opened in 1914, was an example of the eclectic style that was in vogue at the time, combining European and Arab traditions. The Mugrabi cinema, designed in 1930, was built in art deco style. In the late 1930s, the Esther, Chen and Allenby theaters were prime examples of the Bauhaus style. In the 1950s and 1960s, brutalist style architecture was exemplified by the Tamar cinema built inside the historic Solel Boneh building on Allenby Street.\n\nThe persistent existential threat posed by rival ideologies impacts how architecture is used as a powerful means of determining who gets to control and use land in Israel. Eyal Weizman advances a detailed argument concerning how the power relations expressed through architecture explain built form. .\n\nFrom 1948, architecture in Israel was dominated by the need to house masses of new immigrants. The Brutalist concrete style suited Israel's harsh climate and paucity of natural building materials. Municipal laws in Jerusalem require that all buildings be faced with local Jerusalem stone. The ordinance dates back to the British Mandate and the governorship of Sir Ronald Storrs and was part of a master plan for the city drawn up in 1918 by Sir William McLean, then city engineer of Alexandria.\n\nA small Bauhaus Museum was established in Tel Aviv in 2008. The Munio Gitai Weinraub Museum of Architecture opened in Haifa in 2012.\n\n\nn\n\n"}

{"id": "884197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=884197", "title": "Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary", "text": "Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary\n\nBinky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary is a comic-book story by American cartoonist Justin Green, published in 1972. Green takes the persona of Binky Brown to tell of the \"compulsive neurosis\" with which he struggled in his youth and which he blamed on his strict Roman Catholic upbringing. Green was later diagnosed with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and came to see his problems in that light.\n\nIn the story, sinful thoughts that he cannot control torment Binky Brown; to his alarm, phallic objects become literal penises and project what he calls \"pecker rays\" at religious objects such as churches and statues of the Virgin Mary. He develops an internal set of rules to obey and punishments for breaking them. The torment does not subside, and he comes to reject the Catholic Church in defiance as the source of it. The work combines a wide variety of visual and narrative techniques in a style that echoes the torment of its protagonist.\n\n\"Binky Brown\" had an immediate influence on contemporaries in : such cartoonists as Aline Kominsky, Robert Crumb, and Art Spiegelman soon turned to producing similarly confessional works. \"Binky Brown\" has gained a reputation as the first major work of autobiography in English-language comics, and many aspects of its approach have become widespread in underground and alternative comics.\n\nJustin Green (b. 1945) was born to a Jewish father and Catholic mother and raised Catholic. As a child he at first attended a Catholic parochial school, and later transferred to a school where most students were Jews. He rejected the Catholic faith in 1958 as he believed it caused him \"compulsive neurosis\" that decades later was diagnosed as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nGreen was studying painting at the Rhode Island School of Design when in 1967 he discovered the work of Robert Crumb and turned to cartooning, attracted to what he called Crumb's \"harsh drawing stuffed into crookedly-drawn panels\". He experimented with his artwork to find what he called an \"inherent and automatic style as a conduit for the chimerical forms in own psyche\". He dropped out of an MFA program at Syracuse University when in 1968 he felt a \"call to arms\" to move to San Francisco, where the nascent scene was blossoming amid the counterculture there. That year Green introduced a religion-obsessed character in the strip \"Confessions of a Mad School Boy\", published in a periodical in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1968. He named the character Binky Brown in \"Binky Brown Makes up His Own Puberty Rites\", published in the 17th issue of the underground comic book \"Yellow Dog\" in 1969. \"The Agony of Binky Brown\" followed in the first issue of \"Laugh in the Dark\", published by Last Gasp in 1971.\n\nAt the time, comic books had a reputation in the US as low-brow children's entertainment, and the public often associated them with juvenile delinquency. Comics had little cultural capital and few American cartoonists had challenged the perception that the medium was inherently incapable of mature artistic expression.\n\nGreen takes the persona of Binky Brown, who opens the story writing a confession of the neurosis that has tortured him since puberty. In his childhood, he knocks over a statue of the Virgin Mary and feels intense guilt over this affront to his mother and to God. Binky is raised a Catholic and undergoes the religious indoctrination of nuns at a strict Catholic parochial school that commonly employs corporal punishment. He forms an image of a vengeful God, which fills him with feelings of fear and guilt.\n\nBinky's intrusive thoughts bring him to believe his body is trying to lead him to sin and eternal punishment. He develops an internal system of rules to cope with these thoughts and punishes himself for violations. He wards off thoughts and fantasies he cannot control and that give him guilt by silently repeating the word \"noyatin\" to himself, a contraction of the repentant \"not a sin\".\n\nAs he approaches adolescence and becomes aware of his sexuality, he begins to see common objects as phalluses—phalluses that project unholy rays. These objects include his fingers, his toes, and his own penis, and he obsessively tries to deflect their \"pecker rays\" from reaching holy items such as churches or statues of Mary. Binky finds his anguish all-consuming as he imagines the destruction he cannot avoid, and spends hours praying to God for forgiveness. As an adult, Binky confronts his faith and by smashing a set of statues of the Virgin Mary declares himself free of the Church and its influence on him.\n\nGreen spent about a year working on the 44-page \"Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary\". He took a few months making cards of what he called \"factual incidents or neurotic habits\" to incorporate. During the seven months he drew the work Green received a monthly stipend of $150 from Ron Turner, the founder of underground publisher Last Gasp Eco-Funnies. Last Gasp published the story as a one-shot comic book in 1972—Green's first solo title. It went through two print runs of 55,000 copies each with a \"Youngsters Prohibited\" label on the cover.\n\nIn 1990, Green had an essay published entitled \"The Binky Brown Matter\" in \"The Sun\". In the essay, he describes the OCD with which he was diagnosed years after completing \"Binky Brown\". Last Gasp reprinted the story in 1995 in \"The Binky Brown Sampler\", a softcover anthology of Binky Brown strips with an introduction by Art Spiegelman and an expanded version of \"The Binky Brown Matter\".\n\nGreen sold the original artwork to the strip in the 1970s; McSweeney's staff contacted the owner of the artwork, Christine Valenza, to make fresh scans for a standalone reprinting in 2009, overseen by McSweeney's editor Eli Horowitz. It had a print run of 5,000 copies and reprints the artwork at the full size of the originals; the page reproductions mimic the actual pages, including marks, smudges, and corrections. In 2011, the publisher Stara published a French translation by Harry Morgan titled \"Binky Brown rencontre la Vierge Marie\", and La Cúpula published a Spanish translation by Francisco Pérez Navarro titled \"Binky Brown conoce a la virgen María\".\n\nThe story takes the form of a guilt-ridden confession. In the opening, the adult Binky hangs over a sickle, bound from head to toe and listening to \"Ave Maria\" as he draws with a pen in his mouth. He declares his intention: \"to purge myself of the compulsive neurosis which I have served since I officially left Catholicism on Halloween, 1958.\" He justifies the work to communicate with the \"many others are slaves to their neuroses\" and who, despite believing themselves isolated, number so many that they \"would entwine the globe many times over in a vast chain of common suffering\".\n\nThough Green built \"Binky Brown\" on an autobiographical base he fabricated many scenes—such as one in which Binky is bullied by two third-graders—\"to suggest or convey a whole generalized idea about some subjective feeling, such as order or fear or guilt\". To critic Charles Hatfield \"Binky Brown\" displays a \"radical subjectivity\" that calls into question the notion of objectivity in autobiography. The presentation is insistently subjective and non-literal in its visuals.\n\nDespite the heavy tone, humor is prominent. The work is conscious of its own creation—Green's drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are constant reminders of it throughout. Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt-Keeper in EC Comics' \"Tales from the Crypt\" series from the 1950s. Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and as a way to tie together the past and present timeframes. There is a disconnect in that the narrator refers to his younger self as \"he\". Other references to comics include a \"Sinstopper's Guidebook\", which alludes to Dick Tracy's \"Crimestopper's Textbook\" and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background.\n\nGreen employs numerous Catholic symbols, such as a word balloon adorned with symbols of Christ's martyrdom to represent the depth of Binky's desperation. Catholic works such as a catechism and \"Treasure Chest\" parochial comics appear throughout the work.\n\nDespite strict censorship in other media in the US, explicit sexuality was common in underground . \"Binky Brown\" was the first work of autobiographical comics to depict explicit sexuality: penises appear throughout, and Binky masturbates in one scene. The central symbol of the penis recurs sometimes subtly as in the images of pencils used to craft the work, and more often explicitly, as every phallic-like object Green sees because a literal \"pecker ray\"-projecting penis in Binky's mind.\n\nArt Spiegelman described the artwork as \"quirky and ungainly\". Though it appears awkward, Green put considerable effort into elements such as graphical perspective, and draws attention to his craft by depicting himself drawing and by placing the drawing manuals \"Perspective\" and \"Fun With a Pencil\" in the backgrounds. In contrast to the mundane tales of Harvey Pekar, another prominent early practitioner of autobiographical comics, Green makes wide use of visual metaphors. In \"Binky Brown\" symbols become literal, as when Binky imagines himself becoming a snowball hurtling into Hell or as a fish chased by a police officer who wears a crucifix. The work displays a wide array of visual techniques: diagrammatic arrows; mock-scholarly documentation; a great variety in panel size, composition, and layout; and a range of contrasting mechanical and organic rendering techniques, such as screentone alongside dense hand-drawn hatching. The symbolic and technical collide where the Virgin Mary becomes the vanishing point of Binky's converging \"pecker rays\".\n\nCritic Joseph Witek sees the shifting between different modes of traditional comics representation at times presents a literalist view through \"windowlike panels\", and at others \"representational, symbolic, allegorical, associative, and allusive\", an approach analogous to \"Binky Brown's massively and chaotically overdetermined subjectivity\". Witek finds roots for the fractured psychological landscape of \"Binky Brown\" in the comics of earlier eras: the unrestrained psyches in the dreams of Winsor McCay's \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\", the irrational, shifting landscapes of George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\", and Superman's obsessively contrarian nemesis Bizarro.\n\nIn \"Binky Brown\" Green blames the Catholic Church for his psychological troubles; years later, he was diagnosed with OCD, and came to see these episodes in that light rather than as the fault of the Church. He nevertheless continued to blame the Church for contributing to his anxieties and maintained that religion has a magnifying influence on the condition. He said the abandoning of both religion and recreational drugs made it easier to cope with his condition. In 1990 a Catholic priest raised concerns that \"Binky Brown\" may be harmful to minors; Green countered that he believed it was the Church that was harming minors. Green has likened his OCD to a \"split vision\" which made him \"both the slave to the compulsion and the detached observer\".\n\nLiterary scholar Hillary Chute sees the work as addressing feminist concerns of \"embodiment and representation\" as it \"delves into and forcefully pictures non-normative sexuality\". Chute affirms that despite its brevity \"Binky Brown\" merits the label \"graphic novel\" as \"the quality of work, its approach, parameters, and sensibility\" mark a \"seriousness of purpose\".\n\nGreen recounted \"a strong energy\" that \"Binky Brown\" drew from his readership, the first significant response he got from his work. The story has had a wide influence on underground and alternative comics, where its self-mocking and confessional approach has inspired numerous cartoonists to expose intimate and embarrassing details of their lives. Under the influence of \"Binky Brown\", in 1972 Aline Kominsky published her first strip, the autobiographical \"Goldie: A Neurotic Woman\" in \"Wimmen's Comix\" . Other contemporary underground cartoonists were soon to incorporate confessional autobiography into their work. Robert Crumb followed the same year with \"The Confessions of R. Crumb\" and continued with numerous other such strips. Art Spiegelman, who had seen \"Binky Brown\" in mid-creation in 1971, went as far as to state that \"without \"Binky Brown\" there would be no \"Maus\"\"—Spiegelman's most prominent work. The same year as \"Binky Brown\"s publication, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip to the first issue of \"Funny \", which Green edited and was published by Apex Novelties. Spiegelman delivered the three-page \"Maus\" in which Nazi cats persecute Jewish mice, inspired by his father's experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp; years later he revisited the theme in the graphic novel of the same name. Comics critic Jared Gardner asserts that, while underground was associated with countercultural iconoclasm, the movement's most enduring legacy was to be autobiography.\n\n\"Binky Brown\" went out of print for two decades after selling its initial print runs, during which time enthusiasts traded copies or photocopies. Green made his living painting signs, and contributed occasional cartoon strips to various publications. Green used the Binky Brown persona over the years in short strips and prose pieces that appeared in underground periodicals such as \"Arcade\" and \"Weirdo\". \"Sweet Void of Youth\" in 1976 follows Binky from high school to age thirty-one, torn between cartooning and more respected forms of art. Aside from occasional one-off strips, his more regular cartooning appeared in the ongoing strips \"The Sign Game\", in \"Signs of the Times\" magazine, and \"Musical Legends in America\", in \"Pulse!\" Such later work has attracted far less attention than \"Binky Brown\".\nThough autobiographical elements had appeared earlier in the work of underground cartoonists such as Crumb, Spain, and Kim Deitch, \"Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary\" has gained credit as the first important work of autobiographical comics in English. To Charles Hatfield \"Binky Brown\" is \"the ur-example of confessional literature in comics\"; for Paul Gravett Green was \"the first neurotic visionary to unburden his uncensored psychological troubles\"; Douglas Wolk declared Green and his work \"ahead of the memoirist curve\"; Art Spiegelman declared: \"What the Brontë sisters did for Gothic romance, what Tolkien did for sword-and-sorcery, Justin Green did for confessionary, autobiographical \"; and \"Publishers Weekly\" called the work the \"Rosetta Stone of autobiographical comics\". \n\n\"Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary\" has appealed mostly to comics fans and cartoonists, and has gained little recognition from mainstream audiences and arts critics. Spiegelman has speculated this neglect comes from the nature of the comics medium; in contrast to explicit works such as Philip Roth's \"Portnoy's Complaint\", the penises in Green's work are visual.\n\nAccording to underground historian Patrick Rosenkranz, Green represents a break with past convention by being \"the first to openly render his personal demons and emotional conflicts within the confines of a comic\". Green denied credit, calling confessional autobiography \"a \"fait accompli\", a low fruit ripe for the plucking\", examples of which abounded in literary works he had read by James Joyce, James T. Farrell, and Philip Roth. He has accepted credit for \"anticipat the groundswell in literature about obsessive compulsive disorder by almost two decades\", for which he knew of no precedent. Chute sees major themes of isolation and coping with OCD recurring in autobiographical works such as Howard Cruse's \"Stuck Rubber Baby\" (1995) and Alison Bechdel's \"Fun Home\" (2006). Hatfield sees echoes of Green's unrestrained approach to dealing with a mental condition in Madison Clell's \"Cuckoo\" (2002)—about Clell's dissociative identity disorder—and in David B.'s \"Epileptic\" (2003).\n\nTo cartoonist Jim Woodring, Green's autobiographical work \"has never been surpassed\". Woodring's own autobiographical work in \"Jim\" draws from his dreams rather than his waking life. British-American cartoonist Gabrielle Bell sympathized with Brown's approach, which she described as \"talking about his feelings or his emotional state when he was illustrating it with striking images that were sort of absurd or a weird juxtaposition\". Green's influence extended overseas to cartoonists such as the Dutch Peter Pontiac, who drew inspiration from \"Binky Brown\" and \"Maus\" to produce \"Kraut\" (2000), about his father who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. \n\nThe story ranked No. 9 on \"The Comics Journal\"s list of the best hundred English-language comics of the 20th century, and featured as the cover artwork for the autobiographical comics issue of the journal \"Biography\" (Vol. 31, No. 1). Artwork to \"Binky Brown\" appeared in an exhibition of Green's work at Shake It Records in Cincinnati in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7274740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7274740", "title": "Buddhism and Hinduism", "text": "Buddhism and Hinduism\n\nHinduism and Buddhism have common origins in the Ganges culture of northern India during the so-called \"second urbanisation\" around 500 BC. They have shared parallel beliefs that have existed side by side, but also pronounced differences.\n\nBuddhism attained prominence in the Indian subcontinent as it was supported by royal courts, but started to decline after the Gupta era and virtually disappeared from India in the 11th century CE except in some pockets of India. It has continued to exist outside India and is the major religion in several Asian countries.\n\nCertain Buddhist teachings appear to have been formulated in response to ideas presented in the early Upanishads – in some cases concurring with them, and in other cases criticizing or re-interpreting them.\n\nThe influence of Upanishads, the earliest philosophical texts of Hindus on Buddhism has been a subject of debate among scholars. While Radhakrishnan, Oldenberg and Neumann were convinced of Upanishadic influence on the Buddhist canon, Eliot and Thomas highlighted the points where Buddhism was opposed to Upanishads.\n\nBuddhism may have been influenced by some Upanishadic ideas, it however discarded their orthodox tendencies. In Buddhist texts he is presented as rejecting avenues of salvation as \"pernicious views\". Later schools of Indian religious thought were influenced by this interpretation and novel ideas of the Buddhist tradition of beliefs.\n\nIn later years, there is significant evidence that both Buddhism and Hinduism were supported by Indian rulers, regardless of the rulers' own religious identities. Buddhist kings continued to revere Hindu deities and teachers and many Buddhist temples were built under the patronage of Hindu rulers. This was because Buddhism has never been considered an alien religion to that of Hinduism in India but as only one of the many strains of Hinduism. Kalidas' work shows the ascension of Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. By the eighth century, Shiva and Vishnu had replaced Buddha in pujas of royalty.\n\nThe Buddha approved many of the terms already used in philosophical discussions of his era; however, many of these terms carry a different meaning in the Buddhist tradition. For example, in the Samaññaphala Sutta, the Buddha is depicted presenting a notion of the \"three knowledges\" (\"tevijja\") – a term also used in the Vedic tradition to describe knowledge of the Vedas – as being not texts, but things that he had experienced (these are not noble truths). The true \"three knowledges\" are said to be constituted by the process of achieving enlightenment, which is what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of the night of his enlightenment.\n\nKarma (Sanskrit: कर्म from the root kṛ, \"to do\") is a word meaning \"action\" or \"activity\" and often implies its subsequent results (also called karma-phala, \"the fruits of action\"). It is commonly understood as a term to denote the entire cycle of cause and effect as described in the philosophies of a number of cosmologies, including those of Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nKarma is a central part of Buddhist teachings. In Buddha's teaching, karma is a direct intentional result of a person's word, thought and/or action in life. In pre-Buddhist Vedic culture, karma has to do with whether or not the ritualistic actions are correctly performed. Little emphasis is placed on moral conduct in the early Vedic conception. In Buddhism, by contrast, a person's words, thoughts and/or actions form the basis for good and bad karma: sila (moral conduct) goes hand in hand with the development of meditation and wisdom. Buddhist teachings carry a markedly different meaning from pre-Buddhist conceptions of karma.\n\nDharma (Sanskrit, Devanagari: धर्म or Pāli Dhamma, Devanagari: धम्म) means Natural Law, Reality or Duty, and with respect to its significance for spirituality and religion might be considered the Way of the Higher Truths. A Hindu appellation for Hinduism itself is \"Sanātana Dharma\", which translates as \"the eternal dharma.\" Similarly, Buddhadharma is an appellation for Buddhism. The general concept of dharma forms a basis for philosophies, beliefs and practices originating in India. The four main ones are Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism (Jaina Dharma), and Sikhism (Sikha Dharma), all of whom retain the centrality of dharma in their teachings. In these traditions, beings that live in harmony with dharma proceed more quickly toward, according to the tradition, Dharma Yukam, Moksha, or Nirvana (personal liberation). Dharma can refer generally to religious duty, and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue.\n\nThe term \"Buddha\" too has appeared in Hindu scriptures before the birth of Gautama Buddha. In the \"Vayu Purana\", sage Daksha calls Lord Shiva as Buddha.\n\n\nA mantra (मन्त्र) is a religious syllable or poem, typically from the Sanskrit language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as spiritual conduits, words or vibrations that instill one-pointed concentration in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras existed in the historical Vedic religion, Zoroastrianism and the Shramanic traditions, and thus they remain important in Buddhism and Jainism as well as other faiths of Indian origin such as Sikhism.\n\nThe practice of Yoga is intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Buddhism. However, there are distinct variations in the usage of yoga terminology in the two religions.\n\nIn Hinduism, the term \"Yoga\" commonly refers to the eight limbs of yoga as defined in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, written some time after 100 BCE, and means \"yoke\", with the idea that one's individual atman, or soul, would yoke or bind with the monistic entity that underlies everything (brahman). Yoga in Hinduism also known as being 'complex', based on yoking (integrating). Yoga defines a specific process: it has an emphasis on knowledge and practice, as well as being known to be 'mature' and difficult. The most basic meaning of this Sanskrit term is with technique. The technique of the different forms of yoga is what makes the practice meaningful. Yoga is not an easy or simple practice, viyoga is what is described as simple. Yoga is difficult in the fact of displaying the faith and meaning of Hinduism. Many Hindus tend to pick and choose between the five forms of yoga because of the way they live their life and how they want to practice it in the form they are most connected to.\n\nIn the Vajrayana Buddhism of Tibet, however, the term \"Yoga\" is simply used to refer to any type of spiritual practice; from the various types of tantra (like Kriyayoga or Charyayoga) to 'Deity yoga' and 'guru yoga'. In the early translation phase of the Sutrayana and Tantrayana from India, China and other regions to Tibet, along with the practice lineages of sadhana, codified in the Nyingmapa canon, the most subtle 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: yana) is Adi Yoga (Sanskrit). A contemporary scholar with a focus on Tibetan Buddhism, Robert Thurman writes that Patanjali was influenced by the success of the Buddhist monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.\n\nThere is a range of common terminology and common descriptions of the meditative states that are seen as the foundation of meditation practice in both Hindu Yoga and Buddhism. Many scholars have noted that the concepts of dhyana and samādhi - technical terms describing stages of meditative absorption – are common to meditative practices in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Most notable in this context is the relationship between the system of four Buddhist \"dhyana\" states (Pali: \"jhana\") and the \"samprajnata samadhi\" states of Classical Yoga. Also, many (Tibetan) Vajrayana practices of the generation stage and completion stage work with the chakras, inner energy channels (nadis) and kundalini, called tummo in Tibetan.\n\nDespite the similarities in terminology there exist differences between the two religions. There is no evidence to show that Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste.\n\nThe major differences are mentioned below.\nGautama Buddha was very ambiguous about the existence of a Creator Deity Brahman and Eternal Self Atman and rejected them both. Various sources from the Pali Cannon and others suggest that the Buddha taught that belief in a Creator deity was not essential to attaining liberation from suffering, and perhaps chose to ignore theological questions because they were \"fascinating to discuss,\" and frequently brought about more conflict and anger than peace. The Buddha did not deny the existence of the popular gods of the Vedic pantheon, but rather argued that these devas, who may be in a more exalted state than humans, are still nevertheless trapped in the same samsaric cycle of suffering as other beings and are not necessarily worthy of veneration and worship. The focus of the Noble Eightfold Path, while inheriting many practices and ideologies from the previous Hindu yogic tradition, deviates from the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and earlier works of the Dharmic Religions in that liberation (Nirvana or Moksha) is not attained via unity with Brahman (the Godhead), Self-realization or worship. Rather, the Buddha's teaching centers around what Eknath Easwaran described as a \"psychology of desire,\" that is attaining liberation from suffering by extermination of self-will, selfish desire and passions. This is not to say that such teachings are absent from the previous Hindu tradition, rather they are singled out and separated from Vedic Theology.\n\nAccording to Buddhologist Richard Hayes, the early Buddhist Nikaya literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god \"primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view\". In these texts the Buddha is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.\n\nCiting the \"Devadaha Sutta\" (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, \"while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God.\"\n\nThe Buddha (as portrayed in the Pali scriptures, the agamas) set an important trend in nontheism in Buddhism by establishing a somewhat non-theistic view on the notion of an omnipotent God, generally ignoring the issue as being irrelevant to his teachings. Nevertheless, in many passages in the Tripitaka gods (devas in Sanskrit) are mentioned and specific examples are given of individuals who were reborn as a god, or gods who were reborn as humans. Buddhist cosmology recognizes various levels and types of gods, but none of these gods is considered the creator of the world or of the human race.\n\n\nBuddhist canonical views about God and the priests are:\n\nScholar-monk Walpola Rahula writes that man depends on God \"for his own protection, safety, and security, just as a child depends on his parent.\" He describes this as a product of \"ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,\" and writes that this \"deeply and fanatically held belief\" for man's consolation is \"false and empty\" from the perspective of Buddhism. He writes that man does not wish to hear or understand teachings against this belief, and that the Buddha described his teachings as \"against the current\" for this reason. He also wrote that for self-protection man created God and for self-preservation man created \"soul\".\n\nIn later Mahayana literature, however, the idea of an eternal, all-pervading, all-knowing, immaculate, uncreated and deathless Ground of Being (the dharmadhatu, inherently linked to the sattvadhatu, the realm of beings), which is the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta) or Dharmakaya (\"body of Truth\") of the Buddha himself, is attributed to the Buddha in a number of Mahayana sutras, and is found in various tantras as well. In some Mahayana texts, such a principle is occasionally presented as manifesting in a more personalised form as a primordial buddha, such as Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vairochana, Amitabha and Adi-Buddha, among others.\n\nIn later tradition such as Mahayana Buddhism in Japan, the Shingon Fire Ritual (Homa /Yagna) and Urabon (Sanskrit: Ullambana) derives from Hindu traditions. Similar rituals are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Both Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism share common rites, such as the purification rite of Homa (Havan, Yagna in Sanskrit), prayers for the ancestors and deceased (Ullambana in Sanskrit, Urabon in Japanese).\n\nThe Buddha repudiated the caste distinctions of the Brahmanical religion, by offering ordination to all regardless of caste.\n\nWhile the caste system constitutes an assumed background to the stories told in Buddhist scriptures, the sutras do not attempt to justify or explain the system. In Aggañña Sutta, Buddha elaborates that if any of the caste does the following deeds: killing, taking anything which is not given, take part in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking rough words or nonsense, greedy, cruel, and practice wrong beliefs; people would still see that they do negative deeds and therefore are not worthy or deserving respect. They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.\n\nIn Buddhist cosmology, there are 31 planes of existence within samsara. Beings in these realms are subject to rebirth after some period of time, except for realms of the Non-Returners. Therefore, most of these places are not the goal of the holy life in the Buddha's dispensation. Buddhas are beyond all these 31 planes of existence after parinibbana. Hindu texts mostly mentions the devas in Kamma Loka. Only the Hindu god Brahma can be found in the Rupa loka. There are many realms above Brahma realm that are accessible through meditation. Those in Brahma realm are also subject to rebirth according to the Buddha.\n\nTo have an idea of the differences between Buddhism and pre-existing beliefs and practices during this time, we can look into the Samaññaphala Sutta in the Digha Nikaya of the Pali Canon. In this sutra, a king of Magadha listed the teachings from many prominent and famous spiritual teachers around during that time. He also asked the Buddha about his teaching when visiting him. The Buddha told the king about the practices of his spiritual path. The list of various practices he taught disciples as well as practices he doesn't encourage are listed. The text, rather than stating what the new faith was, emphasized what the new faith was not. Contemporaneous religious traditions were caricatured and then negated. Though critical of prevailing religious practices and social institutions on philosophical grounds, early Buddhist texts exhibit a reactionary anxiety at having to compete in religiously plural societies. Below are a few examples found in the sutra:\n\nAccording to the Maha-Saccaka Sutta, the Buddha recalled a meditative state he entered by chance as a child and abandoned the ascetic practices he has been doing:\n\nAccording to the Upakkilesa Sutta, after figuring out the cause of the various obstacles and overcoming them, the Buddha was able to penetrate the sign and enters 1st- 4th Jhana.\n\nIn the same way as above, the Buddha encountered many more obstacles that caused the light to disappear and found his way out of them. These include sloth and torpor, fear, elation, inertia, excessive energy, energy deficient, desire, perception of diversity, and excessive meditation on the ways. Finally, he was able to penetrate the light and entered jhana.\n\nThe following descriptions in the Upakkilesa Sutta further show how he find his way into the first four Jhanas, which he later considered \"samma samadhi\".\n\nAccording to the early scriptures, the Buddha learned the two formless attainments from two teachers, Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta respectively, prior to his enlightenment. It is most likely that they belonged to the Brahmanical tradition. However, he realized that neither \"Dimension of Nothingness\" nor \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" lead to Nirvana and left. The Buddha said in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta:\n\nCessation of feelings and perceptions\n\nThe Buddha himself discovered an attainment beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the \"cessation of feelings and perceptions\". This is sometimes called the \"ninth \"jhāna\"\" in commentarial and scholarly literature.\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nIn the Magga-vibhanga Sutta, the Buddha defines Right Concentration that belongs to the concentration (samadhi) division of the path as the first four Jhanas:\n\nThe Buddha did not reject the formless attainments in and of themselves, but instead the doctrines of his teachers as a whole, as they did not lead to \"nibbana\". He then underwent harsh ascetic practices that he eventually also became disillusioned with. He subsequently remembered entering \"jhāna\" as a child, and realized that, \"That indeed is the path to enlightenment.\"\n\nIn the \"suttas\", the immaterial attainments are never referred to as \"jhānas\". The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1-4) focus on concentration. A common translation for the term \"samadhi\" is concentration. Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term ” samadhi” is not found in any pre-buddhist text. Hindu texts later used that term to indicate the state of enlightenment. This is not in conformity with Buddhist usage. In \"The Long Discourse of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya\" (pg. 1700) Maurice Walshe wrote,\n\nMeditation was an aspect of the practice of the yogis in the centuries preceding the Buddha. The Buddha built upon the yogis' concern with introspection and developed their meditative techniques, but rejected their theories of liberation. In Buddhism, sati and sampajanna are to be developed at all times, in pre-Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction. A yogi in the Brahmanical tradition is not to practice while defecating, for example, while a Buddhist monastic should do so.\n\nAnother new teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with a liberating cognition.\n\nReligious knowledge or \"vision\" was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside the Buddhist fold. According to the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\" this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of 'meditation' (Sanskrit: dhyāna) coupled with the perfection of 'ethics' (Sanskrit: śīla). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of \"religious insight\" (Sanskrit: prajñā) was original.\n\nThe Buddhist texts are probably the earliest describing meditation techniques. They describe meditative practices and states that existed before the Buddha, as well as those first developed within Buddhism. Two Upanishads written after the rise of Buddhism do contain full-fledged descriptions of yoga as a means to liberation.\n\nWhile there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre-Buddhist early Brahminic texts, Wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the Brahminic or Shramanic tradition, based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts. He mentions less likely possibilities as well. Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition, he argues that the Nasadiya Sukta contains evidence for a contemplative tradition, even as early as the late Rg Vedic period.\n\nBuddhism does not deny that the Vedas in their true original were sacred although it maintains that the Vedas have been amended repeatedly by certain Brahmins to secure their positions in society. The Buddha declared that the Veda in its true form was declared by Kashyapa to certain rishis, who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes. In the Buddhist Vinaya Pitaka of the \"Mahavagga\" (I.245) section the Buddha names these rishis. The names of the Vedic rishis were \"Atthako, Vâmako, Vâmadevo, Vessâmitto, Yamataggi, Angiraso, Bhâradvâjo, Vâsettho, Kassapo, and Bhagu\" but that it was altered by a few Brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices. The Vinaya Pitaka's section \"Anguttara Nikaya: Panchaka Nipata\" says that it was on this alteration of the true Veda that the Buddha refused to pay respect to the Vedas of his time.\n\nThe Buddhist text Mahamayuri Tantra, written during 1-3rd century CE, mentions deities thrughout Jambudvipa (modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and invokes them for the protection of the Buddhadharma. It also mentions a large number of Vedic rishis.\n\nThe Buddha is recorded in the Canki Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 95) as saying to a group of Brahmins:\n\nIn the same discourse, he says:\n\nHe is also recorded as saying:\nWalpola Rahula writes, \"It is always a question of knowing and seeing, and not that of believing. The teaching of the Buddha is qualified as \"ehi-passika,\" inviting you to 'come and see,' but not to come and believe... It is always seeing through knowledge or wisdom, and not believing through faith in Buddhism.\"\n\nIn Hinduism, philosophies are classified either as Astika or Nastika, that is, philosophies that either affirm or reject the authorities of the Vedas. According to this tradition, Buddhism is a Nastika school since it rejects the authority of the Vedas. Buddhists on the whole called those who did not believe in Buddhism the \"outer path-farers\" (\"tiirthika\").\n\nSince the Hindu scriptures are essentially silent on the issue of religious conversion, the issue of whether Hindus evangelize is open to interpretations. Those who view Hinduism as an ethnicity more than as a religion tend to believe that to be a Hindu, one must be born a Hindu. However, those who see Hinduism primarily as a philosophy, a set of beliefs, or a way of life generally believe that one can convert to Hinduism by incorporating Hindu beliefs into one's life and by considering oneself a Hindu. The Supreme Court of India has taken the latter view, holding that the question of whether a person is a Hindu should be determined by the person's belief system, not by their ethnic or racial heritage.\n\nBuddhism spread throughout Asia via evangelism and conversion. Buddhist scriptures depict such conversions in the form of lay followers declaring their support for the Buddha and his teachings, or via ordination as a Buddhist monk. Buddhist identity has been broadly defined as one who \"takes refuge\" in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, echoing a formula seen in Buddhist texts. In some communities, formal conversion rituals are observed. No specific ethnicity has typically been associated with Buddhism, and as it spread beyond its origin in India immigrant monastics were replaced with newly ordained members of the local ethnic or tribal group.\n\nUpanishadic soteriology is focused on the static Self, while the Buddha's is focused on dynamic agency. In the former paradigm, change and movement are an illusion; to realize the Self as the only reality is to realize something that has always been the case. In the Buddha's system by contrast, one has to make things happen.\n\nThe fire metaphor used in the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.\n\nLiberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the permanent realization at death of a nondual meditative state anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept (\"becoming cool\", \"going out\") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life. The Buddha taught that these meditative states alone do not offer a decisive and permanent end to suffering either during life or after death.\n\nHe stated that achieving a formless attainment with no further practice would only lead to temporary rebirth in a formless realm after death. Moreover, he gave a pragmatic refutation of early Brahminical theories according to which the meditator, the meditative state, and the proposed uncaused, unborn, unanalyzable Self, are identical. These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective it is not surprising that meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos. The Buddha, in contrast, argued that states of consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no state of consciousness could be this eternal Self.\n\nBoth the Buddha's conception of the liberated person and the goal of early Brahminic yoga can be characterized as nondual, but in different ways. The nondual goal in early Brahminism was conceived in ontological terms; the goal was that into which one merges after death. According to Wynne, liberation for the Buddha \"... is nondual in another, more radical, sense. This is made clear in the dialogue with Upasiva, where the liberated sage is defined as someone who has passed beyond conceptual dualities. Concepts that might have some meaning in ordinary discourse, such as consciousness or the lack of it, existence and non-existence, etc., do not apply to the sage. For the Buddha, propositions are not applicable to the liberated person, because language and concepts (Sn 1076: \"vaadapathaa\", \"dhammaa\"), as well as any sort of intellectual reckoning (\"sankhaa\") do not apply to the liberated sage.\n\n\"Nirvana\" (or Nibbana in Pali language) means literally 'blowing out' or 'quenching'. The term is pre-Buddhist, but its etymology is not essentially conclusive for finding out its exact meaning as the highest goal of early Buddhism. It must be kept in mind that nirvana is one of many terms for salvation that occur in the orthodox Buddhist scriptures. Other terms that appear are 'Vimokha', or 'Vimutti', implying 'salvation' and 'deliverance' respectively. Some more words synonymously used for nirvana in Buddhist scriptures are 'mokkha/moksha', meaning 'liberation' and 'kevala/kaivalya', meaning 'wholeness'; these words were given a new Buddhist meaning.\n\nThe concept of Nirvana has been also found among other religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism.\n\nEarly Buddhist scriptures do not mention schools of learning directly connected with the Upanishads. Though the earliest Upanishads had been completed by the Buddha's time, they are not cited in the early Buddhist texts as Upanishads or Vedanta. For the early Buddhists they were likely not thought of as having any outstanding significance in and of themselves, and as simply one section of the Vedas.\n\nThe Buddhist texts do describe wandering, mendicant Brahmins who appear to have valued the early Upanishads' promotion of this lifestyle as opposed to living the life of the householder and accruing wealth from nobles in exchange for performing Vedic sacrifices. Furthermore, the early Buddhist texts mention ideas similar to those expounded in the early Upanishads, before controverting them.\n\nThe old Upanishads largely consider Brahman (masculine gender, Brahmā in the nominative case, henceforth \"Brahmā\") to be a personal god, and Brahman (neuter gender, Brahma in the nominative case, henceforth \"Brahman\") to be the impersonal world principle. They do not strictly distinguish between the two, however. The old Upanishads ascribe these characteristics to Brahmā: first, he has light and luster as his marks; second, he is invisible; third, he is unknowable, and it is impossible to know his nature; fourth, he is omniscient. The old Upanishads ascribe these characteristics to Brahman as well.\nIn the Buddhist texts, there are many Brahmās. There they form a class of superhuman beings, and rebirth into the realm of Brahmās is possible by pursuing Buddhist practices. \n\nIn the Pāli scriptures, the neuter Brahman does not appear (though the word \"brahma\" is standardly used in compound words to mean \"best\", or \"supreme\"), however ideas are mentioned as held by various Brahmins in connection with Brahmā that match exactly with the concept of Brahman in the Upanishads. Brahmins who appear in the Tevijja-suttanta of the Digha Nikaya regard \"union with Brahmā\" as liberation, and earnestly seek it. In that text, Brahmins of the time are reported to assert: \"Truly every Brahmin versed in the three Vedas has said thus: 'We shall expound the path for the sake of union with that which we do not know and do not see. This is the correct path. This path is the truth, and leads to liberation. If one practices it, he shall be able to enter into association with Brahmā.\" The early Upanishads frequently expound \"association with Brahmā\", and \"that which we do not know and do not see\" matches exactly with the early Upanishadic Brahman.\n\nIn the earliest Upanishad, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Absolute, which came to be referred to as Brahman, is referred to as \"the imperishable\". The Pāli scriptures present a \"pernicious view\" that is set up as an absolute principle corresponding to Brahman: \"O Bhikkhus! At that time Baka, the Brahmā, produced the following pernicious view: 'It is permanent. It is eternal. It is always existent. It is independent existence. It has the dharma of non-perishing. Truly it is not born, does not become old, does not die, does not disappear, and is not born again. Furthermore, no liberation superior to it exists elsewhere.\" The principle expounded here corresponds to the concept of Brahman laid out in the Upanishads. According to this text the Buddha criticized this notion: \"Truly the Baka Brahmā is covered with unwisdom.\"\n\nGautama Buddha confined himself to what is empirically given. This empiricism is based broadly on both ordinary sense experience and extrasensory perception enabled by high degrees of mental concentration.\n\nĀtman is a Sanskrit word that means 'self'. A major departure from Hindu and Jain philosophy is the Buddhist rejection of a permanent, self-existent soul (Ātman) in favour of anicca or impermanence.\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, Ātman is the first principle, the \"true\" self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. Yajnavalkya (c. 9th century BCE), in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, uses the word to indicate that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description. While, older Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka, mention several times that the Self is described as \"Neti neti or not this – not this\", Upanishads post Buddhism, like the Maitri Upanishad, define Ātman as only the defiled individual self, rather than the universal self. Taittiriya Upanishad defines Ātman or the Self as consisting of five sheaths (kosha): the bodily self consisting of the essence of food (annamaya kosha), the vital breath (pranamaya kosha), the mind or will (manomaya kosha), the intellect or capacity to know (vijnanamaya kosha) and bliss (anandamaya kosha). Knowledge or realization of the Ātman is seen as essential to attain salvation (liberation):\nSchools of Indian philosophy, such as Advaita (non-dualism) see Ātman within each living entity as being fully identical with Brahman – the Principle, whereas other schools such as Dvaita (dualism) differentiate between the individual atma in living beings, and the Supreme atma (Paramatma) as being at least partially separate beings. Unlike Advaita, Samkhya holds blissfullness of Ātman as merely figurative. However, both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego (asmita, ahamkara) rather than the Ātman to be the cause of pleasure and pain. Later Advaitic text Pañcadaśī classifies the degrees of Ātman under three headings: Gauna or secondary (anything other than the personality that an individual identifies with), Mithya or false (bodily personality) and Mukhya or primary (the real Self).\n\nThe concept of Ātman was rejected by the Buddha. Terms like anatman (not-self) and shunyata (voidness) are at the core of all Buddhist traditions. The permanent transcendence of the belief in the separate existence of the self is integral to the enlightenment of an Arhat. The Buddha criticized conceiving theories even of a unitary soul or identity immanent in all things as unskillful. In fact, according to the Buddha's statement in Khandha Samyutta 47, all thoughts about self are necessarily, whether the thinker is aware of it or not, thoughts about the five aggregates or one of them.\n\nDespite the rejection of Ātman by Buddhists there were similarities between certain concepts in Buddhism and Ātman. The Upanishadic \"Self\" shares certain characteristics with nibbana; both are permanent, beyond suffering, and unconditioned. Buddhist mysticism is also of a different sort from that found in systems revolving around the concept of a \"God\" or \"Self\":\nHowever, the Buddha shunned any attempt to see the spiritual goal in terms of \"Self\" because in his framework, the craving for a permanent self is the very thing that keeps a person in the round of uncontrollable rebirth, preventing him or her from attaining nibbana. At the time of the Buddha some philosophers and meditators posited a \"root\": an abstract principle all things emanated from and that was immanent in all things. When asked about this, instead of following this pattern of thinking, the Buddha attacks it at its very root: the notion of a principle in the abstract, superimposed on experience. In contrast, a person in training should look for a different kind of \"root\" — the root of dukkha experienced in the present. According to one Buddhist scholar, theories of this sort have most often originated among meditators who label a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal, and identify with it in a subtle way.\n\nAdi Shankara in his works refuted the Buddhist arguments against Ātman. He suggested that a self-evident conscious agent would avoid infinite regress, since there would be no necessity to posit another agent who would know this. He further argued that a cognizer beyond cognition could be easily demonstrated from the diversity in self existence of the witness and the notion. Furthermore, Shankara thought that no doubts could be raised about the Self, for the act of doubting implies at the very least the existence of the doubter. Vidyaranya, another Advaita Vedantic philosopher, expresses this argument as:\nThe Buddha denies the existence of the cosmic Self, as conceived in the Upanishadic tradition, in the Alagaddupama Sutta (M I 135-136). Possibly the most famous Upanishadic dictum is \"tat tvam asi\", \"thou art that.\" Transposed into first person, the Pali version is \"eso ‘ham asmi\", \"I am this.\" This is said in several suttas to be false. The full statement declared to be incorrect is \"This is mine, I am this, this is my self/essence.\" This is often rejected as a wrong view. The Alagaduppama Sutta rejects this and other obvious echoes of surviving Upanishadic statements as well (these are not mentioned as such in the commentaries, and seem not to have been noticed until modern times). Moreover, the passage denies that one’s self is the same as the world and that one will become the world self at death. The Buddha tells the monks that people worry about something that is non-existent externally (\"bahiddhaa asati\") and non-existent internally (\"ajjhattam asati\"); he is referring respectively to the soul/essence of the world and of the individual. A similar rejection of \"internal\" Self and \"external\" Self occurs at AN II 212. Both are referring to the Upanishads. The most basic presupposition of early Brahminic cosmology is the identification of man and the cosmos (instances of this occur at TU II.1 and Mbh XII.195), and liberation for the yogin was thought to only occur at death, with the adept's union with brahman (as at Mbh XII.192.22). The Buddha's rejection of these theories is therefore one instance of the Buddha's attack on the whole enterprise of Upanishadic ontology.\n\nThe Buddha redefined the word \"brahmin\" so as to become a synonym for arahant, replacing a distinction based on birth with one based on spiritual attainment. The early Buddhist scriptures furthermore defined purity as determined by one's state of mind, and refer to anyone who behaves unethically, of whatever caste, as \"rotting within\", or \"a rubbish heap of impurity\".\n\nThe Buddha explains his use of the word \"brahmin\" in many places. At Sutta Nipata 1.7 \"Vasala Sutta\", verse 12, he states: \"Not by birth is one an outcast; not by birth is one a brahmin. By deed one becomes an outcast, by deed one becomes a brahmin.\" An entire chapter of the Dhammapada is devoted to showing how a true brahmin in the Buddha's use of the word is one who is of totally pure mind, namely, an arahant. However, it is very noteworthy that the Bhagavad Gita also defines Brahmin, and other varnas, as qualities and resulting from actions, and does not mention birth as a factor in determining these. In that regard, the chapter on Brahmins in the Dhammapada may be regarded as being entirely in tune with the definition of a Brahmin in Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita. Both say that a Brahmin is a person having certain qualities.\n\nA defining of feature of the Buddha's teachings is self-sufficiency, so much so as to render the Brahminical priesthood entirely redundant.\n\nIn one Purana, the Buddha is described as an incarnation of Vishnu who incarnated in order to delude demons away from the Vedic dharma. The Bhavishya Purana posits:\n\nConsequently, the word Buddha is mentioned in several of the Puranas that are believed to have been composed after his birth.\n\nAccording to the biography of the Buddha, before taking his last birth on Earth as Gautama, the Buddha was a Mahapurusha (great being) named Shvetaketu, dwelling in the Tushita Heaven (Home of the Contented Gods). After attaining enlightenment on Earth, there is to be no more rebirth for the Buddha. Before leaving the Tushita realm to take birth on earth, he designated Maitreya to take his place there. Maitreya will come to earth as the next Buddha, instead of him coming back again.\nKrishna was a past life of Sariputra, a chief disciple of the Buddha. He has not attained enlightenment during that life as Krishna. Therefore, he came back to be reborn during the life of the Buddha and reached the first stage of Enlightenment after encountering an enlightened disciple of the Buddha. He reached full Arahantship or full Awakening/Enlightenment after becoming ordained in the Buddha's sangha.\n\nSarvepalli Radhakrishnan has claimed that the Buddha did not look upon himself as an innovator, but only a restorer of the way of the Upanishads, despite the fact that the Buddha did not accept the Upanishads, viewing them as comprising a pretentious tradition, foreign to his paradigm.\n\nVivekananda wrote in glowing terms about Buddha, and visited Bodh Gaya several times.\n\nSteven Collins sees such Hindu claims regarding Buddhism as part of an effort – itself a reaction to Christian proselytizing efforts in India – to show that \"all religions are one\", and that Hinduism is uniquely valuable because it alone recognizes this fact.\n\nSome scholars have written that Buddhism should be regarded as \"reformed Brahmanism\", and many Hindus consider Buddhism a sect of Hinduism.\n\nB. R. Ambedkar, the founder of the Dalit Buddhist movement, declared that Buddhism offered an opportunity for low-caste and untouchable Hindus to achieve greater respect and dignity because of its non-caste doctrines. Among the 22 vows he prescribed to his followers is an injunction against having faith in Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. He also regarded the belief that the Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu as \"false propaganda\".\n\nMany examples exist of temples dedicated to both faiths. These include the Kaiyuan Temple and Angkor Wat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36581978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36581978", "title": "Censorship in Islamic societies", "text": "Censorship in Islamic societies\n\nIslamic teachings and argument have been used to censor opinions and writings throughout history, up to and including the modern era, and thus there are many cases of censorship in Islamic societies. One example is the fatwa (\"religious judgment\") against \"The Satanic Verses\" (a novel), ordering that the author be executed for blasphemy. Depictions of Muhammad have inspired considerable controversy and censorship. Some Islamic societies have religious police, who enforce the application of Islamic Sharia law.\n\nIn non-Islamic countries, Islam has often been cited as a reason for self-censorship. Sometimes this self-censorship is because of threats of violence. Leaders of the member states of the world's largest Islamic organization, known as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), called for a categorical ban on anything that could be deemed as denigration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2012.\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the world's second largest intergovernmental organization, comprising fifty-seven Islamic states, has actively lobbied for a global ban on what it perceives as anti-Islamic blasphemy, especially after the publication of \"Innocence of Muslims\" — a \"low-quality film\" depicting Muhammad as a madman, philanderer, and paedophile, — triggered protests and demonstrations in over a dozen Islamic countries. The OIC actions constituted a major step to criminalize speech critical of religion.\n\nEkmeleddin İhsanoğlu, a Turkish citizen and the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, also called for a ban on insults against the Islamic prophet. He said, \"If the Western world fails to understand the sensitivity of the Muslim world, then we are in trouble\". He asserted provocative insults are \"a threat to international peace and security and the sanctity of life.\"\n\nHowever, the opposition from Western nations barred the resolution from being accepted. Ihsanoglu said, \"We could not convince them, [..] The European countries don't vote with us, the United States doesn't vote with us.\"\n\nThe Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan after the mid-1990s, had the most strict, deeply enforced Islamic censorship of any other government in the Muslim World. They enforced and imposed a blanket ban on all films and videos. The Taliban fully fell in 2002 and Afghan President Hamid Karzai's administration began, with expectations of a move towards more secular policies.\n\nHowever, Karzai has worked with members of the Islamic Council of Scholars to censor television programs regarded as sinful, particularly those created by the Indian entertainment industry (many Afghan Islamists often euphemistically refer to Hindus in said industry as \"worshipers of graven idols\"). One of Afghanistan's most popular television soap operas, \"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi\", has faced threats of a total banning from the country unless the shows were heavily modified.\n\nAzim Roboti, director of the Kabul company 'Caravan Film', has remarked about Islamic censorship,\n\nDuring the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, at least 60 journalists were killed by Islamists.\n\nSeveral books of the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin have been banned in Bangladesh, including her novel Lajja. Militant Islamist groups announced a bounty on Nasreen's head and in October 2002, a court sentenced Nasreen \"in absentia\" to a year in jail for her \"derogatory remarks about Islam.\"\n\nThe government of Egypt, during the modern era, used a fundamentally secular legal code that went back decades. In 1985, Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and the National Assembly revised that code in order to try and take some of the heat off of Islamist anti-regime activists such as those in the Muslim Brotherhood by co-opting some of the Islamists' demands. Systematic Islamic censorship on the nation's media began at the same time as the imposition of religious education in state schools.\n\nThe government's Ministry of Culture typically worked with the Islamic Research Council, based out of Al-Azhar University, to implement Islamic censorship of the nation's film industry. For example, Youssef Chahine, one of the most popular Egyptian filmmakers in history, had the distribution of his successful 1994 work \"The Emigrant\" ended when the Council objected to a character's portrayal of the religious figure Joseph. Chahine sued and won, ensuring further showings of his film and showing the sometimes inconsistent nature of Egyptian censorship.\n\nEgyptian films of the nation's classic cinema period often depict all sorts of physical affection such as kisses and hugging, and said films receive frequent play on the state-owned Egyptian Television Network. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring toppling of Mubarak's government, some conservative Islamists in Egypt's parliament have worked for a comprehensive censorship law banning such displays. Many Egyptians have expressed concerns about increasing Islamic censorship harming the nation's entertainment industries.\n\nAlthough both secular and Islamic censorship has existed, widespread use of the internet, physical distribution of DVDs, and so on has broadly allowed a large variety of arts and media access. Those measures have not kept Cairo from being regarded as the largest arts and media publishing hub in the Middle East.\n\nA coalition of participants in the Egyptian art world formed the 'Egyptian Creativity Front' to oppose Islamic censorship by the ruiling Muslim Brotherhood, using the slogan \"Long Live Free Art\". The government has used article 44 of the new Egyptian Constitution as justification for their measures, which states \"insult or abuse of all religious messengers and prophets shall be prohibited\".\n\nThe Shah's government eschewed Islamic censorship, with popular commercial films featuring frank sexual themes and even nudity. The regime largely concerned itself with fostering feelings of legitimacy and making sure that films always portrayed it in a positive light. The Shah personally intervened in a 1934 film biopic to make sure that the protagonist, the poet Firdawsi, viewed the ruler character as a patron of the arts.\n\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, members of the 1979 Revolution sought to use film and other measures to shift public opinion's against the Shah's regime and, upon taking power, utilized filmmakers for ideological support. In some circumstances, this meant more rights than under the Shah such as use of minority dialects by characters. However, the Islamic government has strictly regulated films in order to suppress messages perceived as un-Islamic, using religious bureaucracies such as the Council of Screenplay Inspection and the Council of Film Reviewing to alter and delete specific lines and scenes against filmmaker's wishes.\n\nIn particular, the government forbids the depiction of women either singing, dancing, or both. Actresses also must conceal their hair at all times, even in moments when the characters are shown alone in their own homes. Censors suppress the showing of direct physical contact between members of the opposite sex. Despite this tradition of censorship, some officials have relaxed implementation of Islamic standards, particularly since the death of Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 (which resulted in the film \"Two Women\" by Tahmineh Milani being un-banned before receiving widespread public acclaim).\n\nIran's government, through the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, reviews written works before allowing authors to be published. This process tends to involve having three separate officials inspect works for offending words and phrases, which can take several months to years before approval is granted. Authors with banned works include Plato, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, James Joyce, Kurt Vonnegut, and Paulo Coelho. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly attacked the impact of \"harmful books\" on his nation, analogizing them with \"poisonous\" drugs.\n\nIranian censorship of books grew stricter after then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration began in 2005. His government authorized booksellers to distribute \"Memoria de mis putas tristes\" by Nobel-prize winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, which had the five-thousand first edition sell out in short notice, but it reversed course and banned further reprinting. Muslim religious conservatives objected to the story's plot, which describes an isolated ninety-year-old man seeking a night of \"wild love\" with an adolescent prostitute.\n\nCensorship for both socio-political and religious justifications, intertwined, was widespread in Iraq's government in the 20th century. In particular, the Iraqi Law on the Censorship of Foreign Films of 1973 banned the showing of anything with \"the propagation of reactionary, chauvinistic, populistic, racialist or regionist ideas, of favouring the spirit of defeatism, serving imperialism and Zionism\", prohibiting as well anything \"defaming the Arab nation and its goals\". Iraq's government effectively had the ability to ban any film for any reason whatsoever at any notice.\n\nIn 2006 alone, 56 publications were banned by the Internal Security Ministry, including the Indonesian translation of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\". In January 2014, an image of pigs was censored in the Malaysian edition of the \"International New York Times\", with the pig's faces blacked out.\n\nIn November 2011, the blog of journalist Ismail Khilath Rasheed was shut down by Communications Authority of the Maldives (CAM) on the order of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, on the grounds that the site contained \"anti-Islamic material\". Rasheed, a self-professed Sufi Muslim, had argued for greater religious tolerance.\n\nThe government of Pakistan maintains strict censorship of its citizens' access to the internet, with the Ministry of Information Technology's sub-agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority monitoring and filtering a variety of websites accused of playing host to perceived anti-Islamic content. Examples of cautioned websites include Google, Yahoo, Bing, YouTube, Hotmail, MSN, and Amazon. The government banned access to Facebook outright for two months in mid-2010 after the controversial page titled \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" received public attention.\n\nThese measures have partially contributed to underlying tensions between the Pakistani government and the U.S. government, with many of the aforementioned websites being American-owned.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has, in the words of the \"International Business Times\", \"resorted to drastic measures to limit free communication within its own borders.\" The administration blocks hundreds of thousands of websites for having content perceived as immoral. Censorship has grown more strict since the 'Arab Spring' revolutions began in early 2011.\n\nIn one well-publicized instance of Islamic censorship, the government of Tunisia fined Nabil Karoui, owner of Tunis-based company Nessma TV, about $1,700 in May 2012 for airing the controversial film \"Persepolis\". Said film includes a scene depicting Allah directly along with other disputed material. The government's ruling blasted Karoui for what it viewed as \"broadcasting a film that disturbs public order and threatens proper morals\".\n\nIslam Karimov, the President of Uzbekistan, has implemented a degree of Islamic censorship over the nation's media, such as banning advertisements for alcohol or tobacco products. Those measures have been a part of a general plan of religious administration that has included running religious programming on state television, federally funding the building of mosques and the restorations of shrines, and the promotion of the official government \"muftiyat\" to smooth connections between the state and Islamic believers.\n\nSeveral examples exist of incidences of self-censorship in non-Islamic countries.\n\nAfter 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad, were published in the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" on 30 September 2005, Muslim groups in Denmark complained, and the issue eventually led to protests in many countries around the world, which included violent demonstrations and riots in some Islamic countries.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", many of the demonstrations eventually turned violent, resulting in \"at least 200 deaths\" globally. Several death threats and reward offers for killing those responsible for the cartoons were made, resulting in the cartoonists going into hiding.\n\nDutch film director Theo Van Gogh received death threats for making a film about the treatment of Muslim women by other Muslims, titled \"Submission\" and was eventually murdered in 2004 by an Islamic radical in retribution. A letter pinned to Van Gogh's body with a knife was a death threat to Ayaan Hirsi Ali who provided the script and the voice-over for the film.\n\nThe makers of the television series \"South Park\" were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they \"will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show.\" This caused the network Comedy Central to censor the episodes.\n\nWhen an anti-Islamic film trailer titled \"Innocence of Muslims\" was uploaded to YouTube, it was perceived as denigration of the prophet Muhammad and it culminated in demonstrations and violent protests against the video. The protests have led to hundreds of injuries and over 50 deaths. Fatwas have been issued against the video's participants and a Pakistani minister has offered a bounty for the killing of the producer Nakoula. The film has sparked debates about freedom of speech and internet censorship.\n\nYouTube itself was blocked in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sudan and Pakistan for not removing the video. Government authorities in Chechnya and Daghestan have issued orders to internet providers to block YouTube and Iran has announced that it is blocking Google and Gmail. In 2012 a request by White House was extended towards Google to reconsider the anti-Islam video in light of the violent protests in the Arab world and its rules banning hate speech on Google-owned YouTube, but Google didn't comply.\n\nIn 2008, Random House cancelled publication of Sherry Jones' \"The Jewel of Medina\" — a work of historical fiction focusing upon the life of 'Ā'ishah bint Abī Bakr, first wife of the Islamic prophet Muhammad — due to claims that the novel \"made fun of Muslims and their history,\" and thus raised \"a very real possibility of major danger for the building and staff and widespread violence\" or even stood to create \"a national security issue\". Eventually, the novel saw publication in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth by Gibson Square, and in the United States by Beaufort Books.\n\nAlthough India's constitution protects freedom of speech as a fundamental right, it allows for \"reasonable restrictions\" in the interests of \"public order, decency or morality\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42276792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42276792", "title": "Chinese shamanism", "text": "Chinese shamanism\n\nChinese shamanism, alternatively called Wuism (; alternatively 巫觋宗教 \"wū xí zōngjiào\"), refers to the shamanic religious tradition of China. Its features are especially connected to the ancient Neolithic cultures such as the Hongshan culture. Chinese shamanic traditions are intrinsic to Chinese folk religion, an overarching term for all the indigenous religions of China. \"Wu\" masters remain important in contemporary Chinese culture.\n\nVarious ritual traditions are rooted in original Chinese shamanism: contemporary Chinese ritual masters are sometimes identified as \"wu\" by outsiders, though most orders don't self-identify as such. Also Taoism has some of its origins from Chinese shamanism: it developed around the pursuit of long life (\"shou\" 壽/寿), or the status of a \"xian\" (仙, \"mountain man\", \"holy man\").\n\nThe Chinese word \"wu\" 巫 \"shaman, wizard\", indicating a person who can mediate with the powers generating things (the etymological meaning of \"spirit\", \"god\", or \"nomen agentis\", \"virtus\", \"energeia\"), was first recorded during the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), when a \"wu\" could be either sex. During the late Zhou dynasty (1045-256 BCE) \"wu\" was used to specify \"female shaman; sorceress\" as opposed to \"xi\" 覡 \"male shaman; sorcerer\" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE \"Guoyu\"). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include \"nanwu\" 男巫 for \"male shaman; sorcerer; wizard\"; and \"nüwu\" 女巫, \"wunü\" 巫女, \"wupo\" 巫婆, and \"wuyu\" 巫嫗 for \"female shaman; sorceress; witch\".\n\nThe word \"tongji\" 童乩 (lit. \"youth diviner\") \"shaman; spirit-medium\" is a near-synonym of \"wu\". The Chinese tradition distinguishes native \"wu\" from \"Siberian shaman\": \"saman\" 薩滿 or \"saman\" 薩蠻; and from Indian \"Shramana\" \"wandering monk; ascetic\": \"shamen\" 沙門, \"sangmen\" 桑門, or \"sangmen\" 喪門.\n\nBerthold Laufer (1917:370) proposed an etymological relation between Mongolian \"bügä\" \"shaman\", Turkish \"bögü\" \"shaman\", Chinese \"bu\", \"wu\" (shaman), \"buk\", \"puk\" (to divine), and Tibetan \"aba\" (pronounced \"ba\", sorcerer). Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root *\"\" \"magician; sorcerer\" for Chinese \"wu\" < \"mju\" < *\"mjag\" 巫 \"magician; shaman\" and Written Tibetan\" 'ba'-po\" \"sorcerer\" and\" 'ba'-mo\" \"sorcereress\" (of the Bön religion). Further connections are to the \"bu-mo\" priests of Zhuang Shigongism and the \"bi-mo\" priests of Bimoism, the Yi indigenous faith. Also Korean \"mu\" 무 (of Muism) is cognate to Chinese \"wu\" 巫.\n\nThe Chinese religion from the Shang dynasty onwards developed around ancestral worship. The main gods from this period are not forces of nature in the Indo-European way, but deified virtuous men. The ancestors of the emperors were called \"di\" (帝), and the greatest of them was called \"Shangdi\" (上帝, \"the Highest Lord\"). He is identified with the dragon (\"Kui\" 夔), symbol of the universal power (qi).\n\nCosmic powers dominate nature: the Sun, the Moon, stars, winds and clouds were considered informed by divine energies. The earth god is \"She\" (社) or \"Tu\" (土). The Shang period had two methods to enter in contact with divine ancestors: the first is the numinous-mystical \"wu\" (巫) practice, involving dances and trances; and the second is the method of the oracle bones, a rational way.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty, succeeding the Shang, was more rooted in an agricultural worldview. They opposed the ancestor-gods of the Shang, and gods of nature became dominant. The utmost power in this period was named \"Tian\" (天, \"heaven\"). With \"Di\" (地, \"earth\") he forms the whole cosmos in a complementary duality.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Traditionally made of ivory, with inlay work, though now made with plastic they are worn by a bride on her wedding day, especially during Punjabi weddings. It is a favoured tradition in Punjabi family. It is primarily a Punjabi tradition along with Sindhoor and mangalsutra. Chooriyan (plural) may contain different coloured bangles in various combinations, but the most common combination is red and white. The choora is worn by the bride for 1 year from the day she puts it on and on the 1st anniversary only her inlaws can remove it for her. She can wear other choora after that for as long as she likes in any colour.\n\nThe choora ceremony is held on the morning of the wedding or the day before. The bride's maternal uncle and aunt give her a set of choorae (21 bangles in red and white ivory). Nowadays, the bride often wears 7 or 9 bangles. According to tradition, the bride should ideally wear the choora for at least a year. It is now normal for the bride to wear her choora for a month and a quarter (40 days). The bangles range in size according to the circumference of the top of the forearm and the wrist end so that the set fits neatly.\n\nAs the choora is made of fragile materials, Punjabi custom has it that the bride may refrain from heavy housework in her marital home to keep it intact for the 40 days, as a kind of honeymoon. After that, in traditional homes at least, she takes over the lion's share of domestic work from her mother-in-law..\n\nTraditionally, the bride would wear a chura for a full year. When the color started to fade, her in-laws would actually have it re-colored, so everyone knows she was a newly wed (less than a year of marriage). On an auspicious Punjabi holiday, usually sangrand, after the 1st anniversary her in-laws would hold a small intimate ceremony in which the chura was removed and glass churiyan (bangles) were placed on both hands. This usually was accompanied with mithai (Indian sweets) and a monetary shagun. The chura then was taken to a river and a prayer was said and it left to float onto the water.\n\nAlso note, if a newly wed bride became pregnant before her first anniversary, the chura was taken off.\n\nModern day brides usually wear the chura for 40 days, since it difficult to return to work after the wedding with it on.\n"}

It was first introduced by the Spanish, later followed by French colonialists. The primary brand of Christianity was Catholicism. In recent years, some Protestant denominations have made an increased number of converts in Haiti, continuing early work done by a small number of Protestant missions since the independence of the island.\n\nHaiti was first colonized by the Spanish, who later abandoned the island's western portion. That region came under French influence after 1630, and was formally recognized as the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1697. Under French rule, Roman Catholicism was the sole legal religion, though African slaves frequently practiced vodou. Slaves revolted in 1791 and managed to achieve independence in 1804. Three years later Protestant missionary activity begun. Political control of the island shifted frequently during the 19th century with different European governments, the Dominican republic, Columbia and Haiti itself alternating in power.\n\nProtestant churches and sects have frequently attempted to so-ordinate their activities through organisations like the Council Churches in Haiti and the Protestant Federation. The Roman Catholic Church later participated in the Ecumenical Research group of 1968. The practice of vodou is strong in Haiti and some vodou practitioners advocate being included in any ecumenical gatherings.\n\nThe Spanish first brought Catholicism to the island. The first European to set foot on Haiti, Christopher Columbus landed on December 6, 1492, by way of San Salvador, with three ships. His own ship, the Santa Maria ran aground near Mole St. Nicolas on the northwest of the island. Some evangelization efforts were extended to the natives, though this population was soon nearly wiped out through disease and slavery. African slaves, brought to work in their place, were introduced to Christianity.\n\nDuring Spanish rule, religion was one of the most important aspects of life on the island. Catholic missionaries traveled inland to Christianize most of the island inhabitants. In 1511, three bishoprics formed and the inhabitants appeared enthusiastic. However, missionary work among such impoverished people on a tropical island was challenging. Diseases such as 'yellow fever' and malaria killed many missionaries and their converts.\n\nUnder French rule, Capuchins and Jesuits did most of the missionary work in the 18th century. From 1804, when independence was declared, until 1860, the country was in schism. Relations were regularized by a concordat concluded in 1860, when an archdiocese and four dioceses were established. Most of the population of Haiti adheres to the Catholic faith, though some combine this with elements of vodou.\n\nProtestantism was introduced to the newly independent nation in 1807, and missionary efforts have been ongoing. Today, Protestants make up at least one-sixth of the population and as much as one-third.\n\nRara is the yearly festival in Haiti that the peasants and urban poor celebrate. On the eve of Lent, Rara processions build for six weeks until Easter week starts. Processions include walking for miles through local territory, performing new and traditional songs, and attracting fans. The belief in this celebration is that they are conducting the spiritual work that becomes necessary when the angels and saints along with Jesus, disappear into the Underworld on Good Friday.\n\nProtestant was the first church allowing broadcast programs in 1950, for up to three hours from Monday to Saturday. The first broadcast was done in the backroom of a church. The two programs were Radio 4VEH and Radio Lumiere. The first test transmission was given in Haiti. The transmission emitted a message stating \"4VEH, you are coming in clear and strong\". It was the first transmission for the radio 4VEH. Later, the Christian radio station became known worldwide to people, and then the first transmission in Spanish from this station was announced in the year of 1952. Following that, they started doing the broadcasts in other different languages such as French, English etc. In 1978, a Catholic station, Radio Soleil, began functioning. Today there are music and programmes in French and English for 17 hours a day.\n\nProtestants in Haiti are a significant minority of the population. The 2015 CIA Factbook reports that around 16% of the population is Protestant (Baptist 10%, Pentecostal 4%, Adventist 1%, other 1%). Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it may form one-third of the population in 2001. Protestant churches have experienced significant growth in recent decades.\n\nProtestant churches of significant size include the Assemblées de Dieu, the Convention Baptiste d'Haïti, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of God (Cleveland), the Church of the Nazarene and the Mission Evangelique Baptiste du Sud-Haiti.\n\nWhereas a very small amount of Catholic Haitians combine their faith with aspects of Vodou, this practice is much more rare among Haitian Protestants, whose churches tend to strongly denounce Vodou as diabolical.\n\n"}
{"id": "45678309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45678309", "title": "De Ira", "text": "De Ira\n\nDe Ira (On Anger) is a Latin work by Seneca (4 BC–65 AD). The work defines and explains anger within the context of Stoic philosophy, and offers therapeutic advice on how to prevent and control anger.\n\nThe Stoic philosopher Posidonius (1st-century BCE) is considered the main source for Seneca. Other influences may have included works \"On Passions\" by the Stoics Chrysippus and Antipater of Tarsus, and Seneca may have known works written by the Peripatetic philosopher Theophrastus and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus.\n\nThe exact date of the writing of the work is unknown, apart from an earliest date (\"terminum post quem\"), deduced from repeated references by Seneca to the episodic anger of Caligula, who died 24 January 41 AD. Seneca refers to his brother by his native name, Novatus, rather than his adoptive one, Gallio, which he bore by 52/53 AD, suggesting the work may date from the mid 40s AD.\n\nBook III begins with its own introduction on the horrors of anger, and can be read on its own, which has led to suggestions that it was devised either as a later appendix to the work, or that it was a separate treatise in its own right.\n\n\"Ira\" is defined as anger, wrath, rage, ire, passion, indignation - primarily, to be angry.\n\n\"De Ira\" consists of three books. It is part of Seneca's series of \"Dialogi\" (\"dialogues\"). The essay is addressed to Seneca's elder brother, Lucius Annaeus Novatus. The works first sentence reads:\n\nAlthough split into three books, \"De Ira\" is effectively divided into two parts. The first part (I–II.17) deals with theoretical questions, whereas the second part (II.18–III end) offers therapeutic advice. The first part begins with a preamble on the horrors of anger, followed by definitions of anger. It continues with questions such as whether anger is natural, whether it can be moderate, whether it is involuntary, and whether it can be erased altogether. The second part (Book II.18 onwards) begins with advice on how the avoidance of bad temper can be taught to both children and adults. This is followed by numerous snippets of advice on how anger can be forestalled or extinguished, and many anecdotes are given of examples to be imitated or avoided. The work concludes with a few tips on mollifying other people, followed by Seneca's summing-up.\n\n\"De Ira\" is written within the context of Stoicism, which sought to guide people out of a life enslaved to the vices, to the freedom of a life characterised by virtue. This is achievable by the development of an understanding of how to control the \"passions\" (Greek: \"pathê\"), anger being classified as a passion, and to make these subject to reason. As a Stoic, Seneca believed the relationship of the passions to reason are that the passions arise in a rational mind as a result of a mis-perceiving or misunderstanding of reality. A passion is a defective belief, they occur when the mind makes errors about the values of things.\n\nSeneca states that his therapy has two main aims: one is that we do not become angry (resisting anger), and the other is that we do no wrong when we are angry (restraining anger). Much of the advice is devoted to the first aim of preventing anger. Seneca does offer some practical advice on restraining anger (mostly in III.10-15) although after this he resumes his theme of preventing anger. For the Stoics anger was contrary to human nature, and vengeance considered an evil, which explains Seneca's emphasis on anger prevention. The fact that he offers advice on merely restraining anger shows an awareness that his audience is one of male Roman aristocrats for whom anger was largely a part of everyday routine.\n\nThe work survives due to being a part of the \"Codex Ambrosianus (no. 90)\" manuscript which dates from the 11th century.\n\n\n\n"}

It taught that the king was a divine universal ruler, a manifestation of the Hindu god, often attributed to Shiva or Vishnu. The concept viewed the monarch to possess transcendental quality, the king as the living god on earth. The concept is closely related to Indian concept of Chakravartin (universal monarch). In politics, it is viewed as the divine justification of a king's rule. The concept was institutionalized and gained its elaborate manifestations in ancient Java and Cambodia, where monuments such as Prambanan and Angkor Wat were erected to celebrate the king's divine rule on earth.\n\nIn Sanskrit the term \"deva-raja\" could have different meanings such as \"god-king\" or \"king of the gods\". In Hindu pantheon the title of king of gods is often attributed to Shiva, sometimes Vishnu, or previously Indra. Thus the mortal kingdom on earth mirrored the celestial kingdom of gods, the concept regarded the king as the living god on earth. It is also from influences in Hinduism and indigenous traditions.\n\nExample of devaraja cult — such as demonstrated by Jayavarman II — associate the king with the Hindu god Shiva, whose divine essence was represented by the linga (or lingam), a phallic idol housed in a mountain temple. The king was deified in an elaborate and mystical ceremony, requiring a high priest, in which the divine essence of kingship was conferred on the ruler through the agency of the linga. The safeguarding of the linga became bound up with the security of the kingdom, and the great temple architecture of the Khmer period attests to the importance attached to the belief.\n\nThe devaraja concept has been established through rituals and institutionalized within the Indianized kingdoms of Southeast Asia. It enables the monarch to claim the divine authority which could be use on ensuring political legitimacy, managing social order, economic and religious aspects. In political aspect it strengthen the justification of the king and the ruling dynasty as the righthful ruler of the land. It also used to maintain social order, exalting the king as living god definitely demands the utmost service and devotion of his people. Introducing the Indian caste system also defining social class, occupations, as well as the way of life of their people.\n\nThe devaraja cult also enabled the king to embark on large scale public works and grand projects, by mobilizing their people to create and maintain elaborate hydraulic irrigation system to support large scale rice agriculture, or to construct imposing grand monuments and temples in the king's honor. The example of this grand projects are Borobudur, Prambanan, also temples and barays in Angkor.\n\nThe cult of devaraja or God King was the ancient Cambodian state religion, but it probably originated in Java where the Hindu influence first reached Southeast Asia. Circa 8th century, Sailendras allegedly ruled over Java, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and parts of Cambodia. In ancient Java, since Sailendra dynasty. The devaraja cult is believed to be introduced to Java in 732, when king Sanjaya installed a linga to consecrate a new Mataram Dynasty, as stated in Canggal inscription, thus the king seek Shiva's protection of his rule.\n\nEven older Tarumanagara kingdom, the state religion regarded the king as god incarnated on earth. The Tarumanagara fifth century CE Ciaruteun inscription, inscribed with king's sole print, regarded King Purnawarman as incarnation of Vishnu on earth. The Kebon Kopi I inscription, also called \"Telapak Gajah\" stone, with an inscription and the engraving of two large elephant footprints, associated king's elephant ride as Airavata (elephant ride of God Indra), thus associated the king also with Indra.\n\nIn Medang kingdom in Central Java, it is customary to erect \"candi\" (temple) to honor and sent the soul of a dead king. The image of god inside the garbhagriha (central chamber) of the temple often portrayed the deceased king as a god, as the soul of the dead king finally united with the revered god in svargaloka. Some archaeologists propose that the statue of Shiva in the garbhagriha of Prambanan main temple was modelled after King Balitung, serving as a depiction of his posthumous deified self. It is suggested that the cult was the fusion of Hinduism with native Austronesian ancestor worship. The 11th century great king Airlangga of Kahuripan in East Java, was deified posthumously as Vishnu in Belahan temple. In Java, the tradition of divine king continued well to Kediri, Singhasari, and Majapahit kingdom in the 15th century.\n\nAfter the coming of Islam in the archipelago and the fall of Majapahit, the concept of God-King were most likely ceased to exist in Java, since Islam rejects the concept of divinity in mortal human being. Yet the concept survived in traditional Javanese mysticism of Kejawen as \"wahyu\", suggesting that every king and rulers in Java was bestowed \"wahyu\", a divine authority and mandate from God. A heavenly mandate that could be revoked and transferred by God, to explain the change of dynasty in Java during Demak, Mataram Sultanate era, well to the succession of the president of Indonesia.\n\nIn ancient Cambodia, devarāja is recognized as the state's institutionalized religion. The Cambodian the cult of the \"god-king\" is believed to be established early in the 9th century by Jayavarman II, founder of the Khmer empire of Angkor, with the brahmin scholar Sivakaivalya as his first chief priest at Mahendraparvata. For centuries, the cult provided the religious basis of the royal authority of the Khmer kings.\n\nIn a Khmer context the term was used in the latter sense as \"god-king\", but occurs only in the Sanskrit portion of the inscription K. 235 from Sdok Kak Thom / Sdok Kăk Thoṃ (in modern Thailand) dated 8 February 1053 CE, referring to the Khmer term \"kamrateṅ jagat ta rāja\" (\"Lord of the Universe who is King\") describing the protective deity of the Khmer Empire, a distinctly Khmer deity, which was mentioned before in the inscription K. 682 of Chok Gargyar (Kòḥ Ker) dated 921/22 CE.\n\nIn the Sdok Kăk Thoṃ inscription a member of a brahmin family claimed that his ancestors since the time of Jayavarman II (), who established around 800 CE by marriage to the daughter of a local king in the Angkor region a small realm which became at the end of the 9th century the famous Khmer Empire, were responsible for the cult of the Devarāja (kamrateṅ jagat ta rāja). Historians formerly dated his reign as running from 802 CE to 850 CE, but these dates are of very late origin (11th century) and without any historical basis. Some scholars now have tried to identify Jayavarman II with Jayavarman Ibis who is known from his inscriptions from Práḥ Thãt Práḥ Srĕi south of Kompoṅ Čàṃ (K. 103, dated 20 April 770) and from Lobŏ’k Srót in the vicinity of Kračèḥ close to the ancient town of Śambhupura (K. 134, dated 781 CE). The Sdok Kăk Thoṃ inscription incised c. 250 years after the events (of which their historicity is doubtful) recounts that on the top of the Kulen Hills, Jayavarman II instructed a brahmin priest named Hiraṇyadāman to conduct a religious ritual known as the cult of the devarāja () which placed him as a \"cakravartin\", universal monarch, a title never heard of before in Cambodia.\n\nCoedes states, \"...in southern India, Mount Mahendra was considered the residence of Siva as king of all gods (\"devaraja\"), including Indra Devaraja, and as sovereign of the country where the mountain stands. The ritual of the Devaraja established by the brahmin Hiranydama was based on four texts - \"Vinasikha\", \"Nayottara\", \"Sammoha\", and \"Siraccheda\"...the four faces of Tumburu. These Tantras \"were supposed to have been uttered by the four mouths of Siva represented by the gandharva Tumburu.\" He goes on to state, \"In the Indianized kingdoms of Southeast Asia, the Hindu cults...eventually became royal cults. The essence of royalty...was supposed to reside in a linga...obtained from Siva through a brahmin who delivered it to the king...the communion between the king and the god through the medium of a priest took place on the sacred mountain.\"\nToday, the tradition of public reverence to the King of Cambodia is said to be the continuation of this ancient devaraja cult, and is mistakenly said of the King of Thailand.\n\n"}

Hence such disobedience – which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy – constitutes a \"schismatic\" act (cf. \"Code of Canon Law\", can. 751). In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal \"canonical warning\" sent to them by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops on 17 June last, Mons. Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by ecclesiastical law (cf. \"Code of Canon Law\", can. 1382).\"\n\nPope John Paul II went on to make \"an appeal both solemn and heartfelt, paternal and fraternal, to all those who until now have been linked in various ways to the movement of Archbishop Lefebvre, that they may fulfil the grave duty of remaining united to the Vicar of Christ in the unity of the Catholic Church, and of ceasing their support in any way for that movement. Everyone should be aware that formal adherence to the schism is a grave offence against God and carries the penalty of excommunication decreed by the Church's law (cf. \"Code of Canon Law\", can. 1364).\"\n\nThe Pope instituted the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\" to assist those who had been associated with Archbishop Lefebvre but who wished \"to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church, while preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions, in the light of the Protocol signed on 5 May last by Cardinal Ratzinger and Mons. Lefebvre\", a protocol that Archbishop Lefebvre later repudiated.\n\nThe Pope stated: \"Respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition, by a wide and generous application of the directives already issued some time ago by the Apostolic See for the use of the Roman Missal according to the typical edition of 1962\". In this the Pope expanded the scope of permission already granted under the 1984 special indult \"Quattuor Abhinc Annos\".\n\nThe conditions indicated in the document to which Pope John Paul referred were replaced on 7 July 2007 by those indicated in the \"motu proprio\" \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9593490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9593490", "title": "Fasting girl", "text": "Fasting girl\n\nA fasting girl was one of a number of young Victorian girls, usually pre-adolescent, who claimed to be able to survive over indefinitely long periods of time without consuming any food or other nourishment. In addition to refusing food, fasting girls claimed to have special religious or magical powers.\n\nThe ability to survive without nourishment was attributed to some saints during the Middle Ages, including Catherine of Siena and Lidwina of Schiedam, and regarded as a miracle and a sign of sanctity. Numerous cases of fasting girls were reported in the late 19th century. Believers regarded such cases as miraculous.\n\nIn some cases, the fasting girls also exhibited the appearance of stigmata. Doctors, however, such as William A. Hammond ascribed the phenomenon to fraud and hysteria on the part of the girl. Historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg believes the phenomenon to be an early example of anorexia nervosa.\n\nMary J. \"Mollie\" Fancher (August 16, 1848 – February, 1916), otherwise known as the \"Brooklyn Enigma\", was extremely well known for her claim of not eating, or eating very little for extended periods of time. She attended a reputable school and, by all reports, was an excellent student. At age 16, she was diagnosed with dyspepsia. At around the age of 19, reports came out that she had abstained from eating for seven weeks.\n\nIt was after two accidents, in 1864 and 1865, that she became famous for her ability to abstain from food. As a result of the accidents, Mollie Fancher lost her ability to see, touch, taste, and smell. She claimed to have powers that involved her being able to predict events as well as to read without the ability of sight.\n\nBy the late 1870s, she was claiming to eat little or nothing at all for many months. Her claim to abstinence from food lasted for 14 years. Doctors and people in the public began to question her abilities and wished to perform tests to determine the truthfulness of her claims. The claims to abstinence were never verified, and she died in February 1916. \n\nA case that led to a death and arrests was that of Sarah Jacob (May 12, 1857 – December 17, 1869), the \"Welsh fasting girl\", who claimed not to have eaten any food at all after the age of ten. A local vicar, initially skeptical, became convinced that the case was authentic, and Jacob enjoyed a long period of publicity, during which she received numerous gifts and donations from people who believed she was miraculous.\n\nDoctors were becoming increasingly skeptical about her claims, and eventually proposed that she be monitored in a hospital environment to see whether her claims about fasting were true. In 1869, her parents agreed for a test to be conducted under strict supervision by nurses from Guy's Hospital. The nurses were instructed not to deny Jacob food if she asked for it, but to see that any she received was observed and recorded. After two weeks, she was showing clear signs of starvation.\n\nThe vicar told the parents that she was failing and that the nurses ought to be sent away so that she could get food. The parents refused, and continued to refuse even when informed that their daughter was dying, insisting that they had frequently seen her like this before and that lack of food had nothing to do with her symptoms. Jacob died of starvation a few days later, and it was found that she had actually been consuming very little amounts of food secretly, which she could no longer do under medical supervision. Her parents were convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to hard labour.\n\nAnother case was that of New Jersey's Lenora Eaton in 1881. Reputable citizens in Eaton's town promoted her as someone who had \"lived without eating\". During these times, Eaton was marked as a \"special person and symbol of faith in the miraculous\". When these claims were investigated and doctors were sent to help her, Eaton continued to refuse to eat and died after forty-five days.\n\nIn 1889, the \"Boston Globe\" ran a story, \"Who Took the Cold Potato? Dr. Mary Walker Says the Fasting Girl Bit a Doughnut.\" Dr. Walker reported that Josephine Marie Bedard, known as the Tingwick girl, was a fraud. The evidence was circumstantial: \"At the hotel I searched her clothing and found in one of her pockets a doughnut with a bite taken out of it... On Fast day I had a lunch served to me... I left a platter with three pieces of fried potato on it. I went there and one of the pieces was gone... when I returned, Josephine had her handkerchief to her mouth.\" Asked whether that was all the evidence, she said, \"after I accused her of it she broke down and cried.\"\n\nBecause fasting girls were such a curiosity in the Victorian era, many companies and individuals rushed to put them on display. In the case of Josephine Marie Bedard, two different Boston-based enterprises, the Nickelodeon and Stone and Shaw's museum, competed in court for the right to \"exhibit the girl\" publicly. Still, even as she was used for blatant commercial gain, there was also an element of scientific inquiry in regarding Bedard as a medical phenomenon. While a modern institutional review board would not have approved the violation of privacy for these young women for commercial gain, the practice was allowed in the Victorian era as demonstrated in the examples.\n\n\n"}

The Constitution of Afghanistan is dated January 23, 2004, and its initial three articles mandate:\n\nArticle seven of the constitution commits the state to abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other international treaties and conventions to which the country is a party.\nArticles 18 and 19 of the UDHR, taken together, effectively declare that it is a universal human right to engage in religious proselytism.\n\nIn the past, small communities of Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, and Christians also lived in the country; however, most members of these communities have left. Even at their peak, these non-Muslim minorities constituted only one percent of the population. Almost all members of the country's small Hindu and Sikh population, which once numbered about 50,000, have emigrated or taken refuge abroad. Non-Muslims such as Hindus and Sikhs now number only in the hundreds, often working as traders. The few Christians and Jews who live in the country are mostly foreigners who are in the country to carry out relief work on behalf of foreign non-governmental organization (NGOs).\n\nThe Taliban imposed its interpretation of Islamic law, establishing a \"Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\" for purposes of enforcement. One of the Ministry's duties was to operate a body of religious police who enforced edicts on dress code, employment, access to medical care, behavior, religious practice, and expression. Persons found to be in violation of an edict were often subject to punishment meted out on the spot, which included beatings and detention.\n\nThe Taliban persecuted members of other Islamic sects as well as non-Muslims. Traditionally, Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence has been the dominant form of Islam in Afghanistan. This school counts the Taliban among its followers. The Deoband madrassa (religious school) near Delhi, India, has been a source of influence for these Sunni for approximately 200 years. Most of the Taliban leadership attended Deobandi-influenced seminaries in Pakistan. The Deoband school has long sought to \"purify\" Islam by discarding supposedly un-Islamic accretions to the faith and reemphasizing the models established in the Qur'an and Hadith. Deobandi scholars often have opposed what they perceive as Western influences. Much of the population adheres to Deobandi-influenced Hanafi Sunnism, but a sizable minority adheres to a more mystical version of Hanafi Sunnism generally known as Sufism. Sufism centers on orders or brotherhoods that follow charismatic religious leaders.\n\nThe Shi'a, under the Taliban, were among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country. An ethnic group known as the Hazara is predominantly Shi'a Muslim. There also are small numbers of Ismailis living in the central and northern parts of the country. Ismailis are Shi'a Muslims, but consider the Aga Khan their spiritual leader.\n\nIn March 2015, a 27-year-old Afghan woman was murdered by a mob in Kabul over false allegations of burning a copy of the Koran. After beating and kicking Farkhunda, the mob threw her over a bridge, set her body on fire and threw it in the river.\n\nThe Taliban prohibited free speech about religious issues or discussions that challenge orthodox Sunni Muslim views. Publishing and distribution of literature of any kind, including religious material, was rare. In 1998 television sets, videocassette recorders, videocassettes, audiocassettes, and satellite dishes were outlawed in order to enforce the prohibition. However, subsequent reports indicated that many persons in urban areas around the country continued to own such electronic devices despite the ban. The Taliban continues to prohibit music, movies, and television on religious grounds in areas that it still holds.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch (HRW), in September 1999, the Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, forbade non-Muslims from criticizing Muslims, ordered non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops, forbade non-Muslims from living in the same residence as Muslims, and required that non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance.\n\nThe constitution limits the political rights of Afghanistan's non-Muslims, and only Muslims are allowed to become the President.\n\nIn May 2001, according to news reports, the Taliban considered an edict requiring Sikhs to wear identifying badges on their clothing. On May 23, 2001, Taliban radio announced that the edict was approved by religious officials. However, Mullah Omar reportedly did not sign the edict and it was not implemented by the Taliban. The Taliban claim was that the proposed edict would protect Sikh citizens from harassment by members of the religious police. International observers regarded the proposed edict as part of the Taliban's efforts to segregate and isolate non-Muslim citizens, and to encourage more Sikh emigration. The reaction of Sikh citizens reportedly ranged from indifference to outrage.\n\nRepression by the Taliban of the Hazara ethnic group, which is predominantly Shia Muslim, was particularly severe. Although the conflict between the Hazaras and the Taliban was political and military as well as religious, and it is not possible to state with certainty that the Taliban engaged in its campaign against the Shi'a solely because of their religious beliefs, the religious affiliation of the Hazaras apparently was a significant factor leading to their repression.\n\nThe Taliban have been accused of committing mass killings of the Hazaras particularly in the north. It has been claimed that the Taliban massacred thousands of civilians and prisoners during and after the capture of Mazar-i-Sharif in August 1998; this massacre reportedly was aimed at ethnic Hazaras. In September 1998, approximately 500 persons were killed as the Taliban gained control of the city of Bamiyan. The Hazaras regained control of Bamiyan in April 1999 following prolonged guerilla-style warfare; however, the Taliban recaptured Bamiyan in May 1999 and reportedly killed a number of Shi'a residents.\n\nIn January 2001, several NGO's reported that the Taliban massacred several hundred Shi'a civilians in Yakaolang in the center of the country. The massacre reportedly occurred after the Taliban recaptured the area from opposition forces. According to witnesses interviewed by HRW, after the Taliban recaptured the area, they rounded up victims from the surrounding villages, and shot or stabbed them with bayonets in the town center.\n\nBesides claims of genocide, there are claims of forced expulsions of ethnic Hazaras and Tajiks from areas controlled or conquered by the Taliban, as well as harassment of these minorities throughout Taliban-controlled areas.\n\nA small number of foreign Christian groups were allowed in the country to provide humanitarian assistance; however, they were forbidden by the Taliban to proselytize. A June 2001 decree stated that proselytizing by non-Muslims was punishable by death or deportation in the case of foreigners. Taliban officials subsequently stated that the decree was only a guideline.\n\nOn August 3, 2001 Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer were arrested by the Taliban along with 22 others for their work with \"Shelter Now\", a Christian aid organization based in Germany. The Taliban also seized Bibles and videos and audio tapes from the members of the group. The workers were tried for violating the Taliban prohibition against proselytizing. On November 15, 2001 Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer were freed by Operation Enduring Freedom forces, after the Taliban had fled Kabul.\n\nPrayer was mandatory for all, and those found not praying at appointed times or who were late attending prayer were punished, often by severe beatings. There were reports in 1998 that Ministry members in Kabul stopped persons on the street and demanded that they recite various Koranic prayers in order to determine the extent of their religious knowledge.\n\nIn March 2001, the Taliban destroyed two giant pre-Islamic Buddha statues carved into cliffs in Bamiyan province, on the grounds that statues are idolatrous and insulting to Islam. The Taliban destroyed the statues despite appeals from the United Nations, international NGOs, and the world community, including many Muslim countries, to preserve the two-thousand-year-old statues.\n\n"}

In general, a gaja personifies a number of positive attributes, including abundance, fertility and richness; boldness and strength; and wisdom and royalty. In European Portuguese, it means \"physically attractive female\"; its origin in the Portuguese language can be related to a personification of fertility, as mentioned.\n\nIn the context of the history of Ancient India, the earliest depiction of gaja is found on the seals discovered at sites (like Harappa and Mohenjo Daro) of the Indus Valley Civilization (3000 BC – 1700 BC). Some scholars believe that by that time elephants had been tamed and domesticated, and used for peaceful and possibly for other purposes. Rigveda 8-33-8 mentions a Wild Elephant. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya reports use of war elephants during warfare.\n\nOver a period of time encompassing several centuries, elephants became an important part of Indian life and society, particularly of religious tradition, the royalty, and the aristocratic segment of the society. Capturing, taming and training of elephants developed into a specialized skill. In Ancient India, a number of treatises were written about caring and management of elephants, which included the following:\n\n\nThe legend states that Airavata, the first elephant, emerged from the churning of the ocean. There is another mythological account, which states that Brahma created elephants. \n\nThe Buddhist tradition states that Buddha came into the womb of his mother in the form of an elephant having six tusks. According to Jaina tradition, each of the mother of the twenty-four thirthankars dreamt of fourteen auspicious objects, which included an elephant. \nIn Hinduism, Ganesh, a god with the elephant’s head has been an object of reverence and worship for more than two millennia. He is therefore called as Gajanan(Gaj=elephant, aanan= faced). Several deities and mythological figures have elephants as their conveyance (vahan) including Balarama, Skanda and aiyanar. \n\nAn elephant is also one of several attributes of a Chakravartin, which he is expected to own to be bestowed with the title of Chakravatin, that is, the supreme and universal ruler.\n\n\n"}

The school was founded in 1990.\n\nThe school is located in the Himalayas, above Dharamsala in the Kangra district, near McLeod Ganj, at an altitude of more than 1700m. Children coming to the school must have previously been brought up in Sahaja Yoga culture and understand the importance of meditation. Their education is based on the teachings of Nirmala Srivastava. Students \"learn the basic principles of Sahaja Yoga ... the tenets of Hinduism and worship the school’s patron\".\n\nThe medium of instruction is English. Subjects (as followed by the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education curriculum) include standard courses as well as English, German, Indian Classical Music (including instruments), and Indian Classical dance.\n\nJudith Coney reports that the school has accepted children from the age of four and notes that \"often very young children are separated from their natural parents for prolonged periods, as they usually stay in India for nine months\". An Indian newspaper article published in 2000 reported that students at the time were aged six and above.\n\nAn official school statement said that the villagers bring presents to the students and enjoy looking after them. A 1995 report on the school by the Austrian Ministry of Justice has said that uninvited visitors 'dropping in' have been refused entry meaning that the domestic and foreign population nearby does not know anything about the teachers, pupils and the daily routine at the school, which is-regarding the rustic surrounding-an astonishing fact.\"\n\nA 2000 article in the Indian Express noted that \"an aura of secrecy envelops the school and entry is strictly forbidden.\" The article quoted a director of the school as saying \"...we don’t like the vibrations to be polluted by outsiders. Sometimes we even tell parents not to come here.\" Students are schooled in 'vibratory awareness' which practitioners say enables them to detect and treat subtle imbalances in themselves and others. This is part of the school's vision of fulfilling the students' physical, emotional, intellectual and, above all, spiritual potential.\n\nAccording to the school website, Sahaja Yoga education \"envisages the development of the child in an atmosphere where the innate qualities, such as innocence and wisdom, are protected and enhanced; where the students imbibe the timeless and unchanging values which come from inner awareness, and are not subject to the vagaries of fashion, religion or national culture.\" The Indian Express article noted that the \"dormitories are austere, even monastic in appearance\".\n\nThey are realised souls, there is God who is looking after them, why are you so much worried about them? Leave them alone! Send them to the Indian school. Then the mothers are sitting there, teachers don't like it, no one likes it. They are just gone there. The mothers. No school allows such nonsense! But in Sahaja Yoga they think they have the right. What right have they got? Have they paid for the school? Have they done anything for the school? What right have they got to go and sit in the school? So the discretion should be, we have to bring up our children according to Sahaj culture. The first of the principles of Sahaja Yoga is fortitude. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such ... dainty darlings. You have to be soldiers of Sahaja Yoga. - Nirmala Srivastava\n\nThe Austrian Ministry of Justice's 1995 \"Report on the Sahaja Yoga school\" comments that \"Despite the altitude, eight months of sunshine a year and outdoor activities and sports in the open, the European children appeared pale which was unexplainable to the visitor\". Coney reports that one child arrived home having lost a stone in weight, and so changed in appearance that his mother could not recognise him, although the school had consistently reported that he was 'doing fine'.\n\nConey reports that, \"whilst there is evidence that some children have enjoyed their time at the Sahaja Yoga school in India, a number of children have expressed unhappiness at being returned to the India school.\" The school advises parents not to enroll their children until they are ready.\n\nRegarding discipline, Sukhmani writes that corporal punishment is taboo at the school. Nirmala Srivastava has advised that parents are allowed to occasionally slap 'extremely difficult' children, but forbids teachers from slapping children or punishing \"in such a way that the child gets hurt.\" Coney reports that due to instances of children having been beaten, the Headmaster was temporarily dismissed. The Supreme Court of India banned corporal punishment in schools in 2000.\n\nThere have been instances of objections by grandparents of children at the school which have resulted in legal action being taken. In Austria, a mother's guardianship was partly substituted, after legal intervention of the grandmother, as she was not willing to take her boy out of the Sahaja Yoga boarding-school in India. A French Court of Appeal allowed another mother custody of her children on condition that she did not send any of them to the school, again a result of grandparental intervention.\n\nConey says these instances are confined to the European continent partly because the anti cult movement there has successfully drawn attention to the differences between Sahaja Yoga and the mainstream, resulting in a media attack on the movement. Coney says in the UK grandparents have been more likely to give parents freedom to bring up children as they wish, in a couple of instances even paying for the child's education at the school. The enrolment form used in the admission procedure now asks for details of any resistance from family members to the child studying at the school.\n\n"}

Through marriage, she was a member of the Astor and Dudley–Winthrop families.\n\nJulia was born on October 21, 1882 in Glen Cove, New York. She was the daughter of Stephen Henry Olin (1847–1925), the acting President of Wesleyan University from 1922 to 1923, and Alice Wadsworth Barlow (1853–1882). Her sister was Alice Townsend Olin (1881–1963), who married Tracy Dows (1871–1937) in 1903. After her mother's death in 1882 at the age of 29, her father remarried to Emeline Harriman (1860–1938), the former wife of William Earl Dodge III, in 1903. Emeline was the daughter of Oliver Harriman and the sister of Anne Harriman Vanderbilt, Oliver Harriman, Jr., J. Borden Harriman, and Herbert M. Harriman.\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Samuel Latham Mitchill Barlow (1826–1889) and Alice Cornell Townsend (1833–1889). Her paternal grandparents were Julia Matilda Lynch Olin (1814–1879) and Rev. Dr. Stephen Olin (1797–1851), 2nd President of Wesleyan University and the son of Henry Olin (1768–1837), a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Vermont.\n\nJulia was first introduced to the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith about 1925, as she states in her auto-biography. Becoming intimately associated with Mirza Ahmad Sohrab they together with her second husband, started the \"New History Society\". This Society, based in the home that Julia and Lewis owned in New York, (later called \"Caravan House\"), published several books, into the late 1950s. It apparently became defunct after Sohrab and/or Julia had died.\n\nIn 1929, he and Julia formed an educational organization called \"Caravan of East and West\" with a quarterly magazine called \"The Caravan\". This magazine is where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared, also in 1929.\n\nAlso that year, an article appeared in which the engagement of her daughter Elsie Benkard to Charles H. Clarke was announced. The marriage announcement appeared on February 27, 1930, stating that \"...they were married with a Bahai ceremony. It was the first time that such a ceremony... has been used at a society wedding in New York. Mirza Ahmad Sohrab officiated.\"\n\nThe New History Society was addressed by several luminaries, including Albert Einstein in 1930. Another speaker was Margaret Sanger in January 1932. In 1934, she described Baha'i membership as: \"To be a Baha'i simply means to love all the world; to love humanity and try to serve it; to work for universal peace and universal brotherhood\". In 1936, Julia translated the French version of \"Seven Valleys\" into English.\n\nShe was expelled from the Bahá'í community in 1939 along with Lewis and Sohrab after they refused to allow the Local Spiritual Assembly of New York oversight over the operations of the New History Society. They went on to support the efforts of Mírzá Muhammad `Alí, and at one point petitioned the President of Israel for Muhammad `Alí's property rights when he tried to assert his control over the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nAs part of its mission, the New History Society, for many years sponsored an essay-contest. At least one of the winners of this, Jaja Wachuku, became famous in his own right, for his essay \"How Can the People of the World Achieve Universal Disarmament?\" written while at the New Africa University College.\n\nOn December 11, 1902, Julia married John Philip Benkard (1872–1929) of New York City, a financier and the son of James Benkard. Before their divorce in December 1920, they had two daughters:\n\n\nOn May 23, 1921, she married Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler (1869–1942), the ex-Lieutenant Governor of New York and a former Democratic candidate for Governor, in Paris. He was the fifth son of John Winthrop Chanler and Margaret Astor Ward and the great-grandson of the first John Jacob Astor.\n\nShe died on March 11, 1961, at the age of 78.

Since the foundation of the church its hierarch held a title Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia with his episcopal see located in the city of Kiev (or possibly Tmutarakan). The church was created as part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. There is an evidence that the first bishop might have been dispatched to Kiev in 864 by the Patriarch of Constantinople Photios I before the official Christianization of 988. It happened after Kiev was captured by Varangians in 860. It is also apparent that Prince of Kiev Askold might have been baptized due to the fact that there exist the Saint Nicholas Church at the Askold's Grave. During a rule of Prince Igor of Kiev, in Kiev existed the Saint Elijah Church, while during signing the 944 treaty with the Greeks some Ruthenians took an oath on the Bible.\n\nThe earliest metropolitan bishop whose name is known is Michael of Kiev.\n\nFollowing Mongol invasion and the 1240 sack of Kiev by Batu Khan communications between Kiev and Constantinople deteriorated. On the demand of the Golden Horde the newly appointed Kirill III of Kiev had to govern from the city of Vladimir, yet the official transfer of the episcopal see did not occur until 1299. Governing the church from Vladimir and later Moscow, hierarchs continued to be called Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia. Grand Princes of Vladimir and later Moscow were controlling Kiev on the permission of the Khan of the Golden Horde.\n\nTwo other successor states of the Kievan Rus', Kingdom of Rus and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogotia that controlled portion of territory of former Rus demanded to establish separate dioceses independent from Moscow. Sometimes their demands were approved, other times former eparchies were returned under jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia. During the 14th century the church was de facto split in two or three. The Great Duchy of Moscow completely lost control of Kiev in the mid 14th century.\n\nStarting from the 15th century, the church was finally reunited and was continued to be governed from Moscow by Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia, while being located in the neighboring country. During that time in the Holy Roman Empire was taken place Council of Florence as a political and religious forum. While resisting at first, the Great Prince of Moscow allowed the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia Isidore of Kiev to attend it. Isidore who was of Greek origin went forward to sign the Florentine Union uniting the Russian Orthodox Church with the Latin Church. The Great Prince of Moscow voided the union and placed Isidore in prison for sometime. Following that incident, the next Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia Jonah who was not approved by the Constantinople Patriarch changed his title to Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia. Since then and until 1589, no hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow were approved by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople declaring their complete autocephaly.\n\nNonetheless, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople continued to appoint his metropolitans for dioceses of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The next hierarch of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Gregory the Bulgarian was originally consecrated by a Latin Patriarch of Constantinople and received a title of Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia. Later his appointed was also approved by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as well. The episcopal see of the new hierarch was located in Vilnius, Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nIn 1588–1589 Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremias II of Constantinople when traveling across the Eastern Europe, visited both Moscow and Vilnius. In Moscow Jeremias confirmed autocephaly of the Russian Orthodox Church and for the first time since 1448 consecrated Job of Moscow as the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. Later Jeremias stopped in Vilnius and consecrated Michael Rohoza as Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia, thus again confirming division of the former Russian Orthodox Church. Soon thereafter, in 1596 the Metropolitan of Kiev and other top clergymen of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth signed the Union of Brest turning the Russian (Ruthenian) Orthodox Church under jurisdiction of the Latin Church and converting to the Ruthenian Uniate Church.\n\nAs the previous Florentine union, the Union of Brest was not accepted by all orthodox clergymen causing some eparchies (dioceses) to continue their operations as Eastern Orthodox. In 1620 the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophanes consecrated Job as the new Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia and Exarch of Ukraine. This appointment revitalized Eastern Orthodox churches and deepened the schism. On the other hand, the episcopal see was returned to Kiev for the first time since 1299. In 1646 last remnants of the Russian Orthodox Church in Carpathian region joined the Union of Uzhhorod and converted into the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church. At the same time, the eastern territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth which today part of Belarus and Ukraine entered a great turmoil and eventually were occupied by the Tsardom of Muscovy. Soon after occupation of Ukraine (Cossack Hetmanate), in 1685 the Ruthenian Orthodox Church was transferred from under jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople to under jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Moscow. The newly appointed metropolitan Gedeon was titled as Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and all Little Russia. This transfer successfully terminated any remnants of the original Russian Orthodox Church centered in Kiev.\n\nThe church (Ancient Greek: \"Ρωσική Ορθόδοξη Εκκλησία\", Rhousike Orthodoxe Ekklesia) was established and governed by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in Kievan Rus' (or Ruthenia) until invasion of Mogols and eventual partition between Grand Duchy of Lithnia, Kingdom of Hungary, and Ulus of Jochi (Golden Horde) with its vassal Grand Duchy of Moscow. At first it led to succession of Muscovite dioceses into its own Metropolis and although it was not recognized in the beginning eventually it turned into Patriarchate. Later the dioceses that were under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were reorganized within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and as part of the Polonization process eventually joined the Union of Brest coming under communion with the Pope of Rome. The Eparchy of Mukačevo that was under the Kingdom of Hungary became one of the longest surviving dioceses of Eastern Orthodoxy in the west until it also was Catholicized though the Union of Uzhhorod.\n\n\"In 1299 Metropolitan Maximus moves the seat from Kiev to Vladimir, title \"of Kiev\" retained.\"\n\n\"In the 14th century the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos sanctioned creation of two additional metropolitan sees in Halych (1303) and Navahrudak (1317).\"\n\n\"In 1325 the Vladimir's seat was moved to Moscow\"\n\n\"Following the signing of Council of Florence, Isidore of Kiev came back to Moscow as a Ruthenian cardinal in 1441, and was arrested after being accused of apostasy. In 1448 the Grand Duke of Moscow installed own Muscovite metropolitan of Kiev Jonah without the Patriarchal approval Gregory III of Constantinople (in 1461 Metropolitan of Moscow). In 1458, the Orthodox dioceses within the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including Kiev, were reorganized and a metropolitan episcopal see was moved to Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\"\n\n\"Patriarch Isidore II of Constantinople reorganized the church and its primates were given a new title: Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia, and all Ruthenia thus commemorating the office of Metropolitan of Galicia. The episcopal see was located in Vilnius.\n\n\n\"In 1595 the Vilnius/Kyiv Metropolis signs the Union of Brest with the Catholic Church, so establishing the Ruthenian Uniate Church.\"\n\n\"In 1620 – about 25 years after the implementation of the Union of Brest – Patriarch Cyril Lucaris, of Constantinople, re-established a rival with a hierarchy, within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\" \"The new metropolitan was organized with bishops who refused to join the Union of Brest.

{"id": "76241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76241", "title": "Mount Shasta", "text": "Mount Shasta\n\nMount Shasta (Karuk: \"Úytaahkoo\" or \"White Mountain\") is a potentially active volcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County, California. At an elevation of , it is the second-highest peak in the Cascades and the fifth-highest in the state. Mount Shasta has an estimated volume of , which makes it the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.\nThe mountain and surrounding area are part of the Shasta–Trinity National Forest.\n\nMount Shasta is connected to its satellite cone of Shastina, and together they dominate the landscape. Shasta rises abruptly to tower nearly above its surroundings. On a clear winter day, the mountain can be seen from the floor of the Central Valley to the south. The mountain has attracted the attention of poets, authors, and presidents.\nIt is dormant.\n\nThe mountain consists of four overlapping volcanic cones that have built a complex shape, including the main summit and the prominent satellite cone of Shastina, which has a visibly conical form. If Shastina were a separate mountain, it would rank as the fourth-highest peak of the Cascade Range (after Mount Rainier, Rainier's Liberty Cap, and Mount Shasta itself).\n\nMount Shasta's surface is relatively free of deep glacial erosion except, paradoxically, for its south side where Sargents Ridge runs parallel to the U-shaped Avalanche Gulch. This is the largest glacial valley on the volcano, although it does not now have a glacier in it. There are seven named glaciers on Mount Shasta, with the four largest (Whitney, Bolam, Hotlum, and Wintun) radiating down from high on the main summit cone to below primarily on the north and east sides. The Whitney Glacier is the longest, and the Hotlum is the most voluminous glacier in the state of California. Three of the smaller named glaciers occupy cirques near and above on the south and southeast sides, including the Watkins, Konwakiton, and Mud Creek glaciers.\n\nThe oldest-known human settlement in the area dates to about 7,000 years ago.\n\nAt the time of Euro-American contact in the 1820s, the Native American tribes who lived within view of Mount Shasta included the Shasta, Okwanuchu, Modoc, Achomawi, Atsugewi, Karuk, Klamath, Wintu, and Yana tribes.\n\nThe historic eruption of Mount Shasta in 1786 may have been observed by Lapérouse, but this is disputed. Although perhaps first seen by Spanish explorers, the first reliably reported land sighting of Mount Shasta by a European or American was by Peter Skene Ogden (a leader of a Hudson's Bay Company trapping brigade) in 1826. In 1827, the name \"Sasty\" or \"Sastise\" was given to nearby Mount McLoughlin by Ogden. An 1839 map by David Burr lists the mountain as Rogers Peak. This name was apparently dropped, and the name Shasta was transferred to present-day Mount Shasta in 1841, partly as a result of work by the United States Exploring Expedition.\n\nBeginning in the 1820s, Mount Shasta was a prominent landmark along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, which runs at Mount Shasta's base. The Siskiyou Trail was on the track of an ancient trade and travel route of Native American footpaths between California's Central Valley and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe California Gold Rush brought the first Euro-American settlements into the area in the early 1850s, including at Yreka, California and Upper Soda Springs. The first recorded ascent of Mount Shasta occurred in 1854 (by Elias Pearce), after several earlier failed attempts. In 1856, the first women (Harriette Eddy, Mary Campbell McCloud, and their party) reached the summit.\n\nBy the 1860s and 1870s, Mount Shasta was the subject of scientific and literary interest. In 1854 John Rollin Ridge titled a poem \"Mount Shasta.\" A book by California pioneer and entrepreneur James Hutchings, titled \"Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California\", contained an account of an early summit trip in 1855. The summit was achieved (or nearly so) by John Muir, Josiah Whitney, Clarence King, and John Wesley Powell. In 1877, Muir wrote a dramatic popular article about his surviving an overnight blizzard on Mount Shasta by lying in the hot sulfur springs near the summit. This experience was inspiration to Kim Stanley Robinson's short story \"Muir on Shasta\".\n\nThe 1887 completion of the Central Pacific Railroad, built along the line of the Siskiyou Trail between California and Oregon, brought a substantial increase in tourism, lumbering, and population into the area around Mount Shasta. Early resorts and hotels, such as Shasta Springs and Upper Soda Springs, grew up along the Siskiyou Trail around Mount Shasta, catering to these early adventuresome tourists and mountaineers.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Pacific Highway followed the track of the Siskiyou Trail to the base of Mount Shasta, leading to still more access to the mountain. Today's version of the Siskiyou Trail, Interstate 5, brings thousands of people each year to Mount Shasta.\n\nFrom February 13–19, 1959, the Mount Shasta Ski Bowl obtained the record for the most snowfall during one storm in the U.S., with a total of .\n\nMount Shasta was declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1976.\n\nThe lore of some of the Klamath Tribes in the area held that Mount Shasta is inhabited by the Spirit of the Above-World, Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit at the request of a Klamath chief. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains.\n\nItalian settlers arrived in the early 1900s to work in the mills as stonemasons and established a strong Catholic presence in the area. Many other faiths have been attracted to Mount Shasta over the years—more than any other Cascade volcano. Mount Shasta City and Dunsmuir, California, small towns near Shasta's western base, are focal points for many of these, which range from a Buddhist monastery (Shasta Abbey, founded by Houn Jiyu-Kennett in 1971) to modern-day Native American rituals. A group of Native Americans from the McCloud River area practice rituals on the mountain.\n\nMount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city of advanced beings from the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s, to a description of a hidden Lemurian village in 1925. In 1931, Wisar Spenle Cerve wrote \"Lemuria: the lost continent of the Pacific\", published by the Rosicrucians, about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that cemented the legend in many readers' minds.\n\nIn August 1987, believers in the spiritual significance of the Harmonic Convergence described Mount Shasta as one of a small number of global \"power centers\". Mount Shasta remains a focus of \"New Age\" attention.\n\nAbout 593,000 years ago, andesitic lavas erupted in what is now Mount Shasta's western flank near McBride Spring. Over time, an ancestral Mount Shasta stratovolcano was built to a large but unknown height; sometime between 300,000 and 360,000 years ago the entire north side of the volcano collapsed, creating an enormous landslide or debris avalanche, in volume. The slide flowed northwestward into Shasta Valley, where the Shasta River now cuts through the flow.\n\nWhat remains of the oldest of Mount Shasta's four cones is exposed at Sargents Ridge on the south side of the mountain. Lavas from the Sargents Ridge vent cover the Everitt Hill shield at Mount Shasta's southern foot. The last lavas to erupt from the vent were hornblende-pyroxene andesites with a hornblende dacite dome at its summit. Glacial erosion has since modified its shape.\n\nThe next cone to form is exposed south of Mount Shasta's current summit and is called Misery Hill. It was formed 15,000 to 20,000 years ago from pyroxene andesite flows and has since been intruded by a hornblende dacite dome.\n\nThere are many buried glacial scars on the mountain which were created in recent glacial periods (\"ice ages\") of the present Wisconsinian glaciation. Most have since been filled in with andesite lava, pyroclastic flows, and talus from lava domes. Shastina, by comparison, has a fully intact summit crater indicating Shastina developed after the last ice age. Shastina has been built by mostly pyroxene andesite lava flows. Some 9,500 years ago, these flows reached about south and north of the area now occupied by nearby Black Butte. The last eruptions formed Shastina's present summit about a hundred years later. But before that, Shastina, along with the then forming Black Butte dacite plug dome complex to the west, created numerous pyroclastic flows that covered , including large parts of what is now Mount Shasta, California and Weed, California. Diller Canyon ( deep and wide) is an avalanche chute that was probably carved into Shastina's western face by these flows.\n\nThe last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the Military Pass flow, extends down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain).\n\nIn the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La Pérouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.\n\nDuring the last 10,000 years, Mount Shasta has erupted an average of every 800 years, but in the past 4,500 years the volcano has erupted an average of every 600 years. The last significant eruption on Mount Shasta may have occurred about two centuries ago.\nMount Shasta can release volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows or dacite and andesite lava. Its deposits can be detected under nearby small towns. Mount Shasta has an explosive, eruptive history. There are fumaroles on the mountain, which show Mount Shasta is still alive.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for an eruption is a large pyroclastic flow, such as what occurred in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Since there is ice, such as Whitney Glacier and Mud Creek Glacier, lahars would also result. Ash would probably blow inland, perhaps as far as eastern Nevada. There is a small chance an eruption could result in a collapse of the mountain, as happened when Mount Mazama in Oregon collapsed to form what is now called Crater Lake, but this is of much lower probability.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey monitors Mount Shasta and rates it as a very high-threat volcano.\n\nThe summer climbing season runs from late April until October, although many attempts are made in the winter. In winter, Sargents Ridge and Casaval Ridge, to the east and west of Avalanche Gulch, respectively, become the most traveled routes, to avoid avalanche danger. Mount Shasta is also a popular destination for backcountry skiing. Many of the climbing routes can be descended by experienced skiers, and there are numerous lower-angled areas around the base of the mountain.\n\nThe most popular route on Mount Shasta is Avalanche Gulch route, which begins at the Bunny Flat Trailhead and gains about of elevation in approximately round trip. The crux of this route is considered to be to climb from Lake Helen, at approximately , to the top of Red Banks. The Red Banks are the most technical portion of the climb, as they are usually full of snow/ice, are very steep, and top out at around before the route heads to Misery Hill.\nThe Casaval Ridge route is a steeper, more technical route on the mountain's southwest ridge best climbed when there's a lot of snow pack. This route tops out to the left (north) of the Red Banks, directly west of Misery Hill. So the final sections involve a trudge up Misery Hill to the summit plateau, similar to the Avalanche Gulch route.\nNo quota system currently exists for climbing Mount Shasta, and reservations are not required. However, climbers must obtain a summit pass and a wilderness permit to climb the mountain. Permits and passes are available at the ranger station in Mount Shasta and the ranger station in McCloud, or climbers can obtain self-issue permits and passes at any of the trailheads 24 hours a day.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14285288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14285288", "title": "Nirjara", "text": "Nirjara\n\nNirjara is one of the seven fundamental principles, or Tattva in Jain philosophy, and refers to the shedding or removal of accumulated karmas from the atma (soul), essential for breaking free from samsara, the cycle of birth-death and rebirth, by achieving moksha, liberation.\n\nLiterally meaning \"falling off\", the concept is described first in chapter 9 of the classical Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra (True nature of Reality) written by Acharya Umasvati, in 2nd century CE, the only text authoritative in both Svetambara and Digambara sects of Jainism. Later it also finds mention in Dravyasamgraha (Compendium of substances), a 10th-century Jain text by Acharya Nemichandra.\n\nNirjara is preceded by stoppage of karma accumulation, or \"samvara\", thereby ending \"asrava\" or influx of karma which leads to \"bandha\" or bondage due \"kasaya\" or passions of the soul, namely, \"krodha\" (anger), \"lobha\" (greed), \"mana\" (ego) and \"maya\" (deceit), besides \"raaga\" (attachment) and \"dvesa\" (hatred). \" Dravyasamgraha\" explains that the soul becomes dim due to the dust of karmic matter, thus nirjara itself offers a way to clear the soul, and ultimately leading to moksha, liberation.\n\nNirjara is of two types, \"Bhava Nirjara\", modification of soul which leads to separation of karmic matter from the soul, and \"Dravya Nirjara\", actual separation of karmic matter from the soul. In turn, \"bhava nirjara\" is of two types, \"Savipaka\" and \"Avipaka\".\n\nSavipaka - Passive Method - Also known as \"Akam\" or unintentional \"Nirjara\", equanimous submission to the fruition of karma, and involves natural maturing of past Karma, in due course of time and experiencing the results, both good and bad with equanimity. If the fruits of the past karmas are not received without attachment or agitation then the soul earns fresh karmic bondages. It is also not possible for the soul to know before-hand when and which karma will start to produce results and therefore require good discipline in practicing equanimity under all circumstances.\n\nThis passive method of exhaustion of karmic matter around the soul, after enjoyment of its fruits, is compared with emptying of a pond through evaporation, while water channels are still pouring in. Naturally it is a slow method, as by the time karmas become ripe and are exhausted, new karmas fill in, as karmic matter is constantly pouring into the \"karma sharira\" (karmic body), through asrava, influx of karma. Thus to achieve liberation, the active method of purging off karma, \"avipaka nirjara\" is advised.\n\nAvipaka - Active Method - Also known as \"Sakam\" or intentional \"Nirjara\", it involves individual exertion of ascetic practices, by practicing internal and external austerities, like penances or tapas, literally meaning heat, so as to accelerate the ripening process as well as reducing the effects produced. This is recommended approach as it prepares and conditions the soul and reminds it to be vigilant. Tapas is of two kinds, \"bahya\" or external, and \"antaranga\" or internal.\n\nThe \"Bahya\" or \"bahiranga tapa\", external austerities are meant to discipline the sensual cravings, and prepares the person for internal austerities, which come next.\n\n\nAt some places, alternative to this list include, \"Ichhanirodha\", control of desire for food and material things.\n\nThe \"antaranga tapa\", internal austerities which follow are:\n\n\nAll the first five internal austerities and all six external austerities are preparatory steps for the practice of dhyana, which is the primary cause of moksha.\n\nFor layman the journey begins with practicing the Triple gems of Jainism, \"Ratnatraya\", namely Right View or perception (\"Samyak Darshana\"), Right knowledge (\"Samyak Gyana\") and Right conduct (\"Samyak Charitra\"), which constitute the path to liberation. The monks in Jainism, who have dedicated their lives to achieve, moksha and acquiring the \"Kevala Jnana\", absolute knowledge, however go on to take the five \"Mahavrata\", literally Great Vows, of self-control:\n\nApart from that, the monks also practices, three \"Guptis\" and five \"Samitis\". Three Restraints (\"Gupti\"), i.e., Control of the mind (Managupti), Control of speech (Vacanagupti), Control of body (Kayagupti); and Five Carefulness (Samiti) i.e. Carefulness while walking (Irya Samiti), Carefulness while communicating (Bhasha Samiti), Carefulness while eating (Eshana Samiti), Carefulness while handling their fly-whisks, water gourds, etc. (Adana Nikshepana Samiti), Carefulness while disposing of bodily waste matter (Pratishthapana Samiti)\n\nAccording to Umaswati in \"Tattvartha Sutra\" 10.1.2, \"Kevala Jnana\", absolute knowledge or Omniscience, comes only after, the Mohaniya karma are first destroyed, followed by Jnanavaraniya karma, Darsanavarana karma and Antaraya karma. However after attaining the \"Kevala jnana\", the causes of bandha, bondage end, thus the influx of Karma, asrava, ends as well, thus the person is freed from the Aghatiya karmas namely, Ayu karma, Nama karma, Gotra karma and Vedaniya karma, which cause worldly existence. Emptied of karma the person attains liberation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18577584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18577584", "title": "PZ Myers", "text": "PZ Myers\n\nPaul Zachary Myers (born March 9, 1957) is an American biologist who founded and writes the \"Pharyngula\" science-blog. He is associate-professor of biology at the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) where he works in the field of developmental biology. He is a critic of intelligent design (ID), the creationist movement, and other pseudoscientific concepts.\n\nIn 2006 the journal \"Nature\" listed Myers's \"Pharyngula\" as the top-ranked blog by a scientist based on popularity. Myers received the American Humanist Association's 2009 Humanist of the Year award and the International Humanist Award in 2011. Asteroid 153298 Paulmyers is named in his honor.\n\nMyers was born March 9, 1957, the eldest of six children in Kent, Washington; his mother is of Swedish and Norwegian descent. Regarding his ancestry, Myers wrote: \"I'm only half Scandinavian. The blood has been thinned with that of those domesticated English and Irish and Scots.\" He was named \"Paul Zachary\", after his grandfather, but preferred the initials PZ to being called \"Little Paul\". He has described his family as \"probably what would be called the working poor nowadays\", and noted that \"when I was growing up I was called white trash more than a few times\".\n\nHe claims to have been a \"science geek\" from an early age, gaining an interest in zoology and marine biology from studying the insides of fish while on fishing trips with his father.\n\nGrowing up, Myers attended an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) church. Prior to his confirmation, Myers says, \"I started thinking, you know, I don't believe a word of this.\" Now an atheist, Myers comments widely on his blog about science, education, atheism and religion.\n\nMyers graduated from Kent-Meridian High School in 1975 and subsequently attended DePauw University in Indiana on a full scholarship. However, he returned home the next year after his father suffered a heart attack. He then graduated from the University of Washington in 1979 with Bachelor of Science in zoology. Myers drifted away from this field toward evolutionary developmental biology and obtained a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon.\nA self-styled \"godless liberal\" and outspoken atheist, he is a vocal critic of all forms of religion, superstition, supernaturalism, spirituality and pseudoscience. He is quoted as having \"nothing but contempt\" for intelligent design, arguing that it is \"fundamentally dishonest\".\n\nHe is also an outspoken supporter of sex-positive feminism. Myers believes women should make their own sexual choices without outside pressure.\n\nIn 2009 Myers was named the American Humanist Association's \"Humanist of the Year\".\n\nIn April 2015, Atheist Ireland issued an official announcement, apologizing that they had given Myers \"public platforms in Ireland, both at the World Atheist Convention in 2011, and at our international conference in 2013 on Empowering Women Through Secularism\" and that now it is \"publicly dissociating itself from the hurtful and dehumanising, hateful and violent, unjust and defamatory rhetoric of the atheist blogger PZ Myers\".\n\nIn 2017, PZ Myers who formerly considered himself one of the \"New Atheists\", disassociated himself with the New Atheist label. Describing the label as being applied \"against our protests, because we were all aware that there was nothing new about it. Maybe we were more aggressive, or maybe suddenly people were listening to us, but really, it was the same old atheism with a fancy artisan label\", Myers prefers to be simply referred to as an atheist.\n\nMyers has taught and researched at the University of Oregon, the University of Utah and Temple University. He is currently an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota's Morris campus. He is a member of \"Minnesota Citizens for Science Education\", and cultivates an interest in cephalopods.\n\nMyers has been active on the internet. He was involved in scientific debates on USENET surrounding the growing creationist movement. He was a founding member of The Panda's Thumb blog. In June 2002, he started his website \"Pharyngula.org\", which morphed into a blog now hosted by ScienceBlogs and Freethought Blogs.\n\nPharyngula is Myers's personal weblog, promoted as \"Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal.\" The topics Myers covers are eclectic, delving into the non-scientific as well as scientific. While Pharyngula includes many articles discussing breaking science news and research, the blog has become particularly well known for ridicule of intelligent design and of attempts to insert it into science education. In 2006, the science journal \"Nature\" listed Pharyngula as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist.\n\nPharyngula.org was started on June 19, 2002. It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class. Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web-publishing software, and started to use it himself. The blog is named after his favorite stage in embryonic development, the pharyngula stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs, a project of Seed Magazine, in 2005.\n\nOn Pharyngula, Myers has repeatedly denounced the Discovery Institute, Answers in Genesis, and other creationist websites, as well as offering rebuttals to Intelligent Design, pointing out that its claims are pseudoscientific. Other posts on Pharyngula cover a broad variety of topics that interest Myers. These include cephalopods; science; religion; local, national and international politics, particularly those involving science and/or education; superstition; and evolutionary developmental biology. Myers dismissed the Discovery Institute's petition A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism, stating that the scientists listed didn't have credentials relevant to Biology, and that the number of them was minuscule compared to the scientific community as a whole.\n\nOn his blog in 2007, Myers reviewed Stuart Pivar's book \"Lifecode\", which argues that self-organization at the embryonic and fetal stages determine the development and final structure of organisms. Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence.\nHow his theory can be reconciled with a large body of embryological evidence that directly contradicts virtually all of it is not clear, and Pivar has chosen not to address any of it. And a book full of geometrically interesting sketches neither explains nor supports Pivar's theory.… Theories are supposed to explain observation and experiment. You don't come up with a theory first, and then invent the evidence to support it.\nAfter some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula, Pivar sued Myers for libel. Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit, stating that \"the real issue got sidelined\" and that his problem was more with Seed Media Group.\n\nIn addition to articles about keeping religion out of science education, church-state separation, and complaints of misdeeds done in the name of religion, Myers continues to write about science in the disciplines of evolution, palaeontology, genetics, development, and molecular biology.\n\nIn 2012, Myers announced that Chris Clarke, an environmentalist and blogger, would become Pharyngula's co-author. Clarke left the blog in August 2013, partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of \"Pharyngula\" commenters. \n\nMyers's book, \"The Happy Atheist,\" was published by Random House in August, 2013. It is largely a compilation of previous blog posts.\n\nThe book has been well-received by critics. Fellow blogger Greg Laden celebrates \"the level of refinement of his writing\" and noting that \"these essays actually have a different feel to them\".\n\nA controversy arose in July 2008 over a Pharyngula blog entry written by Myers expressing amazement at news reports of death threats issued to University of Central Florida Student Senator Webster Cook. On June 29, 2008, Cook attended a Catholic Mass being held in the student union at UCF by a Catholic student group that receives funding from the student government. Cook received the Catholic Eucharist host but did not consume it immediately. He said later that he wanted to take it back to his seat to show a friend, but when stopped he pretended to put it in his mouth until back at his seat, then a church leader made forcible attempts to take the wafer from him. Cook stored the host at his home, then returned it one week later after receiving e-mail threats and pleas. Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League, described the student's actions as \"beyond hate speech\" and said that \"All options should be on the table, including expulsion.\"\n\nIn his July 8 blog entry, Myers criticized the reaction to Cook's act. Myers described the level of harassment including multiple death threats leveled against the student, and accusations against the student which included hate crime, kidnapping, and intent to desecrate the Eucharist which Catholics consider a mortal sin. Myers expressed outrage that Fox News Channel appeared to be inciting readers to cause further problems for the student, and ridiculed reports that armed guards would attend the next mass. Myers suggested that if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts for him, he would treat the wafers \"with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web.\"\n\nMyers was criticized from both religious and non-religious quarters. The Catholic League accused Myers of anti-Catholic bigotry, described his proposal as a threat to desecrate what Catholics hold to be the Body of Christ, and sent a letter asking the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers. The Catholic League argued that, as the Pharyngula website was accessible via a link from the University of Minnesota's website, it should be bound by the university's code of conduct, which requires faculty to be \"respectful, fair and civil\" when dealing with others. Joe Foley, a member of the Board of the Secular Student Alliance, wrote on the organization's website that Myers had \"crossed the line\" from \"playful satire\" to \"masturbatory condescension\". Foley concluded, \"if open-minded believers are willing to join us in polite dialogue, we need to be ready to welcome them with more than ridicule and pranks.\"\n\nSubsequently, Myers explained to the \"Star Tribune\" that while his post was \"satire and protest,\" he had received death threats regarding the incident but was not taking them too seriously. In a talk show featuring Myers on \"Catholic Radio International\", hosted by Jeff Gardner, Myers confirmed that he had been sent an unspecified number of consecrated hosts and said that he intended to “subject them to heinous cracker abuse.” When asked by Gardner to explain why he must do so, Myers said that Donohue of the Catholic League was insisting that he acknowledge the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Gardner pointed out that Donohue had no authority to insist on such acknowledgment. The show host then asked Myers which individual possessing the Magisterial authority of the Catholic Church had insisted that he recognize the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Myers replied that no one from the Catholic Church had contacted him.\n\nOn July 24, 2008, Myers, in his post, \"The Great Desecration,\" wrote that he had pierced through the \"goddamned cracker\" with a rusty nail, which he also used to pierce a few ripped-out pages of the Qur'an (in English translation, not the original Arabic) and \"The God Delusion\", and had simply thrown them all in the trash along with old coffee grounds and a banana peel. He provided a photograph of these items in the garbage, and wrote that nothing must be held sacred, encouraging people to question everything. In addition, he described the history of allegations of host desecration, emphasizing the frequent use of such allegations in medieval Europe to justify anti-Semitism. The following day, University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) Chancellor stated: \"I believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible\" and that the school \"affirms the freedom of a faculty member to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint.\"\n\nIn April 2007 Myers was interviewed for what he was told would be a documentary titled \"Crossroads\", purportedly about science and religion. However, in September 2007, executive producer Mark Mathis announced that the film was \"\" about perceived censorship of intelligent design supporters in academia and elsewhere. Regarding the discrepancy of focus, Myers wrote: \"I mean, seriously, not telling one of the sides in a debate about what the subject might be and then leading him around randomly to various topics, with the intent of later editing it down to the parts that just make the points you want, is the video version of quote-mining and is fundamentally dishonest.\"\n\nOn March 20, 2008, Myers was of \"Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed\" at the Mall of America in Minneapolis. He was waiting with his family and guests to attend a private screening after having reserved seats for himself and guests under his own name using the freely available online procedure set up by the film's promoters. Shortly before the film started, a security guard told him that the producer Mark Mathis had instructed that Myers be removed from the premises. After telling his family of this Myers went to a nearby Apple store and blogged about his amusement that they had expelled him, but allowed his guest entry to see the film—British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who had also been interviewed for the film under similar circumstances. In a question and answer session at the end of the film Dawkins asked why Myers had been excluded, and later said that \"if anyone had a right to see the film, it was [Myers]. The incompetence, on a public relations level, is beyond belief.\" The saga has been described by Dawkins as \"an incredible piece of inept public relations\" on the part of the film's producers.\n\nMyers's engagement as keynote speaker at the 2009 Secular Student Alliance Conference in Columbus, Ohio developed into an August 7, 2009 trip, in which 304 attendees visited the nearby Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. \n\nBeforehand, there was a flurry of heated blog posts which resulted in the museum sending a warning letter detailing appropriate behavior. The visit resulted in two reported incidents. In one, a student wearing a T-shirt that read \"There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy yourself\" It was also reported that a student was asked to leave the Creation Museum after a family visiting the museum complained to staff that they saw him \"laughing at the exhibits\". Ken Ham however, denied that the student was told to leave, claiming that a photographer who witnessed the incident was the one who was removed.\n\nMyers has been invited to speak about science, rationalism, or atheism at conferences, symposia, and other events. \n\nIn July, 2013, Freethought Blogs organized an online virtual conference called FtBCon or FtB Conscience. Google+ Hangout software was used to enable real-time discussion around the world. Participants included all the Freethought Blog bloggers as well as Jeremy Beahan, Jamila Bey, Virginia Brown, Ania Bula, David Brin, Eneasz Brodski, Ian Bushfield, environmental blogger & author Chris Clarke, James Croft, Heina Dadabhoy, J. T. Eberhard, Daniel Fincke, Debbie Goddard, Julia Galef, Nicole Harris, Rebecca Hensler, scientist and blogger Greg Laden, Robin Marty, science artist & blogger Glendon Mellow, Aoife O’Riordan, Beth Presswood of The Atheist Experience, Kim Rippere, Amy Roth, Jacques Rousseau, Desiree Schell of Skeptically Speaking, David Silverman, Xavier Trapp, blogger Rebecca Watson, Eliezer Yudkowski, scientist & blogger Bora Zivkovic, and others. The conference was free and took place over three days.\n\nMyers has received several awards for his activism and blogging.\n\n\nOfficial\nInterviews/Presentations\n"}

In 1984, the library's contents were confiscated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the empty building allegedly burned to the ground by the Indian Army. In recent years the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has attempted to recover the looted material but has not yet recovered substantial materials. To date, the status of library manuscripts and artifacts is unclear; the vast majority remain in the hands of the government, a few office files and passports were returned, and as many as 117 items were destroyed for being \"seditious\" materials.\n\nThe Sikh Reference Library was established by the SGPC with a resolution dated 27 October 1946. The library had its roots in a meeting of the Sikh Historical Society under the presidency of Princess Bamba on 10 February 1945 at Khalsa College, Amritsar which established the Central Sikh library. The Central Sikh library was then folded into the Sikh Reference Library.\n\nBefore its destruction, the library contained rare books and manuscripts on Sikh religion, history, and culture. It also contained handwritten manuscripts of the Guru Granth Sahib and Hukmnamas containing signatures of Sikh Gurus. The library also held documents related to the Indian Independence Movement.\n\nAccording to the Indian Army white paper on Operation Blue Star, the library was destroyed on the night of June 5, 1984 in the midst of a firefight. However, according to V. M. Tarkunde, the library was still intact on 6 June when the Army had gained control of the Golden Temple, and was in fact burned down by the army at some point between 6 June and 14 June. Although the Indian Army has maintained that the library's contents were completely destroyed on 5 June, the SGPC has contradicted their version of events. By using witness accounts, the SGPC has alleged that material from the library was taken in gunny sacks on military truck to Amritsar's Youth Club, a temporary office of the CBI , and the empty library was burned by the army afterwards. At that location, the CBI catalogued the materials until September 1984, when in light of a Sikh convention being held in the city, the library's contents were moved to an undisclosed location.\n\nIn 2003, Ranjit Nanda, a former inspector for the Central Bureau of Investigation, (CBI) turned whistleblower and revealed he was part of a five member team which scrutinized the documents at the CBI's makeshift office at Amritsar's Youth Club. He revealed that officials from his department were \"desperately looking for a purported letter written by Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, to Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale\", and reported seeing letters from the other leaders addressed to Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale. Manjit Calcutta, a former secretary of the SGPC, corroborated Nanda's version of events but further alleged that the army set the library \"on fire in desperation when it failed to find the letter\". Nanda further confirmed the SGPC's version of events by describing how after inspecting each book and manuscript the CBI packed the documents into 165 numbered gunny sacks and bundled the material into waiting army vehicles because of a meeting of Sikh high priests taking place at the time. He also showed a letter from his superiors commending his work \"during examination of documents from SGPC \".\n\nSince 1988, the SGPC has written to the Central Government asking for the return of the material taken by the CBI but has only received minor office files.\n\nOn 23 May 2000 George Fernandes wrote to the SGPC Secretary, Gurbachan Singh Bachan, and acknowledged that the Indian Army had taken the books and other documents from the Sikh Reference Library and handed them over to the CBI. He asked him to refer the matter to the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, whose jurisdiction the CBI falls under.\n\nIn a visit to Jalandhar, Punjab Fernandes announced that the CBI had destroyed 117 \"seditious\" documents from the material taken from the Sikh Reference Library.\n\nOn 25 March 2003, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam made assurances that the books, documents, and manuscripts would be returned; however, he took no further action.\n\nIn 26 April 2004, the Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered the Central Government, Government of Punjab, and the CBI to return the \"valuables, books, scriptures, paintings, etc, that were seized from the Golden Temple during “Operation Bluestar” in 1984\".\n\nIn February and May 2009, A. K. Antony, defense minister of India, claimed in parliament that the Indian Army no longer had any material taken from the library. Various members of parliament and the SGPC criticized him for \"misleading parliament\".\n"}
{"id": "4767888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4767888", "title": "Taixu", "text": "Taixu\n\nTaixu (), (8 January 1890 – 17 March 1947) was a Buddhist modernist, activist and thinker who advocated the reform and renewal of Chinese Buddhism.\n\nTaixu was born in Hǎiníng (海寧/海宁) in Zhejiang province. His lay name was Lǚ Pèilín (呂沛林). His parents died when he was still young, and he was raised by his grandparents. At 16 he was ordained into the Linji school of Chan Buddhism in Xiao Jiǔhuá Temple (小九華寺/小九华寺) in Suzhou. Not long after being ordained he was given the Dharma name of Taixu, meaning Great Emptiness. In 1909 he travelled to Nanjing to join the Sutra Carving Society established there by the lay Buddhist Yang Renshan.\n\nAs a result of being exposed to the political writings of Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Tan Sitong and Zhang Taiyan, Taixu turned his mind to the reformation of Buddhism. In 1911 while in Guangzhou, he made contact with the revolutionaries plotting to overthrow the Qing dynasty and participated in some secret revolutionary activities. Taixu would later describe the formation of his political thinking during this time in his \"Autobiography\" (自傳 \"zìzhuàn\"):\n\nMy social and political thought was based upon 'Mr. Constitution', the Republican Revolution, Socialism, and Anarchism. As I read works such as Zhang Taiyan's \"On Establishing Religion\", \"On the Five Negatives\", and \"On Evolution\", I came to see Anarchism and Buddhism as close companions, and as a possible advancement from Democratic Socialism.\n\nAfter the establishment of the new Republic of China, Taixu founded the \"Association for the Advancement of Buddhism\" (佛教協進會/佛教协进会 \"fójiào xiéjìn hùi\"), which lasted only a short time due to resistance from conservative Buddhists. Unable to convince the Buddhist community of his ideas, and shocked by the outbreak of the First World War and the sufferings in China, Taixu went into seclusion (閉關/闭关 \"bìguān\") on Putuoshan for three years from October 1914.\n\nUntil his death Taixu worked toward the revival of Buddhism in China, although because of the economic and political turmoil that China experienced through wars and revolutions, few of his projects were successful. He died on March 12, 1947 at the Jade Buddha Temple (玉佛寺 \"yùfó sì\") in Shanghai. One of his influential disciples was Dongchu 東初 (1907–1977).\n\nBesides being a revolutionary activist for the Chinese, Taixu was a Buddhist modernist. He took the doctrine and adapted it so that he may propagate Buddhism throughout the world. One of his grand schemes was to reorganize the Sangha. He envisioned plan was to cut the number of monks in the monastic order down and according to history of religion professor Don A. Pittman, by 1930 Taixu had\n\nthese numbers [down] to include only twenty thousand monastics; five thousand students, twelve thousand bodhisattva monastics, and three thousand elders. Of the twelve thousand bodhisattva monastics, five thousand should be spreading the Dharma through public preaching and teaching, three thousand serving as administrators in Buddhist educational institutions, fifteen hundred engaging in Buddhist charitable and relief work, fifteen hundred serving as instructors in the monastic educational system, and one thousand participating in various cultural affairs.\n\nThis reorganization of the Sangha was an attempt to revitalize Buddhism, an important step to bring about a Pure Land in this world. Pure Land Buddhism was widely practiced in China during his time. Taixu's modernist mentality caused him to propagate the idea of a Pure Land, not as a land of Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world. Pittman writes:\n\nHis views on the realization of that ideal were far from those of the mainstream of the contemporary Sangha. Rather than focusing on the glories of distant pure lands, which were accessible through reliance on the spiritual merit and power of other great bodhisattvas and buddhas, Taixu visualized this earthly world transformed into a pure land by the dedication and sacrificial hard work of thousands of average bodhisattvas who were mindful of what their concerted witness could mean.\n\nLike many Buddhist modernists, Taixu was interested in using tactics such as cultural translation (a method of explaining Buddhism) so that non Buddhists can better comprehend the complexity of the tradition. For example, in his essay \"Science and Buddhism,\" Taixu makes a translation of the Buddha's teaching that inside of every drop of water, there are 84 thousand microbes, a Buddhist teaching that basically states that within our world there are many more worlds. He goes on to explain how that when one looks inside of a microscope one will be able to see these tiny microbes and that each one is a life of its own.\n\nIn his writings he connected the scientific theory that there is infinite space with no center of the universe to the Buddhist Sutras that states \"Space is endless and the number of worlds is infinite, for all are in mutual counterpoise like a network of innumerable beads.\" However, Taixu did not believe that science was the be-all and end-all. As a matter of fact he saw that in no way was it possible to reach enlightenment through science even though it is capable of explaining many of the universe's mysteries. \"Scientific knowledge can prove and postulate the Buddhist doctrine, but it cannot ascertain the realities of the Buddhist doctrine.\"\nHe understood Buddhism to be scientific and yet surpassing science. Like other Buddhist modernists, Taixu condemned superstition. Taixu explains that the two deeply rooted superstitions were the \"Superstition of God\" and the \"Superstition of Reality.\" These two superstitions go hand-in-hand in regards to explaining why, according to Taixu, Buddhism is the only way to true enlightenment. The \"Superstition of God\" can be understand as how science will never be able to explain the existence of the supernatural. Also science is also only able to explain the materialistic aspects of the world, which leads to the second superstition, \"Superstition of Reality.\" The \"Superstition of Reality\" is basically materialism but as materialism, in this sense, means what science is capable of explaining. These two superstitions essentially blind science and people's ability to see the truths that only Buddhism can reveal.\n\nTaixu's reforms of the Sangha were influenced in part by Christianity. While in Europe, Taixu saw the successes of Christian charitable organizations and hoped to bring that organization style into his reformed Buddhism. He implemented these methods into organizations like the Bodhi Society and Right Faith Society, lay organizations devoted to providing charity to the sick, poor, and misfortunate. \n\nHowever, he was critical of Christian philosophy, believing that it was incompatible with modern science and failed to prevent economic depressions in Europe and both World Wars. Western critics argued that he was naive and ill-informed about Christian philosophy, calling his \"Lectures in Buddhism\" \"a rambling, incoherent, amateurish talk.\"\n\nIn one publication by Taixu, he discusses the importance of interreligious dialogue. He realizes the problems that exist in China and through a conversation with a French archbishop he was able to understand this importance. Taixu writes:\n\nAll religions should be regulated in order that they conform to the situation in China. There should be no overt rejection of Catholicism.\n\nThis quote shows that Taixu believed there was no reason to deny the teachings of another religion because different religions, with cooperation and open-mindedness, have the ability to work together and learn from each other. Taixu went as far as incorporating some Christian ideas, such as methods of pastoral training and revival style preaching, into his own Buddhist practices.\n\nBeyond adopting select Christians methods, a more controversial topic that Taixu dealt with openly was the existence of God. When Taixu went into three years of self confinement after a failed reform attempt he reflected on the subject -\nWho is God? Is He made of matter or not? . . . If He exists in the heart only, then his existence is legendary, similar to such non-existent things as \"turtle hair\" and \"hare horn.\" Thus, we should not believe that God created all things in the world. . . . How did He create the Universe? If the Holy Father is part of the universe, it is unreasonable that He created the world. I challenge the existence of God. Show me the evidence of the birth of God. What was He before His birth? Does He exist because He possesses an inherent nature? It is not rational to claim that all things exist before His birth. If there is a birth, or a beginning, there should be an end. It is unreasonable to say that He is almighty. . . . If, with knowledge, God created man and all things at His will, then did He create man blindly or ignorantly? How could He create sinful things, crimes, ignorance, and even blasphemers? This would be unreasonable. If He did all these things, it would be unreasonable that God sent people into exile, to make them suffer, rather than allowing them to stay in Paradise. How could God create men who do not respect Him?\n\nTaixu questions the existence of God because rationally if one looks at the world's situation there is no evidence of a god. He appears to tie this argument to the connections between Buddhism and science, and how superstition creates an obstacle on the path to enlightenment.\n\nIn Taixu’s own article “\"Science and Buddhism\"” he offers many interesting and original thoughts on science and superstition. Taixu’s main argument in the article is that all of the superstition in the world such as “The superstition of God or the restriction of the ego” and “the superstition of reality” prevent the advance of scientific discovery because of the closed-mindedness of the superstitious people to see beyond their beliefs. Taixu writes,\n\nScience therefore, can never be the main support of Buddhism although it may act as a valuable auxiliary and much may be expected from uniting the two methods of investigation.\n\nFrom his writings Taixu’s followers can grasp an understanding that he believes science is a valuable resource but because of people's steadfast faith in superstitions it will never be a successful asset to Buddhism. He seems to argue that science is a means to enlightenment but it will never allow someone to get there. In Taixu's words, \"Scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it.\"\n\nDon Pittman wrote a book entitled “Toward a Modern Chinese Buddhism” in which he analyzes Taixu’s reform efforts. One of his reform efforts was the attempt to make Pure Land Buddhism a reality.\n\nIf today, based on good knowledge of our minds, we can produce pure thoughts and work hard to accomplish good deeds. How hard can it be to transform an impure China into a Chinese pure land?... All persons have this force of mind, and since they already have the faculty (\"benneng\") to create a pure land, they can all make the glorious vow to make this world into a pure land and work hard to achieve it.\"\n\nThis among many things was one of Taixu's greatest ideas of reform. He believed that the only way to end the suffering on this world was to bring the Pure Land to it. He attempted to do so through many means, including the reorganization of the Sangha. Unfortunately for Taixu, his attempts at global propagation of the Dharma failed. Most of his institutions that were set up to help bring about this better life were crushed by many different things, including the communists.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school operates primarily as a boarding school, with most students living on campus either full-time or five-day (going home for the weekends). The school also accepts day students; boarders must be at least eight years old, while day students can be as young as five. Most of the school's 272 students are in grades 8-12.\n\nIn the fall of 1976, the Delphian School opened on the site of a former a Jesuit novitiate near Sheridan, Oregon. The main building on campus is a four-story, Art Deco-style building with a brick exterior that was designed by Poole & McGonigle and built in 1933 for the Jesuit house.\n\nThere were about 60 students enrolled in the school's first year. Two years later in 1978 the school had 120 students, tuition was $4,500 for boarding students and $2,800 for non-boarders.\n\nIn the mid-1980s the campus was considered as a possible location for a federal prison. The Sheridan Federal Correctional Institution opened in 1989 in another location in the area.\n\nThe Delphian School is operated by Delphi Schools using L. Ron Hubbard's study techniques, known as Study Tech. The Study Tech teaching methodology is licensed through the Scientology-related group Applied Scholastics. The school is also the location of Heron Books, which published textbooks and materials using Hubbard's educational philosophy (the Delphi Curriculum).\n\nThe school uses a proficiency- or competency-based education model. There are no letter grades, report cards, or traditional grade levels at the school. Students advance through the curriculum by demonstrating proficiency or competence rather than at a set time.\n\nDelphian School is a member of the Oregon Federation of Independent Schools (OFIS), an organization that works to limit government influence on school choice. The OFIS's current director, Mark Siegel, also acts as assistant headmaster of the school. The school is an accredited member of the Northwest Association of Independent Schools, and an accredited member school of AdvancED.\n\nThe Delphian School's sports team is known as the \"Dragons\". The school participates in the Oregon School Activities Association's (OSAA) Northwest League, 2A classification, for girls and boys basketball, baseball and softball, boys soccer and tennis, volleyball, cheerleading, solo music, and choir. In 2014 the Delphian choir tied for the OSAA Choir State Championship, and three school soccer players were named to the All-State team.\n\nIn 2013 a student was chosen as the youth delegate to Youth for Human Rights International, a Scientology-related organization.\n\nLauren Haggis, a daughter of Paul Haggis, said that Delphian is \"on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere\" and that she \"lived in a giant bubble.

(Latin upper captions translated)\n\nLibavius' illustration and the marble sculpture of the Layer Quaternity share an identical pairing including a naked figure (lower pair), a bare-legged royal male and a regal draped female (upper pair) as well as the titled captions \"Gloria\" and \"Labor\", along with the symbols of palm branch, \"rotundum\", and moon. \n\nThe similarities between the captioned phrases of Libavius' illustration to those of the single-word titles of the Layer Quaternity suggest that in time sequence, the Layer monument was based upon and installed before 1606, the publication date of Libavius' illustration.\n\nBiblical verse which parallels the symbolism of each captioned entity includes for the lower and mortal pair – \"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the Labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was Vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun\". Ecclesiastes 2.v.11 With an antithetical response from the upper, immortal, \"Heavenly\" pair – Glory \"to God in the highest, and on earth Peace, goodwill to all men.\" Luke 2 v.14\n\nThe Layer Quaternity also corresponds to the alchemical 'deities' Apollo, Luna, Mercurius and Vulcan as named in emblem XVII of Atalanta Fugiens (1617) by the German alchemist-physician Michael Maier.\n\nThe four figurines housed in the monument's pilasters, \"Pax\" and \"Gloria\", \"Vanitas\" and \"Labor\", (Peace, Glory, Vanity, Labor) are relatively rare examples of Northern Mannerist sculpture extant in Britain. Collectively they exemplify how Christian iconography during the era of Elizabeth I, in tandem with Renaissance Europe, integrated symbolism from the western esoteric traditions of alchemy and astrology into works of art, including the funerary monument. The Layer Quaternity in their totality are a unique alchemical mandala. Through polarised symbolism they delineate essential coordinates associated with mandala art, namely Space (Heaven and Earth) and Time (Young and Old). They also represent fundamental aspects of the human condition, namely, gender, youth and age, as well as pleasure and suffering. In essence, the Layer Quaternity, not unlike the \"Scaiolae\" of Paracelsus (which are discussed by Libavius in \"Alchemia\") are a quaternity of differentiated virtues or psychic entities which represent a complete wholeness or totality in sum.\n\nThe role of the Quaternity in religious symbolism is discussed at length by Carl Gustav Jung. Much of his in-depth study and observations upon the function and role of the quaternity in religious symbolism is applicable to the Layer Quaternity. To Jung the quaternity was a natural expression of differentiation which always represents a totality, citing the four elements, the four seasons, the ancient Greek schemata of the four humours, and the four temperaments, as well as the four Evangelists with their respective emblems in the form of the tetramorph in Christian iconography, as examples. \n\nThe symbolism of the four entities of the Layer Quaternity exemplify Jung's observation that individuation develops through psychic qualities consisting of two pairs of opposites, which are often polarised to each other.\n\nAs such, the Layer Quaternity may be viewed as exemplary of Renaissance-era psychology. Its four highly-symbolic figurine entities are simultaneously, a 'map' of the psyche, and a highly-original alchemical mandala in western funerary art.\n"}

In 1871, aged eleven, she purportedly fell asleep and did not wake for nine years. The case attracted international attention from newspapers, medical professionals and the public.\n\nBorn to a large, impoverished family of farm workers, Ellen was sent to work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven. Soon afterwards, she began suffering periods of drowsiness and was referred to a local hospital. After four months her condition was declared incurable, and she was sent home. Two days later, Ellen had a series of seizures and—her mother claimed—fell into a deep sleep from which she could not be roused.\nEllen became a tourist attraction for the village, and her family made considerable money from visitors' donations. As the years progressed with no sign of Ellen's waking, speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother, an issue that was never resolved. In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.\n\nEllen Sadler was born on 15 May 1859 to Ann and William Sadler, who lived in the small village of Turville, Buckinghamshire. The Sadlers were a large, impoverished family consisting mainly of farmhands; Ellen, the youngest child, shared her home with her eleven siblings. Ellen's father died while she was an infant; Ann Sadler subsequently married Thomas Frewen.\n\nIn 1870, aged eleven, Ellen began work as a nursemaid in nearby Marlow, but she began suffering periods of somnolence and her employment was terminated. She was subsequently attended by a local doctor, Henry Hayman F.R.C.S., from nearby Stokenchurch. Ellen had been suffering for 13 weeks from \"glandular swellings\" or an abscess on the back of her head, and symptoms consistent with a spinal disease. The family did not have much money, so the parish vicar, The Reverend Studholme, asked Hayman to secure Ellen's admission to a local hospital, where her condition worsened. Ellen stayed at the hospital for 18 weeks before being \"discharged as incurable\" in March 1871.\n\nAccording to Ellen's mother, upon the girl's return home on a rickety cart, she began to feel drowsy and had several seizures. Hayman states that it was two days after her discharge that the seizures occurred. He visited Ellen at her home, where he was told that the previous night, 17 March, Ellen had endured a series of such attacks, after which she turned to lie \"on her left side, with her hand under her head, and the lower extremities drawn upwards\". It was in this position that—her mother maintained—Ellen remained for the duration of her sleep. Hayman visited Ellen many times over the next few years and he later said that he \"never found her otherwise\".\n\nEllen became something of a tourist attraction for Turville. She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the \"plain curious\" from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family to be allowed to see her. Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the \"supply\" began to run out. A \"Bucks Free Press\" journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold ... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances ... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death ... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.\n\nA correspondent from \"The Daily Telegraph\" visited Ellen about 22 months after she fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face is by no means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath ... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash. ... The girl's [hand] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened ... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected. ... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs. ... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby ... [Her feet were] almost ice-cold. ... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that it is almost impossible to detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.\n\nBy March 1873, Ellen was believed to be suffering from starvation. At first, she had largely subsisted on port, tea and milk, given three times per day. After about 15 months—while her mother was attempting to administer arrowroot—Ellen's jaw locked closed. Subsequently, according to Hayman, she was fed \"wine, gruel and other things\" using the \"spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" journalist expanded on Ellen's feeding: \"The feeding implements stand on a little table by the side of the stump bedstead, and, at first sight, give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she, by a merciful termination of her trance, presently awake to life. The toys in question are two tiny 'teapots', each not much larger than a full-sized walnut and holding four small teaspoonfuls. One of these is filled with port wine, and the other with milk ... this quantity of liquid nourishment ... cannot weigh more than half an ounce ...\" At this time, it was considered \"manifestly out of the question to think of moving her\". How the family dealt with Ellen's passing of urine and faeces is unclear, but in 1880, Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years, and that approximately every four days \"a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder\".\n\nSome visitors were sceptical of Ellen's illness and attempted to uncover the alleged ruse through methods such as stabbing her with pins, to no effect. The \"Bucks Free Press\" journalist was suspicious of Ann's practice of making visitors wait before seeing Ellen. Some neighbours were also \"deeply sceptical\", as Ellen's family was making a \"healthy profit\" from her illness. During summers, the family was taking as much as £2 per week (£ as of ). Others said they sometimes saw Ellen sitting by her window at night. Ann consented to \"fair tests\", but further suspicions were raised because medical personnel were not allowed to remain for too long, and Ann did not want Ellen to be moved to a hospital. Nor was Ellen listed as an invalid during the 1871 census. Hayman said that Ann was reluctant to allow handling of her daughter by medical personnel because they often concealed sharp objects with which to \"test [Ellen's] powers of feeling\". Her parents had also \"strenuously opposed\" Hayman's recommendation to run an electric current through Ellen's sleeping body.\nMuch speculation appeared in the press as to the cause of Ellen's illness; some linked the case to that of Sarah Jacob, a girl from Wales who, her parents claimed, was able to survive without nourishment, through divine intervention. Sarah died of starvation in 1869, and her parents were subsequently convicted of manslaughter. A journalist for \"The Observer\" commented, \"It is to be hoped that [Sarah's case] is known in the obscure village of Turville, where—we are asked to believe—a fresh case of miraculous trance has taken place. ... [Ellen's case] very much ... incites suspicion of deliberate imposture.\" One correspondent to \"The Times\" wrote, \"It is by widespread publicity that such cases are multiplied, and it is difficult to overstate the harm thus done. These impostures exist through a morbid love of sympathy on the part of the children, or from the gains that accrue to the parents. Once begun, they soon pass into real disease.\" Another said the \"ridiculous mystery\" could be resolved if only Ellen were transferred, over her mother's continued objections, to a London hospital, a sentiment echoed by many. Claims that Ellen was suffering from a form of catalepsy—a condition at the time considered \"so rare that not one physician in a thousand has so much as seen a single case of it\"—were also disregarded as unlikely, as was any thought of religious ecstasy.\n\nNevertheless, Hayman affirmed, \"every effort [had] been made to discover the deception, if any, but without effect.\" The Home Secretary and local Magistrate corresponded about the case but the law was powerless to interfere, because despite accepting donations, Ellen's family never asked for money outright, and she \"was not represented as a 'fasting girl, as Sarah Jacob had been. \"The Daily Telegraph\" journalist said, \"[Ann Frewen]'s manner is that of a perfectly honest woman who would be too glad if her child could be restored to consciousness.\" He spoke to neighbours, none of whom indicated anything other than trust in Ellen's parents and Hayman, and claimed that the family was receiving no money from Ellen's illness, although the latter point is contradicted by Hayman and others. The journalist concluded, \"I have no medical knowledge, and [am] unqualified to give an opinion beyond what is justified by close observation of the ordinary kind. I went to Turville prepared to find an imposture. I have returned—puzzled.\"\n\nAnn Frewen died in May 1880. The inquest into her death was held at the nearby Bull and Butcher public house, presided over by the county coroner, Frederick Charsley. Part of the inquest's remit was to consider the matter of Ellen's subsequent care. Thomas Frewen was reported as being \"quite evasive\" when the coroner asked him how Ellen was fed, and although Hayman testified to reaffirm his stance that Ellen's illness was genuine, Reverend Studholme was less certain. However, he could not offer any evidence to this effect, even though he had made several unannounced visits to Ellen's home. Charsley concluded that Thomas could not look after Ellen, as his job left him absent from their home all day, and that the other members of the household would be too busy with its upkeep. Therefore, he turned Ellen's care over to her married sisters, Elizabeth Stacey and Grace Blackall, both of whom lived in Turville. The cause of Ann's death was found to be oedema of the heart, from which she had been suffering for many years.\n\nFive months later, Ellen awoke; by November, she had \"fully recovered\". By this time, Ellen was twenty-one and claimed to remember nothing of the previous nine years. She otherwise suffered few long-term effects, save for slightly stunted growth and a \"weak eye\".\n\nIn 1886, Ellen married Mark Blackall in nearby Fawley. In the censuses of 1891 and 1901, the pair are listed as living in Barkham and Caversham, respectively. They had five children: Ann (b. 1888), Elizabeth or Mable (b. 1889), Gladys (b. 1890), Sydney (b. 1896) and Gertrude (b. 1898). Ellen and Mark appear in the 1911 census together with Sydney and Gertrude, all living in Lower Caversham. The census also records that they had six children of which one had died.\n\nThe case of Ellen Sadler has remained a part of local folklore, spawning tales of witchcraft and rumours of royal attention in Turville. The Sadler family home became known as \"Sleepy Cottage\", and was used for filming of the BBC situation comedy \"The Vicar of Dibley\". No clear cause has ever been ascribed for Ellen's condition; modern diagnoses might include narcolepsy, or deliberate drugging, and the possibility that it was a hoax cannot be discounted. An embellished account of the story can be found in the 1973 collection, \"Witchcraft in the Thames Valley\" by Tony Barham.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4655918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4655918", "title": "Traditional African religions", "text": "Traditional African religions\n\nThe traditional African religions (or traditional beliefs and practices of African people) are a set of highly diverse beliefs that include various ethnic religions. Generally, these traditions are oral rather than scriptural, include belief in a supreme creator, belief in spirits, veneration of the dead, use of magic and traditional medicine. The role of humanity is generally seen as one of harmonising nature with the supernatural.\n\nAdherents of traditional religions in Sub-Saharan Africa are distributed among 43 countries and are estimated to number over 100 million.\n\nAlthough the majority of Africans are adherents of Christianity or Islam, African people often combine the practice of their traditional belief with the practice of Abrahamic religions. The two Abrahamic religions are widespread across Africa, though mostly concentrated in different areas. They have replaced indigenous African religions, but are often adapted to African cultural contexts and belief systems.\n\nWest and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by \"force\" (or \"ashe\", \"nyama\", etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. \n\nWhen this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech. Also, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.\n\nFollowers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their ancestors.\nThese secondary spirits serve as intermediaries between humans and the primary God, also referred to as the Supreme Deity. Most African societies believe in a single Supreme being (Chukwu, Nyame, Olodumare, Ngai, Roog, etc.). Some recognize a dual God and Goddess such as Mawu-Lisa.\n\nThere are more similarities than differences in all traditional African religions. Often, the supreme Deity is worshiped through consultation or communion with lesser deities and ancestral spirits. The deities and spirits are honored through libation, sacrifice (of animals, vegetables, cooked food, flowers, semi-precious stones and precious metals). The will of the Supreme Deity is sought by the believer also through consultation of divinities or divination. In many traditional African religions, there is a belief in a cyclical nature of reality. The living stand between their ancestors and the unborn. Traditional African religions embrace natural phenomena – ebb and tide, waxing and waning moon, rain and drought – and the rhythmic pattern of agriculture. According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of traditional African religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.\n\nFor example, in the Serer religion, one of the most sacred stars in the cosmos is called Yoonir (the Star of Sirius). With a long farming tradition, the Serer high priests and priestesses (Saltigue) deliver yearly sermons at the Xoy Ceremony (divination ceremony) in Fatick before Yoonir's phase in order to predict winter months and enable farmers to start planting.\n\nTraditional healers are common in most areas, and their practices include a religious element to varying degrees.\n\nSince Africa is a large continent with many ethnic groups and cultures, there is not one single technique of casting divination. The practice of casting may be done with small objects, such as bones, cowrie shells, stones, strips of leather, or flat pieces of wood.\n\nSome castings are done using sacred divination plates made of wood or performed on the ground (often within a circle).\n\nIn traditional African societies, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.\n\nVirtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life. Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous.\n\nIn some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives. For the Kikuyu, according to their primary supreme creator, Ngai, acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience. Traditionally, as now, the Kikuyu were monotheists, believing in a unique and omnipotent God whom they called Ngai. The word, is related to the Maasai word Enkai, and was borrowed by both the Kikuyu and Kamba. God is also known as Mungu, Murungu, or Mulungu (a variant of a word meaning God, which is found as far south as the Zambesi of Zambia), and is sometimes given the title Mwathani or Mwathi (the greatest ruler), which comes from the word gwatha, meaning to rule or reign with authority.\n\nNgai is the creator and giver of all things, 'the Divider of the Universe and Lord of Nature'. He gave birth to the human community, created the first Kikuyu communities, and provided them with all the resources necessary for life: land, rain, plants and animals.\nHe - for Ngai is male - cannot be seen, but is manifest in the sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, thunder and lightning, rain, in rainbows and in the great fig trees (mugùmò) that served as places of worship and sacrifice, and which marked the spot at Mukurue wa Gathanga where Gikuyu and Mumbi - the ancestors of the Kikuyu in the oral legend - first settled.\n\nYet Ngai is not the distant God that we know in the West. He had human characteristics, and although some say that he lives in the sky or in the clouds, they also say that he comes to earth from time to time to inspect it, bestow blessings and mete out punishment. When he comes he rests on Mount Kenya and four other sacred mountains. Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of God, and lightning is God's weapon by means of which he clears the way when moving from one sacred place to another. Other people believed that Ngai's abode was on Mount Kenya, or else 'beyond' its peaks. Ngai, says one legend, made the mountain his resting place while on an inspection tour of earth. He then took the first man, Gikuyu, to the top to point out the beauty of the land he was giving him.In traditional African religions, such as the Azande religion, a person is said to have a good or bad conscience, depending on whether he does the bidding of God or malevolent spirits.\n\nIn many cases, Africans who have converted to other religions have still kept up their traditional customs and practices, combining them in a syncretic way.\n\nSome sacred or holy locations for traditional religions include Nri-Igbo, the Point of Sangomar, Yaboyabo, Fatick, Ife, Oyo, Dahomey, Benin City, Ouidah, Nsukka, Kanem-Bornu, Tulwap Kipsigis, and Igbo-Ukwu among others.\n\nThis list is limited to a few well-known traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20965184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20965184", "title": "Ukrainian Radical Party", "text": "Ukrainian Radical Party\n\nThe Ukrainian Radical Party, (URP), (, \"Ukrainska Radikalna Partiya\") founded in October 1890 and based on the radical movement in western Ukraine dating from the 1870s, was the first modern Ukrainian political party with a defined program, mass following, and registered membership. It advocated socialism, increased rights for Ukrainian peasants, and secularism.\n\nThe Radical Party ideology was based on the political thought of Mykhailo Drahomanov, an eastern Ukrainian thinker who spent part of the nineteenth century in western Ukraine. Although the Radical party advocated socialism in its ideology, it considered itself different from western socialists who were beholden to the ideas of Karl Marx because western socialism was based on the industrial proletariat while the Radical party was focused on the peasantry. Accordingly, its socialism was agrarian and peasant-based. The Ukrainian Radical party claimed kinship and affinity with the similarly peasant-based socialist Serbian Radical Party of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It actively opposed the influence of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and its priests in Ukrainian society. It was also opposed to the Austrian government, to mainstream Ukrainophiles who were loyal to Austria, and to Ukrainian attempts to cooperate with Polish authorities. At the same time, the URP cooperated with Polish workers and peasants. The URP supported Ukrainian independence at a party congress in 1895, the first time that the goal of an independent Ukrainian state had been expressed anywhere. Involved with the plight of the Ukrainian peasants, the URP also called for and organized strikes of Ukrainian agricultural workers.\n\nThe Radical Party was founded in Lviv on October 4, 1890 by a group of Ukrainian activists including the poet Ivan Franko, the publisher Mykhailo Pavlyk, and others. It was involved in founding reading rooms and cooperatives, organizing women's groups, and training and politicizing Ukrainian peasants. In 1895, the party passed a resolution calling for Ukrainian independence. That same year, it sent three representatives to the Galician Diet and in 1897 two representatives to the Austrian parliament.\n\nIn the mid-1890s three competing groups emerged within the URP. One maintained its allegiance to the traditional ideology of the URP. Another faction turned more to western European socialism and Marxism. A third faction which included most of the Radical Party's most prominent members such as Ivan Franko became increasingly disenchanted with socialist ideas and more focussed on national concerns. In 1899 the latter two groups left the Radical Party. The socialist-learning faction split off to form the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. The nationalist-leading faction merged with mainstream Ukrainiphiles to create the National Democratic Party, which was the largest Ukrainian political party in Austrian-ruled Ukraine before and during the first world war. The National Democratic party, renamed the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance, would continue to dominate western Ukrainian political life until the Second World War.\n\nAfter the exodus of the Ukrainian Social Democrats and the National Democrats, the remaining Ukrainian Radical Party, having become a definitively peasant-oriented party, was the second largest political party among ethnic Ukrainians in western Ukraine. In 1911, it sent five members to the Austrian parliament and in 1913 six members to the Galician Diet. On the eve of World War I, the Radical party established sporting societies and paramilitary groups that would serve as the basis for the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, an all-Ukrainian unit within the Austrian army.\n\nThe Ukrainian Radical Party was one of the founding parties of the West Ukrainian National Republic, and its members occupied the posts of defence minister (Dmytro Vitovsky) and interior secretary within the West Ukrainian government. Following the war, when western Ukraine became part of the Polish state, at a party congress in 1925 the Radical Party passed a resolution simultaneously opposing cooperation with Ukrainian \"bourgeois parties\" and condemning Bolsheviks policies in Soviet Ukraine. A year later, it merged with a socialist party and renamed itself the Ukrainian Socialist Radical Party (USRP). In the 1928 Polish elections, the party received 280,000 votes, the second most among western Ukrainian parties following the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance's 600,000 votes. This enabled the USRP to send 11 representatives into the parliament and 3 into the senate. In the 1931 elections it ran in a coalition with the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance and obtained 1/4 of the coalition's seats. The USRP boycotted all subsequent Polish elections.\n\nThe party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1931 and 1940.\n\nAfter the Soviets annexed western Ukrainian territory in 1939, the USRP like all other western Ukrainian political parties was forced by the Soviet authorities to disband.\n\n\n"}
