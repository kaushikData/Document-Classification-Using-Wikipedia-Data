His self-immolation was an act of protest against the Roman Catholic Church's ongoing condemnation of homosexuality.\n\nOrmando's only published book was the novel \"Il Fratacchione\" (\"The Overweight Monk\"), which recounted his two years at a monastery attempting to get closer to God and to purify himself of \"unclean\" desires. The narrator in the book states, \"It isn't true that gay is beautiful. On the contrary, it is a continual death on the inside. Either you accept being gay, or you kill yourself.\"\n\nOn 13 January 1998, Ormando set himself on fire in St. Peter's Square close to where Pope John Paul II was addressing the crowds. Two policemen tried to extinguish the flames, and he was taken to Sant'Eugenio Hospital with third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body. He died 11 days later. Ormando was 39 years old. In a letter to a friend he wrote: \"I hope they will understand the message I want to give - it is a form of protest against a Church that demonises homosexuality, demonising nature at the same time; despite the fact that homosexuality is a child of nature\".\n\nAuthorities in the Roman Catholic Church downplayed the event, arguing that he was psychologically disturbed, had family problems and had not been making a protest against the Church.\n\nOrmando's actions are commemorated in St Peter's Square by human rights activists\n\nIn 2014, the filmmaker Andy Abrahams Wilson, produced a 40-minute documentary film called \"Alfredo's Fire\" for the San Francisco-based Open Eye Pictures. Wilson argued that, \"Fire was the perfect allegory for the experiences of LGBT people. Fire is at once a self-annihilation, and harkens back to the Middle Ages when homosexuals were burned at the stake\".\n\n\n"}

Some forms of Buddhism also use chanting for ritualistic purposes.\n\nWhile the basis for most Theravada chants is the Pali Canon, Mahayana and Vajrayana chants draw from a wider range of sources.\n\nIn the Theravada tradition, chanting is usually done in Pali, sometimes with vernacular translations interspersed. Among the most popular Theravada chants are:\n\nThe traditional chanting in Khmer Buddhism is called Smot.\n\nSince Japanese Buddhism is divided in thirteen doctrinal schools, and since Chan Buddhism, Zen and Buddhism in Vietnam – although sharing a common historical origin and a common doctrinal content – are divided according to geographical borders, there are several different forms of arrangements of scriptures to chant within Mahayana Buddhism.:\n\nIn the Vajrayana tradition, chanting is also used as an invocative ritual in order to set one's mind on a deity, Tantric ceremony, mandala, or particular concept one wishes to further in themselves.\n\nFor Vajrayana practitioners, the chant Om Mani Padme Hum is very popular around the world as both a praise of peace and the primary mantra of Avalokitesvara. Other popular chants include those of Tara, Bhaisajyaguru, and Amitabha.\n\nTibetan monks are noted for their skill at throat-singing, a specialized form of chanting in which, by amplifying the voice's upper partials, the chanter can produce multiple distinct pitches simultaneously. Japanese esoteric practitioners also practice a form of chanting called \"shomyo\".\n\nIn the \"Ghitassara Sutta\" (Anguttara Nikaya 5.209), the Buddha teaches:\n\nJohn Daido Loori justified the use of chanting sutras by referring to Zen master Dōgen. Dōgen is known to have refuted the statement \"Painted rice cakes will not satisfy hunger\". This statement means that sutras, which are just symbols like painted rice cakes, cannot truly satisfy one's spiritual hunger. Dōgen, however, saw that there is no separation between metaphor and reality. \"There is no difference between paintings, rice cakes, or any thing at all\". The symbol and the symbolized were inherently the same, and thus only the sutras could truly satisfy one's spiritual needs.\n\nTo understand this non-dual relationship experientially, one is told to practice liturgy intimately. In distinguishing between ceremony and liturgy, Dōgen states, \"In ceremony there are forms and there are sounds, there is understanding and there is believing. In liturgy there is only intimacy.\" The practitioner is instructed to listen to and speak liturgy not just with one sense, but with one's \"whole body-and-mind\". By listening with one's entire being, one eliminates the space between the self and the liturgy. Thus, Dōgen's instructions are to \"listen with the eye and see with the ear\". By focusing all of one's being on one specific practice, duality is transcended. Dōgen says, \"Let go of the eye, and the whole body-and-mind are nothing but the eye; let go of the ear, and the whole universe is nothing but the ear.\" Chanting intimately thus allows one to experience a non-dual reality. The liturgy used is a tool to allow the practitioner to transcend the old conceptions of self and other. In this way, intimate liturgy practice allows one to realize emptiness (sunyata), which is at the heart of Zen Buddhist teachings.\n\nThere are also a number of New Age and experimental schools related to Buddhist thought which practise chanting, some with understanding of the words, others merely based on repetition. A large number of these schools tend to be syncretic and incorporate Hindu japa and other such traditions alongside the Buddhist influences.\n\nWhile not strictly a variation of Buddhist chanting in itself, Japanese \"Shigin\" (詩吟) is a form of chanted poetry that reflects several principles of Zen Buddhism. It is sung in the \"seiza\" position, and participants are encouraged to sing from the gut - the Zen locus of power. \"Shigin\" and related practices are often sung at Buddhist ceremonies and quasi-religious gatherings in Japan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30874039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30874039", "title": "Chalukya dynasty", "text": "Chalukya dynasty\n\nThe Chalukya dynasty () was an Indian royal dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". Kannada literature, which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the Jain and Veerashaiva traditions. The 11th century saw the birth of Telugu literature under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas.\n\nWhile opinions vary regarding the early origins of the Chalukyas, the consensus among noted historians such as John Keay, D.C. Sircar, Hans Raj, S. Sen, Kamath, K. V. Ramesh and Karmarkar is the founders of the empire at Badami were native to the modern Karnataka region.\n\nA theory that they were descendants of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves \"Vashisthiputras\" of the \"Hiranyakagotra\". The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as \"Harithiputras\" of \"Manavyasagotra\" in their inscriptions, which is the same lineage as their early overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.\n\nA later record of Eastern Chalukyas mentions the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of Ayodhya came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess. She had a child called Vijayaditya who is claimed to be the Pulakeshin I's father. However, according to the historians K. V. Ramesh, Chopra and Sastri, there are Badami Chalukya inscriptions that confirm Jayasimha was Pulakeshin I's grandfather and Ranaraga, his father. Kamath and Moraes claim it was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin.\n\nWhile the northern origin theory has been dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination. According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity may have been due to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region. The writing of 12th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the Shudra caste while other sources claim they were Kshatriyas.\n\nThe historians Jan Houben and Kamath, and the epigraphist D.C. Sircar note the Badami Chalukya inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit. According to the historian N. L. Rao, their inscriptions call them \"Karnatas\" and their names use indigenous Kannada titles such as \"Priyagallam\" and \"Noduttagelvom\". The names of some Chalukya princes end with the pure Kannada term \"arasa\" (meaning \"king\" or \"chief\"). The Rashtrakuta inscriptions call the Chalukyas of Badami \"Karnatabala\" (\"Power of Karnata\"). It has been proposed by the historian S. C. Nandinath that the word \"Chalukya\" originated from \"Salki\" or \"Chalki\" which is a Kannada word for an agricultural implement.\n\nInscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main source of information about Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the Badami cave inscriptions of Mangalesha (578), Kappe Arabhatta record of c. 700, Peddavaduguru inscription of Pulakeshin II, the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of Vikramaditya II (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language. The Badami cliff inscription of Pulakeshin I (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script.\nThe reign of the Chalukyas saw the arrival of Kannada as the predominant language of inscriptions along with Sanskrit, in areas of the Indian peninsula outside what is known as Tamilaham (Tamil country). Several coins of the Badami Chalukyas with Kannada legends have been found. All this indicates that Kannada language flourished during this period.\n\nTravelogues of contemporary foreign travellers have provided useful information about the Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang had visited the court of Pulakeshin II. At the time of this visit, as mentioned in the Aihole record, Pulakeshin II had divided his empire into three \"Maharashtrakas\" or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day Karnataka, Maharashtra and coastal Konkan. Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed that the benefits of the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor Khosrau II exchanged ambassadors with Pulakeshin II.\n\nCourt poets of the Western Chalukya dynasty of Kalyani narrate:\n\nSome scholars connect the Chalukyas with the Chaulukyas (Solankis) of Gujarat. According to a myth mentioned in latter manuscripts of Prithviraj Raso, Chaulukyas were born out of fire-pit (Agnikund) at Mount Abu. However it has been reported that the story of Agnikula is not mentioned at all in the original version of the Prithviraj Raso preserved in the Fort Library at Bikaner.\n\nAccording to the Nilagunda inscription of King Vikramaditya VI (11th century or later), the Chalukyas originally hailed from Ayodhya where fifty-nine kings ruled, and later, sixteen more of this family ruled from South India where they had migrated. This is repeated by his court poet Bilhana, who claims that the first member of the family, \"Chalukya\", was so named as he was born in the \"hollow of the hands\" of God Brahma.\n\nAccording to a theory put forward by Lewis, the Chalukya were descendants of the \"Seleukia\" tribe of Iraq and that their conflict with the Pallava of Kanchi was, but a continuation of the conflict between ancient Seleukia and \"Parthians\", the proposed ancestors of Pallavas. However, this theory has been rejected by Kamath as it seeks to build lineages based simply on similar-sounding clan names.\n\nThe Chalukyas ruled over the Deccan plateau in India for over 600 years. During this period, they ruled as three closely related, but individual dynasties. These are the \"Chalukyas of Badami\" (also called \"Early Chalukyas\"), who ruled between the 6th and the 8th century, and the two sibling dynasties, the \"Chalukyas of Kalyani\" (also called Western Chalukyas or \"Later Chalukyas\") and the \"Chalukyas of Vengi\" (also called Eastern Chalukyas).\n\nIn the 6th century, with the decline of the Gupta dynasty and their immediate successors in northern India, major changes began to happen in the area south of the Vindhyas – the Deccan and Tamilaham. The age of small kingdoms had given way to large empires in this region. The Chalukya dynasty was established by Pulakeshin I in 543. Pulakeshin I took Vatapi (modern Badami in Bagalkot district, Karnataka) under his control and made it his capital. Pulakeshin I and his descendants are referred to as \"Chalukyas of Badami\". They ruled over an empire that comprised the entire state of Karnataka and most of Andhra Pradesh in the Deccan.\n\nPulakeshin II, whose pre-coronation name was Ereya, commanded control over the entire Deccan and is perhaps the most well-known emperor of the Badami dynasty. He is considered one of the notable kings in Indian history. His queens were princess from the Alupa Dynasty of South Canara and the Western Ganga Dynasty of Talakad, clans with whom the Chalukyas maintained close family and marital relationships. Pulakeshin II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and halted the southward march of Harsha by defeating him on the banks of the river Narmada. He then defeated the Vishnukundins in the south-eastern Deccan. Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily. It is presumed Pulakeshin II, \"the great hero\", died fighting.\n\nThe Badami Chalukya dynasty went into a brief decline following the death of Pulakeshin II due to internal feuds when Badami was occupied by the Pallavas for a period of thirteen years. It recovered during the reign of Vikramaditya I, who succeeded in pushing the Pallavas out of Badami and restoring order to the empire. Vikramaditya I took the title \"Rajamalla\" (\"lit\" \"Sovereign of the \"Mallas\"\" or Pallavas). The thirty-seven year rule of Vijayaditya (696–733) was a prosperous one and is known for prolific temple building activity.\n\nThe empire was its peak again during the rule of the illustrious Vikramaditya II (733–744) who is known not only for his repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Nandivarman II, but also for his benevolence towards the people and the monuments of Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple. During his reign Arab intruders of the Umayyad Caliphate invaded southern Gujarat which was under Chalukya rule but the Arabs were defeated and driven out by Pulakesi, a Chalukya governor of Navsari. He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, the Cholas and the Cheras in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler. The last Chalukya king, Kirtivarman II, was overthrown by the Rashtrakuta King Dantidurga in 753. At their peak, the Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Kaveri in the south to the Narmada in the north.\n\nThe Chalukyas revived their fortunes in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when much of the Deccan was under the rule of the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami Chalukya dynasty of the 6th century while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.\n\nTailapa II, a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi – 1000 (Bijapur district) overthrew Karka II, re-established the Chalukya rule in the western Deccan and recovered most of the Chalukya empire. The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the Cholas, and with their cousins, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. Vikramaditya VI is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty. Starting from the very beginning of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original \"Saka\" era and established the \"Vikrama Era\". Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in this new era. Vikramaditya VI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan. The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of Kannada literature and Sanskrit literature. They went into their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the Hoysala Empire, the Pandyas, the Kakatiya and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri.\n\nPulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.\n\nAfter the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.\n\nThe fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.\n\nInitially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and literature, though, after a period of time, local factors took over and they gave importance to Telugu language. Telugu literature owes its growth to the Eastern Chalukyas.\n\nThe Badami Chalukya era was an important period in the development of South Indian architecture. The kings of this dynasty were called \"Umapati Varlabdh\" and built many temples for the Hindu god Shiva. Their style of architecture is called \"Chalukyan architecture\" or \"Karnata Dravida architecture\". Nearly a hundred monuments built by them, rock cut (cave) and structural, are found in the Malaprabha river basin in modern Bagalkot district of northern Karnataka. The building material they used was a reddish-golden Sandstone found locally. These cave temples are basically excavations, cut out of the living rock sites they occupy. They were not built as their structural counterparts were, rather created by a special technique known as \"subtraction\" and are basically sculptural. Though they ruled a vast empire, the Chalukyan workshops concentrated most of their temple building activity in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland – Aihole, Badami, Pattadakal and Mahakuta in modern Karnataka state.\n\nTheir temple building activity can be categorised into three phases. The early phase began in the last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one Vedic, one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared verandah, a columned hall (\"mantapa\") and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship. In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of Harihara, Mahishasuramardhini, Varaha, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Vishnu seated on Anantha (the snake) and Nataraja (dancing Shiva).\n\nThe second phase of temple building was at Aihole (where some seventy structures exist and has been called \"one of the cradles of Indian temple architecture\") and Badami. Though the exact dating of these temples has been debated, there is consensus that the beginnings of these constructions are from c. 600. These are the Lad Khan Temple (dated by some to c. 450 but more accurately to 620) with its interesting perforated stone windows and sculptures of river goddesses; the Meguti Jain Temple (634) which shows progress in structural design; the Durga Temple with its northern Indian style tower (8th century) and experiments to adapt a Buddhist \"Chaitya\" design to a brahminical one (its stylistic framework is overall a hybrid of north and south Indian styles.); the Huccimalli Gudi Temple with a new inclusion, a vestibule, connecting the sanctum to the hall. Other \"dravida\" style temples from this period are the Naganatha Temple at Nagaral; the Banantigudi Temple, the Mahakutesvara Temple and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Mahakuta; and the Lower Sivalaya Temple, the Malegitti Sivalaya Temple (upper) and the Jambulingesvara Temple at Badami. Located outside the Chalukyan architectural heartland, 140 km south-east of Badami, with a structure related to the Early Chalukya style is the unusual Parvati Temple at Sanduru which dates to the late 7th century. It is medium-sized, 48 ft long and 37 ft wide. It has a \"nagara\" (north Indian) style \"vimana\" (tower) and \"dravida\" (south Indian) style parts, has no mantapa (hall) and consists of an \"antarala\" (vestibule) crowned with a barrel-vaulted tower (\"sukhanasi\"). The \"staggered\" base plan of the temple became popular much later, in the 11th century.\n\nThe structural temples at Pattadakal, built in the 8th century and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, marks the culmination and mature phase of Badami Chalukyan architecture. The Bhutanatha group of temples at Badami are also from this period. There are ten temples at Pattadakal, six in southern \"dravida\" style and four in the northern \"nagara\" style. Well known among these are the Sangamesvara Temple (725), the Virupaksha Temple (740–745) and the Mallikarjuna Temple (740–745) in the southern style. The Papanatha temple (680) and Galaganatha Temple (740) are early attempts in the \"nagara\" – \"dravida\" fusion style. Inscriptional evidence suggests that the Virupaksha and the Mallikarjuna Temples were commissioned by the two queens of King Vikramaditya II after his military success over the Pallavas of Kanchipuram. Some well known names of Chalukyan architects are Revadi Ovajja, Narasobba and Anivarita Gunda.\n\nThe reign of Western Chalukyas was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. Their architecture served as a conceptual link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the Hoysala architecture popularised in the 13th century. The centre of their cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region of modern Karnataka state, encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. Here, large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing dravida temples, defined the \"Karnata dravida\" tradition.\n\nThe most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district, the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi in the Gadag district, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, both in the Davangere district. Other notable constructions are the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal (Gadag district), the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri (Haveri district), and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri (Dharwad district). The Eastern Chalukyas built some fine temples at Alampur, in modern eastern Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) written by his court poet Ravikirti in Sanskrit language and Kannada script is considered as a classical piece of poetry. A few verses of a poet named Vijayanaka who describes herself as the \"dark Sarasvati\" have been preserved. It is possible that she may have been a queen of prince Chandraditya (a son of Pulakeshin II). Famous writers in Sanskrit from the Western Chalukya period are Vijnaneshwara who achieved fame by writing Mitakshara, a book on Hindu law, and King Someshvara III, a noted scholar, who compiled an encyclopedia of all arts and sciences called \"Manasollasa\".\n\nFrom the period of the Badami Chalukyas, references are made to the existence of Kannada literature, though not much has survived. Inscriptions however refer to Kannada as the \"natural language\". The Kappe Arabhatta record of c. 700 in \"tripadi\" (three line) metre is the earliest available work in Kannada poetics. \"Karnateshwara Katha\", which was quoted later by Jayakirti, is believed to be a eulogy of Pulakeshin II and to have belonged to this period. Other probable Kannada writers, whose works are not extant now but titles of which are known from independent references are Syamakundacharya (650), who is said to have authored the \"Prabhrita\", and Srivaradhadeva (also called Tumubuluracharya, 650 or earlier), the possible author of the \"Chudamani\" (\"Crest Jewel\"), a lengthy commentary on logic.\n\nThe rule of the Western and Eastern Chalukyas, however, is a major event in the history of Kannada and Telugu literatures respectively. By the 9th–10th centuries, Kannada language had already seen some of its most notable writers. The \"three gems\" of Kannada literature, Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna belonged to this period. In the 11th century, Telugu literature was born under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas with Nannaya Bhatta as its first writer.\n\nThe army was well organised and this was the reason for Pulakeshin II's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered \"Revatidvipa\" (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term \"Karnatabala\" when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.\n\nThe government, at higher levels, was closely modelled after the Magadhan and Satavahana administrative machinery. The empire was divided into \"Maharashtrakas\" (provinces), then into smaller \"Rashtrakas\" (\"Mandala\"), \"Vishaya\" (district), \"Bhoga\" (group of 10 villages) which is similar to the \"Dasagrama\" unit used by the Kadambas. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of Vikramaditya I even mentions a land unit called \"Dasagrama\". In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the Gangas, the Banas and the Sendrakas. Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of \"mahajanas\" (learned brahmins) looked after \"agraharas\" (called \"ghatika\" or \"place of higher learning\") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 \"mahajans\" and Aihole which was served by 500 \"mahajanas\". Taxes were levied and were called the \"herjunka\" – tax on loads, the \"kirukula\" – tax on retail goods in transit, the \"bilkode\" – sales tax, the \"pannaya\" – betel tax, \"siddaya\" – land tax and the \"vaddaravula\" – tax levied to support royalty.\n\nThe Badami Chalukyas minted coins that were of a different standard compared to the coins of the northern kingdoms. The coins had \"Nagari\" and Kannada legends. The coins of Mangalesha had the symbol of a temple on the obverse and a 'sceptre between lamps' or a temple on the reverse. Pulakeshin II's coins had a caparisoned lion facing right on the obverse and a temple on the reverse. The coins weighed 4 grams and were called, in old-Kannada, \"hun\" (or \"honnu\") and had fractions such as \"fana\" (or \"fanam\") and the \"quarter fana\" (the modern day Kannada equivalent being \"hana\" – which literally means \"money\"). A gold coin called \"gadyana\" is mentioned in a record at the Vijayeshwara Temple at Pattadakal, which later came to be known as \"varaha\" (their royal emblem).\n\nBoth Shaivism and Vaishnavism flourished during the Badami Chalukya period, though it seems the former was more popular. Famous temples were built in places such as Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (\"archakas\") were invited from northern India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (\"vrata\") and the giving of gifts (\"dana\") was important. The Badami kings were followers of Vedic Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya, Ganapathi, Shakti, Surya and \"Sapta Matrikas\" (\"seven mothers\"). The Badami kings also performed the Ashwamedha (\"horse sacrifice\"). The worship of Lajja Gauri, a fertility goddess is known. Jainism too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged Jainism. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example. Ravikirti, the court poet of Pulakeshin II was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the Trimurti (\"Hindu trinity\") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and \"Ardhanarishwara\" (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar in the Gadag district) were primary places of learning.\n\nThe Hindu caste system was present and devadasis were recognised by the government. Some kings had concubines (\"ganikas\") who were given much respect, and Sati was perhaps absent since widows like Vinayavathi and Vijayanka are mentioned in records. Devadasis were however present in temples. Sage Bharata's \"Natyashastra\", the precursor to Bharatanatyam, the classical dance of South India, was popular and is seen in many sculptures and is mentioned in inscriptions. Some women from the royal family enjoyed political power in administration. Queen Vijayanka was a noted Sanskrit poet, Kumkumadevi, the younger sister of Vijayaditya (and queen of Alupa King Chitravahana) made several grants and had a Jain basadi called Anesajjebasadi constructed at Puligere, and the queens of Vikramaditya II, Lokamahadevi and Trailokyamahadevi made grants and possibly consecrated the Lokesvara Temple (now called Virupaksha temple) but also and the Mallikarjuna temple respectively at Pattadakal.\n\nThe Chalukya era may be seen as the beginning of the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India, making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions. This is seen clearly in the field of architecture. The Chalukyas spawned the \"Vesara\" style of architecture which includes elements of the northern \"nagara\" and southern \"dravida\" styles. During this period, the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local Dravidian vernaculars which were already popular. Dravidian languages maintain these influences even today. This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages. The Hindu legal system owes much to the Sanskrit work \"Mitakshara\" by Vijnaneshwara in the court of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the greatest work in legal literature, \"Mitakshara\" is a commentary on \"Yajnavalkya\" and is a treatise on law based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of India. Englishman Henry Thomas Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance, giving it currency in the British Indian court system. It was during the Western Chalukya rule that the Bhakti movement gained momentum in South India, in the form of Ramanujacharya and Basavanna, later spreading into northern India.\n\nA celebration called \"Chalukya utsava\", a three-day festival of music and dance, organised by the Government of Karnataka, is held every year at Pattadakal, Badami and Aihole. The event is a celebration of the achievements of the Chalukyas in the realm of art, craft, music and dance. The program, which starts at Pattadakal and ends in Aihole, is inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Singers, dancers, poets and other artists from all over the country take part in this event. In the 2006 celebration, 400 art troupes took part in the festivities. Colorful cutouts of the \"Varaha\" the Chalukya emblem, \"Satyashraya\" Pulakeshin (Pulakeshin II), famous sculptural masterpieces such as Durga, Mahishasuramardhini (Durga killing demon Mahishasura) were present everywhere. The program at Pattadakal is named \"Anivaritacharigund vedike\" after the famous architect of the Virupaksha temple, Gundan Anivaritachari. At Badami it is called \"Chalukya Vijayambika Vedike\" and at Aihole, \"Ravikirti Vedike\" after the famous poet and minister (Ravikirti) in the court of Pulakeshin II. \"Immadi Pulakeshi\", a Kannada movie of the 1960s starring Dr. Rajkumar celebrates the life and times of the great king.\n\n\nBooks\n\nWeb\n\n"}

{"id": "3057868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3057868", "title": "Economic humanitarianism (Raëlianism)", "text": "Economic humanitarianism (Raëlianism)\n\nEconomic humanitarianism is a collection of economic ideas which according to its creator Raël is designed to complement Geniocracy.\n\nEconomic humanitarianism accepts the capitalist notion that through competition and technological innovation, some companies may install automation in an attempt to reduce costs, which replaces jobs and reduces the \"aggregate\" consumer base. \"As long as\" there are industries which have not reached maturity, the employment will return to a natural level, as will the consumer base. In the framework of Economic Humanitarianism, capitalism is considered to be the best way for industries to mature in the long run.\n\nIn place once maturity of all industries is close at hand, automation is seen to \"eliminate\" jobs at a rate faster than new industries can introduce. If the economic system is not reformed around this time, this not only reduces aggregate consumer base, but also the total consumer base, resulting in poverty despite normal levels of output. Reflecting on history, the author of Economic Humanitarianism, Claude Vorilhon, suggested that all employees whose labor was replaced by automation should have received supplemental income and that all individuals should receive minimal existence revenue (their fair share of what automation has to offer). Economic humanitarianism supports the implementation of a basic income.\n\nIn Claude Vorilhon's book \"Geniocracy\", he writes:\nObviously this system is not viable in a capitalist society, since once the owners automate their factories, they just sack all their workers without pay and let them starve while the machines do all the work, filling their own pockets with gold from the profit. This is unjust and should not be tolerated. The boss who builds a machine that replaces one hundred workers should continue to pay these workers who now have nothing to do. Thus the machine should allow them to enter and benefit from the age of leisure.\n\nPeople often say that machines enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, but they are wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still have to work with the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.\n\nIn book 1 of 3 in Claude Vorilhon's \"Intelligent Design\" was a text allegedly narrated by Yahweh, who according to him, is a humanoid extraterrestrial responsible for the creation of life on earth:\n\nYOU could very soon live in a genuine terrestrial paradise if only the technology that you have at your disposal today were made to serve human well-being, instead of serving violence, armies, or the personal profit of a few.\n\nScience and technology can totally liberate humanity not only from the problem of hunger in the world, but also from the obligation to work to live, since machines can quite easily look after the daily chores by themselves thanks to automation.\n\nOne way to aid such an effort, Raelians believe, is by changing how property is exploited. According to the Raelian Messages, the following was another official message from Yahweh:\n\nYou are all born equal and this is also written in the Bible. Your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means. It is unacceptable that unintelligent children should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes amassed by their parents, while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat.\nThis way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries benefiting the whole of humanity. To avoid this, property ownership must be abolished without establishing Communism.\n\nUnder most capitalistic systems, money is created by issuing debt and is not necessarily introduced at birth. Instead of property ownership, the humanitarianism described in the Raelian Messages involves of long-duration rent, an idea held by many proponents of Georgism. In the Raelian idea of humanitarianism, this should even apply in the case of businesses (as well as land):\n\nThus individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. To each their own merits. The same should apply to commercial and industrial enterprises.\nIf someone creates a business, it is theirs for their entire life, and they can rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. The same goes for farmers. They can rent land and cultivate it for forty-nine years but after that it all goes back to the State which will be able to rent it out again for another forty-nine years. Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.\nThis method must be adopted for all goods that remain exploitable...\n\nUnder economic humanitarianism, the only legal inheritance is the family home.<ref name=\"He wasn't born again -- he saw little green men / Founder of Raelian religion seeks secret to immortality\">He wasn't born again -- he saw little green men / Founder of Raelian religion seeks secret to immortality \"SF Gate\". 28 December 2002.

In some of the denominations within Methodism that use the title, ordination to this office is open to both men and women, including the United Methodist Church, Free Methodist Church, Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, and Evangelical Methodist Church. In other denominations such as the Primitive Methodist Church, Evangelical Methodist Church of America, Fundamental Methodist Conference, Evangelical Wesleyan Church, and Southern Methodist Church, only men are ordained as elders.\n\nMethodist denominations that have \"a threefold ministry of deacons, elders, and bishops\" include the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, Free Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church, among other denominations represented in the World Methodist Council.\n\n\"Elder\" is an English translation of the Greek word \"Presbuteros\" (), found in the New Testament. The word is also commonly transliterated as \"presbyter\". The office or \"order\" of presbyter is one of three orders of the traditional Christian priesthood, along with deacon and bishop. The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, in the ordination rite, supplanted the \"Book of Common Prayer's\" term \"priest\" for \"elder\", although the rest of the liturgy remained the same.\n\nThe \"Discipline\" of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection states that:\n\nThe \"Book of Discipline\" of the Free Methodist Church states that:\n\nThe \"Discipline\" of the Primitive Methodist Church states that:\n\nThe \"Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church\" states that:\n\nWhile not presiding at a service of worship, Methodist elders are sometimes seen wearing the clerical collar and clergy shirt in public. Preaching tabs can also be worn around the neck in lieu of the clerical collar. Many Methodist elders choose not to wear clerical clothing in their daily activities.\n\nWhen presiding at a service of worship, Methodist elders are often seen wearing church vestments, namely the pulpit robe or alb, and to a lesser extent, the chasuble. Stoles that reflect the season of the Christian year are worn over the vestment. Other elders choose not to wear vestments and are often seen in suits, dress clothes or casual clothing. However, stoles which represent the \"yoke\" of responsibility to the Church and to God are not to be worn unless the person has gone through the process of ordination which extends past education to a provisionary period culminating with a formal ordination service where the Bishop presides.\n\nIn most cases, Methodist elders must have graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in liberal education or equivalent degree in a college or university listed by the \"University Senate of the United Methodist Church\" and must have a Master of Divinity or equivalent degree in a school of theology (seminary). However, individual Annual Conferences may require that a Master of Divinity or equivalent first professional degree be the minimum standard for entrance into the Annual Conference's Order of Elders, or presbyterate. Changes were made by the 1992 and 1996 General Conferences which revamped many aspects of the ordained offices in the United Methodist Church's polity and doctrine and made the Order of Deacon a permanent, rather than transitional, office. These reforms also elevated the previously \"un\"ordained office of Diaconal Minister, who were lay persons performing specialized tasks within a congregational or ministry staff setting (such as music, education, youth ministry, etc.) to ordained status as permanent Deacons as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18565220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18565220", "title": "English Qabalah", "text": "English Qabalah\n\nEnglish Qabalah, or English Kabbalah, refers to several different systems of mysticism related to Hermetic Qabalah that interpret the letters of the Roman script or English alphabet via their supposed numerological significance. The antiquarian spelling \"Qabalah\" is more common in this context, but the modern spelling \"Kabbalah\" is also found.\n\nAccording to Jake Stratton-Kent the English Qaballa is neither merely a qabalah nor a system of numerology or solely gematria. He believes a qabalah is specifically related to three factors: a language, a 'holy' text or texts, and mathematical laws at work in these two. Cath Thompson writes that the English Qaballa is the tool given by its Holy Book for the interpretation thereof and that it is itself a complete magickal system in theory and in practice, with a consistent philosophy, a coherently stable Mandala, and infinite correspondences. Emery More further suggests that the Roman script and Arabic Numerals (the glyph set of the English Alphabet) being the standardized scripting of the Aeon, reveals new truths and natural orders hitherto unknown and should effectively replace those keys of past systems whose truth is already subsumed. <br>\n\nGematria, on the other hand, is a system in which letters are equated to number values. The letters comprising the word or name of person or object are then summed together. The number of this sum is termed the key of that particular word. Words sharing the same key are said to share properties. The letters are often tabulated along with their numerical equivalents.\n\nAn example of the simplest 'serial gematria' for English letters would be the following: \n\nThe first reference to an \"English Qabalah\" found in the literature was made by Willis F. Whitehead in 1898 in his book, \"The Mystic Thesaurus\" in which he describes a system he called \"English Cabala\". \n\nIn 1904, Aleister Crowley wrote out the text of the foundational document of his world-view, known as Liber AL vel legis, or The Book of the Law. In this text was the injunction found at verse 2:55; \"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto\" which was understood by Crowley as referring to an English Qabalah yet to be developed or revealed. \n\nIn one of the Holy Books of Thelema written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called \"Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang\" are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line for the Yang, a broken line for the Yin, and a point for the Tao. By attributing 26 Roman script letters to the trigrams of this work, Crowley felt that he had fulfilled the injunction to \"obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet\", as noted in his 'Old Comment' to The Book of the Law. Crowley did not go on to develop a full qabalah from this work, but many subsequent qabalists have been inspired by the injunction in verse 2:55 to develop a more complete system of English Qabalah, using various methods of exegesis.\n\nWilliam G. Gray proposes another system in his 1984 book \"Concepts of Qabalah\", more recently republished as \"Qabalistic Concepts\". This system has been summarized by Joan Schraith Cole and includes correspondence attributions of the English letters to the positions on the Tree of Life.\n\nA system related to the Spiritualist Agasha Temple of Wisdom was described by William Eisen in his two volume \"The English Cabalah\" (1980–82). \n\nOne system of English Qabalah with a strong English gematria component was proposed by R. L. Gillis in 1996, and published on his website since 1998. Known as Trigrammaton Qabalah, or TQ, this system is based on one of the Holy Books of Thelema written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called \"Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang\". \nLiber Trigrammaton (aka Liber XXVII) was called by Crowley \"the ultimate foundation of the highest theoretical qabalah\". In Liber XXVII are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line representing the Yang, a broken line representing the Yin, and a point representing the Tao. Crowley later attributed the 26 letters of the English alphabet to these trigrams, in an attempt to fulfill an injunction found in his earlier work The Book of the Law, or Liber AL vel Legis. \n\nIn Liber AL, verse 2:55 states: \"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto\". By attributing the English alphabet to the trigrams of his later work, Crowley considered this verse to be fulfilled, as noted in his \"Old Comment\" to The Book of the Law. \nThe TQ is an extension of Crowley's work with Liber Trigrammaton. By considering the numerical value of the 27 trigrams as expressions in Base 3, (or ternary), and then transferring those values to the letters attributed by Crowley to the trigrams, a system of English gematria is created. Further use is made of the trigrams to create a true qabalah in the sense of the definition provided by Jake Stratton-Kent above. In the TQ, correspondences are created with all the major forms of divination such as I Ching, tarot and runes, as well as Greek and Hebrew alphabets, the qabalistic Tree of Life, Western and Vedic astrology, magic squares, and the Platonic solids of geometry. A primary feature of this qabalah is a new understanding of the Cube of Space and its 26 components of edges, faces and vertices, which equal the number of Roman script letters used in the English alphabet.\n\nTrigrammaton English Gematria values are as follows:\n\nThe first appearance of a system of gematria using the natural order of the English alphabet was developed in 1532 by Michael Stifel, who also proposed a system called the \"trigonal alphabet\", using successive triangular numbers. Another early system of English gematria was used by poet John Skelton. An analogue of the Greek system of isopsephy using the Latin alphabet appeared in 1583. Other variations appeared in 1683 (simply referred to as the \"1683 alphabet\", this system was used by Leo Tolstoy in \"War and Peace\" to identify Napoleon with the number of the Beast) and 1707 (\"Alphabetum Cabbalisticum Vulgare\"). These and other variations are detailed in Underwood Dudley's \"Numerology, Or, What Pythagoras Wrought\".\n\nMore recently, Michael Bertiaux described a system called \"Angelic Gematria\" in his \"The Voudon Gnostic Workbook\" (1989), and David Rankine described a system of English gematria using prime numbers which he calls \"Prime Qabalah\" in his book \"Becoming Magick\" (2004).\n\nAccording to Allen Greenfield, Carol Smith discovered the ALW Cipher, which she later called \"English Qaballa\", in 1974. This is a popular error which Smith attempted to persuade Greenfield to correct, but to no avail. James Lees discovered the Key on November 26 1976 and he named the new order & value of the English Alphabet \"English Qaballa\". He chose that spelling deliberately because it was not in popular use at the time. The cipher and the reasoning behind it, and other details of the system were published in five issues of \"The New Equinox / British Journal of Magick\" in a number of essays written by Lees and edited by Smith and given different bylines, which led to the aforementioned inaccuracy . Some of this original material was later summarized by Jake Stratton-Kent in \"The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema\". Since then other self-published authors have discussed the system, referring to it as \"New Aeon English Qabala\".\n\nThe \"order & value\" of the letters in the ALW Cipher can be derived from the grid superimposed on one of the pages of manuscript of Liber AL on which this verse appears (sheet 16 of Chapter III). Also appearing on this page are a diagonal line and a circled cross. Thelemites believe the book of the law should ideally only be printed in Crowley's hand-written version, because the books says there are messages in the chance shapes Crowley's handwriting made, or any shapes he adds to the pages. It is plain to see that whichever top-left to bottom-right diagonal is read the magickal order of the letters is obtained.\n\nAs there are ten squares per column, this method is equivalent to taking every eleventh letter of the alphabet as the \"order\" and then assigning them sequential \"values\":\n\nThe proof given by the grid was noted some time after the order and value was originally worked out by James Lees. Lees had seen that the number 286 is the sum of 13x22 (a reference to the Hebrew alphabet of 22 letters) and of 11x26, the latter indicating the 26 letters of the English alphabet and the Key number 11 which unlocks the magical cipher. \n\nIn the original handwritten text, the string of letters and numbers in the 76th verse of the second chapter is divided into two lines, the first ending with \"Y\" and the second beginning with \"X\". Stratton-Kent thought that in the manuscript the 'X' at the beginning of line two looked like a multiplication symbol, so he added each line's values together and multiplied them; 17x11=187, the numerical value of the phrase \"English alphabet\", which he felt confirmed the correctness of the system.\n\nAlso notable in this period of development was the contributions of Tina Coutu, Coutu was also a member of the OBLH, and had worked with the Head of that order at the time, William Wallace Webb (aka 'Frater Damon'). Coutu was a computer programmer and network engineer, who, in the late 1980s, developed the second text analysis software for Qaballists, called LEXICON. (The first text analysis software was written in 1984-5 for James Lees by Trevor Langford. Langford subsequently worked with Stratton Kent on \"The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema\". ) The Lexicon software enabled large scale analysis of entire texts, which enabled an almost exponential expansion in the available research. LEXICON allowed a user to input any type of cipher key, and it was here that ALW began to be colloquially referred to by LEXICON users as 'Cipher 6'. Coutu, or 'Soror Ishtaria', was a close colleague of Allen Greenfield.\n\nIn 1994, E. Joel Love, a student of the ALW Cipher (who was both a colleague of Greenfield and Coutu), and a member of the Hermetic Alchemical Order of the QBLH, proposed another English cipher that he would call 'Cipher X'. Love possessed a high mathematical aptitude and formal training in Cryptography in the U.S Coast Guard. A lifelong Thelemite, Love considered the ALW cipher to be incomplete to the task of answering many of the cosmological and deep structure questions proposed by Gillis' system. Both Gillis and Stratton-Kent met with Joel Love in 2004 and were mutually surprised to find that both Love's and Gillis' work contained many striking parallels. Love considered the ALW cipher to be representative of an authentic epistle, and interpreted verses in Liber XXVII to hint at a process of inversion. By taking the obvious base three trigrams system of Liber XXVII, and by comparing them to the cipher key of ALW, these inversions resulted in 'Cipher X' which, technically speaking, is the base three inversion of the ALW Cipher. Love always maintained that Cipher X was a complement to ALW, and himself being an advanced user of LEXICON, was a vocal proponent of comparing the results of many ciphers, a study he called 'cross cipher correlation'. Love would go on to compile over 20 years of notes and research. Love had several students, the first of which was longtime friend and colleague H. Thomas Chaudoin. Chaudoin maintains that he was present during the years that the bulk of this research was 'transmitted' to Love. Chaudoin would go on to found the NOT (New Order of Thelema), using many of Love's innovations as a foundation. Love was also a colleague and acquaintance of the late Robert Anton Wilson and a close friend of the late Kerry Wendell Thornley, co-founder of Discordianism. Love passed in June 2015.\n\nBase 3 inversion of the ALW Cipher values results in the following values:\n\n\n"}

After 1945, esoteric elements of the Third Reich were adapted into new \"völkisch\" religions of white nationalism and Neo-Nazism.\n\nFrench-born Greek-English writer Savitri Devi was the first major post-war exponent of what has since become known as Esoteric Hitlerism. According to that ideology, subsequent to the fall of the Third Reich and Hitler's suicide at the end of the war, Hitler himself could be deified. Devi connected Hitler's Aryanist ideology to that of the pan-Hindu part of the Indian independence movement, and activists such as Subhas Chandra Bose. For her, the swastika was an especially important symbol, as she felt it symbolized Aryan unity of Hindus and Germans.\n\nSavitri Devi, above all, was interested in the Indian caste system, which she regarded as the archetype of racial laws intended to govern the segregation of different races and to maintain the pure blood of the fair-complexioned Aryans. She regarded the survival of the light-skinned minority of Brahmins among an enormous population of many different Indian races after sixty centuries as a living tribute to the value of the Aryan caste system (Goodrick-Clarke, \"Black Sun\", p. 92).\n\nSavitri Devi integrated Nazism into a broader cyclical framework of Hindu history. She considered Hitler to be the ninth Avatar of Vishnu, and called him \"the god-like Individual of our times; the Man against Time; the greatest European of all times\", having an ideal vision of returning his Aryan people to an earlier, more perfect time, and also having the practical wherewithal to fight the destructive forces \"in Time\". She saw his defeat—and the forestalling of his vision from coming to fruition—as a result of him being \"too magnanimous, too trusting, too good\", of not being merciless enough, of having in his \"psychological make-up, too much 'sun' [beneficence] and not enough 'lightning.' [practical ruthlessness]\", unlike his coming incarnation:\n\n\"Kalki\" \"will act with unprecedented ruthlessness\". Contrarily to Adolf Hitler, He will spare not a single one of the enemies of the divine Cause: not a single one of its outspoken opponents but also not a single one of the lukewarm, of the opportunists, of the ideologically heretical, of the racially bastardised, of the unhealthy, of the hesitating, of the all-too-human; not a single one of those who, in body or in character or mind, bear the stamp of the fallen Ages.\n\nUnlike most ancient astronaut writers, Robert Charroux took a large interest in racialism. According to Charroux Hyperborea was situated between Iceland and Greenland and was the home of a Nordic white race with blonde hair and blue eyes. Charroux claimed that this race was extraterrestrial in origin and had originally come from a cold planet situated far from the sun. Charroux also claimed that the white race of the Hyperboreans and their ancestors, the Celts, had dominated the whole world in the ancient past. Some of these claims of Charroux have influenced the beliefs of Esoteric Nazism such as the work of Miguel Serrano.\n\nThe next major figure in Esoteric Hitlerism is Miguel Serrano, a former Chilean diplomat. Author of numerous books including \"The Golden Ribbon: Esoteric Hitlerism\" (1978) and \"Adolf Hitler, the Last Avatar\" (1984), Serrano is one of a number of Nazi esotericists who regard the \"Aryan blood\" as originally extraterrestrial:\n\nSerrano finds mythological evidence for the extraterrestrial origins of man in the Nephilim [fallen angels] of the Book of Genesis... Serrano suggests that the sudden appearance of Cro-Magnon Man with his high artistic and cultural achievements in prehistoric Europe records the passage of one such \"divya\"-descended race alongside the abysmal inferiority of Neanderthal Man, an abomination and manifest creation of the demiurge... Of all the races on earth, the Aryans alone preserve the memory of their divine ancestors in their noble blood, which is still mingled with the light of the Black Sun. All other races are the progeny of the demiurge's beast-men, native to the planet.\n\nSerrano supports this idea from various myths which assign divine ancestry to 'Aryan' peoples, and even the Aztec myth of Quetzalcoatl descending from Venus. He also cites the hypothesis of Bal Gangadhar Tilak on the Arctic homeland of the Indo-Aryans, as his authority for identifying the earthly centre of the Aryan migrations with the 'lost' Arctic continent of Hyperborea. Thus, Serrano's extraterrestrial gods are also identified as Hyperboreans.\n\nIn attempting to raise the spiritual development of the earthbound races, the Hyperborean \"divyas\" (a Sanskrit term for god-men) suffered a tragic setback. Expanding on a story from the \"Book of Enoch\", Serrano laments that a renegade group among the gods committed miscegenation with the terrestrial races, thus diluting the light-bearing blood of their benefactors and diminishing the level of divine awareness on the planet.\n\nThe concept of Hyperborea has a simultaneously racial and mystical meaning for Serrano. He believes that Hitler was in Shambhala, an underground centre in Antarctica (formerly at the North Pole and Tibet), where he was in contact with the Hyperborean gods and from whence he would someday emerge with a fleet of UFOs to lead the forces of light (the Hyperboreans, sometimes associated with Vril) over the forces of darkness (inevitably including, for Serrano, the Jews who follow Jehovah) in a last battle and thus inaugurating a Fourth Reich.\n\nSerrano follows the Gnostic tradition of the Cathars (fl. 1025–1244) by identifying the evil demiurge as Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament. As medieval dualists, these eleventh-century heretics had repudiated Jehovah as a false god and mere artificer opposed to the real God far beyond our earthly realm. This Gnostic doctrine clearly carried dangerous implications for the Jews. As Jehovah was the tribal deity of the Jews, it followed that they were devil worshipers. By casting the Jews in the role of the children of Satan, the Cathar heresy can elevate anti-Semitism to the status of a theological doctrine backed by a vast cosmology. If the Hyperborean Aryans are the archetype and blood descendents of Serrano's \"divyas\" from the Black Sun, then the archetype of the Lord of Darkness needed a counter-race. The demiurge sought and found the most fitting agent for its archetype in the Jews.\n\nAs religious scholars Frederick C. Grant and Hyam Maccoby emphasize, in the view of the dualist Gnostics, \"Jews were regarded as the special people of the Demiurge and as having the special historical role of obstructing the redemptive work of the High God's emissaries\". Serrano thus considered Hitler as one of the greatest emissaries of this High God, rejected and crucified by the tyranny of the Judaicized rabble like previous revolutionary light-bringers. Serrano had a special place in his ideology for the SS, who, in their quest to recreate the ancient race of Aryan god-men, he thought were above morality and therefore justified, after the example of the anti-humanitarian \"detached violence\" taught in the Aryo-Hindu\n\nIn the book \"Black Sun\", Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke reports how Carl Gustav Jung described \"Hitler as possessed by the archetype of the collective Aryan unconscious and could not help obeying the commands of an inner voice\". In a series of interviews between 1936 and 1939, Jung characterized Hitler as an archetype, often manifesting itself to the complete exclusion of his own personality. Hitler is a spiritual vessel, a demi-divinity; even better, a myth. Benito Mussolini is a man' ... the messiah of Germany who teaches the virtue of the sword. 'The voice he hears is that of the collective unconscious of his race.\n\nJung's suggestion that Hitler personified the collective Aryan unconscious deeply interested and influenced Miguel Serrano, who later concluded that Jung was merely psychologizing the ancient, sacred mystery of archetypal possession by the gods, independent metaphysical powers that rule over their respective races and occasionally possess their members. A similar esoteric thesis is also put forward by Michael Moynihan in his book \"Lords of Chaos\".\n\nThe writings of Miguel Serrano, Savitri Devi, and other proponents of Esoteric Nazism have spawned numerous later works connecting Aryan master race beliefs and Nazi escape scenarios with enduring conspiracy theories about hollow earth civilizations and shadowy new world orders. Since 1945, neo-Nazi writers have also proposed Shambhala and the star Aldebaran as the original homeland of the Aryans. The book \"Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival\", by Hypnerotomachia Poliphili scholar Joscelyn Godwin, discusses pseudoscientific theories about surviving Nazi elements in Antarctica. \"Arktos\" is noted for its scholarly approach and examination of many sources currently unavailable elsewhere in English-language translations. Godwin and other authors such as Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke have discussed the connections between Esoteric Nazism and Vril energy, the hidden Shambhala and Agartha civilizations, and underground UFO bases, as well as Hitler's and the SS's supposed survival in underground Antarctic oases in New Swabia or in alliance with Hyperboreans from the subterranean world.\n\nOrganisations such as the Armanen-Orden represent significant developments of neo-pagan esotericism and Ariosophy after World War II, but they do not all constitute forms of Nazi esotericism. Some northern European neopagan groups, such as Theods, Ásatrúarfélagið and Viðartrúar, have explicitly stated that neo-Nazism is not common among their members. On the other hand, there are neopagan organisations with close ties to neo-Nazism, such as the \"Artgemeinschaft\" or the Heathen Front, and the attraction of many neo-Nazis to Germanic paganism remains an issue particularly in Germany (see Nornirs Ætt).\n\nThere is a contemporary loose network of small musical groups that combine neo-fascism and satanism. These groups can be found in Britain, France, and New Zealand, under names such as \"Black Order\" or \"Infernal Alliance\", and draw their inspiration from the Esoteric Hitlerism of Miguel Serrano. These groups advocate the anti-modern neo-tribalism and \"Traditionalism\" found in the \"pagan\" mysticist ideals of Alain de Benoist's \"Nouvelle Droite\" inspired by Julius Evola.\n\nEsoteric themes, including references to artifacts such as the Holy Lance, are also often alluded to in neo-Nazi music (e.g. Rock Against Communism) and above all in National Socialist black metal.\n\n"}
{"id": "4858520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4858520", "title": "Eucharistic Minister", "text": "Eucharistic Minister\n\nA Eucharistic minister, also known as a communion steward, is an individual that assists in the distribution of Holy Communion to the congregation of a Christian church.\n\nEucharistic Minister, or more properly \"Lay Eucharistic Minister LEM\", is used to denote a lay person who assists the priest in administering the sacraments of holy communion, the consecrated bread and wine. They may also take the sacraments to those who are ill, or otherwise unable to attend Mass. LEMs usually vest in cassock and surplice rather than Alb.\n\nAlthough the practice varies from Diocese to Diocese in general LEMs are recommended by the parish priest to the Bishop of the Diocese, who grants them a three-year license to practice the ministry. This license is often renewed at the priest's discretion for subsequent three year terms.\n\nIn many Methodist Churches, communion stewards assist the minister in the distribution of Holy Communion to the congregation during the Liturgy of the Eucharist. These individuals also aid the minister in consuming any remaining Eucharistic elements after the distribution has been completed, although some of it is reserved to be taken to the sick in hospitals and in their homes.\n\nOnly a validly ordained priest may consecrate the Eucharist. As stated in Canon Law, \"The ordinary minister of holy communion is a bishop, presbyter, or deacon.\" and \"The extraordinary minister of holy communion is an acolyte or another member of the Christian faithful designated according to the norm of ⇒ can. 230, §3.\" \n\n\"[T]he name “minister of the Eucharist” belongs properly to the Priest alone.\" That is also specified in the Vatican document \"Instruction Redemptionis Sacramentum\". RS Section [154] states: \"the only minister who can confect the Sacrament of the Eucharist in persona Christi is a validly ordained Priest. Hence the name “minister of the Eucharist” belongs properly to the Priest alone.\" \n\n\"Eucharist\", in the Catholic Church, refers to both the celebration of the Mass, that is, the Eucharist liturgy, and to the bread and wine which are transubstantiated (changed in substance) into the body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ. The term \"Holy Communion\" refers only to the latter. Thus, the terms \"Eucharist\" and \"Holy Communion\" are not interchangeable.\n\nThe distribution of Holy Communion is done by the priest, often with one or more ministers, depending on the size of the service. There are two types of assistants: ordained (ordinary) ministers, and extraordinary ministers. An \"Ordinary Minister of Holy Communion\" is an ordained Bishop, Priest, or Deacon. See also Section [154] of \"Redemptionis Sacramentum\". The term \"Ordinary\" refers to the fact that ordained ministers are the ones who would ordinarily assist in the distribution of Holy Communion. However, the shortage of ordained ministers has led to the need to sometimes enlist lay persons in this ministry.\n\nAn \"Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion\" is a Catholic lay person who assists in the distribution of Holy Communion, either during the Mass, or afterwards, such as to housebound persons. Section [156] prohibits the use of other titles for these lay persons. The term \"Eucharist\" does not appear in their title, because it would imply a broader function, which is reserved for the priest alone. Despite these instruction, a very common error is the use of the terms \"Eucharistic Ministers\", or \"Extraordinary Ministers of Eucharist.\" These improper titles have appeared on several book titles, instructional handbooks, and in many articles. Likewise, erroneous abbreviations, such as \"EM\", \"EME\", or \"EEM\", are commonly used instead of the proper abbreviation \"EMHC\".\n\nSection [158] provides instructions on the proper use of EMHC: \"the extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the Priest and Deacon are lacking, when the Priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged.\" However, many parishes do not follow these instructions. This is contrary to Canon Law. Some routinely use EMHCs when there is no lacking of Priests and Deacons, or they employ a large number of EMHCs, reducing the Communion distribution to a few minutes. One factor is lack of knowledge of the Vatican instructions. Another is the popularity of participating in this service.\n"}

By the time of his graduation from the famous “Mukha” (\"Fly\" in Russian), he had already developed a critical stance towards the official Soviet art dominated by the Communist ideology and began exhibiting at semi-underground exhibitions. This was culminated by his taking part in a famous 1975 exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture. Abeshaus was fired from his job and censured by the official press – which however admitted his \"artistic taste, a good sense of color and form\". \n\nSoon afterwards, Abeshaus set up, together with several Jewish artists, the Alef Group and became its leader. The group’s first exhibition in November 1975 was held at Abeshauses’ small apartment. According to the Alef Manifesto written by Alec Rappoport, “We are trying to conquer the influence of small-town Jewish art and find sources for our work in deeper, wiser, and more spiritual European culture, and from it build a bridge to today and tomorrow\". \n\nIn May 1976, some of Abeshaus’s works, clandestinely sneaked out of the country, were exhibited at the Berkeley Art Museum to much critical acclaim. Later in the same year, following some political bargain between Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Abeshaus and his family were finally permitted to leave the USSR for Israel. \n\nSince then Abeshaus lived and worked in Ein Hod, a picturesque artists’ village near Haifa founded by Marcel Janco. His works were exhibited at numerous exhibitions, including dozens one-artist shows, in Israel, USA, Europe and, after the collapse of the USSR, in Russia. His ultimate acceptance and recognition there was culminated in a sensational memorial one-artist exhibition staged in 2009 at the famous Russian Museum in St.Petersburg - an exceptional honor for a modern artist.\n\n"}

It has been suggested that the Hall of Records is under the Great Sphinx of Giza, which is in the Giza pyramid complex.\n\nThere is no evidence to indicate that the Hall of Records ever existed. In 1998, Zahi Hawass, Chief Director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, undertook excavations beneath the main body of the Sphinx at Giza and rediscovered access tunnels to several large, apparently natural, caves directly under the Sphinx. No artifacts were found and a survey was undertaken to assess any potential threats in the substrate that might affect the ancient monument above. There was evidence of earlier ancient excavations. Hawass commented in a documentary about the 1998 excavations that he suspected that there could be other cavities beneath the structure, based on the evidence of the small watercourse that had caused some minor structural damage to stonework on the flank of the Sphinx.\n\nThe story of the Hall of Records is popular among those who hold alternative theories of Ancient Egypt. The phrase \"Hall of Records\" originated with Edgar Cayce although Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince suggest that the idea of the existence of lost Egyptian records \"has a long pedigree\".\n\nGraham Hancock and Robert Bauval, in \"Message of the Sphinx\", stated that American archaeologists and the Egyptian government had blocked investigations around the Sphinx, including attempts to locate any underground cavities. Bauval later wrote \"Secret Chamber\" in 1999. According to Bauval, Egyptian authorities granted an American team a license to search for the Hall of Records under the Sphinx. It has been postulated that there may be three passages around the Sphinx; two with unknown origin and one is supposedly a small dead-end shaft behind the head of nineteenth-century origins.\n\nVarious alternate theories on the origin of the Hall have been proposed, including that the Hall was not the work of Ancient Egyptians at all but another society such as advanced prehistoric societies or a superior race of intelligent beings. Accordingly, this original society sealed the Hall away with scrolls of their accumulated knowledge at about 10,500 BC—the last period of time when the constellation of Leo was located between the Sphinx's paws when it rose in the night sky.\n\nThe \"Sleeping Prophet\" Edgar Cayce also stated in 1939, that the Hall of Records had a twin counterpart library that was anciently deposited on the Yucatán Peninsula somewhere by the eastern coastal temple complex sites. He mentioned that the Yucatán Depository was currently under water.\n\nThe study of and the search for the Hall is considered by many academics to be pseudo-archaeology.

The first political constitution of the Mexican United States enacted in 1824, stipulated that Roman Catholicism was the national religion in perpetuity, and prohibited any other religion. Moreover, since 1857, by law, Mexico has had no official religion; as such, anti-clerical laws meant to promote a secular society, contained in the 1857 Constitution of Mexico and in the 1917 Constitution of Mexico limited the participation in civil life of Roman Catholic organizations, and allowed government intervention to religious participation in politics.\n\nIn 1992, the Mexican constitution was amended to eliminate the restrictions, and granted legal status to religious organizations, limited property rights, voting rights to ministers, and allowing a greater number of priests in Mexico. Nonetheless, the principles of the Separation of Church and State remain; members of religious orders (priests, nuns, ministers, \"et al.\") cannot hold elected office, the federal government cannot subsidize any religious organization, and religious orders, and their officers, cannot teach in the public school system.\n\nHistorically, the Roman Catholic Church dominated the religious, political, and cultural landscapes of the nation; yet, the Catholic News Agency said that there exists a great, secular community of atheists, intellectuals and irreligious people, reaching 10% according to recent polls by religious agencies.\n\nSince the Spanish Conquest (1519–21), the Roman Catholic Church has held prominent social and political positions concerning the moral education of Mexicans; the ways that virtues and morals are to be socially implemented; and thus contributed to the Mexican cultural identity. Such cultural immanence was confirmed in the nation's first political constitution, which formally protected Catholicism; thus, Article 3 of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico established that:\n\nFor most of Mexico's 300 years as the Imperial Spanish colony of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (1519–1821), the Roman Catholic Church was an active political actor in colonial politics. In the early period of the Mexican nation, the vast wealth and great political influence of the Church spurred a powerful anti-clerical movement, which found political expression in the Liberal party. Yet, during the middle of the 19th century, there were reforms limiting the political power of the Mexican Catholic Church. In response, the Church supported seditious Conservative rebels to overthrow the anti-clerical Liberal government of President Benito Juárez; and so welcomed the anti-Juárez French intervention in Mexico (1861), which established the military occupation of Mexico by the Second French Empire, of Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nAbout the Mexican perspective of the actions of the Roman Catholic Church, the Mexican Labour Party activist Robert Haberman said:\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century, the collaboration of the Mexican Catholic Church with the \"Porfiriato\", the 35-year dictatorship of General Porfirio Díaz, earned the Mexican clregy the ideological enmity of the revolutionary victors of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20); thus, the Mexican Constitution of 1917 legislated severe social and political, economic and cultural restrictions upon the Catholic Church in the Republic of Mexico. Historically, the 1917 Mexican Constitution was the first political constitution to expilicity legislate the social and civil rights of the people; and served as constitutional model for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Russian Constitution of 1918. Nevertheless, like the Spanish Constitution of 1931, it has been characterized as being hostile to religion.\n\nThe Constitution of 1917 proscribed the Catholic clergy from working as teachers and as instructors in public and private schools; established State control over the internal matters of the Mexican Catholic Church; nationalized all Church property; proscribed religious orders; forbade the presence in Mexico of foreign-born priests; granted each state of the Mexican republic the power to limit the number of, and to eliminate, priests in its territory; disenfranchised priests of the civil rights to vote, and to hold elected office; banned Catholic organizations that advocated public policy; forbade religious publications from editorial commentary about public policy; proscribed the clergy from wearing clerical garb in public; and voided the right to trial of any Mexican citizen who violated anti-clerical laws.\n\nDuring the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), the national rancour provoked by the history of the Catholic Church's mistreatment of Mexicans was aggravated by the collaboration of the Mexican High Clergy with the pro–U.S. dictatorship (1913–14) of General Victoriano Huerta, \"The Usurper\" of the Mexican Presidency; thus, anti-clerical laws were integral to the Mexican Constitution of 1917, in order to establish a secular society. In the 1920s, the enforcement of the Constitutional anti-clerical laws, by the Mexican Federal Government, provoked the Cristero Rebellion (1926–29), the clerically-abetted armed revolt of Catholic peasants, known as \"The Christers\" (\"Los cristeros\"). The social and political tensions between the Catholic Church and the Mexican State lessened after 1940, but the Constitutional restrictions remained the law of the land, although their enforcement became progressively lax. The Government established diplomatic relations with the Holy See during the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988–94), and the Government lifted almost all restrictions on the Catholic Church in 1992. That year the Government ratified its informal policy of not enforcing most legal controls on religious groups by, among other things, granting religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property rights, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country. However, the law continues to mandate strict restrictions on the church and bars the clergy from holding public office, advocating partisan political views, supporting political candidates, or opposing the laws or institutions of the State. The Church's ability to own and operate mass media is also limited. Indeed, after the creation of the Constitution the Catholic Church has been acutely hostile towards the Mexican government. As Laura Randall in his book \"Changing Structure of Mexico\" points out, most of the conflicts between citizens and religious leaders lie in the Church's overwhelming lack of understanding of the role of the state's laicism. \"The inability of the Mexican Catholic Episcopate to understand the modern world translates into a distorted conception of the secular world and the lay state. Evidently, perceiving the state as anti-religious (or rather, anti-clerical) is the result of 19th-century struggles that imbued the state with anti-religious and anti-clerical tinges in Latin American countries, much to the Catholic Church's chagrin. Defining laicist education as a 'secular religion' that is also 'imposed and intolerant' is the clearest evidence of episcopal intransigence.\" Others, however see the Mexican state's anticlericalism differently. Recent President Vicente Fox stated, \"After 1917, Mexico was led by anti-Catholic Freemasons who tried to evoke the anticlerical spirit of popular indigenous President Benito Juárez of the 1880s. But the military dictators of the 1920s were a more savage lot than Juarez.\" Fox goes on to recount how priests were killed for trying to perform the sacraments, altars were desecrated by soldiers and freedom of religion outlawed by generals.\n\nAs many students of Latin American religion have pointed out, there is a substantial difference between describing oneself as religious or culturally religious and practicing one's faith literally. In the case of Mexico the decline of the church's religious influence is specially mirrored by the decline of church attendance among its citizens. Church attendance itself is a complex, multi-layered phenomenon that is subject to political and socio-economic factors. From 1940 to 1960 about 70% of Mexican Catholics attended church weekly while in 1982 only 54 percent partook of Mass once a week or more, and 21 percent claimed monthly attendance. Recent surveys have shown that only around 3% of Catholics attend church daily; however, 47% percent of them attend church services weekly and, according to INEGI, the number of atheists grows annually by 5.2%, while the number of Catholics grows by 1.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father was a gas manager and his family were Anglicans. He had six siblings. As a boy, he participated in activities at the Methodist chapel that was next door to the family home. In 1914, the family moved to Biddulph. Having become a Methodist, he began preaching as a boy. At 16, he joined the Labour Party. He attended the Handsworth Methodist College, Birmingham.\n\nIn 1930, he accepted a position in Risca, Monmouthshire at St John's Church of Probationer Minister. Like Donald Soper, he held open-air meetings on a weekly basis and he drew people to his services, including unbelievers. Atkin embraced the Social Gospel and was an active voice concerning political and social issues affecting the community. He became increasingly involved in social issues two years later when he was moved to Bargoed. At the Methodist Central Hall, he provided a programs to assist unemployed men, including offering free meals, barber and shoe repair services, and lodging, the latter of which circumvented the governmental Means Test of the men's parent's income and angered authorities. He was critical of the church and the Labour Party. Synod leaders then made arrangements for transfer to Cornwall, which Atkin would not accept.\n\nHe accepted one of three offers from Congregationalist denominations in Cardiff to lead St Paul's in Swansea. The church was £2,000 in debt and had only 12 members. He began holding open-air ministry meetings, drawing up to 500 people, more so during the summer months. He was not popular within the leadership of the Congregational Union of England and Wales due to his anti-Fascism positions in the Labour Party and reluctance to take direction from church leaders. \n\nHe became a representative for Brynmelyn Ward of the Swansea Borough Council in November 1936. He joined the Royal Artillery in 1940, but became an Army Chaplain upon the intervention of the United Chaplains Board. He served in Holland, North Africa, France, and Italy and became a captain.\n\nAtkin returned to Swansea, where the chapel had been locked and he had lost his ministry. He was able to settle back at St Paul's, without the Congregational Union's formal support, due to the allegiance of members of the community and former soldiers. He formed The People's Party in 1947 to keep his seat on the Council, due to complaints he made against the Labour Party. He sat on the Council until 1964.\n\nHe was married with two children. Until World War II, he was a pacifist. While living in Swansea, he visited public houses on Fridays to collect donations for entertainment of poor children. Dylan Thomas was a friend. He died on 27 November 1976 in Swansea.\n\n"}

She studied with liberation theologians including and .\n\nShe was a member of the Evangelical Methodist Church of Argentina. She followed the methods of Paulo Freire, undertaking community and social projects supported by the church in impoverished neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. Due to her experience and accomplishments in this regard, Althaus-Reid was invited to Scotland, where she worked in poor neighborhoods of Dundee and Perth, coordinating projects inspired by the liberationist pedagogy of Freire.\n\nShe completed her doctorate in 1994 at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, writing her doctoral thesis on the influence of Paul Ricoeur in the methodology of liberation theology. Her academic interests included liberation theology, feminist theology and queer theology. Subsequently, she was appointed Professor of Contextual Theology at New College, University of Edinburgh.\n\nAlthaus-Reid died on 20 February 2009, in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she had lived since 1986.

In the last years of her life, she worked with the Argentine theologian Ivan Petrella to publicize liberation theology in the English-speaking world. She was also associate editor of the journal \"Studies in World Christianity\" and a member of the editorial board of the journal \"Concilium\".\n\nAlthaus-Reid is perhaps most well-known for her 2002 work in \"Indecent Theology,\" in which she challenged feminists in her use of sexual and explicit language. She argued sex has been constructed by a patriarchal worldview which underpins many of the great atrocities of the world. Hence, the virginity of the Virgin Mary needs to be \"indecented\" as it hides the lives of many poor women who, she describes, as rarely being virgins.\n\nShe also speaks about an \"indecent Christ,\" whereby a kenotic Christology speaks of God self-emptying and being embodied in Christ and human sexuality. She explains that \"[Jesus] has been dressed theologically as a heterosexually oriented (celibate) man. Jesus with erased genitalia; Jesus minus erotic body.\" Instead, she speaks about the bi-sexuality of Christ as an inclusive understanding of the incarnation. She wants to argue for a larger Christology which recasts Jesus in postmodern sexualities, genders, and economic locations. This is a critique she had against Latin American liberation theology, which she understood as failing to address questions of gender and sexuality alongside the question of conquest and colonization of the Americas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "85387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85387", "title": "Moneta", "text": "Moneta\n\nIn Roman mythology, Moneta (Latin Monēta) was a title given to two separate goddesses: the goddess of memory (identified with the Greek goddess Mnemosyne) and an epithet of Juno, called Juno Moneta (Latin Iūno Monēta). The latter's name is source of numerous words in English and the Romance languages, including the words \"money\" and \"mint\".\n\nThe cult of the goddess Moneta was established largely under the influence of Greek religion that featured the cult of Mnemosyne (\"Μνημοσύνη\"), the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. The goddess's name is derived from Latin \"monēre\" (which means to remind, warn, or instruct). She is mentioned in a fragment of Livius Andronicus' Latin Odyssey: \"Nam diva Monetas filia docuit\" (\"since the divine daughter of Moneta has taught...\", frg. 21 Büchner), which may be the equivalent of either Od. 8,480-1 or 488.\n\nThe epithet Moneta given to Juno more likely derives from the Greek word \"moneres\" (\"μονήρης\") and means \"alone, unique\". By Andronicus' age, the folk-etymology deduction from \"monēre\" prevailed, and so he could transform this epithet into a separate goddess, the literary (but not religious) counterpart of Greek Mnemosyne.\n\nJuno Moneta, an epithet of Juno, was the protectress of funds. As such, money in ancient Rome was coined in her temple. The word \"moneta\" is where we get the words \"money\", or \"monetize\", used by writers such as Ovid, Martial, Juvenal, and Cicero. In several modern languages including Russian and Italian, \"moneta\" (Spanish \"moneda\") is the word for \"coin\".\n\nAs with the goddess Moneta, Juno Moneta's name is derived either from the Latin \"monēre\", since, as protectress of funds, she \"warned\" of instability or more likely from the Greek \"moneres\" meaning \"alone, unique\".\n\n\"Moneta\" retained the meanings of \"money\" and \"die\" well into the Middle Ages and appeared often on minted coins. For example, the phrase \"moneta nova\" is regular on coins of the low countries and the rhineland in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, with the \"nova\", Latin for \"new\", not necessarily signifying a new type or variety of coin.\n\nMoneta is a central figure in John Keats' poem \"\".\n\n"}

A more specific \"o-fuda\" may be placed near particular objects such as one for kitchen to protect from accidental fire. A popular \"o-fuda\" called \"jingū-taima\" (神宮大麻) or simply \"taima\" (大麻) is issued by Ise Shrine. It used to be made from hemp cloth (\"taima\") but nowadays it is made of IseWashi (Washi (Japanese paper) made in Ise) that is blessed and replaced every year — as the use of hemp as a material was common in antiquity.\n\nA portable form of \"o-fuda\", commonly called \"omamori\" (お守り or 御守, o-mamori) is typically given out wrapped in a small bag made of decorated cloth. This originates from Onmyōdō and Buddhism, but was subsequently adopted by Shintoism. Both Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines give out these \"o-mamori\".

Pius' reign coincided with the Second World War, the commencement of the Cold War and the accelerating European decolonisation. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under Fascist and Communist governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in Occupied Poland. The defeat of Fascism at the end of World War Two ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions - notably in Eastern Europe, the USSR, and, later, the People's Republic of China. The Catholic Church was under attack in all Communist governed countries and lost most of its existence in Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, Communist China and the Soviet Union (including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).\n\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to John Cornwell, the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive or resist, or confront and risk annihilation. To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn East Germany and Hungary, the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII.\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the National Socialist German Workers Party through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the Concordat it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of Adolf Hitler began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German Catholic Centre Party, as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the Third Reich expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer Alan Bullock, Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\". Bullock wrote that Hitler had some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism, but utter contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\". Bullock wrote that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":\n\nAlfred Rosenberg was the original draftsman and spokesman of the Nazi Party program and official ideologist of the Nazi Party. He was a rabid anti-Semite and anti-Catholic. In his \"Myth of the Twentieth Century\", published in 1930, Rosenberg proposed to replace traditional Christianity with the neo-pagan \"myth of the blood\":\n\nRosenberg and Hitler's senior lieutenant Martin Bormann actively collaborated in the Nazi program to eliminate Church influence - a program which included the abolition of religious services in schools; the confiscation of religious property; circulating anti-religious material to soldiers; and the closing of theological faculties.\n\nThe Nazi Government closed down Catholic publications, dissolved the Catholic Youth League and charged thousands of priests, nuns and lay leaders on trumped up charges. The Gestapo violated the sanctity of the confessional to obtain information. Erich Klausener, the President of Catholic Action in Germany, delivered a speech to the Catholic Congress in June 1934, criticizing the government. He was shot dead in his office on the Night of the Long Knives of 30 June. His entire staff was sent to concentration camps. Church kindergartens were closed, crucifixes were removed from schools, the Catholic press was closed down and Catholic welfare programs were restricted on the basis they assisted the \"racially unfit\".\n\nMany German clergy were sent to the concentration camps for voicing opposition to the Nazi authorities, or in some regions simply because of their faith. Many Catholic laypeople also paid for their opposition with their lives. Over 300 monasteries and other institutions were expropriated by the SS.\n\nThe Vatican issued two encyclicals opposing the policies of Mussolini and Hitler: \"Non abbiamo bisogno\" in 1931 and \"Mit brennender Sorge\" in 1937, respectively. The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the encyclical \"Mit brennender Sorge\", signed by Pope Pius XI. Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology as \"insane and arrogant\". It denounced the Nazi myth of \"blood and soil\", decried neopaganism of Nazism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the Führer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance.' It was written partially in response to the Nuremberg Laws and as response to the persecution of the church.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War Two, the Vatican, under Pope Pius XII pursued a policy of neutrality. The Holy See advocated for peace and spoke against racism, selfish nationalism, atrocities in Poland, the bombardment of civilians and other issues. The Pope allowed national hierarchies to assess and respond to their local situations, but established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to thousands of war refugees, and saved further thousands of lives by instructing the church to provide discreet aid to Jews.\n\nAccording to Norman Davies, the Nazi terror was \"much fiercer and more protracted in Poland than anywhere in Europe.\" Nazi ideology viewed ethnic \"Poles\" - the mainly Catholic ethnic majority of Poland - as \"sub-humans\". Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and of murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites: including religious leaders. In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: \"Poles may have only one master – a German. Two masters cannot exist side by side, and this is why all members of the Polish intelligentsia must be killed.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church was brutally suppressed in Poland. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members (18%) of the Polish clergy, were murdered; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps. During the 1939 invasion, special death squads of SS and police arrested or executed those considered capable of resisting the occupation: including professionals, clergymen and government officials. The following summer, the A-B Aktion (\"Extraordinary Pacification Operation\") further round up of several thousand Polish intelligentsia by the SS saw many priests shot in the General Government sector.\n\nHistorically, the church had been a leading force in Polish nationalism against foreign domination, thus the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their terror campaigns. Treatment was at its most severe in the annexed regions, where churches were systematically closed and the majority of priests were either murdered, imprisoned or deported. Seminaries and convents were closed.\n\n1,992 Polish clergy died in concentration camps. Eighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs. Around 1.5 million Poles were transported to work as forced labor in Germany. Treated as racially inferior, they had to wear purple P's sewn into their clothing - sexual relations with Poles was punishable by death. Beyond the genocide of the Polish Jews, it is estimated that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians were killed during the German Occupation and the war.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, the Dutch Bishops condemned the Nazi abduction of Jews. The Nazis retaliated with a series of repressive measures. Many Catholics were involved in strikes and protests against the treatment of Jews, and the Nazis offered to exempt converts and Jews married to non-Jews if protests ceased. The Archbishop of Utrecht and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics. Some 40,000 Jews were hidden by the Dutch church and 49 priests killed in the process. Among the Catholics of the Netherlands abducted in this way was Saint Edith Stein, who died at Auschwitz.\n\nThe expansion of Imperial Japan across the Asia Pacific from 1941 was accompanied by many atrocities against Catholic missionaries, clerics, nuns, and lay people. Imperial Japan had developed State Shinto as the Imperial religion and promoted the notion of the divinity of the Emperor. Japanese propaganda identified Catholics with European dominance - especially among Japan's own small Catholic community but also larger Asian communities in East Timor, Korea, French Indo-China the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australian Papua and New Guinea and elsewhere.\n\nIn the majority Catholic Philippines, priests and seminarians were interned. The five Columban priests killed at Malate are remembered as the Malate Martyrs.\n\nIn Australian New Guinea, priests and religious were imprisoned in concentration camps. From 1943, Japanese toleration of Christianity had shifted to confrontation. Troops interfered with Catholic religious practices and destroyed church buildings. Some 100 Catholics were killed for continuing to catechise. The martyr Peter To Rot took up duties as a catechist after Japanese invaders imprisoned the local missionaries. Forms of worship were forbidden following the Battle of the Coral Sea and To Rot was arrested and executed by the Japanese in 1945. He became the first Melanesian to be beatified in 1995.\n\nPius XII was a diplomat who valued diplomatic relations in order to keep contact with the local Church. As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.\n\nThus, after World War II, the Vatican kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See. In encyclicals such as \"Invicti athletae\", and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania, the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities. He excommunicated all those who imprisoned Cardinals and bishops as in the case of Stepinac, Mindszenty, Grösz, Beran, Wyszinski and Pacha.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent governmental usurpation of ecclsastical offices, The Vatican threatened to excommunicate anyone who do so, or, illegally grant or receive episcopal ordination. Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical Ad Apostolorum Principis to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country. Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries. While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local Confucian customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an ancient ritual, to the Vatican, it was a religious exercise which conflicted with Catholic dogma. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered superstitious, but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians. The Government of China established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval. The Papal degree changed the ecclesiastical situation in China in an almost revolutionary way. As the Church began to flourish, Pius XII established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy, and, received the Archbishop of Peking, Thomas Tien Ken-sin, SVD, into the Sacred College of Cardinals.\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed\n\nThe establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the persecution of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds. Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult. On 23 January 1918 the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, Pope Benedict XV issued \"Bonum Sana\" in which he condemned the philosophy and practices of Communism. Pius XI followed this line with numerous statements and the encyclicals Miserentissimus Redemptor, Caritate Christi, and Divini Redemptoris \nThe pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the Baltic States and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the USSR. At once, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked.\n\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome, reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the Papacy, already viewed as anti-Russian. He also was aware, that in months preceding the encyclical \"Orientales omnes Ecclesias\", all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested. Josyf Slipyj, Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka perished in Siberia. Subjected to Stalinist Show Trials, they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nAfter the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. Mass arrests of priests followed. In Lemko, some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945 or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\". Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted, Catholic United Churches were integrated under the Moscow Patriarchy, after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested. The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"peaceful coexistence\" became subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical cooperation, whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de-Stalinisation and the Soviet crack-down of the Hungarian Revolution did not produce major results, aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko expressed willingness of Moscow, to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position, which he claimed was identical with Kremlin policy.\n\nThe small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of Lithuania for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. Catholic Lithuania suffered especially in the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war, in spite of massive persecutions. The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter \"Flagranti Semper Animi\", in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, Decennium Dum Expletur. He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. Cum Jam Lustri commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland. In honour of Saint Stanisław, Pope Pius XII issues Poloniae Annalibus, giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests are incarcerated, all seminaries of religious institutes closed On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the Diplomatic Corps to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski. After the arrest of the Cardinal, Communist authorities support patriotic priests, who desire a separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of Jasna Góra, Pope Pius XII writes again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. Gloriosam Reginam salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Pope Pius addressed with \"Invicti athletae\" in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Andrew Bobola through the Russians. \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church\" The Pope asks for endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, and even sacrifices in time and money, but they must never give in. The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix courage with prudence, and knowledge with wisdom:\n\"They can take away your freedom, but they cannot tear the Catholic faith from your hearts. They can turn you into martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors\". In 1945, the Czechoslovakian government expelled its Hungarian and German populations from Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of Catholics in the country. After its Communist coup in 1948, Czechoslovakia expelled the Papal Nuncio and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. Prague outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press. Attempts were made, to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop Joseph Plojhar. Archbishop Josef Beran and others refusing to participate were subjected to public show trials and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" assumed all functions of the Catholic Church.\n\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the Red Army in 1945, socialist policies gaind only gradually ground in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost three thousand and three-hundred schools, numerous hospitals and newspapers. 11.500 Religious were asked to leave their convents and monasteries and institutes. The nuncio was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop Jozsef Grosz and Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.\n\nJozsef Mindszenty had been jailed by the Germans, freed by the Soviet army and was ordained Bishop in 1944. After coup of the communist party in Hungary, a reign of terror backed by the Soviet army was instituted \nPope Pius XII named Mindzenty Primate of Hungary and received him in the College of Cardinals in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and currency fraud. None of the accusations were true. He was tortured, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a confession. His show trial was condemned by the United Nations... The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\" The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the Hungarian Revolution he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars. The Apostolic Constitution \"Solemmni Conventione\" of 1930 includes a concordat between Romania and the Vatican. It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent. The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.\n\nBulgaria became a People's Republic on 15 October 1946. The new constitution of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years, many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under Italian occupation since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the oppressors. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.\n\nAfter defining relations with the Orthodox Church in 1929, Muslims in 1931, Protestants and Jews in 1933, a Concordat was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II. The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The Independent State of Croatia, which declared independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open collaboration of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan monks, 50% of the clergy was jailed. As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was Aloysius Stepinac, who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop. Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. Pope John Paul II beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns\n\nReligious institutes and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.\n\nIn World War II, the religious of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\" The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. Gestapo raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan monk Maximilian Kolbe.\n\nIn the Dachau concentration camp alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers. Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day. Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags. However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950. In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain. The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools \n\nIn Yugoslavia, all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In Bosnia, numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in Slovenia and Croatia during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and North Korea Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.\n\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its first two or three words.\n\n\n"}

The laity assisted at the daily Liturgy of the Hours psalmody, the sacrifice of the Mass, the numerous processions, and were quite familiar with the liturgy. Those few religious practices outside of official services, e.g. the Rosary (a substitute for the 150 Psalms) originated in the liturgy.\n\nAt the beginning of the modern period, \"the primacy accorded to contemplation, the importance attributed to subjectivity and a certain ascetical pragmatism exalting human endeavour ensured that Liturgy no longer appeared as the primary source of the Christian life in the eyes of men and women advanced in the spiritual life.\" The reform of the Roman liturgy after the Council of Trent brought advantages such as ensuring that the doctrinal content reflected the faith in its purity, but its new fixity made it seem the reserve of the clergy and reinforced a division between liturgy and popular piety. \n\nPopular devotion then followed its own channels, especially since the 16th century. Non-liturgical practices like the Stations of the Cross, the Forty Hours' Devotion, various litanies and rosary-based prayers and chaplets prevailed everywhere; novenas and series of Sundays and weekdays in honour of particular saints or mysteries were instituted.\n\nEntire months of the year were given over to special devotions, the most widespread being: January (Holy Name of Jesus); March (Saint Joseph); May (Virgin Mary); June (Sacred Heart); July (Precious Blood); September (Our Lady of Sorrows); October (Rosary); November (Souls in Purgatory).\n\nA renaissance of liturgical worship began in the late 19th century and was advanced by the reforms of Pope Pius X and his 20th-century successors.\n\nThe Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy devotes separate chapters to consideration of practices associated with the liturgical year, veneration of the Mother of God, veneration of the other saints and the beatified, praying for the dead, and shrines and pilgrimages.\n\nUnder the heading \"The language of popular piety\", it speaks of gestures, texts and formulae, song and music, sacred music, sacred places and sacred times.\n\nFor an overview of some practices that form part of Catholic popular piety, see Catholic devotions.\n\nThe Directory declares:\nIn application of this principle, members of the Church, clergy or laity, individuals or groups, must obtain the local ordinary's permission to promote prayers, formulas or private initiatives in this field. On a level beyond the confines of single dioceses, competence belongs to the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "498669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=498669", "title": "Redcap", "text": "Redcap\n\nThe redcap (or Redcap) is a type of malevolent, murderous goblin found in Border folklore. He is said to inhabit ruined castles along the Anglo-Scottish border, especially those places that were once the scenes of tyranny or wicked deeds, and is known for soaking his cap in the blood of his victims. He is also known as Redcomb and Bloody Cap.\n\nRedcap is depicted as \"a short, thickset old man with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery red colour, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, iron boots, a pikestaff in his left hand, and a red cap on his head. When travellers take refuge in his lair he will fling huge stones at them, and if he kills them he will soak his cap in their blood, giving it a crimson hue. However, he may be driven away by repeating words of Scripture or holding up the cross. He will then utter a dismal yell and vanish in flames, leaving behind him a large tooth on the spot where he was last seen. Other than these measures, human strength will do very little in overcoming him.\n\nAccording to the 19th-century folklorist William Henderson, the dunter or powrie is distinct from the redcap. Like the redcap he inhabits old Border forts, castles and peel towers, but their main activity is to make a noise like the beating of flax or the grinding of barley in a hollow stone quern. If this sound goes on longer or louder than usual then it is considered an omen of death or misfortune. Popular tradition states that these Border castles were built by the Picts who bathed the foundation stones in human blood which often resulted in such hauntings. The suggestion is that dunters and redcaps may be the spirits of the original foundation sacrifices.\n\nThe tale of a redcap in Perthshire depicts him as a more benign little man living in a room high up in Grantully Castle. He bestows good fortune on those who see or hear him.\n\nThe Kabouter (Kaboutermannekins), or redcaps of Dutch folklore, are also very different and more akin to brownies.\n\nThe ruin of Blackett Tower, a border fortress that was owned by the Bell family in the parish of Kirkpatrick-Fleming in Dumfriesshire, was haunted by a more traditional ghost known as Old Red Cap or Bloody Bell. A description of the tower and ghost was given by William Scott Irving in the poem \"Fair Helen\" in which the \"ghastly phantom\" holds a bloody dagger beneath a red eastern moon.\n\nThe term redcap is also used in a more general sense. For example, in the village of Zennor in Cornwall fairies were often referred to as \"red-caps\" (including the more benevolent trooping fairies) because of their fondness for wearing green clothing and scarlet caps. This characteristic is demonstrated by an excerpt from the poem \"The Fairies\" by the Irish poet William Allingham: \"Wee folk, good folk/trooping all together/Green jacket, red cap/and white owl's feather\".\n\nThe redcap familiar of Lord William de Soulis, called Robin Redcap, is said to have wrought much harm and ruin in the lands of his master's dwelling, Hermitage Castle. Ultimately, William was (according to legend) taken to the Ninestane Rig, a stone circle near the castle, then wrapped in lead and boiled to death. In reality, William de Soulis was imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle and died there, following his confessed complicity in the conspiracy against Robert the Bruce in 1320.\n\nSir Walter Scott in \"The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border\" records a ballad written by John Leyden entitled \"Lord Soulis\" in which Redcap has granted his master safety against weapons and lives in a chest secured by three strong padlocks. Scott states that the Redcap is a class of spirits that haunts old castles, and that every ruined tower in the south of Scotland was supposed to have one of these spirits residing within. Robin Redcap should not be confused with the mischievous hobgoblin known as Robin Roundcap of East Yorkshire folklore.\n\n\n"}

As a result, it plays an important role in shaping the country's social and cultural life. \n\nAccording to the 2013 estimate by the government of Benin, the population of Benin is 27.7% Muslim, 25.5% Roman Catholic, 13.5% Protestant (which includes Celestial 6.7%, Methodist 3.4%, and other Protestant 3.4%), 11.6% Vodun, 9.5% of other Christian denominations, and 12.2% of others or none.\n\nThere are Christians, Muslims, and adherents of African Traditional Religion throughout the country. However, most adherents of the traditional Yoruba religious group are in the south, while other African Traditional Religion beliefs are followed in the north. Muslims are represented most heavily in the north and southeast. Christians are prevalent in the south, particularly in Cotonou, the economic capital. It is not unusual for members of the same family to practice Christianity, Islam, African Traditional Religion, or a combination of all of these.\n\nAmong the most practiced African Traditional Religions in Benin is the Vodun system of belief which originated in this area of Africa.\n\nOther African Traditional Religions are practiced in the Atakora (Atakora and Donga provinces) and Vodun and Orisha or Orisa veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples is prevalent in the center and south of the country. The town of Ouidah on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun.\n\nThe Tado and the Yoruba Orisha pantheons correspond closely:\n\nChristianity first reached Benin in 1680, gaining more permanent footing in the 19th century. English Methodists arrived in 1843, operating amongst the coastal Gun people. More than half of all Christians in Benin are Roman Catholic. The Catholic hierarchy in Benin consists of the Archdiocese of Cotonou (including the Dioceses of Abomey, Dassa-Zoumé, Lokossa, Porto Novo) and the Parakou (including the Dioceses of Djougou, Kandi, Natitingou, and N'Dali). There are 440 priests and 900 men and women in religious orders. Other Christian groups include Baptists, Methodists, Assemblies of God, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Celestial Christians, Rosicrucians, the Unification Church. Many nominal Christians also practice traditional local religious beliefs.\n\nIslam, which accounts for more than 27.7% of the country's population, was brought to Benin from the north by Hausa, and Songhai-Dendi traders. Nearly all Muslims adhere to the Sunni Maliki branch of Islam. The few Shi'a Muslims are primarily Middle Eastern expatriates. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is also present, who recently inaugurated a mosque in Benin, the Al Mahdi Mosque in 2006. Many nominal Muslims also practice traditional local religious beliefs.\nThree out of twelve departments have a Muslim majority: Alibori (81.3%), Donga (77.9%) and Borgou (69.8%). Couffo has the lowest share of Muslims in Benin as Muslims comprise less than 1% of the total population. \nOther religious groups in Benin include Eckankar and Baha'is.\n\nThe Constitution of Benin provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. The United States government recorded no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice during 2007, and prominent societal leaders have taken positive steps to promote religious freedom.\n"}

The best known distinction of the SNM is its advocacy of the use of the \"sacred name\" Yahweh (Hebrew: יַהְוֶה), i.e., the reconstructed proper name of the God of Israel, and the use of the original Hebrew name of Jesus, often transliterated as Yahshua. SNM believers also generally keep many of the Old Testament laws and ceremonies such as the Seventh-day Sabbath, Torah festivals, and kashrut food laws.\n\nThe Sacred Name Movement arose in the early 20th century out of the Church of God (Seventh Day) movement. This movement was influenced by Joseph Franklin Rutherford who changed the name of the main branch of the Bible Student movement to \"Jehovah's Witnesses\" in 1931, based on his belief in the importance of the Hebrew name of God. C. O. Dodd, a member of the Church of God (Seventh Day), began keeping the Jewish festivals (including Passover) in 1928, adopting sacred name doctrines in the late 1930s.\n\nThe Assembly of Yahweh was the first religious organization in the Sacred Name Movement. It was formed in Holt, Michigan, in the 1930s. The Assembly of Yahweh believes the name of the Almighty Yahweh should be used along with his son's name, Yahshua. They keep the seventh day Sabbath (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) along with all the scriptural feast days. They believe the Torah (law) was not done away with. They believe Yahshua is the son of Yahweh and that his life, death, burial, and resurrection give us salvation. They believe after a person repents of sin, they should be baptized in the name of Yahshua. They first met in private homes near Lansing, Michigan. Later the assembly was located at The Camp of Yah outside of Eaton Rapids, Michigan. The land was owned by the Smith family, and Pearl Smith was the first pastor of the assembly. For a time after her leadership, the assembly was governed by a group of male elders. Sometime in the late 1960s, Samuel Graham was made pastor. The congregation purchased a one-room school house and an additional a few miles from the original Camp of Yah. They later put a small addition on the original building. In 2008, the group received an anonymous donation to be used for a larger building. The main meeting room now allows up to 200 to meet for worship.\n\nDodd began publishing \"The Faith\" magazine starting in 1937 to promote his views. It is currently freely distributed by the Assembly of Yahweh. American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton wrote, \"No single force in spreading the Sacred Name movement was as important as \"The Faith\" magazine.\"\n\nThe Assembly of Yahweh publishes the \"Faith Magazine\" and the \"Word of Yahweh Bible\". They have services every Sabbath at 10:30 am and host all Feast days. During the Feast of Tabernacles, people come from different states and other countries to observe the feast.\n\nThe Sacred Name Movement consists of several small and contrasting groups (such as Yahweh's Assembly in Messiah, and Yahweh's Assembly in Yahshua, etc), unified by the use of the name Yahweh and for the most part, a Hebraic-based form Yahshua for the name of God's Son. Angelo Traina, a disciple of Dodd, undertook the translation of a Sacred Name edition of the Bible, publishing the \"Holy Name New Testament\" in 1950 (see Tetragrammaton in the New Testament) and the \"Holy Name Bible\" in 1962, both based upon the King James Version, but changing some names and words in the text to Hebrew-based forms, such as \"God\" to \"Elohim\", \"LORD\" to \"Yahweh\" and \"Jesus\" to \"Yahshua\". Most groups within the Sacred Name Movement use a Sacred Name Bible, others having been produced since Traina's.\n\nThe SNM rejects Easter and Christmas as pagan in origin and instead observes the holy days of Leviticus 23 such as Passover and the Feast of Weeks. The movement is also non-Trinitarian because it rejects the doctrine of the Trinity as unbiblical.\nHowever, groups within the movement have differed on doctrinal points, such as the wearing of beards and what constitutes a Sabbath rest. The Assemblies of Yahweh (headquartered in Bethel, Pennsylvania) distanced itself from the movement because of its refusal to become doctrinally united with it, calling the movement a \"disorganisation\" and \"confusion\".\n\nIndividuals and groups within the Movement will use other forms of Yahshua, including \"Yeshua\", \"Yehoshua\", \"Yahushua\", \"Yahoshua\", \"Yaohushua\", \"Y'shua\" or \"Yahshuah\". This use of the sacred names has led to the SNM production of Bibles. These include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2170969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2170969", "title": "Supernatural (U.S. TV series)", "text": "Supernatural (U.S. TV series)\n\nSupernatural is an American dark fantasy television series created by Eric Kripke. It was first broadcast on September 13, 2005, on The WB, and subsequently became part of successor The CW's lineup. Starring Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, the series follows the two brothers as they hunt demons, ghosts, monsters, and other supernatural beings. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television, in association with Wonderland Sound and Vision. Along with Kripke, executive producers have been McG, Robert Singer, Phil Sgriccia, Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver, John Shiban, Ben Edlund and Adam Glass. Former executive producer and director Kim Manners died of lung cancer during production of the fourth season.\n\nThe series is filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia and surrounding areas and was in development for nearly ten years, as creator Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it. The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season. Originally, Kripke planned the series for three seasons but later expanded it to five. The fifth season concluded the series' main storyline, and Kripke departed the series as showrunner. The series has continued on for several more seasons with new showrunners, including Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver, Robert Singer and Andrew Dabb. With its eleventh season, \"Supernatural\" became the longest-running American live-action fantasy TV series. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a fourteenth season, which premiered on October 11, 2018, and will consist of 20 episodes.\n\nBefore bringing \"Supernatural\" to television, creator Eric Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years, having been fascinated with urban legends since he was a child. He had originally envisioned \"Supernatural\" as a movie. He later developed it as a TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was picked up by The WB. The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van \"fighting the demons in search of the truth\". Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the \"best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories.\"\n\nAs he had previously written for The WB series \"Tarzan\", Kripke was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network and used the opportunity for \"Supernatural\". However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the characters being brothers. He decided to have the brothers be from Lawrence, Kansas, because of its closeness to Stull Cemetery, a location famous for its urban legends.\n\nWhen it came time to name the two lead characters, Kripke decided on \"Sal\" and \"Dean\" as an homage to Jack Kerouac's road-trip novel \"On the Road\". However, he felt that \"Sal\" was inappropriate for a main character and changed the name to \"Sam\". It was originally intended for the brothers' last name to be \"Harrison\" as a nod to actor Harrison Ford, as Kripke wanted Dean to have the \"devil-may-care swagger of Han Solo\". However, there was a Sam Harrison living in Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons. Combining his interest in the Winchester Mystery House and his desire to give the series the feel of \"a modern-day Western\", Kripke settled on the surname of \"Winchester\". However, this also presented a problem. The first name of Sam and Dean's father was originally \"Jack\", and there was a Jack Winchester residing in Kansas, so Kripke was forced to change the character's name to \"John\".\nGrowing up, Kripke connected to television shows that had signature cars, such as \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"Knight Rider\". This prompted him to include one in \"Supernatural\". \"We say it's a modern American Western – two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking from the very beginning that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse.\" He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since \"you can put a body in the trunk\" and because \"you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors.\" Kripke has commented, \"It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show.\"\n\nKripke had previously pitched the series to Fox executive Peter Johnson, and when Johnson moved to Wonderland Sound and Vision as president of TV, he contacted Kripke. Johnson soon signed on as co-executive producer, as did Wonderland owner McG as executive producer, with the production company set to make the pilot episode. Before it could be filmed, however, script issues needed to be dealt with. Originally, the brothers were not raised by their father, but rather by their aunt and uncle. Thus, when Dean comes to Sam for assistance in the pilot episode, he has to convince him that the supernatural exists. However, Kripke realized that this made the backstory too complicated and reworked it with Peter Johnson so that their father raised them to be hunters. The script went through many additional revisions. One of the original ideas was for Sam's girlfriend Jessica to be revealed as a demon, which prompts him to join Dean on the road; however, Kripke felt it was more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death, so he had her killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, making them the \"right bookends\". Other revised concepts include Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer who murders their father and their father dying in Jessica's place. Filming for the pilot episode was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on \"Tarzan\", signed on. When the series was eventually picked up, the studio brought in Robert Singer as executive producer, as it wanted Kripke to work with someone with production experience. Due to his previous work on \"The X-Files, \"co-executive producer John Shiban was also hired to help design the series mythology. Kripke had the series planned out for three seasons but later expanded it to five and hoped to end it there on a high note.\n\nThe staff for the first season consisted of Kripke and five other writers, with assistants to help with researching urban legends. Most of the work done in writing the series is very collaborative, with the writers often breaking up into groups. At the beginning of each season, the writers are brought together and pitch their ideas, which are then assigned to a specific writer to be developed. Each story idea is outlined on a dry-erase board, with Kripke and Bob Singer making necessary changes. Afterward, the script is written, and Kripke goes through it to make sure it has the same tone as other episodes. Kripke found this task very difficult to do in the first season, but he felt it became easier by the third season, as the staff came to \"really understand the show's style\". Following the fifth season, Kripke stepped down as showrunner but maintained his connection with the series as an executive consultant. In a 2006 interview with \"Collider\", he responded to the question as to how involved he still is with the show with the answer, \"I would define myself as a proud parent who has sent their child off to college.\" He elaborated on this analogy, explaining, \"I'm there if they need me, I'm happy to help, but I also stay out of their way if they don't need me.\"\n\nThe tone of \"Supernatural\" was heavily influenced by films such as \"Poltergeist\"—having the horror happen in a family setting rather than remote location—and \"Evil Dead II\" and \"An American Werewolf in London\"—having bits of comedy mixed in. Commenting on the former, Kripke said, \"It's the idea that horror can happen in your own backyard. How many viewers have to worry about the vampire in the gothic castle?\" \"It's always been a show about \"family\".\" Other influences include \"The Two Sisters\" and Asian horror films \"The Eye\", \"Ju-on\", and \"Ring\".\n\nAccording to creator Eric Kripke, the show originally was intended to focus on the weekly monsters, with Sam and Dean Winchester merely being \"an engine to get us in and out of different horror movies every week\". His sole desire was to merely \"scare the crap out of people\". However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. This revelation caused them to change the series to focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters. According to Kripke, \"... sometimes we don't even have the monster until way late in the break, once we get all the angst and the drama done first.\"\n\nThough companies were hired for work on the pilot episode—such as Entity FX for the visual effects—effects departments now work exclusively for the series. Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director make sure that the scenes are being filmed in the best way for the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors are looking at the correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors. Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature, though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story. In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.\n\n\"Supernatural\" features a synthesized orchestral score, although traditional acoustic instruments such as guitars and cellos are used at times. Special instruments have also been used in specific episodes, such as \"bluesy gospel music\" played on a broken-down piano in the faith-healing episode \"Faith\". Unlike other television shows, the series features two composers: Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. Each composer scores every other episode, giving them extra time to write the scores, which usually end up being around 30 minutes per episode. They write themes for their own episodes and characters and work with one another if there is overlap between episodes. They try to base the music on the visuals of the episode, such as in the episode \"Dead in the Water\", in which off-angle shots are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes, and spoken words such as \"water\" and \"die\" are followed by a lower pitch to create a \"gurgly\" sound. While there are similarities in the scores for situations such as the brothers and their father, about a third of each episode's score is newly written for the series.\n\nWhile original scores are used throughout episodes, another important aspect of the series' music is the use of classic rock, over which creator Eric Kripke threatened to quit when the network would not allow its inclusion. Most of the songs are from Kripke's private collection, although one of his favorite bands—Led Zeppelin—is too expensive to use. Some episode titles are references to Led Zeppelin songs. The series has featured such bands as Blue Öyster Cult, Bad Company, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rush, Boston, Triumph and AC/DC on more than one occasion. Multiple songs are usually used throughout each episode, and accompany \"The Road So Far\" sequences before select episodes that highlight a montage of past events. Although Kripke prefers to keep a fine line between the score and songs used, sometimes Lennertz and Gruska are required to write short sections of rock-like music to fill 15-to-20-second gaps, as it would be too costly to acquire song rights. On the last episode of every season except the first, the song \"Carry On Wayward Son\" by Kansas is played at the beginning.\n\nThough the pilot was filmed in Los Angeles, principal filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Thus, on-location filming usually takes place in the area. \"Dead in the Water\" was filmed at Buntzen Lake, and the final scenes of \"Simon Said\" were filmed at Cleveland Dam. Other locations used on the show are often reused two or three times, with the art department making variations to conceal this. Heritage Park in Burnaby has been used as a cemetery in \"Red Sky at Morning\", and as the location of the gingerbread-house cottage in \"Bedtime Stories\". Also, Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam has served many functions for the series, including an asylum in \"Asylum\", a hospital in \"In My Time of Dying\", and a prison in \"Folsom Prison Blues\". The episode \"Houses of the Holy\" was filmed on location in Vancouver at St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church. Because episodes usually take place in the middle of nowhere, filming often takes place at an old military base. Having been shut down for years, the buildings have been removed, leaving just roads on which sets are erected, such as for crossroads scenes.\n\nRather than having the series debut on television, The WB instead made the pilot episode available for online streaming through Yahoo! a week before it was set to premiere on the network as part of a promotional scheme. Following the transition to The CW, \"Supernatural\" episodes were added to Apple's iTunes Store starting in December 2006, being one of the first CW series to be made available for sale online. The following month, the network began streaming episodes of the series on its website with limited commercial interruption, available for up to four weeks after the initial airings. Beginning January 11, 2007, Australia's Network Ten also began offering full episodes for download via their website, through a deal with Warner Bros. Television. To combat piracy, Ten debuted the second-season premiere five days before its initial broadcast in the country, making \"Supernatural\" the first major network show available for free download in Australia before being aired. Subsequent episodes became available online just hours after being televised. Around the same time, episodes were also made available for download on Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace. In September 2008, Amazon.com launched its new on-demand TV service, with \"Supernatural\" being one of the many television shows available for sale.\n\nThe series originally focuses primarily on the brothers Dean Winchester and Sam Winchester, played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, as they travel throughout the country hunting down evil supernatural creatures. Padalecki became interested in the role because he liked horror series, including both \"The X-Files\" and \"The Twilight Zone\", which he found similar to the proposed plot of \"Supernatural\". He was also excited to play \"the reluctant hero\", comparing Sam to \"The Matrix\"s Neo and Luke Skywalker of \"Star Wars\". Padalecki had previous experience working with executive producers McG and David Nutter, the former convincing him to audition for the role. Ackles was originally asked by Nutter to audition for the role of Sam but preferred the character of Dean after reading the script. At the time of his audition, he was already a series regular on fellow WB series \"Smallville\". After landing the part of Dean, his \"Smallville\" role was cut short.\n\nWhile the series does not have many lead characters, there are many recurring characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father \"split the show\". Shiban noted that \"... the boys were looking for Dad, and they were looking for a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like – 'what is Dad doing? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'\" They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to \"Supernatural\" for the second season because of his recurring role on the series \"Grey's Anatomy\". Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.\n\nAlso introduced in the first season are the demon Azazel and his unnamed daughter. While Azazel mainly appears merely as shadows or silhouettes in the first season, only taking physical form when he possesses John Winchester, Azazel's daughter uses a girl named Meg Masters—portrayed by Nicki Lynn Aycox—as a host. In the second-season premiere, Azazel's host is portrayed by Fredric Lehne; originally brought on only for one episode, Lehne impressed the showrunners so much that he was asked to return for the season's two-part finale. Even after the character's death, Azazel makes appearances in subsequent seasons, being portrayed by different actors. Lehne also reprises the role in the first episode of season six when Dean is poisoned and begins to see Azazel again. Likewise, after Azazel's daughter is exorcised from Meg towards the end of the first season, the demon and her host continued to appear in the series, although now as two separate characters. Aycox continued her role in the fourth season when the angry spirit of Meg tries to kill the Winchesters. The demon returns for an episode in the second season played by Padalecki, temporarily taking Sam as a host. She appears once again in the fifth season, her newest host being portrayed by Rachel Miner, in a recurring role.\n\nThe writers eventually wanted to flesh out the concept of hunters, resulting in the introduction of many new characters. Actor Jim Beaver makes his first appearance as Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters, at the end of the first season. Becoming a sort of surrogate father to Sam and Dean after their father's death, the character acts as their mentor and foremost point of contact before his departure in the seventh season. Other hunters appear in the second season with the introduction of Harvelle's Roadhouse, a saloon frequented by hunters. It is owned by Ellen Harvelle (played by Samantha Ferris), whose late husband was a friend of John Winchester. Working alongside her mother is Jo Harvelle (played by Alona Tal). Also present is the computer guy Ash (played by Chad Lindberg), who uses his vast computer skills to track the paranormal. Tal was eventually written out of the series, and believes the reason to be that the producers felt she looked like Sam and Dean's \"14-year-old sister\". Kripke claims the character was incorrectly conceived, and also cites poor fan reaction for her removal. Also, the character of Ash is killed off in the second-season finale with the destruction of the Roadhouse. Ellen was meant to return in the third season, but the episode had to be scrapped due to the writer's strike. The writers intended for her to be featured in the third-season finale, but Ferris declined because the deal offered to her was not acceptable, as \"It could cost [her] money and work\". However, both actresses returned as Jo and Ellen in the fifth season.\n\nFor the third season, the writers decided to introduce Ruby, a demonic former witch who claims to be an ally to the Winchesters. However, The CW requested that another female be added, so the character Bela Talbot, a self-centered thief who sells occult objects to wealthy clients and who was already intended to appear in multiple episodes, was upgraded to a series regular. Katie Cassidy and Lauren Cohan were eventually cast as Ruby and Bela, respectively, though they originally auditioned for the others' role. Though only making six appearances each in the third season, both actresses were credited as co-stars for their episodes. At the end of the season, Bela was killed off, and Cassidy was let go for budgetary reasons. The role of Ruby was recast for the fourth season, auditions only describing the character as \"a love interest\". Genevieve Cortese (who later married Padalecki) took over the role until the character's death at the end of the season.\n\nWanting to bring in Christian mythology to the series, the writers created the angel Castiel. With Kripke wanting to keep the introduction of an angel a secret, the character was instead described as a demon during auditions. Misha Collins was cast as the character. Making his debut in the fourth-season premiere, Castiel resurrects Dean from Hell after his death in the third season, and comes to be an ally of the Winchesters. The character was originally intended for only a six-episode story arc, but the role was later expanded. Collins was promoted to a series regular for the fifth and sixth season, something Collins believes to be mainly due to fan support. Collins was downgraded to recurring status for the seventh and eighth seasons, but returned to series regular status for seasons nine and ten.\n\nAlong with Castiel came other angelic characters, with Robert Wisdom portraying the \"militant\" and \"dogmatic\" Uriel, who secretly supports Lucifer; Julie McNiven playing the fallen angel Anna Milton, who eventually regains her angelic form but remains an outcast of Heaven; and Kurt Fuller as Castiel's boss Zachariah, who wishes to start the Apocalypse in order to bring Paradise to Earth. Though Wisdom's character is eventually killed, McNiven and Fuller continue their roles into the fifth season and are joined by Mark Pellegrino as the recently released but fallen archangel Lucifer. Pellegrino also appears as Lucifer as a hallucination in Sam's head in season 7. Pellegrino had been the second choice for the role of Castiel and was offered the role of Lucifer without an audition. Further on, Fuller's and McNiven's characters were also killed along with both Harvelle characters.\n\nSeason 5 introduces the demon Crowley, played by Mark Sheppard, who would become the Winchester's longest-recurring antagonist and occasional anti-hero in the series. Crowley appears in three episodes of season 5 to help the Winchesters seal Lucifer back in the Cage, believing that once he destroys humanity he will target all demonkind next. In season 6, Crowley becomes the King of Hell and one of the main antagonists working with Castiel to stop Archangel Raphael, the other main antagonist of season 6, from restarting the Apocalypse by harnessing the souls of Purgatory and splitting the power with Castiel. In season 7, Crowley becomes an anti-hero who helps the Winchesters against the threat of Leviathans led by Dick Roman, after they are released from Purgatory by Castiel. Crowley becomes the main antagonist of season 8, attempting to harness the Words of God and their powers and stop the Winchesters from sealing Hell forever. In season 9, Crowley becomes an unwilling prisoner of the Winchesters but is forced to deal with Abaddon trying to steal his position as King of Hell. Sheppard was promoted to series regular status for season 10.\n\nSeason 7 introduces Kevin Tran the prophet (played by Osric Chau), who translates the word of God to help the Winchesters stop the Leviathans which leads to their destruction. In season 8, Kevin works to translate another word of God to find the means of sealing Hell forever. In season 9, Kevin instead tries to find the means of returning the fallen angels to Heaven but is killed by a Gadreel-possessed Sam.\n\nAlso introduced in Season 7 is Charlie Bradbury, a tech-savvy geek (played by Felicia Day) who works at Richard Roman Enterprises. After hacking into Frank's hard drive and learning about the existence of monsters, Charlie becomes an ally of the Winchesters and occasionally helps them out with technical problems and hunts.\n\nSeason 9 introduces the angel Gadreel, who originally poses as Ezekiel, played by Tahmoh Penikett and Padalecki. After Sam is seriously injured when he decides not to seal Hell, Gadreel comes to Dean in response to his prayer for help, possesses Sam to heal him, and becomes Dean's ally. However, Gadreel's true identity is later revealed by Metatron to be the guardian who had allowed Lucifer into the Garden of Eden and was imprisoned until the fall. Gadreel then allies with Metatron in an attempt to redeem himself and lead the angels back to Heaven. He kills Kevin Tran and is later expelled from Sam and possesses his original vessel again. However, after Metatron begins sacrificing angels for his plans, Gadreel becomes regretful and joins Sam, Dean and Castiel.\n\nBecause the show focuses mainly on the two Winchester brothers, the writers realized that viewers would know that the characters are not in danger of being permanently killed. To fix this, the staff often writes in guest characters to give tension to the episode, occasionally having them die.\n\nThe first season consists of 22 episodes that premiered on September 13, 2005, and concluded on May 4, 2006. The first 16 episodes aired on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays at 9:00 pm.\n\nAfter their mother's death in a suspicious fire that burns down their house 22 years prior, Sam and Dean Winchester's father goes missing during a \"hunting trip\". As a result, Dean tracks down Sam at Stanford University and they begin to live a life on the road, in Dean's black, 1967 Chevrolet Impala with Kansas license plates. However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and spirits, and has trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They also find another man with abilities similar to Sam's, whose mother died the same way. They reach out to the young man, Max Miller, offering help and seeking answers. But Max has experienced years of physical abuse and neglect and his life ends in a murder suicide which Dean and Sam are unable to stop. They eventually find and reunite with their father, who reveals that the creature that killed their mother years earlier is the demon Azazel (aka \"Yellow Eyes\") and the only thing that can kill him is a legendary gun created by Samuel Colt. It is revealed that Azazel, on a baby's six-month birthday, would bleed into their mouth and kill the moms when they walk in. This is what gave Sam and Max their powers. The season ends with the brothers and their father involved in a car crash when a truck hits the side of the Impala. They lie inside the car, covered in blood and unconscious.\n\nThe second season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm beginning September 28, 2006, and ending May 17, 2007.\n\nThe season follows Sam and Dean as they deal with their father's death, who, after the car crash, traded Azazel his life for Dean's. Sam and Dean continue to hunt Azazel, who caused the fires that led to the deaths of their mother, and later, Sam's girlfriend, Jessica. They receive assistance from new allies Bobby, Ellen, Jo, and Ash. Part of Azazel's master plan is eventually revealed as he gathers Sam and others with similar psychic abilities to fight each other, leading to Sam's death. Dean makes a deal with a crossroads demon to bring Sam back in exchange for his soul, which will be collected in one year and taken to Hell. Azazel opens a portal to Hell, and as hundreds of demons and souls escape, has a final confrontation with the Winchesters. With the help of the spirit of John Winchester, who escaped Hell through the portal, Dean finally kills Azazel and the portal is closed. The Winchester brothers and their allies are left to deal with the demon army that has been unleashed and the one-year contract Dean has before he goes to Hell.\n\nThe third season consists of 16 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm beginning October 4, 2007, and ending May 15, 2008. Originally 22 episodes were ordered for the third season, but production was halted on December 5, 2007, upon completion of the twelfth episode by the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. The season number was shortened to sixteen episodes, with four new episodes airing in April and May 2008.\n\nThe season focuses on trying to save Dean from his deal and tracking down the demons that were released from hell. Along the way, the brothers meet Ruby, a \"good\" demon, who has an interest in Sam and claims to be able to help save Dean. Also, they meet Bela Talbot, an acquirer and seller of occult objects, who becomes a thorn in their side. The brothers learn from Bela which demon holds Dean's contract: a powerful demon named Lilith. Lilith is the very first demon ever made, with her soul being twisted by Lucifer himself in a spite against God for kicking him out. Lilith takes Bela's soul after her contract expires, but not before she warns Sam and Dean. The brothers, along with Ruby, track Lilith down and attempt to kill her. Lilith is unable to stop Sam on account of his mysterious abilities; however, Dean's contract expires and his soul is taken to Hell.\n\nThe fourth season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm beginning September 18, 2008, and ending May 14, 2009.\n\nDean is rescued from Hell and brought back by an angel of the Lord named Castiel. The rest of the season follows the brothers as they work with Castiel to stop Lilith's plan of breaking the 66 seals, which would allow the fallen archangel Lucifer, AKA \"the Devil\" or \"Satan himself\", to walk the Earth free once again. Sam and Dean's relationshing is strained and Sam starts siding with Ruby over Dean. He begins to give into his demonic side by drinking demon blood to become strong enough to defeat Lilith. He and Dean have a falling-out. Sam sides with Ruby in his obsessive quest to kill Lilith. Dean makes a deal with the angels to save Sam, and learns that the angels want the Apocalypse to occur in order to rebuild Paradise on Earth. With aid from Castiel, Dean escapes and tries to stop Sam after learning that Lilith is, in fact, the last seal, but Sam kills her anyway, breaking open Lucifer's prison. Ruby reveals her true colors as a demon loyal to Lucifer and Dean kills her. As the season ends, Lucifer's cage opens and he escapes from Hell.\n\nThe fifth season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm beginning September 10, 2009, and ending May 13, 2010. This season was rumored to be the last season, because Eric Kripke had said previously that he planned the show to run for only five seasons. Despite this, Padalecki and Ackles had contracts for a sixth season, and The CW renewed it for season six on February 16, 2010.\n\nThe fifth season revolves around the fight to stop Lucifer and save the world from the Apocalypse, inspired by events in the Book of Revelation. Throughout the season, while Castiel searches for God, Sam and Dean battle both angels and demons as they fight their destiny to become the vessels of Lucifer and Michael, respectively. They attempt to stop Lucifer by retrieving the Colt from the demon Crowley and attempting to kill Lucifer with it. This fails as Lucifer can't be killed by the Colt, and they lose fellow hunters and friends Jo and Ellen in the process. Unable to defeat Lucifer, Sam and Dean, with information from the Trickster, revealed to be the archangel Gabriel, and with help from the demon Crowley, decided to collect the rings of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, including Death, which act as the key to Lucifer's prison. In the end, Sam allows Lucifer to possess him and he kills Bobby and Castiel, who is now human. Sam then manages to regain control, thanks to his bond with Dean, and throws himself (while possessed by Lucifer) and Adam (possessed by Michael) into the Cage to trap Lucifer once more. Castiel is resurrected by God and, more powerful than ever, resurrects Bobby and then returns to Heaven to restore order. Dean returns to his old girlfriend Lisa to live a normal life. Sam is next shown mysteriously free of the Cage, watching his brother eating dinner in the house with Lisa and her son Ben.\n\nThe sixth season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Fridays at 9:00 pm beginning September 24, 2010, and ending May 20, 2011. Beginning with this season, Kripke did not return as showrunner, but still remained as a hands-on executive producer, leaving executive producer Sera Gamble to take over the reins.\n\nThe sixth season begins a year after the conclusion of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable to get much help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel Raphael. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still in the Cage, so he implores the Horseman Death to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time in the Cage, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.\n\nThe seventh season consists of 23 episodes that aired on Fridays at 9:00 pm beginning September 23, 2011, and ending May 18, 2012.\n\nAfter absorbing souls from Purgatory and declaring himself God, Castiel begins to punish all the wrongdoers in the world. He discovers that he absorbed the Leviathans, who are attempting to break free of his vessel. Sam and Dean manage to return most of the souls to Purgatory but fail to return the Leviathans, who seemingly kill Castiel before vanishing and inhabiting the bodies of many different people around the world. Sam and Dean learn that their weakness is Sodium Borate (also known as Borax), though it has minimum effectiveness on the Leviathan leader Dick Roman. After Roman kills Bobby, Dean becomes obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and learns of a facility they are building, only to discover that it is a facility to cure cancer. The spirit of Bobby later confirms that while they are curing disease, they are doing it as part of their plan to turn humanity into the perfect food source. With Castiel and Kevin's help, the brothers learn that the only way to kill the Leviathans is with the \"bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen\" and set out to find the three bloods. Kevin can read the word of God and helps Sam and Dean decipher it to stop the Leviathans. Eventually, Dean and Castiel kill Dick but are dragged into Purgatory as a result, while Sam is left alone to deal with Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the Leviathans are disorganized.\n\nKey plot points presented in the season were Sam struggling with the constant hallucinations of Lucifer and the ghost of Bobby \"haunting\" Sam and Dean through his alcohol flask. Bobby's rage toward Dick Roman slowly causes him to become a vengeful spirit, and Sam and Dean ultimately deal with this by burning the flask at his request, thus destroying Bobby.\n\nThe eighth season consists of 23 episodes that aired on Wednesdays at 9:00 pm beginning October 3, 2012, and ending May 15, 2013.\n\nOne year after being dragged to Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth without Castiel, carrying inside his body the soul of a vampire named Benny. The two brothers begin a fight against Crowley to find the Demon Tablet and lock the Gates of Hell, thereby trapping all demons in Hell. The brothers use Kevin Tran to help them read the tablet and accomplish this. Castiel is brought back by an angel named Naomi, and takes possession of the Angel Tablet to break her control of him when she tries to use him to kill Dean. While Kevin works on the tablet, Sam and Dean have an unexpected encounter with their paternal grandfather, Henry Winchester, who was a member of the Men of Letters, an organization dedicated to gathering supernatural knowledge; his disappearance in 1958 was actually him using a time-travel spell to go to the future and escape an attack by the demon Abaddon. Henry is killed protecting his grandsons, but he provides them with access to the Men of Letters bunker, a storehouse for several supernatural artefacts and books, which the Winchesters subsequently adopt as a new 'home'. Kevin translates three trials that must be completed in order to lock the Gates of Hell for good, but although Sam completed the first two, Dean ends the trials before the third can be finished as completing the trials would kill Sam. Unfortunately, Castiel is tricked by the Angel Metatron into completing a series of trials that would have allegedly locked all angels in Heaven, but actually banished every angel apart from Metatron to Earth, the season ending with millions of angels falling from the sky and Castiel stripped of his Grace.\n\nThe ninth season consists of 23 episodes that aired on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm beginning October 8, 2013, and ending May 20, 2014.\n\nIn the first half of the ninth season, the angels have fallen to Earth and two angel factions are warring against each other while hunting Castiel. Rogue angels roam the Earth causing trouble. Castiel is now human and has to adjust to his new life while Crowley is held prisoner by Sam and Dean who are trying to use an old blood ritual to turn demon Crowley back into a human. Sam is left near-death from the Trials of God and Dean is forced to let an angel, claiming to be Ezekiel, possess Sam to heal him from the inside. Dean must hide Ezekiel's presence from Sam so that he won't expel him and die while also keeping Castiel away at Ezekiel's demand. The brothers search for a way to return the angels to Heaven. Eventually it is revealed that Ezekiel is actually Gadreel, the angel who let Lucifer into the Garden of Eden. Gadreel murders Kevin Tran and escapes, while Castiel regains his powers. With Crowley's help, Sam expels Gadreel, but the experience causes Sam and Dean to split up while letting Crowley go as part of the deal Dean made for him to save Sam.\n\nIn the second half, Dean begins searching for both Gadreel for revenge and the First Blade to kill Abaddon with the help of Crowley. Despite being warned of terrible repercussions, Dean takes on the Mark of Cain in order to be able to wield the First Blade. After healing Sam completely, Castiel begins a search of his own for Metatron, believing him to be the key to reversing the expulsion of the angels. Metatron begins trying to unite all the angels under his rule while Castiel leads other angels against him to retake Heaven. Eventually Dean kills Abaddon and Castiel defeats Metatron with the help of a repentant Gadreel, but Metatron kills Dean, causing Dean to become a demon due to the influence of the Mark of Cain.\n\nIn the tenth season, after being resurrected by the Mark of Cain, Dean is now a demon, working alongside Crowley. Meanwhile, Sam continues to search for Dean. After Dean refuses to follow Crowley's order and embarrasses him in front of his demon followers, Crowley gives Sam his brother's location. For giving up Dean, Sam gives Crowley the First Blade. Later, Sam, with the help of Castiel, cures Dean by using sanctified human blood. After being cured, Dean is reminded by Castiel that the Mark of Cain is still a problem. Dean and Sam help Castiel track down his vessel's (Jimmy's) daughter, Claire. Dean ends up slaughtering several men who are keeping her captive and loses control of the Mark, a nightmare he previously had.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious new witch comes into play, being revealed to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the \"Book of the Damned\". Sam needs help in reading and using the tome, and turns to Rowena for help. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is for the good of the world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the \"Book of the Damned\".\n\nIn the eleventh season, Sam and Dean deal with the release of Amara/The Darkness, after Rowena's spell removed the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm. While Crowley's taking care of Amara, feeding her with souls, the brothers are, alongside Castiel, trying to find a way to kill The Darkness. In order to find out more about Amara, Castiel asks Metatron for help, and he says that in order to create the world, God had to sacrifice His sister, The Darkness. To face the most dangerous creature they've crossed paths with so far, the brothers ask for Lucifer's help. Lucifer claims he's the only one that can beat Amara, but in order to do so, he needs to possess Sam's body. When Sam refuses, Lucifer tries to kill Dean, Sam, and Castiel, but Rowena's spell seems to have sent him away. Later, it's revealed that Castiel said \"yes\" at the last second, and that Lucifer is now possessing his body. \n\nWhen nothing works to get rid of The Darkness, Amara claims that God must appear Himself to see her destroying everything He created and loves. Then, she decides to draw out God by torturing an archangel, making Lucifer/Castiel scream in agony. Meanwhile, Chuck returns and reveals himself to Metatron, telling him He is God. Then, He reveals Himself to The Winchesters and they all decide to seal Amara. Rowena, who had cast a spell that made her immortal, helps them with a spell, while Crowley and Lucifer use the demons and angels in a combined attack against Amara. When Chuck tried to seal Amara, she resisted, stopping the Winchesters, apparently killing Lucifer and gravely wounding Chuck. Amara warns that Chuck is not dead yet because he is going to watch her destroy everything ever created.\n\nAs a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance for the world to survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin gathering ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness. With the help of Billie the Reaper, they are able to get the needed souls which are inserted into Dean. Chuck sends Dean to Amara who has started to regret her actions and Dean convinces Amara that revenge is not worth it. Amara and Chuck reconcile and Amara heals Chuck of the damage she did to him. The two then leave the Earth, but not before Amara tells Dean she is going to give him what he wants most for helping her. At the bunker, Castiel is banished by a woman who identifies herself as Lady Antonia Bevell of the London chapter of the Men of Letters. Antonia tells Sam the Men of Letters have sent her to bring Sam in for punishment for his actions and fires her gun, apparently at Sam as he tries to talk her down. Making his way through the woods, Dean finds his resurrected mother.\n\nThe twelfth season premiered on October 13, 2016, and concluded on May 18, 2017, consisting of 23 episodes.\n\nDean meets his mother for the first time in 30 years after Amara sends him the gift which he wanted most. Sam has been captured by Lady Bevell and is being tortured as punishment for his past sins. Dean convinces Mary that he is her son and thereafter discovers that Sam has been captured. Dean, Mary and Castiel devise a plan to rescue Sam. Lucifer has been possessing numerous vessels in his quest to find one that is suitable for him. He finally possesses Vince Vincete, a veteran rock star, and kills Rowena in the process. After a concert where Lucifer plans to destroy all those who attend, his vessel disintegrates before he is able to make the President of the United States his vessel. Sam and Dean try to warn the president, but are presumed to be assassins who are trying to kill the president and are thereby detained at an unknown center. They both fake being dead in order to escape and are reunited with Castiel and Mary. Mary begins to work with Mr Arthur Ketch of the Men of Letters in order to get back into hunting. Mary tricks the brothers into stealing the Colt from one of the four princes of hell Ramiel.\n\nAfter Mick Davies is killed the brothers acknowledge that the Men of Letters have gone rogue. Meanwhile, the president has made his assistant Kelly Kline pregnant and Castiel realizes that a Nephilim is to be born. Sam, Dean and Castiel try convince Kelly about the impending danger. While Lucifer has been captured and being tortured by Crowley. Sam and a few hunters gather to defeat the Men of Letters while Castiel retrieves Kelly after killing Dagon. Lucifer is released by Crowley's minion demon and heads on to find his son. In the finale Kelly gives birth to the Nephilim, while Crowley sacrifices himself to kill Lucifer. Crowley and Castiel die trying to kill Lucifer while Mary and Lucifer are pulled into the rift created by the Nephilim's birth. Dean kneels down in despair after witnessing Castiel being killed while Sam is shocked when he arrives to see Jack the Nephilim grown into a teenager.\n\nThe thirteenth season premiered on October 12, 2017, and concluded on May 17, 2018, consisting of 23 episodes.\n\nDean and Sam are left reeling from the loss of so many allies and family members and their new responsibility to 'raise' Jack, with Sam willing to give the boy a chance while Dean is immediately concerned due to his heritage. In the other world, Lucifer keeps Mary alive as a hostage to trade for his son when he returns home, but finds himself confronted by the alternate Michael, who has killed his Lucifer and won the war. Although Dean becomes increasingly bitter at their recent losses, he gains a new sense of hope when Jack unintentionally brings Castiel back to life. Things become complicated when Men of Letters Arthur Ketch is revealed to have escaped death through a spell he received from Rowena, Ketch taking Castiel and a weakened Lucifer prisoner after Lucifer escapes back into this world when Michael tries to use his grace to create a portal so that he can conquer the other reality.\n\nWhile the Winchesters' efforts to return to the other world to rescue Mary fail, Ketch is revealed to be working with Asmodeus, who reveals in turn that the source of his power is Gabriel, who actually faked his death during his confrontation with Lucifer but was sold to Asmodeus by the children of the real Loki. After their first attempt to enter the other world traps Jack in that reality, the Winchesters retrieve the demon tablet, a translation of it reveals the ingredients needed to open a portal to the other world. As Jack sides with Mary and the humans against the angels, the Winchesters and Castiel gather the ingredients for the spell to open the portal while Lucifer tries to re-establish himself as king of Heaven in the absence of God and other archangels. After Ketch rescues Gabriel, allowing the Winchesters to use his grace as part of the spell, the initial raid on the other world fails to achieve more than Dean rescuing the alternate version of his deceased friend Charlie Bradbury, but Gabriel flees in fear after an attack on the bunker by Asmodeus. With Heaven in desperate straits after Lucifer fails to hold the angels together, Castiel is charged with finding Gabriel while the last ten angels try to keep Heaven in order, leaving the Winchesters to mount a new assault on the other world with Gabriel and Lucifer. They are able to rescue a range of human survivors from the other world, including the alternate versions of Bobby and Charlie, but Gabriel is killed in the process and Lucifer and the alternate Michael follow them through.\n\nAs Lucifer takes Jack's power for himself, Dean is forced to make a deal to act as the vessel for the alternate Michael to stop him. Dean is able to stay in control long enough to kill Lucifer, but the season ends with Michael taking control of Dean's body and departing.\n\nThe fourteenth season premiered on October 11, 2018, and will consist of 20 episodes.\n\nThroughout the series, Dean drives a black 1967 Chevrolet Impala which he refers to as \"Baby.\" Having been passed down to him by his father (John), it is Dean's most prized possession, with actor Jensen Ackles feeling it is Dean's \"life\" and \"sanctuary\". The brothers travel in it throughout the country as they hunt the supernatural, and the trunk holds various weaponry and their fake IDs. In the first two seasons, it has a Kansas license plate with the number KAZ 2Y5, a reference to the Winchesters' home state of Kansas, and the series premiere date of 2005. Towards the end of the second season, the car sports a new Ohio license plate (CNK 80Q3) to aid the brothers in hiding from the FBI.\n\nThe origins of the Impala were first depicted in the comic mini-series \"Supernatural: Origins\", in which John Winchester takes ownership of the car from Mary's uncle after accidentally getting him killed during a hunt. However, fans responded negatively to this, as John is shown with the Impala in the teaser for the pilot episode, which is chronologically set before the comic series. Because of this, the comic was altered for the trade paperback version, with the Impala's true origins later being depicted in the series' fourth season. Having been sent back to 1973 by the angel Castiel, Dean convinces his father to purchase the Impala over a 1964 VW Van. The car's origins were further explored during the season five finale, in which a frame story surrounded the plot of the episode tracking the Impala's history from its manufacture, through several previous owners, up until the present day. According to Chuck Shurley, the brothers have \"made it their own\", and they are shown as kids sticking an army man into an ash tray that remains there (Sam), putting blocks into the heating vents (Dean) and carving their initials into the car. The Impala later proves important when seeing the old army man allows Sam to overpower Lucifer during the final confrontation. According to Chuck, as they have the Impala, the Winchesters never consider themselves truly homeless. In the seventh season, after two Leviathans go on a killing spree in an identical Impala, Sam and Dean are forced to put the car into storage and use various other cars as they are too identifiable with the Impala. Dean later pulls it out of storage to confront Dick and has the demon Meg crash it into Sucrocorp to create a distraction. Starting in season 8, Sam and Dean are once again using the Impala as their car. The Impala was stolen by the angel Gadreel while possessing Sam, once again forcing Dean to use a stolen car, but it was quickly recovered and proved instrumental in tracking down the rogue angel.\n\nAll of the cars used in the show are stock 1967 Chevrolet Impala four door hardtops. They feature Chevrolet small-block engines, recolored interiors, custom seats, and nonfunctioning radios. Other than the one used in the original, all of the Impalas had to be painted black for the series. One of the Impalas used features a detachable roof and doors for up-close shots, and is capable of being separated in half.\n\nBecause Dean and Sam do not get paid for their hunting, the brothers earn their living and pay for their hunting equipment through credit card fraud, poker winnings, and pool hustling. Furthermore, their investigations often put them on the wrong side of the law, as they have desecrated graves, impersonated various officials, and committed breaking and entering. Framed for murder and bank robbery by shapeshifters, Dean has become a highly wanted man, and the brothers are occasionally pursued by various law enforcement officers, most notably FBI agent Victor Henricksen. Because of their wanted status, the brothers often use aliases, usually derived from hard rock musicians, film references, or a meta-reference. However, in the third season's mid-season finale episode \"Jus in Bello\", Sam and Dean are presumed dead in the explosion of the Monument, Colorado Sheriff's county jail, effectively ending the FBI's pursuit of them. By the seventh season, however, the FBI are in pursuit of the brothers again, believing them to be mass-murderers (while the murders were actually committed by Leviathans impersonating the Winchesters). However, with the help of a sheriff who learns the truth and the bodies of their doppelgangers, they are able to fake their deaths again, but have to lie low to prevent discovery, abandoning the Impala, taking on new aliases and using stolen cars to get around. By season 8, the threat of discovery seems to blow over as Sam and Dean return to using the Impala and their rock band aliases which they had been warned made them easy to find. Notably in \"Ask Jeeves\" in season 10, they use their real names and even though a detective is investigating a murder, he doesn't recognize them from \"their\" previous crime sprees.\n\nThe 1836 Colt Paterson revolver, usually referred to simply as \"the Colt\", was made by Samuel Colt, a paranormal hunter. According to legend, anything shot by this gun, using one of its thirteen original bullets, will die, including creatures normally immune to any and all weapons.\n\nJohn Winchester gives it to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after a near-fatal car crash. At the end of the second season, Azazel uses the Colt as the key to open one of the Gates to Hell that Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill Azazel, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's right-hand demon, Crowley, acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes – Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973, and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future – before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are five things in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he is one of them. The Colt is subsequently lost and absent for several years until Mary Winchester retrieves it back from a Prince of Hell, Ramiel.\n\nIt is later revealed due to a causal loop, the Colt went in the possession of Daniel Elkins, the owner of the gun at the beginning of the series, due to the actions of the Winchesters. When the Winchesters travel to 1861, they meet Samuel Colt, from whom Sam gets the Colt, and Dean uses it to kill a phoenix, as they need its ashes. Dean drops the Colt just before being transported back to the present day, where it is presumably retrieved by the saloon owner Elkins, the ancestor of Daniel Elkins.\n\nThe gun used in the series is actually a replica Paterson modified to fire metallic cartridges. The gun was described as being built in 1835, before Colt made firearms, and fires metallic cartridges which were never made to fire in a Colt revolver until 10 years after Samuel Colt's death. On the barrel of the gun is inscribed the Latin phrase \"non-timebo mala\", meaning \"I will fear no evil\". On the grip is a carving of a pentagram, with much of the finish removed to give it an aged appearance. The prop department also has a rubber version of the Colt to be used in fight scenes for pistol-whipping.\n\nRuby possesses a mysterious and presumably magical demon-killing knife, which Kripke refers to as \"a hand-to-hand version of the Colt\". Its handle is made of elk antlers, and the knife has engravings on both sides of the blade, although the symbols are all nonsensical. It has been seen and used many times following its introduction in the third season. Upon being stabbed in a vital area, the demon is almost immediately killed, usually taking the human host with it. The only known survivor is Bobby Singer who stabbed himself with it while fighting off a possession and was left paralyzed as a result. It is unknown if it is effective against other supernatural beings, although it is useless against angels. Furthermore, the higher-ranked demons are resistant or even immune to the effects of the knife. Creator Eric Kripke doubted that how the knife functions would ever be revealed, stating, \"I like to leave some things mysterious. And that's likely to remain mysterious.\" However, the eighth season reveals it to be \"an ancient demon-killing knife of the Kurds\".\n\nSometime in the distant past, God dictated the angel scribe Metatron to write a compendium of tablets known as the Word of God. They cover a variety of subjects, including demons, angels, and leviathans. God then sealed the tablets inside the \"Vault of the Earth\" and even if someone were to find them, only a few chosen humans, the prophets, are able to decipher them. The Leviathan Tablet, which was dug from somewhere in Iran, has an instruction regarding how to kill a leviathan. The Demon Tablet, recovered by Crowley through unknown means, contains an instruction about locking all demons in Hell forever as well as techniques about disposing demons, such as devil's traps, holy water, and demon bombs. The Angel Tablet, stored in one of Lucifer's crypts, has the information on how to make all angels fall from Heaven as well as an incantation to imbue an angel with great power. The Demon Tablet is currently in the possession of Castiel, who has destroyed the Angel Tablet in the ninth season to prevent Metatron from using its powers.\n\nFor centuries, supernatural activity on Earth was logged and observed by the Men of Letters, a secret society dedicated to gathering knowledge and artefacts, occasionally working with elite teams of hunters to eliminate particularly dangerous supernatural threats. This tradition came to an end when Henry Winchester, attending his final initiation rite in 1958, became the sole survivor of the organization when it was attacked by the demon Abaddon, forcing Henry to attempt a desperate escape by using a spell to take himself to 2013, where he met Dean and Sam. Although Henry is killed in the subsequent battle with Abaddon, he is able to pass on information about the Men of Letters to his grandsons, who track down the Men of Letters' secret bunker, which stores all the knowledge and artefacts that the society had gathered over the centuries. After this, Dean and Sam adopt the bunker as a 'home', residing in the bunker when between cases and using its books to carry out further research. They experience an unexpected challenge when the British Men of Letters come to America to try and take control of the local hunters, perceiving the Winchesters as too dangerous, but the Winchesters and a small army of hunters are able to force the British Men of Letters to withdraw after Dean and Sam confirm that the British branch are too brutal for their tastes, such as attempting to immediately kill new werewolf Claire Novak where the Winchesters would prefer to cure if possible, or killing hunter Eileen Leehy just because she accidentally killed a Man of Letters rather than accept that it was an accident.\n\nAfter God and the archangels successfully battled the Darkness to submission at the beginning of creation, God sealed the latter inside a metaphysical cage, whose seal was handed over to Lucifer for safekeeping. However, the Darkness' influence was as such that Lucifer was corrupted by it, eventually becoming the first fallen angel after refusing to honor humans. Lucifer then offered the seal to Cain, which empowered a blade made from the jawbone of a donkey that he used to kill and send his brother, Abel, to Heaven. Whenceforth, the seal was known by the moniker of the Mark of Cain, while the blade was dubbed the First Blade. Wielders of the Mark are corrupted by the Darkness so they would have the lust for power and bloodbath. This power in turn activates the First Blade, otherwise useless when wielded by other people, to become an invincible weapon capable of killing everything, even angels and higher demons. If killed, wielders of the Mark are resurrected as demons, as shown by Dean in the finale of the ninth season. At the start of the series, Cain had thrown the First Blade to the bottom of the Marianas Trench, only to take it back and give it as well as the Mark to Dean as part of the latter's quest to kill Abaddon. However, this gives Dean the attendant problems of the Mark, which slowly corrupts him, as releasing the Mark requires an arduous ritual, and if not transferred to someone else would release the Darkness from her cage.\n\nThe advertisements The WB chose for the show went beyond just commercials and billboards. Before the series debuted, the network placed signs for the show at gas station pumps, and gave out rubber glow-in-the-dark bracelets at New York and Los Angeles movie theaters. Also, coffee cup sleeves revealed the image of a \"terrified woman seemingly pinned to a ceiling\" when heated were distributed to 500 cafes throughout New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The same image was used in special mirrors the network installed in almost 200 nightclubs throughout three cities in order to reach \"young, hip horror fans\". Additional advertisements were also placed in bars, movie theaters, and video game stores, with hundreds of the bars also receiving \"Supernatural\" napkins and coasters.\n\nThe series also has many real-life tie-ins. The urban legend website \"Hellhounds Lair\" featured in the season one episode \"Hell House\" was a real website set up by the show's producers. As a tie-in to the sequel episode \"Ghostfacers\", in which the owners of \"Hellhounds Lair\" create their own \"Ghost Hunters\"-style reality show, The CW set up Ghostfacers.com. The Winchesters later visit this website in the fourth-season episode \"It's a Terrible Life\". Series tie-ins, however, extend beyond the internet. For a time, Dean's cell number—revealed in the first-season episode \"Phantom Traveler\" to be 1–866–907–3235—was a real number, with Jensen Ackles reading the message: \"This is Dean Winchester. If this is an emergency, leave a message. If you are calling about 11–2–83, page me with your coordinates.\" The second-season episode \"Tall Tales\" featured a tie-in to that week's issue of the tabloid newspaper \"Weekly World News\". The February 19 and March 19, 2007, editions of the paper featured exclusive interviews with Sam and Dean, the articles being written by Paul Kupperberg.\n\n\"Supernatural\" has a vast amount of merchandise available, including calendars, T-shirts, shot glasses, temporary tattoos and posters. Inkworks has released trading cards for the show, some cards featuring actors' autographs and swatches from actual costumes used on the series.\n\nThe \"Supernatural Role Playing Game\" (a pen-and-paper role-playing game) was developed by Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd. Originally scheduled for release in October 2007, it was delayed until August 2009. The game uses material from the series, novels, and comics. Additionally, on September 7, 2010, Watertower Music released Supernatural: Original Television Soundtrack – Seasons 1–5. It features 18 original tracks by Supernatural series composers Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. Funko has also released three Pop! form figures of Dean, Sam, and Castiel as of November 21, 2013.\n\nFurther information on the series' mythology and production have been detailed through print. Official companion guides for the first six seasons have been released (, , , , , ), all written by Nicholas Knight and published by Titan Books. Two additional guides written by Alex Irvine, \"The \"Supernatural\" Book of Monsters, Spirits, Demons, and Ghouls\" () and \"John Winchester's Journal\" (), have been published by It Books. Irvine's books function as resource guides that contain illustrations and detailed descriptions of the supernatural creatures the Winchester family has encountered, giving additional background on creatures and mythology featured on the show. Premiering on November 27, 2007, was the Official \"Supernatural\" Magazine. Published by Titan Magazines, it contains series information and exclusive cast and crew interviews. It Books published \"Supernatural: Bobby Singer's Guide to Hunting\" by David Reed on September 6, 2011 (), sharing all the knowledge that the character Bobby Singer had to share about hunting, the Winchesters, and other knowledge he picked up over the years dealing with the elements of the supernatural.\n\nThe series has also developed an expanded universe. Three six-issue comic book mini-series have been published by WildStorm, a company under the DC Comics umbrella. \"\" depicts the early lives of John, Sam, and Dean Winchester, and shows how John became a hunter. \"Supernatural: Rising Son\", \"a dysfunctional family story\", details Dean as he begins following in his father's footsteps. While Kripke was heavily involved with the first series, the writer's strike prevented him from doing so with \"Rising Son\". \"Supernatural: Beginning's End\" deals with \"the definitive events that led to Sam leaving his family to attend Stanford\".\n\nA fourth miniseries, \"Caledonia\", (named \"Supernatural: The Dogs of Edinburgh\", in the UK) by Brian Wood and Grant Bond, deal with Sam Winchester's trip to the United Kingdom during the Stanford years. The first two miniseries were written by Peter Johnson, one of the series co-executive producer, while the third one is by television series writers Andrew Dabb and Daniel Loflin.\n\nSeveral novels based on the series have also been published.\nAn unofficial anthology titled \"In the Hunt: Unauthorized Essays on Supernatural\" () was released on February 10, 2009, by Smart Pop and featured essays covering different aspects of both the series and its fanbase. \"The Mythology of Supernatural: The Signs and Symbols Behind the Popular TV Show\" (), published by Berkley Trade on August 2, 2011, sought to explore the religious and mythological roots of the show. And on October 1, 2011, ECW Press released the book \"TV Goes to Hell: An Unofficial Road Map of Supernatural\" () which explored topics such as folklore, religion, gender and sexuality, comedy, and music through essays from a number of contributors.\n\nThe growing popularity of \"amateur spook-hunters\" Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spangler prompted Kripke to consider a spin-off series for the characters. He discussed the idea of an online venture with actors A. J. Buckley and Travis Wester, and held a successful meeting with studio and network executives. Though Kripke announced their plans to produce \"some new material, either webisodes, potentially cell phone content or basically an off-network \"Ghostfacers\" series\" at the 2008 Comic-Con, the economic downturn delayed production until 2009.\n\nBuckley and Wester, along with Patrick J. Doody and Chris Valenziano, penned the series. They found the format—ten three-minute segments—difficult to manage because each webisode has to work both individually and as part of the overall storyline. However, Wester noted, \"We couldn't get too indulgent, we couldn't delve into long conversations. That helps not only with the storytelling but with the comedy... With drama, it takes time to establish an emotional connection with the characters. With comedy, you can jump right in.\"\n\nThough an initial idea of Kripke's involved the cast searching real haunted houses, the first season instead features the Ghostfacers investigating a haunted theater. The series also stars Brittany Ishibashi as Maggie and Austin Basis as Spruce.\n\nIn August 2011, a webisode was released online in which the Ghostfacers meet Castiel.\n\nOn June 9, 2010, the official Japanese Warner Bros. website announced an anime version of the series titled \"Supernatural: The Animation\" (スーパーナチュラル・ザ・アニメーション), which debuted in Japan in January 2011 and is produced by Japanese anime studio Madhouse. Shigeyuki Miya and Atsuko Ishizuka are co-directors for the series, with Kripke credited as the project creator. Madhouse co-founder Masao Maruyama serves as executive producer, with Naoya Takayama supervising the scripts and Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters. Yūya Uchida and Hiroki Touchi, who voice Sam and Dean for the Japanese dub of the live-action series, reprise their roles.\n\nThe anime's first season consists of 22 half-hour episodes; while the storyline covers the first two seasons of the live-action series, it also includes original content exploring the Winchesters' childhoods and expanding upon secondary characters. Warner Home Video released the first two episodes on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan on January 12, 2011; episodes 3 through 12 shipped on February 2, and the rest on April 6. Warner Home Video released the Blu-ray and DVD box sets of the anime series on July 26, 2011, in North America.\n\nJared Padalecki voices Sam in the English-language version of the series, while Jensen Ackles voices Dean only in the last two episodes for scheduling reasons; Andrew Farrar voices Dean in English for the first 20 episodes.\n\nOn July 22, 2013, The CW announced there was a spin-off of \"Supernatural\" in the works, with the 20th episode of season nine serving as a back-door pilot. On January 29, 2014, it was revealed that the spin-off was to have been titled \"Supernatural: Bloodlines\".\n\nThe backdoor pilot was written by Andrew Dabb and directed by Robert Singer. The series was going to set to explore the \"clashing hunter and monster cultures in Chicago\". The show was not picked up by the CW for the 2014–2015 season. However, the network has remained open to another spin-off of the series.\n\nDuring production of \"Supernatural\"s third season, Kripke stated that the writers sometimes discussed the possibility of a prequel series. Set in the Old West, the spin-off would follow Samuel Colt and a group of hunters.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, it was announced that \"Wayward Sisters\", a spin-off series starring Kim Rhodes as Sheriff Jody Mills, was being developed by \"Supernatural\" writer-producers Andrew Dabb and Robert Berens, along with Robert Singer and Phil Sgriccia. The spin-off debuted as a backdoor pilot during the thirteenth season of \"Supernatural\". In May 2018, it was confirmed that the series was not picked up.\n\nIn 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"Supernatural\" \"exhibits a nonurban white audience pattern\".\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"Supernatural\" on The WB and The CW (some including repeats).\n\nAfter the first four episodes of \"Supernatural\" aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18–34 and 12–34. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 18–49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, \"Gilmore Girls\". \"Supernatural\" had low ratings during its second season, with viewers consisting mainly of teen girls, and the CW trying to attract more male viewers. The show's future was in doubt at the end of the second season. Despite mediocre ratings in the previous year, it was back for a third season. Although its third season's rating were low, it did well with viewers aged 18–49. In this category, it ranked eighth of all returning series broadcast by a major network. The show received an early pickup for its fourth season. The show's ratings increased in its fourth season. The fourth-season premiere aired on September 18, 2008, averaging its highest rating ever since its debut on The CW with 3.96 million viewers, a 33% surge over the season three premiere and a 1.7/5 in adults 18–49, up 42% from one year earlier. On October 16, 2008, the show was watched by 3.06 million viewers, making the lowest rating for the season. On October 30, 2008, the show climbed to its best performance in adults 18–34 (1.4/4), adults 18–49 (1.5/4) and total viewers (3.6mil) since its season premiere on September 18, 2008. For the fifth-season premiere, viewership increased by 6% in women 18–34 (1.7/5) over the fourth-season premiere. However, taking DVR viewings into account with new Live-Plus 7 Day data, total viewership for the premiere increased 38%, with women 18–34 increasing by 35% and adults 18–34 by 47%.\n\nEarly reception to the series was generally mixed, but has grown more favorable reviews from critics as it progressed.\n\nThe first season received a Metacritic score of 59 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 69% approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 6.8/10 based on 13 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Despite some too-hip dialogue and familiar thematic elements, \"Supernatural\"'s vigilante brothers manage to stir up some legitimate scares.\" Subsequent seasons have also enjoyed positive reviews on the site. Tanner Stransky of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the first season a B, saying the show \"comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series\", but that \"Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack\". Jeff Swindoll of \"Monsters and Critics\" \"really liked\" the first season for its \"horrific content and the brotherly chemistry between its two stars\". He also noted that the season finished \"with one bang of a cliffhanger\". Swindoll enjoyed the second season, too, saying that it \"still works thanks to the brotherly chemistry between Padalecki and Ackles\" and noted the second season focused more on the show's mythology.\n\nSwindoll also liked the third season, saying \"Eric Kripke must've sold his soul to the devil so that the show wouldn't suffer a third season slump.\" He also enjoyed the moments featuring Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), likening him to the character Cooter from \"Dukes of Hazzard\". However, Daniel Bettridge of \"Den of Geek\" believed that the writer's strike hindered the season, with many issues being left unresolved and the finale feeling \"a little rushed\". He also felt that new characters Ruby (Katie Cassidy) and Bela (Lauren Cohan) were \"disappointingly unexplored and ineffectively used\". While Diana Steenbergen of IGN liked that there was a season-long story arc with Dean's demonic deal, she believed that viewers would know that the pact would not be resolved until the finale, making the self-enclosed episodes feel like they are \"treading water, waiting for the main storyline to resume\". In 2008, AOL TV placed the show on its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.\n\nAnother \"Monsters and Critics\" reviewer, June L., gave the fourth season a positive review, saying the show \"remains intriguing and entertaining, giving viewers much to ponder in terms of the philosophical analysis of the nature of good and evil.\" Steenbergen felt that the series made a transition from a \"pretty good show to being a pretty great show\". She praised Misha Collins for his portrayal of the angel Castiel, and felt that the interactions between Dean and Castiel were \"one of the highlights of the season\". Before the premiere of the fifth season, \"Rolling Stone\" listed the series as one of \"The 50 Best Reasons to Watch TV\", citing Sam and Dean Winchester as the \"Bo and Luke Duke of demon hunting\".\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\"'s Maureen Ryan named \"Supernatural\" among the top ten shows of 2009, stating that the \"thoughtfully crafted show got bolder and more creative in 2009, coming up with hilarious and innovative episodes and taking risks with its storytelling.\" Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" also named the series on his top ten list for the year: \"\"Supernatural\" is currently among the wildest and most entertaining series in prime time.\" In 2010, AOL TV ranked \"Supernatural\" fourth of the Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time, noting that the show had been compared to \"The X-Files\" early in its run before \"distinguishing itself as a unique, unpredictable and addictive series that not only features monsters, magic and Lucifer himself, but also boasts a dynamic duo arguably better at the banter than Mulder and Scully -- Sam and Dean Winchester\".\n\nIn 2012, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed the show at No. 19 in the \"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years\", saying, \"\"Supernatural\" began with a pretty straightforward premise – hot guys kill spooky things – but it didn't stay that way for long. The characters have literally been to hell and back, and along the way, they have woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). \"Supernatural\" has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary.\" The show has a broad demographic base and is more popular in Russia than the US.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, the cable television network TNT began airing reruns of \"Supernatural\". In Canada, the series has been syndicated on Space, Dusk, ABC Spark, M3, and E!.\n\nBeing a cult series, \"Supernatural\" has garnered a dedicated fanbase. They are active online, and many have written fanfiction stories about the show, ranging from Wincest (the romantic pairing of brothers Dean and Sam Winchester) to Destiel (the romantic pairing of Dean Winchester and Castiel) to various other character pairings. The writers have referenced this several times in the series, including the 200th episode, which makes references to Wincest, Destiel, and Sastiel (the romantic pairing of Sam Winchester and Castiel).\n\nThe first fan conventions dedicated to \"Supernatural\" took place in Nashville, Tennessee, in October 2006 and in London in May 2007, and conventions have since expanded through to Germany and throughout the United States. The series' stars and large guest cast make appearances, with fans from the United States, Europe, China, and Australia attending.\n\nBefore the debut of the series' fifth season, in which Lucifer is finally freed from his imprisonment, fans attempted to promote the show through Twitter. Enough fans posted the hash tag \"#LuciferIsComing\" that it made it into \"trending topics\" – a list depicting words and phrases posted with the highest frequency on the website. However, Twitter users who were unaware of the fans' intentions responded with numerous posts of \"#GodIsHere\", and the topic was blocked from Twitter's trending topics after complaints. Actor Misha Collins, who portrays Castiel in the series, tried to continue the campaign by requesting that fans post \"#PDiddyIsScaredOfHisTV\", rapper P. Diddy being the one whom many fans believe to be the instigator of the initial backlash. However, after an hour, this attempt to trend the topic was also stymied by Twitter.\n\nIn honor of the series' season 14 renewal, Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Texas declared June 23, 2018 as \"\"Supernatural\" Day\" in the city, as the show's stars Ackles and Padalecki are both Austin residents. The day, which coincided with the duo participating in local charity events, also recognized \"Supernatural\" for, as the declaration proclaimed, \"bringing the best fans in the world\" to the city.\n\n"}
{"id": "40925619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40925619", "title": "Tanacu exorcism", "text": "Tanacu exorcism\n\nThe Tanacu exorcism was a case in which Maricica Irina Cornici, a mentally ill nun at the Romanian Orthodox Church monastery of Tanacu in Vaslui County, Romania, was killed during an exorcism led by priest Daniel Petre Corogeanu and four Orthodox Christian nuns who were a part of the Order of the Holy Trinity. The case was widely publicized in the Romanian media and, following a lengthy trial, the priest was sentenced on appeal to 7 years, one nun to 6 years and the other three nuns to 5 years. They were all found guilty of deprivation of liberty resulting in the victim's death. They received a relatively lenient sentence, compared to the original desire of the prosecution who sought life imprisonment for the priest. Many of Tanacu's residents, including Cornici's brother, believed her to have suffered from demonic possession. The exorcism took place in June 2005.\n\nThe victim, Maricica Irina Cornici, came from a disadvantaged background, and spent part of her childhood in a Romanian orphanage. In January 2005, the 23-year-old moved to the Tanacu monastery. Tanacu monastery was in Vaslui County, one of the poorest areas of Romania. Cornici was born into a broken family, and, following her father's suicide, she and her brother grew up in an orphanage. When she was 19, she worked as a nanny in Germany, and then for a family in Banat. A friend of hers from the orphanage became a nun at the Tanacu monastery and she encouraged her to also become a nun.\n\nSoon after, she began giggling during March and, by April, her mental state deteriorated and the doctors at the local psychiatric hospital diagnosed her disease as schizophrenia. After a two-week treatment, they released her into the care of the monastery. Cornici's friends also stated that she never exhibited any signs of mental illness. Her brother testified that he was with her when he saw Satan go \"into her\" and also maintained that she suffered from demonic possession.\n\nDaniel Petre Corogeanu was the 29-year-old priest of the monastery. A decade before the events, he was a football player in Vaslui, his home town. He began following religious studies at the Iași University after he could not secure admission in Bucharest University, where he wanted to study sports or law. A year later, a businessman from his home town recruited him to help build a monastery in the hills near the city. He was ordained by the local bishop, who expected that he would continue his studies. Nevertheless, he gave up his university education in order to devote himself to running the monastery. \n\nIn 2003, Father Corogeanu had some disputes with the diocese. When the bishop came to read him the canon law, he argued that the rules were \"19th century innovations\" made by the Freemasonry. The original community of monks dissolved as they left to become priests and, instead, Corogeanu organized a community of nuns, who were, according to all accounts, \"completely devout to him\".\n\nFather Corogeanu thought that it was not just a mental illness, but rather that Cornici was possessed by Satan. He would later claim that \"you can't take the Devil out of people with pills\" and that an exorcism was necessary.\n\nIn order to restrain her from violent movements including those causing her to hit herself, the nuns bound her hands and feet and locked her in her room as they participated in the liturgy commemorating the Ascension of Jesus. A few days later, they chained her to a cross with her arms stretched and carried her into the church so that they could anoint her. According to Sister Nicoleta Arcalianu, Cornici had been restrained in the same manner that others who were demonically possessed were; Sister Arcalianu stated that had Cornici not been restrained, she \"could have either killed herself or killed someone else\". With regard to Cornici, Sister Arcalianu stated that \"Irina knew that she was possessed by evil spirits because she was begging us to tie her up and help her.\"\n\nHer wrists and forehead were then anointed with holy oil and she was kept in the church for three days. They put a towel into her mouth to stop her from cursing and prayed to cast out the Devil as they wet her lips with holy water. \n\nCornici was then moved to her room and untied. She was, according to Father Corogeanu, \"cured\". She was later given bread and tea and fainted after eating. The nuns could not arouse her and sensed that her pulse was weak and as a result they called an ambulance. While in the ambulance, she was administered six doses of adrenaline. By the time she reached the hospital, she was dead.\n\nThe police were notified by the doctors at the hospital, who noticed the marks left on her wrists and ankles by the chains. The 2005 autopsy claimed that she had died of dehydration, exhaustion and a lack of oxygen. \n\nFather Corogeanu and the four nuns who helped him were charged with murder and depriving a person of liberty. Prosecutors sought a life sentence for Corogeanu, but he was sentenced in 2007 to 14 years in prison, while the nuns (Nicoleta Arcalianu, Adina Cepraga, Elena Otel and Simona Bardanas) were sentenced to between 5 and 8 years. Many individuals were present in the courtroom to support Father Corogeanu and were distraught at the pronouncement of the verdict. The Court of Appeals reduced his sentence to 7 years. The nuns also had their punishments reduced to 6 years (one nun) and 5 years (three nuns). The priests and the nuns were all found guilty of deprivation of liberty resulting in the victim's death.\n\nCorogeanu was freed on parole in November 2011 after serving two-thirds of his punishment. The Romanian Orthodox Church closed down the monastery and had Corogeanu defrocked.\n\nThere is still controversy about the cause of death. Coroner Dan Gheorghiu, who was hired by Corogeanu's lawyer, argues that the cause of death was actually due to an overdose of adrenaline given in the ambulance: \"'I was part of the team who handled the exhumation of the nun's body. ...It was concluded that the woman died of an overdose of adrenaline. Don't ask me, I don't know why the judges did not take that into account.\" Fr. Corogeanu stated that \"My biggest mistake was that I called the ambulance when I saw she was not moving. I think she died because the medics who came with the ambulance tried to resuscitate her by giving her too much adrenaline. Had I not called the ambulance, she would have been well now.\"\n\nIn Tanacu, many people continue to maintain that Cornici was indeed possessed, rather than mentally ill, and that Corogeanu did his best to help her. Veronica Tomulescu stated that \"It's not as if they actually killed her. They didn't stab her or shoot her. They took her to the hospital alive.\"\n\nThe 2012 movie \"Beyond the Hills\" directed by Cristian Mungiu was based on the novels written by Tatiana Niculescu Bran and inspired by the Tanacu case. \"The Crucifixion\", released in 2017, is also based on Tanacu exorcism.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298706", "title": "Tonal (mythology)", "text": "Tonal (mythology)\n\nTonal (To nal) is a concept within the study of Mesoamerican religion, myth, folklore and anthropology. It refers to the belief found in many indigenous Mesoamerican cultures that a person upon being born acquires a close spiritual link to an animal, a link that lasts throughout the lives of both creatures. The person shows signs of whatever the animals situation in signs include scratches and bruises if the animals get in fights of illness if the animal is ill.It is in this way similar to the concept of Totem.\n\nThe word comes from the Nahuatl word \"tonalli\" (to nal li), meaning \"day\" or \"daysign\". In the Aztec belief system the day of a person's birth calculated in the Tonalpohualli would determine the nature of the person – each day was associated with an animal which could have a strong or weak aspect. The person born on the day of for example \"the dog\" would then have the strong or weak aspect of the dog. In Nahuatl the word Tonalli was used to refer both to a day and to the animal related to that day. In Mayan belief the concept of an animal companion of a person was referred to as \"Way\". The modern Mixe people refer to it as \"Ts'ok\" (Lipp 1991). The Jakaltek Maya people of Concepcion Huista, Guatemala call it \"yixomal ispiẍan nax,\" meaning \"soul bearer\".\n\nThe study of tonalism was initiated by noted archaeologist, linguist and ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton who published a treatise called \"Nagualism: A Study in Native-American Folklore and History\" which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced nagualism in Mexico in 1894. He identified the different beliefs associated with tonalism in some modern Mexican communities such as the Mixe, the Nahuas, the Zapotecs and Mixtecs.\n\n\n"}

On 19 July 1997 Vadim Stanislavovich Kazakov from Kaluga's community was elected as the leader of the USC SNB. On 21 July 2011 Kazakov resigned and Maksim Ionov became his successor through a vote held by the \"veche\" (assembly) on 23 July.\n\nAnnually, on Perun's Day (20 July) the \"All-Slavic Veche\" takes place in Kaluga. The assembly deals with issues including the further widening of the organisation, the cooperation with other organisations, and also the nominations of the chief and of the high priesthood. Hundreds of representatives of many Slavic communities scattered throughout Russia come to the yearly \"veche\".\n\nIn April 2011, the USC SNB bought a 4,77-hectares plot of land just five kilometres away from the city of Kaluga, on the left bank of the river Kaluzhka, located in the village of Krasotinka, with the purpose of building a temple.\n\nIn 2014, the USC SNB was officially registered by the government of Russia as an interregional organisation for the development of Slavic culture.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the day of summer solstice, the Temple of the Fire of Svarozich (Храм Огня Сварожича) was officially opened in the village of Krasotinka.\n\nThe union claims to represent Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery), that is to say the revival of historical Slavic religion, upon which indigenous Slavic customs and traditions rely. The organisation aims at the consolidation of Slavic Native Faith communities across the different Slavic states, as well as the cooperation with non-Slavic modern Pagan organisations in Europe, the United States and Canada.\n\nThe USC SNF requires believers in Slavic Native Faith to be genealogically Slavs.\n\n\nSome organisations branched out of the Union of Slavic Native Faith Communities due to ideological differences. The original Obninsk and Moscow communities left the USC SNB in 2002, on the occasion of the Bittsa Accord, establishing the Circle of Pagan Tradition (CPT).\n\nIn 2009, the USC SNB, the CPT and the Circle of Veles issued a joint statement condemning Ynglism. In 2012 the same three organisations signed an \"Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests\", which defined common criteria for the ordination of Slavic Native Faith's priesthood.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3503653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3503653", "title": "Western Ganga dynasty", "text": "Western Ganga dynasty\n\nWestern Ganga was an important ruling dynasty of ancient Karnataka in India which lasted from about 350 to 1000 CE. They are known as 'Western Gangas' to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over Kalinga (modern Odisha). The general belief is that the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the Pallava empire in South India, a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of Samudra Gupta. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from Kolar and later, moving their capital to Talakadu on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district.\n\nAfter the rise of the imperial Chalukyas of Badami, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchi. The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 CE as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.\n\nThough territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. Chavundaraya's writing, \"Chavundaraya Purana\" of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from religion to elephant management.\n\nMultiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a northern origin, while theories based on epigraphy suggest a southern origin. Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan (prior to their rise to power) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka, the Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu or of the southern districts of modern Andhra Pradesh. These regions encompass an area of the southern Deccan where the three modern states merge geographically. It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the northern king Samudra Gupta prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of Mysore, Hassan Chamarajanagar, Tumkur, Kolar, Mandya and Bangalore in Karnataka state. At times, they also controlled some areas in modern Tamil Nadu (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and Andhra Pradesh (Ananthpur region starting from the middle of the 5th century). The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarma Madhava who made Kolar his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years.\n\nBy the time of Harivarma in 390, the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with Talakad as their capital. Their move from the early capital Kolar may have been a strategic one with the intention of containing the growing Kadamba power. By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu, Sendraka (modern Chikkamagaluru and Belur), Punnata and Pannada regions (comprising modern Heggadadevanakote and Nanjangud) in modern Karnataka. In 529, King Durvinita ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father, King Avinita. Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle, the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father-in-law, Durvinita. From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions (northern Tamil Nadu) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully. Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings, Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music, dance, ayurveda and taming wild elephants. Some inscriptions sing paeans to him by comparing him to Yudhishthira and Manu – figures from Hindu mythology known for their wisdom and fairness.\n\nPolitically, the Gangas were feudatories and close allies who also shared matrimonial relations with the Chalukyas. This is attested by inscriptions which describe their joint campaigns against their arch enemy, the Pallavas of Kanchi. From the year 725 onwards, the Gangavadi territories came to be called as the \"Gangavadi-96000\" (\"Shannavati Sahasra Vishaya\") comprising the eastern and western provinces of modern south Karnataka. King Sripurusha fought the Pallava King Nandivarman Pallavamalla successfully, bringing Penkulikottai in north Arcot under his control temporarily for which he earned the title \"Permanadi\". A contest with the Pandyas of Madurai over control of Kongu region ended in a Ganga defeat, but a matrimony between a Ganga princess and Rajasimha Pandya's son brought peace helping the Gangas retain control over the contested region.\n\nIn 753, when the Rashtrakutas replaced the Badami Chalukyas as the dominant force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century. King Shivamara II is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta Dhruva Dharavarsha, his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta Govinda III and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla. Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga. The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas, a position they maintained till the end of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta.\n\nAfter an uneventful period, Butuga II ascended the throne in 938 with the help of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha III (whose daughter he married). He helped the Rashtrakutas win decisive victories in Tamilakam in the battle of Takkolam against the Chola Dynasty. With this victory, the Rashtrakutas took control of modern northern Tamil Nadu. In return for their valour, the Gangas were awarded extensive territories in the Tungabhadra river valley. King Marasimha II who came to power in 963 aided the Rashtrakutas in victories against the Gurjara Pratihara King Lalla and the Paramara kings of Malwa in Central India. Chavundaraya, a minister in the Western Ganga court was a valiant commander, able administrator and an accomplished poet in Kannada and Sanskrit. He served King Marasimha II and his successors ably and helped King Rachamalla IV suppress a civil war in 975. Towards the end of the 10th century, the Rashtrakutas had been supplanted by the Western Chalukya Empire in Manyakheta. In the south, the Chola Dynasty who were seeing a resurgence of power under Rajaraja Chola I conquered Gangavadi around the year 1000, bringing the Western Ganga dynasty to an end. Thereafter, large areas of south Karnataka region came under Chola control for about a century.\n\nThe Western Ganga administration was influenced by principles stated in the ancient text \"arthashastra\". The \"praje gavundas\" mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities similar to those of the village elders (\"gramavriddhas\") mentioned by Kautilya. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked. The kingdom was divided into \"Rashtra\" (district) and further into \"Visaya\" (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and \"Desa\". From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term \"Visaya\" was replaced by the Kannada term \"Nadu\". Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000, with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages included in that territory.\n\nInscriptions have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister (\"sarvadhikari\"), treasurer (\"shribhandari\"), foreign minister (\"sandhivirgrahi\") and chief minister (\"mahapradhana\"). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander (\"dandanayaka\"). Other designations were royal steward (\"manevergade\"), master of robes (\"mahapasayita\"), commander of elephant corps (\"gajasahani\"), commander of cavalry (\"thuragasahani\") etc. In the royal house, \"Niyogis\" oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewellery etc. and the \"Padiyara\" were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.\n\nOfficials at the local level were the \"pergade\", \"nadabova\", \"nalagamiga\", \"prabhu\" and \"gavunda\". The \"pergades\" were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The \"pergades\" dealing with the royal household were called \"manepergade\" (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called \"Sunka vergades\". The \"nadabovas\" were accountants and tax collectors at the \"Nadu\" level and sometimes functioned as scribes. The \"nalagamigas\" were officers who organized and maintained defence at the \"Nadu\" level. The \"prabhu\" constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries. The \"gavundas\" who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required.\n\nInscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (\"kote\") if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included was the type of soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets (\"palli\") belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (\"bedapalli\"). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title \"arasa\". The \"arasas\" were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The \"velavali\" who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (\"vele\"). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the \"velavali\" were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.\n\nThe Gangavadi region consisted of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom and pepper and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds and it was also the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (\"adeka totta\"), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (\"vara vana\") were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (\"Katta\"). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.\n\nSoil types mentioned in records are black soil (\"Karimaniya\") in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (\"Kebbayya mannu\") Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called \"kalani\", \"galde\", \"nir mannu\" or \"nir panya\" and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water. The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms \"gosahasra\" (a thousand cows), \"gasara\" (owner of cows), \"gosasi\" (donor of cows), \"goyiti\" (cowherdess), \"gosasa\" (protector of cows) attest to this. Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this. Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (\"pendir-udeyulcal\"), abduction of women by \"bedas\" (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.\n\nLands that were exempt from taxes were called \"manya\" and sometimes consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty were called \"bilavritti\" or \"kalnad\". When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called \"Talavritti\". Some types of taxes on income were \"kara\" or \"anthakara\" (internal taxes), \"utkota\" (gifts due to the king), \"hiranya\" (cash payments) and \"sulika\" (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.\n\n\"Siddhaya\" was a local tax levied on agriculture and \"pottondi\" was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, \"pottondi\" also meant 1/10, \"aydalavi\" meant 1/5 and \"elalavi\" meant 1/7. \"Mannadare\" literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (\"Kurimbadere\") payable to the chief of shepherds. \"Bhaga\" meant a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as \"Kirudere\" (due to the landlords) and \"samathadere\" (raised by the army officers or \"samantha\") are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles. \"Bittuvatta\" or \"niravari\" taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.\n\nThe Western Gangas gave patronage to all the major religions of the time; Jainism and the Hindu sects of Shaivism, Vedic Brahminism and Vaishnavism. However scholars have argued that not all Gangas kings may have given equal priority to all the faiths. Some historians believe that the Gangas were ardent Jains. However, inscriptions contradict this by providing references to \"kalamukhas\" (staunch Shaiva ascetics), \"pasupatas\" and \"lokayatas\" (followers of \"Pasupatha\" doctrine) who flourished in Gangavadi, indicating that Shaivism was also popular. King Madhava and Harivarma were devoted to cows and brahmins, King Vishnugopa was a devout Vaishnava, Madhava III's and Avinita's inscriptions describe lavish endowments to Jain orders and temples and King Durvinita performed Vedic sacrifices prompting historians to claim he was a Hindu.\n\nJainism became popular in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I constructed numerous Jain \"basadis\". King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which is evident from the construction of the Gommateshwara monolith. Jains worshipped the twenty four \"tirthankars\" (\"Jinas\") whose images were consecrated in their temples. The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of \"Tirthankar Adinatha\" (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). The worship of subordinate deities such as \"yaksa\" and \"yaksi\", earlier considered as mere attendants of the \"tirthankars\" was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.\n\nVedic Brahminism was popular in the 6th and 7th centuries when inscriptions refer to grants made to \"Srotriya\" Brahmins. These inscriptions also describe the \"gotra\" (lineage) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as \"asvamedha\" (horse sacrifice) and \"hiranyagarbha\". Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship; rituals performed by the brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society to the level of wealthy landowners. Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause. Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the \"Narayanaswami\" temples at Nanjangud, Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district. The deity Vishnu was depicted with four arms holding a conch (\"sanka\"), discus (\"cakra\"), mace (\"gada\") and lotus (\"padma\").\n\nFrom the beginning of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society; the landed elite, landlords, assemblies (\"samaya\"), schools of learning (\"aghraharas\") and minor ruling families such as the Bana, Nolamba and Chalukya clans. The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva \"linga\" (phallus) in the sanctum sanctorum along with images of the mother goddess, Surya (Sun god) and Nandi (a bull and attendant of Shiva) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum. The \"linga\" was man made and in some cases had etchings of Ganapati (son of Shiva) and Parvati (consort and wife of Shiva) on it. Due to the vigorous efforts of priests and ascetics, Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places such as Nandi Hills, Avani and Hebbata in modern Kolar district.\n\nThe Western Ganga society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi. Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of \"nalgavunda\" (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of a fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.\n\nThe devadasi system (\"sule\" or courtesan) in temples was prevalent and was modelled after the structures in the royal palace. Contemporaneous literature such a \"Vaddaradhane\" makes a mention of the chief queen (\"Dharani Mahadevi\") accompanied by lower ranking queens (\"arasiyargal\") and courtesans of the women's royal quarter (\"pendarasada suleyargal\"). Some of the courtesans and concubines employed in the harem of the kings and chieftains were well respected, examples being Nandavva at whose instance a local chief made land grant to a Jain temple. Education in the royal family was closely supervised and included such subjects as political science, elephant and horse riding, archery, medicine, poetry, grammar, drama, literature, dance, singing and use of musical instruments. Brahmins enjoyed an influential position in society and were exempt from certain taxes and customs due on land. In turn they managed public affairs such as teaching, local judiciary, functioned as trustees and bankers, managed schools, temples, irrigation tanks, rest houses, collected taxes due from villages and raised money from public subscriptions.\n\nBy virtue of a Hindu belief that killing of a brahmin (\"Bramhatya\") was a sin, capital punishment was not applicable to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (\"satkshatriya\") were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. if there were no male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as \"Dharmadeya\" (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, \"Svayamvara\" marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing hero stones (\"virkal\") were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.\n\nThe presence of numerous \"Mahasatikals\" (or \"Mastikal\" – hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty. Ritual death by \"sallekhana\" and by \"jalasamadhi\" (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (\"honnasara\" and \"honnagala sara\"), bracelets (\"Kaduga\") and wristlets (\"Kaftkina\"). Women wore a nose jewel (\"bottu\"), nose ring (\"mugutti\"), bangles (\"bale\" or \"kankana\") and various types of necklaces (\"honna gante sara\" and \"kati sutra\"). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as \"agraharas\", \"ghatikas\", \"brahmapura\" or \"matha\". Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places.\n\nThe Western Ganga rule was a period of brisk literary activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, \"Chavundaraya Purana\" (or \"Trishashtilakshana mahapurana\") of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, \"Adipurana\" and \"Uttarapurana\" which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain \"Tirthankar\", twelve \"Chakravartis\", nine \"Balabhadras\", nine \"Narayanas\" and nine \"Pratinarayanas\".\n\nThe earliest postulated Kannada writer from this dynasty is King Durvinita of the 6th century. Kavirajamarga of 850 CE, refers to a Durvinita as an early writer of Kannada prose. Around 900 CE, Gunavarma I authored the Kannada works, \"Shudraka\" and \"Harivamsha\". His writings are considered extinct but references to these writings are found in later years. He is known to have been patronised by King Ereganga Neetimarga II. In \"Shudraka\", he has favourably compared his patron to King Shudraka of ancient times. The great Kannada poet Ranna was patronised by Chavundaraya in his early literary days. Ranna's classic \"Parashurama charite\" is considered a eulogy of his patron who held such titles as \"Samara Parashurama\".\n\nNagavarma I, a brahmin scholar who came from Vengi in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote \"Chandombudhi\" (ocean of prosody) addressed to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in prosody. He also wrote one of the earliest available romance classics in Kannada called \"Karnataka Kadambari\" in sweet and flowing \"champu\" (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics. \"Gajashtaka\" (hundred verses on elephants), a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct. Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.\n\nIn an age of classical Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise \"Dattaka Sutravritti\" which was based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of \"Vaddakatha\", a commentary on Pāṇini's grammar called \"Sabdavathara\" and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called \"Kiratarjunneya\" by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita. King Shivamara II is known to have written \"Gajamata Kalpana\". Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored \"Raghavapandaviya\", a narration of the stories of Rama and the Pandavas simultaneously through puns. \"Gayachintamani\" and \"Kshatrachudamini\" which were based on poet Bana's work \"Kadambari\" were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style. and Chavundaraya wrote \"Charitarasara\".\n\nThe Western Ganga style of architecture was influenced by the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped \"Vimana\" of the shrine with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.\n\nThe monolith of Gomateshwara commissioned by Chavundaraya is considered the high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is tall with the face measuring . With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka. It is the largest monolithic statue in the world. Their free standing pillars called \"Mahasthambha\" or \"Bhrahmasthambha\" are also considered unique, examples of which are the Brahmadeva pillar and Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar. At the top of the pillar whose shaft (cylindrical or octagonal) is decorated with creepers and other floral motifs is the seated \"Brahma\" and the base of the pillar normally has engravings of important Jain personalities and inscriptions.\n\nOther important contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (\"talas\") ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) are used at the top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 are the most important monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by \"torana\" (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (\"gandharva\") and imaginary monsters (\"makara\") ridden by \"Yaksas\" (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.\n\nThe Gangas built many Hindu temples with impressive Dravidian gopuras containing stucco figures from the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the \"mantapa\" (hall) along with \"saptamatrika\" carvings (seven heavenly mothers). Some well known examples are the Arakeshvara Temple at Hole Alur, Kapileswara temple at Manne, Kolaramma temple at Kolar, Rameshvara temple at Narasamangala, Nagareshvara temple at Begur and the Kallesvara temple at Aralaguppe. At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple. Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common, Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes (slab of stone with decorative sculptures) illustrating episodes from the epics and puranas. Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the number of \"virgal\" (hero stones) they have left behind; memorials containing sculptural details in relief of war scenes, Hindu deities, \"saptamatrikas\", Jain tirthankars and ritual death (such as the Doddahundi hero stone).\n\nThe Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were \"brahmadeya\" grants (grants to Brahmin temples). In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith. Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a \"Bengaluru\" war. This is in \"Hale Kannada\" (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends, the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend \"Bhadr\", a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the \"pagoda\" (weighing 52 grains), the \"fanam\" weighting one tenth or one half of the \"pagoda\" and the quarter \"fanams\".\n\nThe template below shows the Timeline of Karnataka.

{"id": "17098750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17098750", "title": "Witchcraft accusations against children", "text": "Witchcraft accusations against children\n\nChildren have been accused of witchcraft, both historically and in contemporary times, in societies that harbour beliefs about the existence of witches and black magic.\n\nIn sixteenth-century Europe, older children sometimes comprised a special category of witch hunters, bringing accusations of witchcraft against adults. In 1525, the traveling judge in the Navarrese witch hunt utilized two \"girl witches\" whom he felt would be able to identify other witches. He hung about forty of these \"witches\" based on the testimony of the two girls.\n\nChild witch hunters sometimes accused their family members of being witches.\n\nThe most renowned trials caused by child accusations occurred in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. Children were viewed as having an important role in convicting witches, due to their being able to identify people impulsively. Children who made such false allegations often directed them at adults with whom they had strained relationships such as teachers or puritanical neighbors.\n\nBy the start of the seventeenth century, many children were being punished and put in prison for taking part in witchcraft. This usually occurred because of their alleged participation in Sabbats. It was a common belief that witches' children inherited witchcraft from their parents. It was often the practice to charge a whole family of witchcraft, even if only one individual was suspected. Witches who confessed often claimed that they learned witchcraft from a parent.\n\nPierre de Lancre and Francesco Maria Guazzo believed that it was enough proof of a witch's guilt if they had parents who were witches. They believed witch parents introduced the children to Satan, took the children to Sabbats, married children to demons, inspired the children to have sex with Satan(devil) or had sex with Satan with the child present. Many times the child accused of witchcraft, due to being shunned, threatened community members, thereby enforcing their beliefs that the child was a witch.\n\nThere are several cases of witchcraft in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that involved children as witches. In Sweden in 1669 a large number of children were included in a witch hunt and in Würzburg as in Salem in 1692, children were the focus of witch hunts. In Augsberg, beginning in 1723 an investigation into twenty children between the ages of six and sixteen resulted in them being arrested for witchcraft. They were held for a year in solitary confinement before being transferred to a hospital. The last child was freed in 1729.\n\nOne example of a child-witch narrative in Germany is of a seven-year-old girl named Brigitta Horner. In 1639, Brigitta claimed to be a witch and that she had participated in witch's Sabbats where the Devil was present. Brigitta claimed to have been baptized in the name of the Devil instead of God. The pastor who baptized Brigitta was married to her grandmother who then taught her the arts of witchcraft.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, research by Dr Leo Ruickbie showed that the problem of child witchcraft accusations was spreading from Africa to countries with African immigrant populations. In some cases this has led to ritualized abuse and even murder. This was evident in the high-profile case of Kristy Bamu in 2010.\n\nIn Nigeria, some African Pentecostal pastors have incorporated African witchcraft beliefs into their brands of Christianity resulting in a campaign of violence against young Nigerians. Children and babies branded as evil are being mistreated, abandoned,\nand even murdered. The preachers make money out of the fear providing costly exorcism services of their parents and their communities.\n\nIn Angola, many orphaned children are accused of witchcraft and demonic possession by relatives in order to justify not providing for them. Various methods are employed: starvation, beating, unknown substances rubbed into their eyes or being chained or tied up.\n\nIn Congo, it is estimated that there are 25,000 homeless children living on the streets of the capital city. Of these, 60% were expelled from their homes because of allegations of witchcraft. Accusations of witchcraft is the only justifiable reason for the refusal to house a family member, no matter how distant the relation.\n\nIn Gambia, about 1,000 people accused of being witches were locked in detention centers in March 2009. They were forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIn the Nigerian states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River about 15,000 children were branded as witches and most of them end up abandoned and abused on the streets. A documentary aired on Channel 4 and BBC, \"Saving Africa's Witch Children\", shows the work of Gary Foxcroft and Stepping Stones Nigeria in addressing these abuses.\n\nAccording to a disputable empiric construction, in Sierra Leone sick infants tend to have better survival-rates due to witchhunts: \"the effect of the witch cleansing probably lasts for years in the sense that mothers are predisposed to tend their babies with more hopefulness and real concern. Therefore many babies who, before the arrival of the witchfinder, might have been saved if the mothers had had the heart and will to stop at nothing to tend their babies, will now survive precisely because they will receive the best attention, as the mothers now believe that the remaining children are free of witchcraft. So there is a reduction in the infant mortality rate in the years immediately following the witchcleansing movement\".\n\nWhile crisis is generally accepted as a factor in the DRC and Nigeria, its impact and ramifications are in discussion by African and European scholars. According to Riedel, two major Nollywood films depicting children as witches don't show any economic stress and play in a middle-class environment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55235409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55235409", "title": "Yadnya Kasada", "text": "Yadnya Kasada\n\nYadnya Kasada, also popularly known as \"Kesodo\" is a festival of Tenggerese people, who are an ethnic group of Javanese, live in Tengger mountains (Mount Bromo) in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in eastern part of Java island in Indonesia.\nThe origin of this festival is a legend that dates back to the Majapahit kingdom, during the reign of King Brawijaya. At the fall of the Majapahit empire the princess of the kingdom and her husband Roro Anteng took refuge in the upper slopes of Mount Bromo. The couple and their followers later settled in the Tengger mountains and ruled the region jointly under the title Purbawisesa Mangkurat Ing Tengger. Under their leadership Tenngerese people settled and began to flourish, but the couple were not happy as they remained childless after many years of marriage. Therefore, they meditated atop Mount Bromo, beseeching the mountain gods for assistance. The gods granted them 24 children on the condition that the 25th child must be thrown into the volcano as human sacrifice. The gods’ request was observed, and so the tradition of offering sacrifices thrown into the volcano to appease the deities continues until today, but, of course, with no sacrifices of humans. Instead, today chickens, goats and vegetables are thrown into the crater as sacrifice.\n\nThe gods’ request was observed, and so the tradition of offering sacrifices thrown into the volcano to appease the deities continues until today, but, of course, with no sacrifices of humans.
