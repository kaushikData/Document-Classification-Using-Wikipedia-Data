A. C. de la Rive recanted much of what he wrote about Freemasonry, since he used the writings and correspondence of Taxil as his source for the 'official documents of the sect', especially in his book, \"Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry\".\n\nHis published works have been quoted and cited by many conspiracy theorists, anti-Masons, and mystics in the US and elsewhere, such as Edith Starr Miller and William Guy Carr. de la Rive is also quoted and cited by many Masonic historians, scholarly publications, and websites in the US and worldwide, including S. Brent Morris, PhD, the University of Pennsylvania, and Brigham Young University.\n\nIn the US, when de la Rive's book, \"Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry\", became available, numerous anti-Masons and religious leaders, both Protestant and Catholic, used the work to denounce Freemasonry and Albert Pike throughout the US, and to show that Freemasonry \"Palladism\" was actually a religion of Satanism, even though no such thing as Palladism existed. Taxil and his hoax are mentioned in the New Catholic Encyclopedia, under the article on impostors.\n\nAfter de la Rive studied at a Dominican college, he became a journalist in 1873; first with \"Courrier de Saône-et-Loire\", then with \"La Belgique\". From 1879 to 1886, he was a senior journalist for various newspapers: \"La Côte d'Or\", \"La Gazette du Centre\", and \"Le Franc-Bourguignon\". de la Rive was a publishing friend of Léo Taxil, and succeeded him as the manager of the weekly magazine, \"Christian Antimasonic France\", in January 1896, a position he held until his death in July 1914. Under de la Rive, the magazine changed its name to \"The Antimasonic France\", and the publication ended with him. Clarin de la Rive ran the Antimasonic Council of France, of which \"The Antimasonic France\" was a publication thereof.\n\nAlbert Pike had written his book, Morals and Dogma, which spoke about the definition of the word \"Lucifer\", that Taxil used for his hoax. Next, while de la Rive was working under Taxil, at the magazine \"Christian Antimasonic France\", Taxil convinced him that Diana Vaughan, a fictitious character in his writing, was real, and that she was admitted into Freemasonry, where she supposedly saw Satanism within the Scottish Rite building firsthand, at Charleston, South Carolina. Taxil then gave de la Rive, what was supposed to be an encyclical written by Albert Pike, which he subsequently used as source material for his book, \"Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry\".\n\nHowever, Diana Vaughan being the name of Taxil's typist, she never had been a Freemason, nor did she experience any of the purported rituals described in said text. Taxil admitted to these being false, in his confession about the hoax. Women have never been allowed to join a Lodge of regular Freemasonry. In de la Rive's book, he wrote that Pikes encyclical, which Diana supposedly brought to France, claimed that Freemasonry had a secret group known as the Palladium, that God and Lucifer were one and the same, and that Freemasonry was a religion, to which the membership of Freemasonry, under the 30th degree in the Scottish Rite, were kept ignorant of.\n\nAfter Taxil admitted to the hoax, in April, 1897, Clarin de la Rive recanted what he wrote.\n\nQuoting A. C. de la Rive in \"Freemasonry Unmasked\":\nWith frightening cynicism, the miserable person we shall not name here, [Taxil], declared before an assembly, especially convened for him, that for twelve years, he had prepared and carried out to the end, the most extraordinary and most sacrilegious of hoaxes. We have always been careful to publish special articles concerning Palladism and Diana Vaughan. We are now giving, in this issue, a complete list of these articles, which can now be considered as not having existed.\n\nIn particular, in his book, \"Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry\", de la Rive wrote three paragraphs that he laid to Albert Pike, which he sourced in a footnote to Diana Vaughn, Léo Taxil's fictitious creation. This writing is part of the texts that Clarin de la Rive recanted, and said that they should not be considered to have ever existed. The text in mention:\nThat which we must say to the world is that we worship a god, but it is the god that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the higher degrees, maintained in the Purity of the Luciferian doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay and his priests calumniate him?\n\nYes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods; darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive...\n\nThus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy, and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.\n\nFootnote in \"Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry\":\n\n\nAnd, under the pseudonym of Sheik Sihabil Klarin M'Ta El Chott:\n\n\nFrom 1893-95 Clarin de la Rive periodically contributed to \"The Cross of Paris\", \"The Cross of Reims\", and \"The Cross of Ardennes\" under the pseudonym of \"a layman\" or \"F.. X..\", and in \"The Devil's Magazine Supplement\", where he attacked Henri Antoine Jules-Bois and used the pseudonym \"Rhémus\".\n"}
{"id": "36787426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36787426", "title": "Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley", "text": "Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley\n\nThe Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley refers to the Achaemenid military conquest and occupation for about two centuries of territories of the North-western regions of the Indian subcontinent. The conquest of the areas as far as the Indus river is often dated to the time of Cyrus the Great, in the period between 550-539 BCE. The first secure epigraphic evidence, given by the Behistun Inscription inscription, gives a date before or about 518 BCE. Achaemenid penetration into the area of the Indian subcontinent occurred in stages, starting from northern parts of the River Indus and moving southward. These areas of the Indus valley became formal Achaemenid satrapies as mentioned in several Achaemenid inscriptions. The Achaemenid occupation of the Indus Valley ended with the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great circa 323 BCE. The Achaemenid occupation, although less successful than that of the later Greeks, Sakas or Kushans, had the effect of acquainting India to the outer world.\n\nThe Achaemenid Empire underwent a considerable expansion, both east and west, during the reign of Cyrus the Great (c.600–530 BC), leading the dynasty to take an interest into the region of northwestern India.\n\nThe conquest is often thought to have started circa 535 BCE, during the time of Cyrus the Great (600-530 BCE). Cyrus probably went as far as the banks of the Indus river and organized the conquered territories under the Satrapy of \"Gandara\" (Old Persian cuneiform: , \"Gadāra\", also transliterated as \"Gadāra\" since the nasal \"n\" before consonants was omitted in the Old Persian script, and simplified as \"Gandara\") according to the Behistun Inscription. The Province was also referred to as \"Paruparaesanna\" (Greek: Parapamisadae) in the Babylonian and Elamite versions of the Behistun inscription. The geographical extent of this province was wider than the Indian Gandhara. Various accounts, such as those of Xenophon or Ctesias, who wrote \"Indica\", also suggest that Cyrus conquered parts of India. Another Indian Province was conquered named Sattagydia (, \"Thataguš\") in the Behistun inscription. It was probably contiguous to Gandhara, but its actual location is uncertain. Fleming locates it between Arachosia and the middle Indus. Fleming also mentions Maka, in the area of Gedrosia, as one of the Indian satrapies.\n\nA successor of Cyrus the Great, Darius I was back in 518 BCE. The date of 518 BCE is given by the Behistun inscription, and is also often the one given for the secure occupation of Gandhara in Punjab. Darius I later conquered an additional province that he calls \"Hidūš\" in his inscriptions (Old Persian cuneiform: , \"H-i-du-u-š\", , also transliterated as \"Hidūš\" since the nasal \"n\" before consonants was omitted in the Old Persian script, and simplified as \"Hindush\"). The Hamadan Gold and Silver Tablet inscription of Darius I also refers to his conquests in India.\n\nThe area of the Province of \"Hindush\" also is uncertain. Some scholars have described it as the middle and lower Indus Valley and the approximate region of modern Sindh, but there is no known evidence of Achaemenid presence in this region, and deposits of gold, which Herodotus says was produced in vast quantities by this Province, are also unknown in the Indus delta region. Alternatively, \"Hindush\" may have been the region of Taxila and Western Punjab, where there are indications that a Persian satrapy may have existed. There are few remains of Achaemenid presence in the east, but, according to Fleming, the archaeological site of Bhir Mound in Taxila remains the \"most plausible candidate for the capital of Achaemenid India\", based of the fact that numerous pottery styles similar to those of the Achaemenids in the East have been found there, and that \"there are no other sites in the region with Bhir Mound's potential\".\n\nAccording to Herodotus, Darius I sent the Greek explorer Scylax of Caryanda to sail down the Indus river, heading a team of spies, in order to explore the course of the Indus river. After a periplus of 30 months, Scylax is said to have returned to Egypt near the Red Sea, and the seas between the Near East and India were made use of by Darius.\n\nAlso according to Herodotus, the territories of Gandhara, Sattagydia, Dadicae and Aparytae formed the 7th province of the Achaemenid Empire for tax-payment purposes, while \"Indus\" (called \"Ἰνδός\", \"Indos\" in Greek sources) formed the 20th tax region.\n\nThe Achaemenid army was not uniquely Persian. Rather it was composed of many different ethnicities that were part of the vast Achaemenid Empire. The army included Bactrians, Sakas (Scythians), Parthians, Sogdians. Herodotus gives a full list of the ethnicities of the Achaemenid army, in which are included Ionians (Greeks), and even Ethiopians. These ethnicities are likely to have been included in the Achaemenid army which invaded India.\n\nThe Persians may have later participated, together with Sakas and Greeks, in the campaigns of Chandragupta Maurya to gain the throne of Magadha circa 320 BCE. The \"Mudrarakshasa\" states that after Alexander's death, an alliance of \"Shaka-Yavana-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika\" was used by Chandragupta Maurya in his campaign to take the throne in Magadha and found the Mauryan Empire.\nThe \"Sakas\" were the Scythians, the \"Yavanas\" were the Greeks, and the \"Parasikas\" were the Persians.\nDavid Brainard Spooner observed of Chandragupta Maurya that \"it was with largely the Persian army that he won the throne of India.\"\n\nThese events were recorded in the imperial inscriptions of the Achaemenids (the Behistun inscription and the Naqsh-i-Rustam inscription, as well as the accounts of Herodotus (483–431 BCE), and of the Hellenistic accounts of the Greek conquests in India (circa 320 BCE). The Greek Scylax of Caryanda, who had been appointed by Darius I to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to Suez left an account, the \"Periplous\", of which fragments from secondary sources have survived. Hecataeus of Miletus (circa 500 BCE) also wrote about the \"Indus Satrapies\" of the Achaemenids.\n\nThe 'DB' Behistun inscription of Darius I (circa 510 BCE) mentions Gandara (, \"Gadāra\") and the adjacent territory of Sattagydia (, \"Thataguš\") as part of the Achaemenid Empire:\n\nFrom the dating of the Behistun inscription, it is possible to infer that the Achaemenids first conquered the areas of Gandara and Sattagydia circa 518 BCE.\n\nHinduš is also mentioned as one of 24 subject countries of the Achaemenid Empire, illustrated with the drawing of a kneeling subject and a hieroglyphic cartridge reading (\"H-n-d-wꜣ-y\"), on the Egyptian , now in the National Museum of Iran. Sattagydia also appears (, \"S-d-g-wꜣ-ḏꜣ\", Sattagydia), and probably Gandara (, \"H-rw-h-d-y\", although this could be Arachosia), with their own illustrations.\n\nFour identical foundation tablets of gold and silver, found in two deposition boxes in the foundations of the Apadana Palace, also contained an inscription by Darius I in Old Persian cuneiform, which describes the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms, from the Indus valley in the east to Lydia in the west, and from the Scythians beyond Sogdia in the north, to the African Kingdom of Kush in the south. This is known as the DPh inscription. The deposition of these foundation tablets and the Apadana coin hoard found under them, is dated to circa 515 BCE. \n\nThe DSe inscription and DSm inscription of Darius in Susa gives \"Thataguš\" (Sattagydia), \"Gadāra\" (Gandara) and \"Hiduš\" (Sindhu or Sindh) among the nations that he rules.\n\n\"Hidūš\" ( in Old Persian cuneiform) also appears later as a Satrapy in the Naqsh-i-Rustam inscription at the end of the reign of Darius, who died in 486 BCE. The DNa inscription on Darius' tomb at Naqsh-i-Rustam near Persepolis records \"Gadāra\" (Gandāra) along with \"Hiduš\" and \"Thataguš\" (Sattagydia) in the list of satrapies. \n\nThe nature of the administration under the Achaemenids is uncertain. Even though the Indian provinces are called \"satrapies\" by convention, there is no evidence of there being any satraps in these provinces. When Alexander invaded the region, he did not encounter Achaemenid satraps in the Indian provinces, but local Indian rulers referred to as \"hyparchs\" (\"Vice-Regents\"), a term that connotes subordination to the Achaemenid rulers. The local rulers may have reported to the satraps of Bactria and Arachosia.\n\nDarius I listed three Indian provinces: \"Thataguš\" (Sattagydia), \"Gandâra\" (Gandhara) and \"Hidūš\" (Sindhu or Sindh). The three regions remained represented among Achaemenid Provinces on all the tombs of the Achaemenid rulers after Darius, except for the last ruler Darius III who was vanquished by Alexander at Gaugamela, suggesting that the Indians were under Achaemenid dominion at least until 338 BCE, date of the end of the reign of Artaxerxes III, before the accession of Darius III, that is, less than 10 years before the campaigns of Alexander in the East and his victory at Gaugamela. The last known appearance of Gandhara in name as an Achaemenid province is of the tomb of Artaxerxes II, circa 358 BCE, date of his burial.\n\nHerodotus (III-91 and III-94), gives a list with a slightly different structure, as some province which are presented separately in the Achaemenid inscriptions are grouped together by Herodotus when he described the tribute paid by each territory. Herodotus presents \"Indos\" () as \"the 20th province\", while \"the Sattagydae, Gandarii, Dadicae, and Aparytae\" together form \"the 7th Province\". According to historian A. T. Olmstead, the fact that some Achaemenid regions are grouped together in this list may have represented some loss of territory. \n\nThe \"Hindūš\" province, remained loyal till Alexander's invasion. Circa 400 BC, Ctesias of Cnidus related that the Persian king was receiving numerous gifts from the kings of \"India\" (\"Hindūš\").\nCtesias also reported Indian elephants and Indian mahouts making demonstrations of the elephant's strength at the Achaemenid court.\n\nBy about 380 BC, the Persian hold on the region was weakening, but the area continued to be a part of the Achaemenid Empire until Alexander's invasion.\n\nDarius III (c. 380 – July 330 BC) still had Indian units in his army. In particular he had 15 war elephants at the Battle of Gaugamela for his fight against Alexander the Great.\n\nThe reliefs at the Apadana Palace in Persepolis describe tribute bearers from 23 satrapies visiting the Achaemenid court. These are located at the southern end of the Apadana Staircase. Among the foreigners the Arabs, the Thracians, the Bactrians, the Indians (from the Indus valley area), the Parthians, the Cappadocians, the Elamites or the Medians. The Indians from the Indus valley are bare-chested, except for their leader, and barefooted and wear the dhoti. They bring baskets with vases inside, carry axes, and drive along a donkey. One man in the Indian procession carries a small but visibly heavy load of four jars on a yoke, suggesting that he was carrying some of the gold dust paid by the Indians as tribute to the Achaemenid court.\n\nAccording to the Naqsh-e Rustam inscription of Darius I (circa 490 BCE), there were three Achaemenid Satrapies in the subcontinent: Sattagydia, Gandara, Hidūš.\n\nThe conquered area was the most fertile and populous region of the Achaemenid Empire. An amount of tribute was fixed according to the richness of each territory. India was already fabled for its gold.\n\nHerodotus (who makes several comments on India) published a list of tribute-paying nations, classifying them in 20 Provinces. The Province of \"Indos\" (, the Indus valley) formed the 20th Province, and was the richest and most populous of the Achaemenid Provinces.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, the \"Indians\" ('Ινδοι, \"Indoi\"), as separate from the Gandarei and the Sattagydians, formed the 20th taxation Province, and were required to supply gold dust in tribute to the Achaemenid central government for an amount of 360 Euboean talents (equivalent to about 8300kg or 8.3 tons of gold annually, a volume of gold that would fit in a cube of side 75cm). The exchange rate between gold and silver at the time of Herodotus being 13 to 1, this was equal in value to the very large amount of 4680 Euboean talents of silver, equivalent to 3600 Babylonian talents of silver (equivalent in value to about 108 tons of silver annually). The country of the \"Indians\" ('Ινδοι, \"Indoi\") was the Achaemenid district paying the largest tribute, and alone represented 32% of the total tribute revenues of the whole Achaemenid Empire. It also means that \"Indos\" was the richest Achaemenid region in the subcontinent, much richer than Gandara or Sattagydia. However the amount of gold in question is quite enormous, so there is a possibility that Herodotus was mistaken and that his own sources actually only meant something like the gold equivalent of 360 Babylonian talents of silver. \nThe territories of Gandara, Sattagydia, Dadicae (north-west of the Kashmir valley) and the Aparytae (Afridis) are named separately, and were aggregated together for taxation purposes, forming the 7th Achaemenid Province, and paying overall a much lower tribute of 170 talents together (about 5151kg, or 5.1 tons of silver), hence only about 1.5% of the total revenues of the Achaemenid Empire:\n\nThe Indians also supplied Yaka wood (teak) for the construction of Achaemenid palaces, as well as war elephants such as those used at Gaugamela. The Susa inscriptions of Darius explain that Indian ivory and teak were sold on Persian markets, and used in the construction of his palace.\n\nIndians were employed in the Achaemenid army of Xerxes in the Second Persian invasion of Greece (480-479 BCE), and \"Indian troops marched with Xerxes's army across the Hellespont\". Herodotus, in his description of the multi-ethnic Achaemenid army invading Greece, described the equipment of the Indians:\n\nHerodotus also explains that the Indian cavalry under the Achaemenids had an equipment similar that of their foot soldiers:\n\nThe Gandharis had a different equipment, akin to that of the Bactrians:\n\nIndian soldiers of the three territories of Gandara, Sattagydia (Tathagatus) and Hindush are shown, together with soldiers of all the other nations, supporting the throne of their Achaemenid ruler, at Naqsh-e Rostam on the tombs of Darius I, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I and Darius II, and at Persepolis on the tombs of Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The last Achaemenid ruler Darius III never had time to finish his own tomb due to his hasty defeat by Alexander the Great, and therefore does not have such depictions. The soldiers from India are characterized by their particular clothing, only composed of a loin cloth and sandals, with bare upper body, in contrast to all the other ethnicities of the Achaemenid army, who are fully clothed, and in contrast also to the neighbouring provinces of Bactria or Arachosia, who are also fully clothed.\nThe presence of the three ethnicities of Indian soldiers on the all the tombs of the Achaemenid rulers after Darius, except for the last ruler Darius III who was vanquished by Alexander at Gaugamela, suggest that the Indians were under Achaemenid dominion at least until 338 BCE, date of the end of the reign of Artaxerxes III, before the accession of Darius III, that is, less than 10 years before the campaigns of Alexander in the East and his victory at Gaugamela.\n\nAccording to Arrian, Indian troops were still deployed under Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE). He explains that Darius III \"obtained the help of those Indians who bordered on the Bactrians, together with the Bactrians and Sogdianians themselves, all under the command of Bessus, the Satrap of Bactria\". The Indians in questions were probably from the area of Gandara. Indian \"hill-men\" are also said by Arrian to have joined the Arachotians under Satrap Barsentes, and are thought to have been either the Sattagydians or the Hindush.\n\nFifteen Indian war elephants were also part of the army of Darius III at Gaugamela. They had specifically been brought from India. Still, it seems they did not participate to the final battle, probably because of fatigue. This was a relief for the armies of Alexander, who had no previous experience of combat against war elephants. The elephants were captured with the baggage train by the Greeks after the engagement.\n\nCoin finds in the Chaman Hazouri hoard in Kabul, or the Shaikhan Dehri hoard in Pushkalavati in Gandhara, near Charsadda, as well as in the Bhir Mound hoard in Taxila, have revealed numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE which circulated in the area, at least as far as the Indus during the reign of the Achaemenids, who were in control of the areas as far as Gandhara.\n\nThe Kabul hoard, also called the Chaman Hazouri, Chaman Hazouri or Tchamani-i Hazouri hoard, is a coin hoard discovered in the vicinity of Kabul, Afghanistan. The hoard, discovered in 1933, contained numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. Approximately one thousand coins were in the hoard. The hoard is dated to approximately 380 BCE as no coins in the hoard were later than that date.\n\nThis numismatic discovery has been very important in studying and dating the history of coinage of India, since it is one of the very rare instances when punch-marked coins can actually be dated, due to their association with known and dated Greek and Achaemenid coins in the hoard. The hoard supports the view that punch-marked coins existed in 360 BCE, as suggested by literary evidence.\n\nDaniel Schlumberger also considers that punch-marked bars, similar to the many punch-marked bars found in north-western India, initially originated in the Achaemenid Empire, rather than in the Indian heartland:\n\nModern numismatists now tend to consider the Achaemenid punch-marked coins as the precursors of the Indian punch-marked coins.\n\nIn 2007 a small coin hoard was discovered at the site of ancient Pushkalavati (the Shaikhan Dehri hoard) near Charsada in Pakistan. The hoard contained a tetradrachm minted in Athens circa 500/490-485/0 BCE, together with a number of local types as well as silver cast ingots. The hoard contained a tetradrachm minted in Athens circa 500/490-485/0 BCE, typically used as a currency for trade in the Achaemenid Empire, together with a number of local types as well as silver cast ingots. The Athens coin is the earliest known example of its type to be found so far to the east.\n\nAccording to Joe Cribb, these early Greek coins were at the origin of Indian punch-marked coins, the earliest coins developed in India, which used minting technology derived from Greek coinage.\n\nTaxila (site of Bhir Mound), the \"most plausible candidate for the capital of Achaemenid India\", was at the crossroad of the main trade roads of Asia, was probably populated by Persians, Greeks and other people from throughout the Achaemenid Empire. The renowned University of Taxila became the greatest learning centre in the region, and allowed for exchanges between people from various cultures.\n\nSeveral contemporaries, and close followers, of the Buddha are said to have studied in Achaemenid Taxila: King Pasenadi of Kosala, a close friend of the Buddha, Bandhula, the commander of Pasedani's army, Aṅgulimāla, a close follower of the Buddha, and Jivaka, court doctor at Rajagriha and personal doctor of the Buddha. According to Stephen Batchelor, the Buddha may have been influenced by the experiences and knowledge acquired by some of his closest followers in Taxila.\n\n\nThe 5th century BCE grammarian Pāṇini lived in an Achaemenid environment. He is said to have been born in the north-west, in Shalatula near Attock, not far from Taxila, in what was then a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, which technically made him a Persian subject.\n\nKautilya, the influential Prime Minister of Chandragupta Maurya, is also said to have been a professor teaching in Taxila. According to Buddhist legend, Kautilya brought Chandragupta Maurya, the future founder of the Mauryan Empire to Taxila as a child, and had him educated there in \"all the sciences and arts\" of the period, including military sciences, for a period of 7 to 8 years. These legends match Plutarch's assertation that Alexander the Great met with the young Chandragupta while campaigning in the Punjab.\n\nVarious Indian artefacts tend to suggest some Perso-Hellenistic artistic influence in India, mainly felt during the time of the Mauryan Empire. The sculpture of the Masarh lion, found near the Maurya capital of Pataliputra, raises the question of the Achaemenid and Greek influence on the art of the Maurya Empire, and on the western origins of stone carving in India. The lion is carved in Chunar sandstone, like the Pillars of Ashoka, and its finish is polished, a feature of the Maurya sculpture. According to S.P. Gupta, the sculptural style is unquestionably Achaemenid. This is particularly the case for the well-ordered tubular representation of whiskers (vibrissas) and the geometrical representation of inflated veins flush with the entire face. The mane, on the other hand, with tufts of hair represented in wavelets, is rather naturalistic. Very similar examples are however known in Greece and Persepolis. It is possible that this sculpture was made by an Achaemenid or Greek sculptor in India and either remained without effect, or was the Indian imitation of a Greek or Achaemenid model, somewhere between the fifth century B.C. and the first century B.C., although it is generally dated from the time of the Maurya Empire, around the 3rd century B.C..\n\nThe Pataliputra palace with its pillared hall shows decorative influences of the Achaemenid palaces and Persepolis and may have used the help of foreign craftsmen. Mauryan rulers may have even imported craftsmen from abroad to build royal monuments. This may be the result of the formative influence of craftsmen employed from Persia following the disintegration of the Achaemenid Empire after the conquests of Alexander the Great. The Pataliputra capital, or also the Hellenistic friezes of the Rampurva capitals, Sankissa, and the diamond throne of Bodh Gaya are other examples.\n\nThe renowned Mauryan polish, especially used in the Pillars of Ashoka, may also have been a technique imported from the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nThe similarity of the 4th century BCE Lycian barrel-vaulted tombs, such as the tomb of Payava, in the western part of the Achaemenid Empire, with the Indian architectural design of the Chaitya (starting at least a century later from circa 250 BCE, with the Lomas Rishi caves in the Barabar caves group), suggests that the designs of the Lycian rock-cut tombs travelled to India along the trade routes across the Achaemenid Empire. \n\nEarly on, James Fergusson, in his \" Illustrated Handbook of Architecture\", while describing the very progressive evolution from wooden architecture to stone architecture in various ancient civilizations, has commented that \"In India, the form and construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these examples in Lycia\". The structural similarities, down to many architectural details, with the Chaitya-type Indian Buddhist temple designs, such as the \"same pointed form of roof, with a ridge\", are further developed in \"The cave temples of India\". The Lycian tombs, dated to the 4th century BCE, are either free-standing or rock-cut barrel-vaulted sarcophagi, placed on a high base, with architectural features carved in stone to imitate wooden structures. There are to the free-standing structures and decorated with reliefs. Fergusson went on to suggest an \"Indian connection\", and some form of cultural transfer across the Achaemenid Empire. The ancient transfer of Lycian designs for rock-cut monuments to India is considered as \"quite probable\".\n\nArt historian David Napier has also proposed a reverse relationship, claiming that the Payava tomb was a descendant of an ancient South Asian style, and that Payava may actually have been a Graeco-Indian named \"Pallava\".\n\nRegarding the Pillars of Ashoka, there has been much discussion of the extent of influence from Achaemenid Persia, since the column capitals supporting the roofs at Persepolis have similarities, and the \"rather cold, hieratic style\" of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka especially shows \"obvious Achaemenid and Sargonid influence\". \n\nHellenistic influence has also been suggested. In particular the abaci of some of the pillars (especially the Rampurva bull, the Sankissa elephant and the Allahabad pillar capital) use bands of motifs, like the bead and reel pattern, the ovolo, the flame palmettes, lotuses, which likely originated from Greek and Near-Eastern arts. Such examples can also be seen in the remains of the Mauryan capital city of Pataliputra.\n\nThe Aramaic language, official language of the Achaemenid Empire, started to be used in the Indian territories. Some of the Edicts of Ashoka in the north-western areas of Ashoka's territory, in modern Pakistan and Afghanistan, used Aramaic (the official language of the former Achaemenid Empire), together with Prakrit and Greek (the language of the neighbouring Greco-Bactrian kingdom and the Greek communities in Ashoka's realm).\n\nThe Indian Kharosthi script shows a clear dependency on the Aramaic alphabet but with extensive modifications to support the sounds found in Indic languages. One model is that the Aramaic script arrived with the Achaemenid Empire's conquest of the Indus River (modern Pakistan) in 500 BCE and evolved over the next 200+ years, reaching its final form by the 3rd century BCE where it appears in some of the Edicts of Ashoka.\n\nThe Edicts of Ashoka (circa 250 BCE) may show Achaemenid influences, including formulaic parallels with Achaemenid inscriptions, presence of Iranian loanwords (in Aramaic inscriptions), and the very act of engraving edicts on rocks and mountains (compare for example Behistun inscription). To describe his own edicts, Ashoka used the word \"Lipī\" (𑀮𑀺𑀧𑀺), now generally simply translated as \"writing\" or \"inscription\". It is thought the word \"lipi\", which is also orthographed \"dipi\" (𐨡𐨁𐨤𐨁‎) in the two Kharosthi versions of the rock edicts, comes from an Old Persian prototype \"dipî\" () also meaning \"inscription\", which is used for example by Darius I in his Behistun inscription, suggesting borrowing and diffusion. There are other borrowings of Old Persian terms for writing-related words in the Edicts of Ashoka, such as \"nipista\" or \"nipesita\" (\"written\" and \"made to be written\") in the Kharoshthi version of Major Rock Edict No.4, which can be related to the word \"nipištā\" (\"written\") from the \"daiva\" inscription of Xerxes at Persepolis.\n\nSeveral of the Edicts of Ashoka, such as the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription or the Taxila inscription were written in Aramaic, one of the official languages of the former Achaemenid Empire.\n\nHistorically, the life of the Buddha also coincided with the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley. The Achaemenid occupation of the areas of Gandara and Hinduš, which was to last for about two centuries, was accompanied by the introduction of Achaemenid religions, reformed Mazdaism or early Zoroastrianism, to which Buddhism might have in part reacted. In particular, the ideas of the Buddha may have partly consisted in a rejection of the \"absolutist\" or \"perfectionist\" ideas contained in these Achaemenid religions.\n\nStill, according to Christopher I. Beckwith, commenting on the content of the Edicts of Ashoka, the early Buddhist concepts of karma, rebirth, and affirming that good deeds with be rewarded in this life and the next, in Heaven, probably find their origin in Achaemenid Mazdaism, which had been introduced in India from the time of the Achaemenid conquest of Gandara.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "62016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62016", "title": "Amedeo Modigliani", "text": "Amedeo Modigliani\n\nAmedeo Clemente Modigliani (; 12 July 1884 – 24 January 1920) was an Italian Jewish painter and sculptor who worked mainly in France. He is known for portraits and nudes in a modern style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as Pablo Picasso and Constantin Brâncuși. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the Section d'Or group at the Salon d'Automne.\nModigliani's œuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity. He died at age 35 in Paris of tubercular meningitis.\n\nModigliani was born into a Sephardic Jewish family in Livorno, Italy. A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large Jewish community. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.\n\nModigliani's mother, Eugénie Garsin, born and raised in Marseille, was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of Talmudic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.\n\nModigliani’s father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining engineer. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost of timberland the family owned.\n\nA reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani’s mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.\n\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.\n\nModigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of pleurisy when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of typhoid fever. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the tuberculosis which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: Naples, Capri, Rome and Amalfi, then north to Florence and Venice.\n\nHis mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his ability to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: \"The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?\"\n\nModigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself \"already a painter\", his mother wrote, even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the Italian Renaissance masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, Guglielmo Micheli.\n\nModigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been Llewelyn Lloyd, Giulio Cesare Vinzio, Manlio Martinelli, Gino Romiti, Renato Natali, and Oscar Ghiglia. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of Renaissance art, can still be seen. His nascent work was shaped as much by such artists as Giovanni Boldini as by Toulouse-Lautrec.\n\nModigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of Domenico Morelli, a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title \"the Macchiaioli\" (from \"macchia\" —\"dash of colour\", or, more derogatively, \"stain\"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized landscape movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the French Impressionists, the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of Monet, and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.\n\nModigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint \"en plein air\", but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to Cézanne than to the Macchiaioli.\n\nWhile with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.\n\nDespite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as \"Superman\", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.\n\nIn 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with life drawing, enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or \"Free School of Nude Studies\", of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti.\nIt is in Venice that he first smoked hashish and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple teenage rebellion, or the cliched hedonism and bohemianism that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of Nietzsche.\n\nHaving been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, Baudelaire, Carducci, Comte de Lautréamont, and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.\n\nLetters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;\n\n(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.\n\nThe work of Lautréamont was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's \"Les Chants de Maldoror\" became the seminal work for the Parisian Surrealists of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart. The poetry of Lautréamont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and D'Annunzio similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through Symbolist imagery.\n\nModigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.\n\nDear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself. I am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate ... A bourgeois told me today–insulted me–that I or at least my brain was lazy. It did me good. I should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life...\n\nIn 1906, Modigliani moved to Paris, then the focal point of the avant-garde. In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: Gino Severini and Juan Gris.\n\nHe later befriended Jacob Epstein, they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for ‘The Pillars of Tenderness’ which would support the imagined temple.\nModigliani squatted in Le Bateau-Lavoir, a commune for penniless artists in Montmartre, renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented—initially, at least—as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.\n\nWhen he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial. He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.\n\nWithin a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.\n\nThe poet and journalist Louis Latourette, upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.\n\nNot only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as \"Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois\".\n\nThe motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition. Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.\n\nModigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.\nHe sought the company of artists such as Utrillo and Soutine, seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues. Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these Bohemian surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used absinthe and hashish. While drunk, he would sometimes strip himself naked at social gatherings. He died in Paris, aged 35. He became the epitome of the tragic artist, creating a posthumous legend almost as well known as that of Vincent van Gogh.\n\nDuring the 1920s, in the wake of Modigliani's career and spurred on by comments by André Salmon crediting hashish and absinthe with the genesis of Modigliani's style, many hopefuls tried to emulate his \"success\" by embarking on a path of substance abuse and bohemian excess. Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, \"...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art.\"\n\nSome art historians suggest that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.\n\nDuring his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost—destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.\n\nHe was first influenced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of Paul Cézanne. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.\n\nHe met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair. Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.\n\nIn 1909, Modigliani returned home to Livorno, sickly and tired from his wild lifestyle. Soon he was back in Paris, this time renting a studio in Montparnasse. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after Paul Guillaume, an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. He was Constantin Brâncuși's disciple for one year.\n\nAlthough a series of Modigliani's sculptures were exhibited in the Salon d'Automne of 1912, by 1914 he abandoned sculpting and focused solely on his painting, a move precipitated by the difficulty in acquiring sculptural materials due to the outbreak of war, and by Modigliani's physical debilitation.\n\nIn June 2010 Modigliani's \"Tête\", a limestone carving of a woman's head, became the third most expensive sculpture ever sold.\n\nModigliani painted a series of portraits of contemporary artists and friends in Montparnasse: Chaim Soutine, Moïse Kisling, Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Marie \"Marevna\" Vorobyev-Stebeslka, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, Jacques Lipchitz, Blaise Cendrars, and Jean Cocteau, all sat for stylized renditions.\n\nAt the outset of World War I, Modigliani tried to enlist in the army but was refused because of his poor health.\n\nKnown as \"Modì\" (which plays on the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as \"Dedo\" to his family and friends, Modigliani was a handsome man, and attracted much female attention. Women came and went until Beatrice Hastings entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including \"Madame Pompadour\", and the object of much of his drunken wrath.\n\nWhen the British painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man at the next table in the café introduced himself as \"Modigliani, painter and Jew\". They became great friends.\n\nIn 1916, Modigliani befriended the Polish poet and art dealer Léopold Zborowski and his wife Anna. Zborowski became Modigliani's primary art dealer and friend during the artist's final years, helping him financially, and also organizing his show in Paris in 1917.\n\nThe several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend Léopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work.\n\nThe paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their \"commercial potential\", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances.\n\nThe Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is \"notorious\" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity. The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.\n\n\"Nude Sitting on a Divan\" is one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale of the painting at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show.\n\n\"Nu couché\" realized $170,405,000 at a Christie's, New York, sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold.\nOn a trip to Nice which had been conceived and organized by Zborowski, Modigliani, Foujita and other artists tried to sell their works to rich tourists. Modigliani managed to sell a few pictures, but only for a few francs each. Despite this, during this time he produced most of the paintings that later became his most popular and valued works.\n\nDuring his lifetime, he sold a number of his works, but never for any great amount of money. What funds he did receive soon vanished for his habits.\n\nIn the spring of 1917, the Russian sculptor Chana Orloff introduced him to a beautiful 19-year-old art student named Jeanne Hébuterne who had posed for Tsuguharu Foujita. From a conservative bourgeois background, Hébuterne was renounced by her devout Roman Catholic family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.\n\nModigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings and a short time later Hébuterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumière. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne Hébuterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art.\nOn December 3, 1917, Modigliani's first one-man exhibition opened at the Berthe Weill Gallery in Paris. The chief of the Paris police was scandalized by Modigliani's nudes and forced him to close the exhibition within a few hours after its opening.\n\nTowards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with Hébuterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico and André Derain. After he and Hébuterne moved to Nice on November 29, 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named Jeanne (1918–1984). In May 1919 they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumière.\nHébuterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.\n\nAlthough he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.\n\nIn 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto Hébuterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, tubercular meningitis. He died on January 24, 1920, at the Hôpital de la Charité.\n\nThere was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old Hébuterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.\n\nA day later, Hébuterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, a day after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Hébuterne was buried at the Cimetière de Bagneux near Paris, and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: \"Struck down by death at the moment of glory\". Her's reads: \"Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice\".\n\nManaging only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.\n\nThe linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative Renaissance painters informed his work. Working during that fertile period of “isms,” Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, “This is what I see.”\n\nMore appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual avant-garde of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of Jean Cocteau’s proclamation: “Ne t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde” (“Don’t wait for the avant-garde”). Pseudo-goitre, a medical condition is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani's paintings which appeared like pseudogoitre.\nSince his death, Modigliani's reputation has soared. Nine novels, a play, a documentary, and three feature films have been devoted to his life. Modigliani's sister in Florence adopted his daughter, Jeanne (1918–1984). As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled \"Modigliani: Man and Myth\".\n\nThe Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world. There are at least five catalogues raisonnés of the artist’s work including two volumes by Ambrogio Ceroni, last updated in 1972. Arthur Pfannstiel (1929 and 1956) and Joseph Lanthemann's (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar Osvaldo Patani produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the Paul Alexandre period (1994), while Christian Parisot has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonné.\n\nIn 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate—believed to be the only ones existing—were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives Légales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani’s work. In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian art forgery unit after a two-year investigation; the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect authenticity certificates.\n\nIn November 2010, a painting of a nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of a series of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (£42.7m) at an auction in New York—a record for the artist's work. Bidding for \"La Belle Romaine\" pushed its price well past its $40m (£24.8m) estimate. Modigliani's previous auction record was 43.2m euros (£35.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist—Jeanne Hébuterne (au chapeau), one of the first portraits he painted of his lover—sold for $19.1m (£11.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9–12m (£5.6–7.4m).\n\nOn November 9, 2015 the 1917 painting \"Nu couché\", sold at Christie's in New York for US$170.4 million. On May 14, 2018 the 1917 painting \"Nu couché (sur le côté gauche)\" sold at Sotheby's in New York for $157.2 million. This was the highest auction price in Sotheby's history.\n\nTwo films have been made about Modigliani: \"Les Amants de Montparnasse\" (1958), directed by Jacques Becker and starring Gérard Philipe as Modigliani; and \"Modigliani\" (2004), directed by Mick Davis and starring Andy García as Modigliani.\n\nModigliani's art was an influence on director Andy Muschetti, who found his works frightening as a child. Creatures based on Modigliani's style have appeared in his films \"Mama\" and \"It\".\n\nIn 1987 the U.S. synth-pop band Book of Love released the single \"Modigliani (Lost In Your Eyes)\".\n\nIn 1991 the Italian singer-songwriter Vinicio Capossela, released his second album titled \"Modi\"' which is also the title of the album's first track. The song's title recalls the French term \"Maudit\" (cursed) and gives an almost impressionist depiction of Modigliani's troubled soul, embracing in its lyrics the painter's well known love of poetry.\n\nIn 2015 Italian jazz player Claudio Ottaviano released the composition \"Modigliani\", opening track for the album \"Aurora\" on NuomRecords.\n\n\"Modi'Tango\" (Giovanna Pieri Buti, violin - Emiliano Degl'Innocenti, doublebass - Alessandro Ottaviani, accordion) is a musical band based in Livorno, that honours Modigliani taking inspiration from an oneiric meeting in Montparnasse between Modigliani and Carlos Gardel in front of a Milonga\n\nIn 2011 Peter Schjeldahl, reviewing Meryle Secrest's book \"Modigliani: A Life\", wrote:\n\nI recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, to one of his long-necked women, with their piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the succulent color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.\n\nSchjeldahl reports Secrest’s speculation that Modigliani was happy to let people consider him an alcoholic and drug addict, \"and thus to mistake the symptoms of his tuberculosis, which he kept a secret. Drunks were tolerated; carriers of infectious diseases were not.\"\n\n\n27 sculptures by Modigliani are known to exist.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12709735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12709735", "title": "Amir Kulal", "text": "Amir Kulal\n\nAmir Kulal (1278–1370), , , birth name Shams ud-Dīn (, ), was a Persian Sufi Islamic scholar, widely considered to be one of the most influential in history. He was a member of a Sufi order, the Naqshbandi. His father was the Sufi scholar Saif ud-Dīn Hamza (), a descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was Amir (chieftain) of the Tribe of Kulal, his full title being \"Amir-i-Kulal\". After his father's death, Shams ud-Dīn became the Amir and head of the tribe. By this time his reputation as a scholar and religious figure had spread through Turkistan and the title \"Amir-i-Kulal\", had become his common name.\nKulal was named for his grandfather, also known as Shams ud-Dīn, the spiritual mentor of the Barlas Tribe and Turghai (father of Amir Timur).\n\nKulal had a number of students who later became prominent figures in history, including Baha-ud-Dīn Naqshband and the Mongol conqueror Amir Timur. After rise of the Timurid Dynasty, a close relationship began between the houses of Amir Timur and Amir Kulal and continued through the Mughal line in India. Kulal is buried at Sokhar, near Bukhara, Uzbekistan.\n\nAmir Kulal's father, Amir Saif ud-Dīn Hamza, was a direct descendant of Husain ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad. The entire tribe of Kulal were descended from Muhammad.\n\nThe Kulal tribe settled in the area of modern-day Vabkent near the end of the twelfth century. Around 1340, the city was visited by Ibn Battuta who spent a night there as a guest. Battuta described it as beautiful, saying that it had \"... many gardens and rivers\". The tribe's date of settlement can be approximated with the remains of the madrasa (a form of Mosque) which was constructed at Vabkent in 1198 under the patronage of Burhan ud-Din Abdul Aziz II (whose name adorns the Madrasa's minaret, the only surviving segment of the building). The builders of the madrasa were members of the Kulal tribe and copied the Kalyan mosque (Po-i-Kalyan) style, making upgrades in the design and technology. This made the Vabkent madrasa a more refined form of Kalyan mosque.\n\nThe tribe quickly established a small industrial base at the central market of Vabkent and built mills in the surrounding areas, which continued to operate well into the sixteenth century. The city's main industries were coin minting; alloying of steel; creating pottery; and milling. Their highly glazed pottery and tiles, unmatched in quality and quantity, were their main export. This earned the tribe the title of Kulal (potter) and gave them their name. Their kiln designs were highly efficient and were able to produce up to 1500 pots in each batch. Utilizing wind and water resources for milling and industrial processes coupled with efficient kiln designs resulted in considerably higher earnings per capita, leading to a healthy lifestyle for the entire tribe.\n\nDespite a history of wars and conflict in the area, the Kulal tribe was not once attacked. There are three main reasons for this:\n\nBy the time of Amir Kulal wrestling had become a Kulal trademark sport. The tribe held regular contests both at Vabkent and Bukhara in which outsiders also competed. The Kulal youth were almost always successful, instilling the idea of the Kulal tribe as superior and fierce warriors.\n\nThe full name of Amir Kulal is as follows:\n\nAmir Kulal ibn Hamzah ibn Ibraheem ibn Muhammad ibn (Muhammad) Hasan ibn Abdullah AlShaheed ibn Jafar ibn Husain ibn Ali ibn Hasan AlQayem ibn (Muhammad) Husain ibn (Ahmad) Husain ibn (Muhammad) Ali AlDaynori ibn Moussa AbuSobha Moussa AlThani ibn Ibraheem AlMurtdha ibn Moussa AlKadhim ibn Jafar AlSadiq ibn Muhammad AlBaqir ibn Ali Zainualabdeen ibn AlHusain AlSebit, son of Fatimah ibnt Muhammad, ibn AlImam Ali ibn AbiTalib AlHashemi AlQurashi\n\nShams ud-Dīn Amir Kulal was born at Bukhara. His father Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was head of the Kulal tribe and a renowned scholar. As head of the tribe, Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was titled \"Amir-i-Kulal\" (Leader of Kulal tribe). Shams ud-Dīn was educated in his childhood and early in his life took the position of head of the madrasa at Vabkent. He was also known as a great wrestler. By the time he became the head of Kulal tribe his fame as a scholar and religious figure had spread through the surrounding region with many noble and powerful families sending their children to study under him, most notably from the Barlas Tribe.\n\nShams ud-Dīn Kulal was elected as tribe's head after his father's death. Although all the heads of Kulal were titled \"Amir-i-Kulal\", it was Shams ud-Dīn whose name has become synonymous with the title-name. Today, he is mostly remembered as Amir Kulal, rather than his birth name.\n\nKulal continued to teach at the madrasa, even when he was head of the tribe. One of his most famous disciples was Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, who used to work as an executioner in Bukhara under the rule of Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur. Legend says that Baha ud-Dīn was ordered to execute a man who had angered the king, but right before his execution the accused called upon Amir Kulal, identifying him as his teacher. Amir Kulal intervened and the accused was set free on his intercession. This was Baha ud-Dīn's first encounter with Amir Kulal. Impressed by him, Baha ud-Dīn became his student.\n\nAmir Kulal also had a sizable following of spiritual protégés. Of these the most prominent was Turghai who had previously been influenced by Amir Kulal's grandfather. After Turghai's death his son Timur held Amir Kulal in the same esteem, holding him as his spiritual guide.\n\nAround the year 1340, Ibn Battuta made a day stop at Vabkent who later described the city as beautiful with many rivers and gardens. He was Amir's guest at the city and was guided towards Bukhara, then at a day's travel from Vabkent.\n\nIn the year 1357, Timur approached Amir Kulal for his advice on strategic maneuvers for attacking Uzbeks. It was under his advice that Timur changed his attack plan.\n\nAmir Kulal died in 770/1370 and was buried in Sukhar (Sokhar) near Bukhara. Sometimes Amir Kulal's tomb is confused with the tomb of his grandfather (also Shams ud-Dīn Kulal). It is Shams ud-Dīn Kulal (Amir Kulal's grandfather) who is buried at Shahrisabz(Kesh); the Green City. Amir Kulal's grandfather had constructed the madrasa Dor-i-Tilavat/Dorut Tilavat (House of Mediation) and was buried here after his death. Later, Timur transferred the body of his father Turghai, to be near the grave of Shams ud-Dīn (Amir Kulal's grandfather). Amir Kulal's grandfather was Turghai and Barlas Tribe's spiritual mentor. Majority of Timur's family is also buried at the same place. Recently, his tomb had been renovated under the orders of Uzbekistan's President.\n\nNone of the books written by Amir Kulal still exist, although some excerpts and essays have survived in the family library. Three copies of a biography of Amir Kulal \"Maqamat-i-Amir Kulal\" written by his great grandson Shihab ul-Dīn have survived.\n\nAfter Amir Kulal's death his descendants, propagated from his four sons (Burhanudeen, Shah, Hamzah, and Omar), continued to assosciate with the Timurid and then Mughal dynasty kings and princes as their friends and teachers. Amir Kulal's grandson Amir Kalan (\"Muhammad ibn Shah ibn Amir Kulal\") was entrusted with the education of young Ulugh Beg. Although Amir Kalan is renowned for his religious scholarship he was also well versed in mathematics and astronomy, and introduced these sciences to the young prince. At Ulugh Beg's madrasa Amir Kalan was considered one of the top ten teachers with unparalleled proficiency in \"ulum-i-yaainia\", \"dinia\" and \"ulum-i-shariat.\" Amir Sultan (\"Muhammad Shmsudeen ibn Ali ibn Burhanudeen ibn Amir Kulal\"), another grandson of Amir Kulal married Ottoman Sultan, Bayezid I's daughter. After Babur established the Mughal Empire in India many of Amir Kulal's descendants moved there and continued to enjoy an influence in the Mughal dynasty. They remained as teachers and mentors of Mughal princes and kings or their close friends. Last of these was Shah Abbas, tutor of Mughal King Farrukhsiyar. By the time Farrukhsiyar was enthroned, the family had parted ways from the Mughals. After about one hundred years the family comes to prominence with Sheikh Samad Ali, one of the prominent students of Shah Abdul Aziz. Although his exploits as an engineering entrepreneur overshadows his scholarly work, his son Hakim Qadir Ali earned fame both as a scholar and doctor. His great grandson Shah Altaf was renowned as a scholar and scientist in the area around Delhi, and his school attracted many students from this area. After its founding, the majority of Amir Kulal's descendants emigrated to Pakistan.\n\nThe Shaykhan family claims ancestry from the Naqshbandi Sufi saint of Bukhara Shaykh Shams ud-Dīn Muhammad Amir Kulal. During the early period of Islamic history the ancestors of Amir Kulal migrated from Al Madinah and settled in Shaykhan Ninawa, Iraq where successive generations lived for over five centuries. The entire family later emigrated to Janah, Iraq and thereafter to Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan.\n\nThe generations following Amir Kulal lived in Bukhara for more than a century. Some notable descendants included: Amir Hamzah Ibn Amir Kulal (d800H), known as \"Baba Mir\", a leading Naqshbandi Sufi saint with large following of spiritual protégés; Amir Hasan Zaman Ibn Amir Hamzah (d 825H), buried in Sokhar near Bukhara. Amir Masud Zaman Ibn Amir Hasan Zaman (d 875H), buried in Samarkand; and Amir Muhammad Arifullah Ibn Amir Masud Zaman\n(847-909H), fourth in descent from Amir Kulal, a prominent Naqshbandi Sufi saint and a spiritual mentor of Umar Shaykh Mirza (1456-1494AD), ruler of the province of Fergana and father of Zahir ud-Dīn Muhammad Babur (1483-1530AD), founder of the Mughal empire in India.\n\nEmperor Babur, fifth in descent from Amir Timur and founder of the Timurid dynasty which ruled northern India for nearly four centuries, was mindful of his Central Asian origin and, following in the steps of Timur, gave extensive patronage to descendants of Amir Kulal.\n\nShaykh Sayyid Zain ud-Dīn Ibn Amir Muhammad Arifullah (d.940H/1533AD) was a writer, a poet and belonged to Naqshbandi Sufi Order. Translated memoirs of Mughal Emperor Babur into Persian and was author of the book Tabaqat-e-Baburi. Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn was part of Babur's entourage when he occupied Kabul in 910H/1504AD and later in 932H/1525AD in his fifth expedition to Hindustan accompanied him to India. In his memoirs Babur writes that on entering Dehli after the victorious battle of Panipat in 932H/1526AD against Sultan Ibrahim Lodi he asked Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn to lead the Friday prayers and recite the Khutba (proclamation) in his name. Decrees of the Emperor announcing victories at the battle of Panipat and against Rana Sanga and the Rajput coalition at the battle of Khanua 933H/March 17, 1527AD were composed by Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn which were copied and dispatched to the entire realm.\n\nShaykh Zain ud-Dīn was \"Sadr-us-Sudur\" responsible for the judicial administration and religious affairs of the Mughal Empire and also for drafting and issuing emperors decrees in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. He died in Agra, India and was buried in the courtyard of a Madrasa built by him. Khwaja Sultan Ali Ibn Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn (d. 970H) was a minister with second Mughal emperor Humayun (1508-1556AD) and later ambassador to Iran during the reign of emperor Akbar (1556-1605AD). Amir Mansoor Khan Ibn Khawaja Sultan Ali (d. 982H) was a senior general in the Mughal army. He died while hunting near Hyderabad Deccan. Shaykh Sayyid Muhammad Adil Khan Ibn Amir Mansoor Khan (d. 1019H) served as a Mughal high-ranking military official in the provinces of Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and Kabul. Shaykh Sayyid Abu Saeed Ibn Shaykh Sayyid Mohammad Adil Khan (d.1043H) was a general in emperor Jahangir's (1569-1627AD) army and later performed important ministerial duties at Jehangir's court. Amir Shaykh Farrukh Zaman Khan Ibn Shaykh Sayyid Abu Saeed (d. 1089H) rose to the illustrious position of the Captain of the Mughal Red Fort at Shahjahanabad in emperor Shah jahan's reign (1627-1659AD) Amir Shah Sajawal Ibn Amir Shaykh Farrukh Zaman Khan (d. 1120H) eleventh in direct descent from Amir Kulal was a Naqshbandi Sufi saint and a tutor to Mughal princes during the reign of emperor Awrangzeb (1659-1707AD) apart from being officer in charge of administration of Mughal court.\n\nAmir Shaykh Muhammad Zaman Sikandrabadi Ibn Amir Shah Sajawal was a leading noble of Sikandrabad (Bulandshahr / India). He lived in the reign of emperor Muhammad Shah (1719-1748AD) and was awarded with an estate at Akbarpur, Salarpur near Dehli.This was a time when the Mughal empire was under severe decline. Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali had sacked Dehli and many noble Muslim families were facing severe economic decline and disorder. However, Amir Shaykh Muhammad Zaman Sikandrabadi's descendants preserved the family traditions of Sufism and were notable sadaats (descendants of Muhammad) of Chehel Amiran (later Koocha Chelan) in Dehli.\n\nDuring the later Mughal period, the family continued to produce eminent men of learning who distinguished themselves in various walks of life. Shaykh Samad Ali ibn Amir Shaykh Mohammad Zaman an accomplished religious scholar and graduate of Rahimiya college (Dehli), a centre of Islamic Renaissance in the subcontinent under Shah Abdul Aziz Ibn Shah Waliullah (1746-1828 AD). Shaykh Mohammad Ali Ibn Shaykh Samad Ali a prominent Naqshbandi Sufi saint of Sikandarabad (Bulandshahr) India. Shaykh Karamat Hussain Ibn Shaykh Mohammad Ali (d. 1898AD) was Kotwal (Chief of Police) in Gwalior the capital of Gwalior State. Another elder of the family Shaykh Nabi Buksh a tutor to Mughal princes was awarded an estate near Dehli in the reign of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah (1837-1857).\n\nDuring the traumatic year of 1857 AD when the War of Independence started, the family played a significant role against the British. Many lost their lives, others fled Dehli and took refuge in small towns / villages namely lncholi, Hapur, Danpur, Aounla, Sambhal, Amroha, Badarpur, Malyana and Jalali. Shaykh Karamat Hussain along with his entire family including his eldest son Shaykh Altaf Hussain (d. 1956AD) and buried in grave yard Bibi Pak Daman, Lahore, Pakistan who was barely seven years old proceeded to Sikandarabad but feeling unsafe due to close proximity of Bulandshahr settled in his ancestor's maternal town Dibai. Shaykh Karamat Hussain died in 1898 and was buried in family graveyard Gulabi Bagh (Dibai). The family lived in Mohalla Shaykhan (Dibai) and later also in Sikandarabad till 1947 AD when on founding of Pakistan migrated to Karachi.\n\nIn memory of their ancestor Amir Kulal, the family's farm located near the village Sarhali Kalan, 37 kilometers south of Lahore, Pakistan, is named Kulal Bagh.\n"}
{"id": "1202179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1202179", "title": "Archbishop of Uppsala", "text": "Archbishop of Uppsala\n\nThe archbishop of Uppsala (spelled Upsala until the early 20th century) has been the primate in Sweden in an unbroken succession since 1164, first during the Catholic era, and from the 1530s and onward under the Lutheran church.\n\nThere have been bishops in Uppsala from the time of Swedish King Ingold the Elder in the 11th century. They were governed by the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen until Uppsala was made an archbishopric in 1164. The archbishop in Lund (which at that time belonged to Denmark) was declared primate of Sweden, meaning it was his right to select and ordain the Uppsala archbishop by handing him the pallium. To gain independence, Folke Johansson Ängel in 1274 went to Rome and was ordained directly by the pope. This practice was increasing, so that no Uppsala archbishop was in Lund after Olov Björnsson, in 1318. In 1457, the archbishop Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) was allowed by the pope to declare himself primate of Sweden.\n\nUppsala (then a village) was originally located a couple of miles to the north of the present city, in what is today known as \"Gamla Uppsala\" (\"Old Uppsala\"). In 1273, the archbishopric, together with the relics of King Eric the Saint, was moved to the market town of Östra Aros, which from then on is named \"Uppsala\".\nIn 1531, Laurentius Petri was chosen by King Gustav I of Sweden (Vasa) to be archbishop, taking that privilege from the pope and in effect making Sweden Protestant. The archbishop was then declared \"primus inter pares\" i.e. first among equals. The archbishop is both bishop of his diocese and Primate of Sweden; he has however no more authority than other bishops, although in effect his statements have a more widespread effect. In 2000, the Archbishop of Uppsala was aided in the diocese by a bishop of Uppsala, currently Ragnar Persenius.\n\nThe labours of the archbishops extended in all directions. Some were zealous pastors of their flocks, such as Jarler and others; some were distinguished canonists, such as Birger Gregerson (1367–83) and Olof Larsson (1435-8); others were statesmen, such as Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna (d. 1467), or capable administrators, such as Jacob Ulfsson Örnfot, who was distinguished as a prince of the Church, royal councillor, patron of art and learning, founder of the University of Upsala and an efficient helper in the introduction of printing into Sweden. There were also scholars, such as Johannes Magnus (died 1544), who wrote the \"Historia de omnibus Gothorum sueonumque regibus\" and the \"Historia metropolitanæ ecclesiæ Upsaliensis\", and his brother Olaus Magnus (d. 1588), who wrote the \"Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus\" and who was the last Catholic Archbishop of Upsala.\n\nThe archbishops and secular clergy found active co-workers among the regular clergy (i.e. religious orders). Among the orders represented in Sweden were the Benedictines, Cistercians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Brigittines (with the mother-house at Wadstena) and Carthusians. A Swedish Protestant investigator, Carl Silfverstolpe, wrote: \"The monks were almost the sole bond of union in the Middle Ages between the civilization of the north and that of southern Europe, and it can be claimed that the active relations between our monasteries and those in southern lands were the arteries through which the higher civilization reached our country.\"\n\nSee Birger Gregersson (1366–83; hymnist and author), Nils Ragvaldsson\n(1438–48; early adherent of Old Norse mythology), Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) (1448–67; King of Sweden), Jakob Ulfsson (1470–1514; founder of Uppsala University), Gustav Trolle (1515–21; supporter of the Danish King), Johannes Magnus (1523-26: wrote an imaginative Scandianian Chronicle), Laurentius Petri (1531–73; main character behind the Swedish Lutheran reformation), Abraham Angermannus (1593–99; controversial critic of the King), Olaus Martini (1601–09), Petrus Kenicius (1609–36),\nLaurentius Paulinus Gothus (1637–46; astronomer and philosopher of Ramus school), Johannes Canuti Lenaeus\n(1647–69; aristotelean and logician), Erik Benzelius the Elder (1700–09; highly knowledgeable), Haquin Spegel (1711–14; public educator), Mattias Steuchius (1714–30),\nUno von Troil (1786–1803; politician), Jakob Axelsson Lindblom\n(1805–19), Johan Olof Wallin (1837–39; beloved poet and hymnist), Karl Fredrik af Wingård (1839–51; politician), Henrik Reuterdahl (1856–70) Anton Niklas Sundberg (1870–1900; outspoken and controversial) and Nathan Söderblom (1914–1931; Nobel Prize winner).\n\nThe first written mention of a bishop at Uppsala is from Adam of Bremen's \"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\" that records in passing Adalvard the Younger appointed as the bishop for \"Sictunam et Ubsalam\" in the 1060s. Swedish sources never mention him either in Sigtuna or Uppsala.\n\nThe medieval \"Annales Suecici Medii Aevi\" and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (\"Henricus scilicet Upsalensis\") in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the \"Chronicon Roskildense\" written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' \"Gesta Danorum\" from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna. Also he is omitted from, or at least redated in, the first list of bishops made in the 15th century. In this list, the first bishop at Uppsala was Sverinius (Siwardus?), succeeded by Nicolaus, Sveno, Henricus and Kopmannus. With the exception of Henricus, the list only mentions their names.\n\nJohannes was ordained by the Archbishop of Lund, Absalon by November 1185. In 1187, a ship from the pagan Estonia entered Mälaren, a lake close to Uppsala, on a plundering expedition. It sailed to Sigtuna, a prosperous city at that time, and plundered it. On its way back, barricades were set up at the only exit point at Almarestäket to prevent the ship from escaping. Johannes was there also. As the ship struggled to pass through, Johannes were among those killed.\nHe was ordained by Absalon. Sweden got a new king, Sverker II of Sweden in 1196, who was related to the Danish Royal Court, whereby Absalon extended his authority over Sweden. When Petrus in 1196 elected three bishops, Absalon requested that the pope decide since the bishops were the sons of other priests, and this was not allowed by papal decree. He also mentioned that several Swedish bishops refused to travel to his synods. Absalon was an authoritative person whom the pope trusted and gave him rights, but by the time the message reached Uppsala Petrus had already died.\n\nIn 1200, Pope Innocent III demanded that Church estate be free from the king's taxes and that clerics be judged only by bishops and prelates, and not civil courts and judges. This was a step in the separation between worldly and spiritual matters, which the Swedish Church had not yet taken. Innocent also demanded that Olov dismiss the two bishops ordained by Petrus.\n\nWhen Uppsala burnt in 1204, Olov's pallium was burnt and he sent a request to Innocent III for a new one to be made.\nValerius was most likely the son of a church man – and the Archbishop of Lund appealed the election to Rome. The pope allowed a dispensation for Valerius on the grounds that there was no other suitable candidate and because Valierus was known as a learned man with good customs and virtues.\n\nValerius joined sides with the King Sverker II of Sweden who belonged to the House of Sverker. The House of Sverker was one of the antagonists in a civil war that had been going on and off since 1130. In 1208 the opposing side, the House of Eric, besieged the capital Stockholm; Sverker and Valierus fled to Denmark.\n\nSverker gathered a small army in Denmark and tried to conquer Sweden but was killed. Valerius then decided to accept King Eric X's authority, and as a result was allowed to return to Uppsala, where he crowned Eric X in 1210. Pope Innocent III sent a letter to Valerius where he proclaimed the procedure to be unauthorised and unlawful, but it seems to have had little impact.\nHe was one of the first known Swedish students at the University of Paris. As archbishop, he established several clerical regulations.\n\nLars was recruited from the recently established Franciscan monastery in Enköping and was most likely a foreigner. The Pope expressed trust in the recently crowned Swedish monarch Birger Jarl who, unlike his predecessors, had promised to support the Church by granting it freedom from taxes and establish missionaries to yet un-Christianised parts – or parts who had returned to paganim – specifically Finland and the Baltic states.\n\nBut this promise was not realised because of the shaky political situation in Sweden. There was an ongoing struggle for power, which eventually forced the antagonists to tax Church property in order to support the war.\n\nLars tried to impose clerical celibacy, which still had not been enforced in Sweden because the low population figures in Sweden required priests to marry and have children. In 1258 Lars sent Pope Alexander IV a request that married clergy not be excommunicated, a request which indicates married clergy were not uncommon.\n\nAlso in 1258 the move of the archdiocese to its present location was decided, but it would not take effect for another decade.\nFolke belonged to the influential family Ängel, which used the Archangel Gabriel as a heraldic charge.\n\nHe was, for unclear reasons, not ordained until 1274. Civil disturbances may have been a cause, but also the reluctance of the cathedral chapter to be under the authority of Lund. In 1274, Folke ignored the Primate of Lund by travelling to Rome and getting ordained by Pope Gregory X himself.\n\nFolke's most important contribution was to commission the moving of the episcopal see from its old location to its present location. At his death he was one of the first to be buried in Uppsala Cathedral.\nWas from the same family as his predecessor. Little else is known about him.\n\nNot ordained. Little is known about him.\n\nLittle is known about him.\n\nHad served as prior at the Sigtuna monastery and Bishop of Åbo. Died in Avignon while travelling to Rome to receive the pallium.\n\nHe studied at the University of Paris in 1278. After returning to Sweden, he became deacon in Uppsala in 1286 and was elected archbishop in 1292. As Nils Allesson was the son of a priest, the cathedral chapter in Lund, Denmark - the primate over Uppsala - appealed the election to the pope. Nils travelled to Rome in 1295 to meet the Pope Boniface VIII and defend his case, which was eventually accepted.\n\nNils was known as a vigorous archbishop. He founded and supervised institutions for safety and order around the archdiocese, such as accommodations for travellers.\nLittle is known about him.\nUnder his time the chapter in Uppsala stopped accepting Archbishop of Lund as primate, and Olov was to be the last Uppsala archbishop to be ordained there.\nHe came from a smaller town in Uppland, the son of the knight Filip Finnvedson, one of the most important men in Uppland (the land of Uppsala). Petrus held various clerical offices until he was elected archbishop. Following the election he travelled to Avignon, the residence of Pope John XXII, to be ordained as bishop.\n\nHe had a strained relationship with the Franciscan order. At the request of Pope Benedict XII, Paul, Archbishop of Nidaros (now Trondheim) in Norway, was to make a judgement on the matter, and this led to a settlement between the two parties in 1339.\n\nIn 1341 Petrus died and was buried in Sigtuna's Dominican order church which today is called Mariakyrkan.\nAt the death of Petrus, Pope Benedict XII wished to occupy the archbishop's seat through commission, but following Hemming's election by the cathedral chapter, Hemming travelled to Avignon and persuaded Benedict to ordain him bishop.\n\nDuring his time, he helped in the political world, made a visitation through Norway and established Uppsala ecclesiastical records. His last will shows that he was also quite wealthy. \nThe first mention of him is from 1320, when he was vicar in Färentuna. He was chancellor of the King Magnus II of Sweden in 1340 and continued to support him during through the 1360s when Sweden was in a civil war.\n\nIn 1342 he was appointed Bishop of Linköping, where he assisted the building of the Linköping Cathedral. He was assessor during King Magnus monetary transactions, among them the repayment of a loan Magnus hade made from the Church. After the new King Albert of Sweden took power, Petrus supported him as well.\nWas known as a vigorous archbishop. He was also a supporter of the Swedish, highly revered, Saint Birgitta (1303–1373), and wrote a biography of her. He also wrote in honour of her and of Saint Botvid, another Swedish saint. As a writer, he has a prominent place in early Swedish literature.\nWas also friends with Saint Birgitta, in Rome and took part in the important political decisions during his years as archbishop, such as the Kalmar Union in 1397.\n\nHad a good economical skill, was a wealthy man, and acquired many farms for the Church. At his death, he left them to the cathedral chapter, but Queen Margaret is said to have taken them in possession instead, which marked the beginning of disputes between the chapter and the states in the union (which lasted until 1520).\n\n\nJöns originated the influential Danish family Lodehat. His uncle was bishop of Roskilde and a former chancellor of the Queen. Jöns himself became, thanks to his family's Royal connection, chancellor to the King of Scandinavia, Eric of Pomerania.\n\nAt the death of the Archbishop Henrik, King Eric appointed Jöns, who had no connection to Uppsala, as new archbishop without regards to the candidates of the chapter.\n\nDuring his time, Jöns paid little respect to the duties of archbishop. He embessled Church property and mistreated Church officials. Eventually, the chapter complained to the Pope, who conducted an investigation and dismissed Jöns Gereksson in 1421.\nWas originally a monk at Vadstena monastery. As archbishop, he freed clericals of taxation, and built a permanent house for the archbishop.\nWhen Olaus Laurentii was elected by the Chapter to become Archbishop of Uppsala and Sweden, the Swedish King Eric of Pomerania was displeased because he was not consulted and therefore decided that Arnold of Bergen should become archbishop in 1433 while Olaus Laurentii was in Rome to be ordained. Arnold moved into the archbishopseat in Uppsala despite protests from the chapter.\n\nThe quarrels were resolved when Arnold died in 1434; then the king decided to accept Olaus Laurentii who had just returned from Rome. \nGustav Eriksson Trolle (1488–1533) was a controversial person. He was in dispute with the king, since he was a supporter of the Danish King Christian II. In 1515 he was removed from office, but barricaded himself in the archbishop's mansion/fortress at Almarestäket, until an assembly of chancellors ordered its destruction in 1517. In 1520, Danish King Christian conquered Swedish territory, and Gustav was reinstated. However, King Christian's reign in Sweden lasted but one year, and in 1521 Gustav was forced to flee to Denmark to seek refuge.\n\nWhen the Pope months later received news of the deposition of Trolle, he ordered the reigning Swedish King Gustav Vasa to reinstate Trolle, not realizing the severity of the matter. Not being allowed to have his selected archbishop consecrated, King Gustav Vasa in effect broke away from the Catholic tradition, making Sweden a Lutheran nation starting 1531.\n\nMagnus was the last Catholic archbishop. He was selected to be archbishop in 1523, but the Pope deemed the disposal of Gustav Trolle unlawful, and demanded he should be reinstated. Gustav Vasa then broke with the Church, and ordained Johannes Magnus in his own ceremony. But before long, Magnus expressed his disapproval of Lutheran teachings, and Gustav Vasa sent him to Russia as a diplomat in 1526.\n\nGustav Vasa appointed a new archbishop, Laurentius Petri, in 1531, and Johannes realized that his time as archbishop was over. He travelled to Rome where he settled for the remainder of his life.\n\nBrother of the previous, with whom he was in exile in Rome. After the death of his brother, Olaus was consecrated by the Pope in 1544, but he never returned home. He was the last Swedish archbishop to get papal consecration.\n\nStaying in Rome, Olaus wrote several highly regarded works about Scandinavia that still interest readers today. He also had published works by his brother Johannes.\n\nHe and his brother Olaus Petri were the main Protestant reformers in Sweden; while his brother was more energetic, Laurentius laid the theoretical foundation for the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571.\nBefore becoming archbishop, Gothus appears to have been inclined towards King Johan III of Sweden's more Catholic viewpoint. He was for this reason ordained by the King in a Catholic ritual with all its apparatus, and wrote the introduction to the King's \"red book\". As the Jesuitic tendencies grew stronger in Sweden in the 1570s, he became more wary; he refused to support the views of the King any longer, and published \"Contra novas papistarum machinationes\" which, although it gives proper respect to the Church fathers, polemizes against the foundation of Catholicism and the Jesuits.\nHe was vicar in Gävle 1570 and is reported as one of the first priests to have used the King's \"red book\" in his sermons, which sparked the King's interest, and he subsequently appointed him archbishop after a four-year vacancy.\n\nBjörnram upset Church officials by declaring that the liturgy of the King was in accordance with the Apostles' Creed and that he supported it. Surprisingly, he nonetheless advocated the reading of Luther's works.\nAngermannus first became known as a critic of the liturgy of King John, and the king had him put him in jail in Åbo, Finland. But he managed to escape back to Stockholm, under the protection of influential friends. However, eventually he had to flee to Germany, where he lived for 11 years. He visited the renowned universities there and wrote several book of Lutheran contents, directed to Swedish readers.\n\nIn 1593 the cathedral chapter in Uppsala elected him archbishop, and he moved back to Sweden and took the seat. He was a harsh critic of Catholicism remnants of which were still in practice around Sweden. In 1599 the King had had enough of him, and prosecuted him. Angermannus was put in prison in Gripsholm, where he was forced to remain until his death in 1607.\nLike his predecessor Angermannus, Bothniensis was imprisoned for 1,5 years due to his resistance to John III's non-Lutheran liturgy.\n\nHe in 1593 became the first professor of theology at the Uppsala University. He died before being consecrated.\n\nBorn 1557 in Uppsala. Educated first in Uppsala, then abroad.He was against the liturgy of King John III of Sweden. He was made archbishop owing to the support of Duke Charles (Charles IX of Sweden), although they later clashed because of their fundamentally different beliefs.\nBorn 1555. Was against the King's liturgy, and was imprisoned for a short time of 1589. Participated in the Uppsala Synod 1593. Was archbishop for a long time, into his old age.\nBorn 1565. Was knowledgeable in several subjects, and was professor of astronomy and logistics at Uppsala University. Wrote several works on astronomy, astrology and theology.\nProfessor of Logic, Hebrew and Greek. Wrote an influential book about the philosophy of Aristotle that revived interest in Aristotelianism and was used as a textbook for several years.\n\nProfessor of Logic at Uppsala where he supported Aristotelian philosophy against the adherents of Ramism. Was considered a highly learned man and was involved in various political and clerical tasks. As an archbishop he did not make any great contribution owing to his advanced age.\n\nCommissioned the new Bible translation and revising the Swedish book of hymns. Published many works, most notably \"A simple explanation of Martin Luther's little catechism\".\n\nBenzelius took an important part in the various ecclesiastical committees active during the reigns of Charles XI and Charles XII, such as that concerning the new Church Law of 1686, the new hymn book of 1695 and the new Bible translation.\n\nHe was a typical representative of 17th-century Swedish Lutheran orthodoxy, careful not to deviate from established theological principles, and lacked originality in his writing. Nevertheless, he was a productive author of works in theology, and his work on church history was used as a textbook for the following century.\n\nHe was an important religious author and hymn writer. He held several bishop's seats before becoming archbishop.\n\n(Uppsala 13 May 1736 – 2 December 1836) was a member of the Swedish Academy. He belonged to the influential noble families von Rosén and Rosenstein.\n\nHe was knowledgeable in the classic languages, had an unusual knowledge of agriculture and was a member of all the Swedish Royal Academies at the time, except for the Academy of Arts. The academies he joined were: the Academy of Science and Literature (joined in 1807), Academy of Science (1808), the Academy of Literature History (1810), the Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (1818), the Swedish Academy (1819), the Scientific society in Uppsala (1820) and the Academy of Music (1822). He was regarded as a generous and social person, friendly, handsome and cheerful.\n\nAfter acquiring his Master of Arts in philosophy and theology and becoming assistant professor in Latin at Uppsala University, he moved to Strängnäs where he was eventually appointed bishop in 1839. He was also an influential politician in the Swedish Riksdag from 1828 to his death.\n\nHe was known as a soft and gently person, and very firm in his beliefs.\nStemming from Malmö, he was orphaned early on and had to rely on others for his education and support. Despite this he managed to get a higher education at the Lund University in theology, philology and Church history, influenced by local academic dignitaries such as Erik Gustaf Geijer and the German Schleiermacher whose works were popular in Lund at the time.\n\nHe later published a comprehensive history of the Church in Sweden, and was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1852.\n\n\nHe acquired a philosophy doctor's degree in Uppsala, became dean and was ordained priest, and then undertook travel through Europe in 1849-50.\n\nHe was known as a controversial person; very outspoken, no stranger to using strong language, despising hypocrisy, but he displayed a notable sense of wit and authority.\n\n\nWas PhD in Uppsala and subsequently a dean and professor of philosophy and bishop of Växjö.\n\nHe wrote many international historical and theological books. For his contribution to the history of the Anglican Church, in 1942 he was awarded the Lambeth Cross, the highest award in the Anglican Church.\n\nHe used his deep historical knowledge when he was archbishop to take measures concerning the organisation, liturgy and methods of preaching; he furthermore had an international interest and was chairman of the Faith and Order commission.\n(Born 19 February 1902 in Eskilstuna; died 13 February 1991 in Uppsala.)\n(Born 25 August 1907 in Svenljunga, Älvsborgs län; died 19 March 1972 in Uppsala.)\nHe officiated at the marriage of present King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia on 19 June 1976, in Storkyrkan in Stockholm.\n\nOn 15 June 2014 Antje Jackelén became Archbishop of Uppsala and primate of the Church of Sweden. She is the first woman to hold that position.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21178549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21178549", "title": "Bhatra", "text": "Bhatra\n\nThe Bhat, Bhatt, Bhatta, Bhatraju, Bhatra, Bhatrai community, refers to a priest, bard, scribe in Sanskrit, a title given to learned Hindu Brahmins, Sikhs and Muslims with Saraswat Brahmin heritage. This community are also known as the Sangat community and are comprised majorly of Sikh, there is also a size able Muslim community (Bhat clan). Today in the United Kingdom there are significant numbers of Sikhs with Bhat ancestry, as there are in India. The majority Bhat Sikhs originate from Punjab and were among the first followers of Guru Nanak in the Punjab community, in India they are classed as raja people (kings) and are well respected people . In the Punjab most Bhat Sikhs are now in Patiala, Amritsar, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur or Bhathinda districts, or in Jalandhar or Chandigarh; they also dwell in other parts of India such as Delhi.\n\nBhat Brahmin priests were engaged in attaining the highest 'spiritual' knowledge (brahmavidya) of Brahman and adhered to different branches (shakhas) of the Vedas. The Brahmin priest was responsible for religious rituals in temples and homes of Hindus. They were authorised (after rigorous training in vedas and 'sacred' rituals) as liaisons between humans and God. In general, as family vocations and businesses are inherited, priesthood is also inherited among Brahmin priestly families. Brahmins are located at the top of the caste pyramid and were followed by the Khastriya (Kings, Warriors), Vaishyas (Merchants, Landlords), Shudras (Servants) and finally the untouchables (street cleaners, leather workers etc).\n\nThe arrival of Islamic invaders in the north of India saw a large scale upheaval for the Hindu Bhat Brahmin's, as many Hindu temples were destroyed leading to the unsettled lives for the fleeing Hindu Bhats. The birth of Sikhism in the north of India caused many Hindu Bhats and some other types of Hindus to embrace the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, becoming Sikh Bhats or Bhatras, etc. The Bhat Sikhs were devoted followers of the Sikh Gurus, where they used there hereditary skills as priests and scribes to recite poetry, write down events, take part in religious discussions and as missionaries. As religious intolerance continued the Bhat Sikh took part in many of the Gurus campaigns against persecution on and intolerance. The Bhats contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp. 1389–1409), known as the \"Bhata de Savaiyye\".<ref name=\"http://www.bhatra.co.uk\"></ref> They also wrote the Bhat Vahis, which were scrolls or records on the Gurus and Sikhism maintained by the Bhat Sikhs.\n\nIn recent times the Bhat Sikhs went on to travel and establish Sikh temples, around the globe mainly in the UK, Canada and the USA. Today's Bhat Sikhs have varied professions.\n\nOther Bhat heritages\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu, people who belong to the hindu caste “Bhatraju” are said to have migrated from North of india to the south, during the relocation of kakathiya king. The Bhatraju clan reside in the villages of Killianwali, tehsil Malout, Muktsar district, and Shergarh (tehsil Dabwali, Sirsa District, Haryana) and other parts of Uttarpradesh. \n\nThe Bhatra Sikhs were originally northern hindu Saraswat Brahmins who eventually became Sikhs, these Brahmins were autochthonous inhabitants who helped found the Indus-Saraswati civilization during 4000-2000BC. They lived in the 700+ archeological sites discovered along the former Saraswati River that once flowed parallel to the Indus in present day Kashmir, Himachal, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan regions. As the intellectual and priestly class of that ancient civilization, they are highly respected and honored for creating the world's oldest literary and religious traditions. They were the original propagators (some argue composers too) of the revered texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads and took these texts into other parts of South Asia. They are considered to be the descendants of the revered Brahmin, \"Sage Saraswat Muni,\" who lived on the banks of the ancient river Saraswati. Around 1900 BC, the river Saraswati started vanishing under ground and the people on its banks started migrating to other parts of South Asia thus forming sub-communities.\nDuring the Islamic invasions of modern day Pakistan and india, many Saraswat Brahmins were forced to flee due to religious oppression. Such as the saraswat Brahmin Kashmiri Pandit.\n\nThe destruction of Hindu temples in India during the Islamic conquest of India occurred from the beginning of the Muslim conquest until the end the Mughal Empire throughout the Indian subcontinent. In the book \"Hindu Temples - What Happened to Them\", Sita Ram Goel produced a politically contentious list of 2000 mosques that it is claimed were built on Hindu temples. During the 14th to 16th century many Saraswat Brahmins were forced to lead unsettled lifes, unable to practice their hereditary profession as Hindu priests, artists, teachers, scribes, technicians class (varna). They used their academia in their unsettled life travelling as scribes, genealogies, bards and astrologists. In the 15th century the religion of Sikhism was born causing many to follow the word of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Further conversions of the Saraswat Brahmins Bhats to Sikhism were induced by a royal preacher by the name of Prince Baba Changa Bhat Rai.\n\nBhatra tradition and Sikh text states their ancestors came from Punjab, where the Raja Shivnabh and his kingdom became the original 16th century followers of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. The Raja's grandson Prince Baba Changa after studying and competing in competition for 14 years under the high Pandit Chetan Gir earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets', and then settled himself and his followers all over India as missionaries to spread the word of Guru Nanak, where most of northern Saraswat Brahmin Bhat became Bhat Sikhs. The Bhats also contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp.1389–1409), known as the \"Bhata de Savaiyye\". They also wrote the Bhat Vahis, which were scrolls or records on the Gurus and Sikhism maintained by the Bhat Sikhs. As Guru Nanak and Sikhism do not support the caste system, the Bhat people do not consider themselves as a caste in the typical sense due to the message of Guru Nanak, but a clan within Sikhism linked by Guru Nanak which is not shackled by the caste system. The majority were from the northern Saraswat Brahmin caste (Bhat clan),(Bhat (surname)) as the Prince Baba Changa Bhat Rai although a kshatriya, trained under Brahmins scholars and shared the Bhat Brahmin heritage due to his passion for religion, many continued to be called the Bhat/Bhat-rai sikhs, eventually leading to the name Bhat-ra Sikh. The sangat also had many members from different areas of the Sikh caste spectrum, such as the Hindu Rajputs and Hindu Jats who joined due to Bhat sikh missionary efforts. The Ramaiya community of Uttar Pradesh is said to be a sub-clan of Bhatra origin. Currently there are many Hindus and Muslims that share the Brahmin Bhat heritage. Today modern Bhat sikhs are commonly known to have pioneered many of the first Gurdwaras outside of India and have donated to various Gurdwaras.\nIn the 17th century Bhats Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das were Saraswat Mohyal Brahmin and were disciples of the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621–1675). They were executed along with the Guru at the Kotwali (police-station) near the Sunehri Masjid in the Chandni Chowk area of Old Delhi, under the express orders of emperor Aurangzeb. Bhat Bhai Sati Das was wrapped in cotton wool and set on fire by the Mughal authorities for refusing to denounce his faith. His brother Bhat Bhai Mati Das was also tortured to death, by having his head sawn in two.\n\nOn 16 December 1634 the Sikh forces under the command of Rai Jodh and Kirt Bhat waged a guerrilla attack on Mughal forces at night, whereby the Sikhs routed and defeated the enemy. Guru Sahib lost 1200 Saint Soldiers including Kirat Bhat Ji. On the other side Sameer Beg and his two sons Shams Beg and Qasim Beg were also killed. The Mughal forces fled to Lahore leaving behind the dead and wounded.\n\nAfter the Battle of Kartarpur, Guru Hargobind Sahib moved towards Kiratpur Sahib, which was under the rule of Raja Tara Chand (a hill state chief). Guru Sahib's entourage was suddenly ambushed by a contingent of royal forces under the command of Ahmed Khan in the village Palahi near Phagwara town on 29 April 1635. It caused considerable loss on the Guru's soldiers. In which Bhai Dasa Ji and Bhai Sohela Ji (sons of Ballu Bhat, and grandsons of Mula Bhat) sacrificed their lives.\n\nMany Religious Bhats also went to fight as \"warrior-saints\" against Mughal persecution in the Khalsa campaign inspired by Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Since many Bhat lived as travelling missionaries, their mobility led them to depend on occupations which did not require a settled life.\n\nBhat Kirat’s grandson Bhat Narbadh (son of Keso Singh) was in attendance to Guru Gobind Singh and accompanied him to Nanded (now Sachkand Hazur Sahib) where Guru Ji spent his last days. In the Bhat-Vahis, Bhat Narbadh records an entry, of the conferment of Guruship upon the Guru Granth Sahib in 1708 upon the death of Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nBy the 19th century Bhat was the name of a caste or \"jati\" within the Indian tradition of social classes, each with its own occupation. Even though Sikhism itself does not support separation by caste, the social system meant that the Bhat followed a hereditary profession of missionaries, bards,scribes, poets and genealogists while some also foretold the future, if they were considered to have clairvoyant or astrological ability's, most of which were from a Brahmin heritage, eventually becoming salesman due to economic change however it is not uncommon to see Bhats in other professions such as farming and retail. According to Nesfield as quoted in W. Crooke, The Tribes and Castes of the North Western India, 1896, Bhats frequently visited the courts of princes and the camps of warriors, recited their praises in public, and kept records of their genealogies. They have been praised for business acumen, described as people with \"a spirit of enterprise\". They were a small clan compared to others and many people in india did not know of them. Though some lived in Lahore, many Bhat can trace their roots to villages around Sialkot and Gurdaspur Districts.\n\nIn the 21st century due to the changing world and new opportunities which are available, Bhats have almost completely left their missionary and hereditary professions, to pursue careers in Engineering, Medicine, Law, Banking, Politics, Music etc.\n\nAccording to the \"Sikh Encyclopedia\", Bhat is related to the Sanskrit word \"bhatta\", a bard or poet.\n\nGuru Nanak met Raja Shivnabh, who was the grandfather of Changa Rai. The Guru bestowed the title of sangat on the Raja and his people, united seven kingdoms and made the Raja Shivnabh leader of them all. Some scholars consider the Raja was the ruler of Batticaloa.\n\nTheafter the grandson of Raja Shivnabh, Changa Rai or Changa Bhat, a disciple of Guru Nanak's mentioned in the Janamsakhis. Earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets, and then settled himself and his few followers all over India as missionaries, where many Sikhs and general Indians became Bhat Sikhs., A congregation led by a teacher called Baba Changa Rai is described in an old document called the \"Haqiqat Rah Muqam\". \nThe \"Sikh Encyclopedia\" discusses the link between Bhat Sikhs,Raja Shivnabh and Prince Changa Bhat, who became a disciple of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Due to the Princes title ‘Bhat Rai’ he added Bhat to his name and spread the word of Guru Nanak to his followers, who also became known as Bhats or Bhatras.\n\nBhatra Sikhs are said to have a mixed ancestry, the mass majority of Bhats were Punjabi saraswat Brahmin. The Northern traveling Saraswat Hindu Brahmins joined Sikhism due to the message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the preaching efforts of the Sikh prince Baba changa Bhat Rai. However, as by the commandment of Guru Nanak, caste discrimination was deemed as blasphemy and so the Sikh Bhats also have a mixed ancestry due to the missionary work of the Bhat prince and his followers to spread the message of Sikhism. Some Kambojas, Tarkhan, Jat, Rajput, Khatri, Gujjars and others also joined. Many Bhats are apart of the Khalsa and Nihang of Sikhism.\n\nM.S. Ahluwalia, a Senior Fellow at the Indian Council of Historical Research, New Delhi, offers historical evidence for Guru Nanak's presence in Sri Lanka, probably in the year 1510. A place called Singaldeep or Sangladeep is often mentioned in 'Hakikat-Rah-Mukaam-Shivnabh-Raje-Ki' and is stated to be in Sri Lanka.\n\nBhat Sikhs started to arrive in the United Kingdom in the 1920s, but most immigrated in the late 1940s or 1950s.\n\nIn the 1920s some men travelled to Britain to work as door-to-door salesmen, most leaving their families in the Punjab to begin with. By the time of the Second World War there were a few hundred Sikhs clustered in British seaports like Cardiff, Bristol, and Southampton and Hull. Some returned to India when war broke out, but others stayed on and used contacts with Punjabi merchant seamen to import scarce goods.\n\nThe Partition of India in 1947 led many Sikhs to emigrate, and the Bhat population in the UK was greatly enlarged. Later arrivals tended to join relatives, friends and neighbours from the Punjab, so that some British Bhat communities have links to one or two particular villages. Difficult journeys following Partition are not forgotten. The Edinburgh Sikh women's group (Sikh Sanjog) has exhibited artwork telling the story of leaving the Punjab and arriving in a strange land. A 2001 obituary of a senior figure in the Cardiff Bhat community described the trials of leaving northern India in turbulent times.\n\nThe traditional Bhat profession of itinerant salesman, Business men and taxi drivers was useful to those arriving in the UK, and was \"a skill with considerable potential\". At first most Bhat, like some other Sikhs, worked either as doorstep or market traders (working with the Khatri community), but some settled in big cities like Leeds or Birmingham, gave up self-employment and took waged jobs in industry. (At this time many educated immigrants to Britain had difficulty finding employment suited to their qualifications and experience, because of racial and/or cultural prejudice.)\n\nBhat traders gradually moved into other roles as self-employed businessmen, often specialising in retailing. By the end of the 1950s selling door-to-door was less common and many British Bhat Sikhs moved towards commercial enterprises like market stalls, shops, supermarkets and wholesale warehouses.\n\n‘One group of Sikhs who kept their\nturbans were a group called Bhartedas (sic)’.\n\nWhen possible the Bhat community have established Gurdwaras (temples). The first of which was opened in Manchester in 1953. As of 2006 there are more than 30 Bhat or Bhat Sikh temples in the UK, the newest being the one opened in Peterborough in 2004. In some British towns Bhats are a small proportion of the overall Sikh population (in Glasgow 5%); elsewhere, as in Edinburgh, they are in the majority. Many Bhats took the role of Gyanis in the newer established Gurdwara, especially in Luton and Leicester.\n\n\n\n"}

It was situated on the south-western corner of the Palatine hill, where it slopes down towards the Circus Maximus, near the so-called \"Steps of Cacus\". It was a traditional single-roomed peasants' hut of the Latins, with straw roof and wattle-and-daub walls, such as are reproduced in miniature in the distinctive funerary urns of the so-called Latial culture (ca. 1000 - ca. 600 BC).\n\nOver the centuries, the \"casa\" was repeatedly damaged by fire and storms, but carefully restored to its original state on each occasion. Destruction by fire is recorded for 38 BC, as a result of a ceremony held inside the \"casa\" by the \"pontifices\" (\"College of High Priests\"), presumably a burnt sacrifice to Romulus in his deified state as the god Quirinus, during which the altar-fire probably ran out of control. The last recorded fire was in 12 BC, on the death of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, right-hand man of the first Roman emperor, Augustus (ruled 30 BC - AD 14). On this occasion, the \"casa\" was apparently set on fire by some crows which dropped pieces of burning meat, again snatched from an altar, onto the thatched roof. It has been speculated that a \"tugurium Faustini\" on the Palatine recorded in the time of the emperor Constantine I the Great (ruled AD 312-37) was in reality the still surviving \"casa Romuli\".\n\nA second \"casa Romuli\" is recorded in the classical sources, on the Capitoline Hill, probably a replica of the original. It is last mentioned in AD 78.\n\nTo date, archaeologists have been unable to definitively associate the \"casa Romuli\" with any extant remains. A strong candidate is the largest of a group of dwellings whose foundations were unearthed in the appropriate location during excavations in 1946. The dwelling's foundations were cut into the tufa bedrock, with an ovoid 4.9m X 3.6m perimeter. Six post-holes arranged in a circle of which one in the centre were presumably to accommodate the supporting struts for walls and roof respectively. Organic material found in the site has been dated to the Italian early Iron Age (ca. 900-700 BC).\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of group of religious buildings that include the Royal Church, and originally built by the Visigoths in the 7th century, in the form of a Greek cross. Since 1944, it has been classified as a National Monument ().\n\nBased on historical accounts, and oral tradition, the site of the chapel was (around 560 A.D.) the location of a small Roman villa and, likely, a temple dedicated to the god Asclepius.\n\nIn 656, Fructuosus of Braga, then Bishop of Bracara, founded on this site the Monastery of São Salvador, ordering the construction of the chapel, as his tomb. In the biography of his life, São Valerius confirms as much, mentioning that the saint who founded the convent was buried there (between 665 and 666).\n\nIn the 9th-10th century, the chapel was reconstructed and redecorated. From a document dated in 883, the chapel was reconsecrated to \"São Salvador\", also affirming the original construction to between 656 and 665.\n\nAround the 12th century, following the Reconquista from the Arabs, with the revival of the Christian community and affinity for \"Saint\" Frutuoso of Braga, a cult to the saint was begun. In 1102, the Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, D. Diogo Gelmires, transferred the mortal remains of Frutuoso to Compostela.\n\nIn 1523, Archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa founded the Franciscan convent of the Order of the \"Capuchos da Piedade\", alongside the chapel of São Frutuoso, likely destroying the older Monastery of São Salvador.\n\nFrom notes by friar Manuel de Monforte (in 1696), in his \"Crónica da Província da Piedade\" (\"Chronicle of the Province of Piedade\"), the chapel \"is in [the shape of a cross] with all sides equal; whose points form four chapels, whose walls close in a half-circle. One of the chapels, which one can call the foot of the cross, serves as the entrance where the door is; another which rightly corresponds to this one, as the head of the cross, serves as the principal chapel, or where the altar is; in the other two, which are the arms, are the two collateral altars; having both about 17 palms, and half a square, in this so small space this church has 24 columns: four at the main entrance to the door, six in each collateral chapel, and eight in the main of all...\".\n\nIn 1728, by order of Archibishop D. Rodrigo de Moura Teles, the beginnings of a reconstruction and remodelling of the Convent of São Francisco's Church is undertaken, with the chapel of São Frutuoso integrated into the Church. From this point forward, the Chapel is accessible from the main Church, owing to significant alterations; this changes include, the destruction of the main façade, the modification of the eastern and western arms of the Latin cross-design; and alterations to the internal columns, including changes to the baldachins.\n\nIt was architect Ernest Korrodi who first promoted the recuperation of the original plan for the chapel (in 1897), publishing a small note entitled \"Um Monumento Latino-Bizantino em Portugal\" (\"A Latin-Byzantine Monument in Portugal\"). More than a century would pass, before João de Moura Coutinho e Sousa Lobo would begin to restore the original plan in 1931. The architect followed the original hypothesis that the chapel was ordered constructed by Fructuosus of Braga as his 6th century tomb, following a model/design aesthetic based on the mausoleum Galla Placidia in Ravenna. This redesign was followed by the DGEMN reconstruction of cupola and roof in 1939, again in 1941, repairs in 1958, that included the reconstruction of the walls, door, plastering of the cupola and several projects around the churchyard. In 1961, the pavement, main arch, reconstruction of the staircase and consolidation of the vaulted ceiling were undertaken, followed by conservation projects in 1966. Similar repairs were undertaken in 1970 (repair and cleaning of the roof), in 1973 (checking of the rood, repairs, painting conservancy and arrangement of the area around the chapel), in 1984 (arrangement of the roof and paintings) and in 1987 (new projects evolving conservancy).\n\nThe chapel is situated on the eastern lateral façade of the church of the Convent of São Francisco, below the level of the latter. While access to the interior of the chapel is made from the church, its original exterior access was made from through a small enclosed courtyard and gates. East of the chapel are the ruins of the old convent and its dependencies, in addition to the Fountain of Santo António () which is further below these buildings. To the southeast, the old granite pavement leads to the Quinta do Lago (\"Estate of the Lake\") and the Escola Primária de Real (\"Primary School of Real\") to the west.\n\nThe chapel of São Frutuoso continues to be an enigma, but it is a uniquely rare example of Visigothic structures in Portugal, based on a Greek-cross, which may have followed the design of a Byzantine mausoleum comparable to the \nGalla Placidia, in Ravenna.\n\nThe church is laid out in a Greek cross design, with a rectangular exterior, and semi-circular interior arms (to the north, south and east). From the exterior, the main volume of the chapel is surmounted by a tower-like cupola and cross, with the roof covered in rounded tiles. The limestone walls are surmounted by edged cornices, preceded by frieses, also in limestone, in the shape of rope, semi-circles, six-pointed rosettas and fleur-de-lis. The collateral façades are decorated with blind arcades, alternating between angular and double rounded-frieses, which are repeated in the tower cupola, and intersected by small round windows. The principal façade, which was the main entrance at one time, is highlighted by a grand arch portico, preceded by staircase. In northern part of the eastern arm of the chapel is an arcosolium, where the mortel remains of Saint Fructuosus was originally entombed, and exposed to the exterior.\n\nThe inner masonry walls are defined by round arches, supported by large pillars, above which are large decorated friezes, with triple horseshoe-shaped arches, and a larger central arch. The chapel's arms are crossed in the middle of the wall by a narrow ribbon of limestone. While the interior arms are supported by wooden joists, the interior part of the hemispherical dome is plastered and painted white. The granite floor slabs are inscribed with coat of arms, and preceded from the main church by a staircase to the lower chapel.\n\n\n"}

Dozens of regional and local Taoist associations are included in this overarching group, which is encouraged by the government to be a bridge between Chinese Taoists and the government, to encourage a patriotic merger between Taoism and government initiatives. The group also disseminates information on traditional Taoist topics, including forums and conferences. The association was a major sponsor of the 2007 International Forum on the Tao Te Ching. The Chinese Taoist Association advocates the recompensation of losses inflicted on Taoism by the Cultural Revolution. Taoism was banned for several years in the People's Republic of China during that period. \n\nTaoist practitioners in China are required to register with the Chinese Taoist Association in order to be granted recognition and official protection. The CTA exercises control over religious doctrine and personnel, and dictates the proper interpretation of Taoist doctrine. It also encourages Taoist practitioners to support the Communist Party and the state. For example, a Taoist scripture reading class held by the CTA in November 2010 required participants to ‘‘fervently love the socialist motherland [and] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.’’ The central government of China has supported and encouraged the Association, along with other official religious groups, in promoting the \"harmonious society\" initiative of Communist Party General Secretary Hu Jintao. \n\n"}
{"id": "2353513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2353513", "title": "Clear (Scientology)", "text": "Clear (Scientology)\n\nIn dianetics and Scientology, Clear is one of the major states practitioners strive to reach on their way up the Bridge to Total Freedom. The state of Clear is reached when a person becomes free of the influence of engrams, unwanted emotions or painful traumas not readily available to the conscious mind. Scientologists believe that human beings accumulate anxieties, psychosomatic illnesses, and aberration due to receiving engrams throughout their lives, and that by applying Dianetics, every single person can reach the state of Clear.\n\nA Clear is defined by the Church of Scientology as person who no longer has a \"reactive mind\", and is therefore free from the reactive mind's negative effects. A Clear is said to be \"at cause over\" (that is, in control of) their \"mental energy\" (their thoughts), and able to think clearly even when faced with the very situations that in earlier times caused them difficulty. The next level of spiritual development is that of an Operating Thetan. A person who has not reached a state of Clear is called a \"pre-clear.\"\n\nDianetics states that a person's awareness is influenced by the stimulus-response nature of the reactive mind. Achieving the state of Clear means a person has overcome the reactive mind and is in complete control of their analytical mind. According to Hubbard: \"A Clear is a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause. The Clear has no engrams which, when restimulated, throw out the correctness of his computations by entering hidden and false data.\" Sociologist Roy Wallis noted, “Being Clear meant being able to do all those things which one could currently not do, and to which one aspired so desperately.” It is estimated that the cost of reaching the Clear state in Scientology is $128,000.\n\nIn \"\", L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, states that becoming a Clear strengthens a person's native individuality and creativity, and that a Clear is free with his emotions. In \"The State Of Clear,\" a Clear is defined as \"a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause\". Hubbard states that merely knowing what the cognition is does not have the effect of realizing it for oneself:\n\nHubbard described Clears as having \"an awareness which can create energy at will, and can handle and control, erase or re-create an analytical or reactive mind\". Hubbard claimed that Clears have complete memories and know why events in their lives have happened, which leaves them free to pursue their goals without hindrances (the \"reactive mind\") emanating from past experiences. Religious scholar Pat Cook compared being \"Clear\" to the concept of nirvana in Zen Buddhism: like nirvana in Buddhism, Clear is a state of being that is highly desired and respected in Scientology.\n\nThe Clear state is said to be achieved through the Scientology practice of auditing. A person undergoing auditing is called a \"pre-clear\", often abbreviated to \"PC\", in Scientology terminology. The Church of Scientology claims that if all individuals in the world were “Clear”, the world would be “free of drugs, war, pollution, crime, mental illness and other ills.”\n\nAfter attaining the state of Clear, a person may go on to study the Operating Thetan levels, which are described in Scientology materials as states where the ability to operate outside the body via \"exteriorization\" becomes commonplace. Beyond that comes \"Cleared Theta Clear\", which Hubbard describes this way:\n\nA thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move <nowiki>MEST [matter, energy, space, and time]</nowiki> and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence.\n\nThere are several conflicting accounts of who first attained the state of Clear, and under what circumstances. In August 1950, amidst the success of \"\", Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as \"the world's first Clear.\" However, despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie. Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word \"now\" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in \"present time,\" which blocked her abilities.\n\nLater, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working \"incognito\" in Hollywood posing as a swami.\n\nIn 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear. McMaster had joined Scientology around 1962, having experienced relief of chronic stomach pain after his first auditing session. He became a leading public spokesman for Scientology and later a member of the Sea Org. He left in November 1969, expressing continuing belief in the Scientology Tech, but disapproval of the way Scientology was managed.\n\n\n"}

Blavatsky.\n\n\"Devachan\" is regarded as the place where most souls go after death where desires are gratified, corresponding to the Christian belief in Heaven. However, Devachan is a temporary, intermediate state of being before the soul's eventual rebirth into the physical world. \nC.W. Leadbeater located the \"Devachan\" on the mental plane many miles far above the surface of Earth. While those souls at the zeroth level of initiation (the vast majority of the inhabitants of Earth) go to Summerland (located on the astral plane only a few miles above the surface of Earth) when they die, those who have reached the first, second, or third levels of initiation go to Devachan when they die. The final Heaven where souls at the fourth level of initiation (those souls who have become arhats and no longer need to reincarnate) is called Nirvana. When reaching the fourth level of initiation, one can become a pratyekabuddha and enter Nirvana right away, or become a buddha or bodhisattva and teach others before entering. One can also choose to become a Master in the Spiritual Hierarchy upon reaching the fourth level of initiation—then one's entrance into Nirvana is delayed for millions, billions, or trillions of years until one has completed climbing the ladder of initiation by completing one's tasks as a Master in the Spiritual Hierarchy.\n\nFrom the perspective of anthroposophy Rudolf Steiner asserts that the Lower Devachan (or the Heavenly World) and Higher Devachan (or the World of Reason) are two \"supersensible\" realms, above the astral realm, associated with emotions and will impulse, respectively. In comparison, the mental realm is associated with thought.\n\n"}
{"id": "207593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207593", "title": "Dick Gregory", "text": "Dick Gregory\n\nRichard Claxton Gregory (October 12, 1932 – August 19, 2017) was an American comedian, civil rights activist, social critic, writer, conspiracy theorist, entrepreneur, and occasional actor. During the turbulent 1960s, Gregory became a pioneer in stand-up comedy for his \"no-holds-barred\" sets, in which he mocked bigotry and racism. He performed primarily to black audiences at segregated clubs until 1961, when he became the first black comedian to successfully cross over to white audiences, appearing on television and putting out comedy record albums.\n\nGregory was at the forefront of political activism in the 1960s, when he protested the Vietnam War and racial injustice. He was arrested multiple times and went on many hunger strikes. He later became a speaker and author, primarily promoting spirituality.\n\nGregory died of heart failure at a Washington, D.C., hospital at age 84 in August 2017.\n\nGregory was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Lucille, a housemaid, and Presley Gregory. When he was nine years old, he was the victim of a racist attack for touching a white woman's leg while shining her shoes. At Sumner High School, he was aided by teachers, among them Warren St. James; he also excelled at running. Gregory earned a track scholarship to Southern Illinois University (SIU), where he set school records as a half-miler and miler. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 1954, his college career was interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the United States Army. At the urging of his commanding officer, who had taken notice of his penchant for joking, Gregory got his start in comedy in the Army, where he entered and won several talent shows. In 1956, Gregory briefly returned to SIU after his discharge, but dropped out because he felt that the university \"didn't want me to study, they wanted me to run.\"\n\nIn the hopes of becoming a professional comedian, Gregory moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he became part of a new generation of black comedians that included Nipsey Russell, Bill Cosby, and Godfrey Cambridge, all of whom broke with the minstrel tradition that presented stereotypical black characters. Gregory drew on current events, especially racial issues, for much of his material: \"Segregation is not all bad. Have you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt?\"\n\nGregory began his career as a comedian while serving in the military in the mid-1950s. He served in the Army for a year and a half at Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Lee in Virginia, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. He was drafted in 1954 while attending Southern Illinois University. After being discharged in 1956, he returned to the university but did not receive a degree. He moved to Chicago with a desire to perform comedy professionally.\n\nIn 1958, Gregory opened the Apex Club nightclub in Illinois. The club failed and landed Gregory in financial hardship. In 1959, Gregory landed a job as master of ceremonies at the Roberts Show Club.\n\nWhile working for the United States Postal Service during the daytime, Gregory performed as a comedian in small, primarily black-patronized nightclubs. He was one of the first black comedians to gain widespread acclaim while performing for white audiences. In an interview with \"The Huffington Post\", Gregory described the history of black comics as limited: \"Blacks could sing and dance in the white night clubs but weren't allowed to stand flat-footed and talk to white folks, which is what a comic does.\"\n\nIn 1961, Gregory was working at the black-owned Roberts Show Bar in Chicago when he was spotted by Hugh Hefner. Gregory was performing the following material before a largely white audience:\n\nGregory attributed the launch of his career to Hefner. Based on his performance at Roberts Show Bar, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago Playboy Club as a replacement for comedian \"Professor\" Irwin Corey.\n\nGregory made his first television appearance on the late night show \"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\". He soon began appearing nationally and on television.\n\nEarly in his career, Gregory was offered an engagement on \"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\". Paar's show was known for helping propel entertainers to the next level of their careers. At the time, black comics did perform on the show, but after their performances, they were never asked to stay and sit on the famous couch and talk with the host. Dick Gregory declined several invitations from Jack Paar to perform on the show. Paar finally called him to find out why he refused to perform on his show. In order to have Gregory perform, the producers eventually agreed to allow him to stay after his performance and talk with the host on air. This was a first in the show's history. Gregory's interview on \"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\" spurred conversations across America.\n\nGregory's comedy occasioned controversy in some conservative white circles. The administration of the University of Tennessee, for instance, branded Gregory an \"extreme racist\" whose \"appearance would be an outrage and an insult to many citizens of this state\", and revoked his invitation by students to speak on campus. The students sued, with noted litigator William Kunstler as their counsel, and in \"Smith v. University of Tennessee\", 300 F. Supp. 777 (E.D. Tenn. 1969), won an order from the court that the University's policy was \"too broad and vague\". The University of Tennessee then implemented an \"open speaker\" system, and Gregory subsequently performed in April 1970.\n\nGregory was number 82 on Comedy Central's list of the \"100 Greatest Stand-ups\" of all time and had his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nHe was a co-host with radio personality Cathy Hughes, and was a frequent morning guest, on WOL 1450 AM talk radio's \"The Power\", the flagship station of Hughes' Radio One. He also appeared regularly on the nationally syndicated \"Imus in the Morning\" program.\n\nGregory appeared as \"Mr. Sun\" on the television show \"Wonder Showzen\" (the third episode, entitled \"Ocean\", aired in 2005). As Chauncey, a puppet character, imbibes a hallucinogenic substance, Mr. Sun warns, \"Don't get hooked on imagination, Chauncey. It can lead to terrible, horrible things.\" Gregory also provided guest commentary on the \"Wonder Showzen\" Season One DVD. Large segments of his commentary were intentionally bleeped out, including the names of several dairy companies, as he made potentially defamatory remarks concerning ill effects that the consumption of cow milk has on human beings.\n\nGregory attended and spoke at the funeral of James Brown on December 30, 2006, in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nGregory was an occasional guest on the Mark Thompson's \"Make It Plain\" Sirius Channel 146 Radio Show from 3pm to 6pm PST.\n\nGregory appeared on \"The Alex Jones Show\" on September 14, 2010, March 19, 2012, and April 1, 2014.\n\nGregory gave the keynote address for Black History Month at Bryn Mawr College on February 28, 2013.\nHis take-away message to the students was to never accept injustice.\n\nEven as late as 2013, Gregory continued to be a ringing voice of the black power movement. Towards the end of his life, he was featured in a Fantagraphics book by Pat Thomas entitled \"Listen, Whitey: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975\", which uses the political recordings of the Civil Rights era to highlight sociopolitical meanings throughout the movement. Gregory is known for comedic performances that not only made people laugh, but mocked the establishment. According to Thomas, Gregory's monologues reflect a time when entertainment needed to be political to be relevant, which is why he included his standup in the collection. Gregory is featured along with the likes of Huey P. Newton, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., Langston Hughes and Bill Cosby.\n\nJoe Morton played Dick Gregory in 2016 in the play \"Turn Me Loose\" at the Westside Theatre in Manhattan.\n\nGregory met his future wife Lillian Gregory at an African-American club; they married in 1959. They had 11 children (including one son, Richard Jr., who died two months after birth): Michele, Lynne, Pamela, Paula, Stephanie (also known as Xenobia), Gregory, Christian, Miss, Ayanna, and Yohance. He was criticized for being an absent father. In a 2000 interview with \"The Boston Globe\", Gregory was quoted as saying, \"People ask me about being a father and not being there. I say, 'Jack the Ripper had a father. Hitler had a father. Don't talk to me about family.'\"\n\nGregory was active in the civil rights movement. On October 7, 1963, he came to Selma, Alabama, and spoke for two hours on a public platform two days before the voter registration drive known as \"Freedom Day\" (October 7, 1963).\n\nIn 1964, Gregory became more involved in civil rights activities, activism against the Vietnam War, economic reform, and anti-drug issues. As a part of his activism, he went on several hunger strikes and campaigns in America and overseas. In the early 1970s, he was banned from Australia, where government officials feared he would \"...stir up demonstrations against the Vietnam war.\"\n\nIn 1964, Gregory played a role in the search for three missing civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, who vanished in Philadelphia, Mississippi. After Gregory and members of CORE met with Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey, Gregory became convinced that the Sheriff's office was complicit. With cash provided by Hugh Hefner, Gregory announced a $25,000 reward for information. The FBI, which had been criticized for inaction, eventually followed suit with its own reward, and the rewards worked. The bodies of the three men were found by the FBI 44 days after they disappeared.\n\nAt a civil rights rally marking the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Gregory criticized the United States, calling it \"the most dishonest, ungodly, unspiritual nation that ever existed in the history of the planet. As we talk now, America is 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 96 percent of the world's hard drugs\".\n\nGregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with that of John F. Kennedy. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as \"Rush to Judgment\". The pair wrote the King conspiracy book \"Code Name Zorro\", which postulated that convicted assassin James Earl Ray did not act alone. Gregory also argued that the moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks is incorrect, among other conspiracy theories.\n\nIn 1966, Gregory and his wife were arrested for illegal net fishing along side of the Nisqually people in Washington state in a protest fish-in. The tribe was protesting against the state laws that ban forms of fishing other than hook-and-line because it barred their rights guaranteed to them through a federal treaty that allowed them to fish in their traditional ways. He was later released from jail in Olympia, Washington after six weeks of fasting to call attention to the violation of Native American treaties by the United States government.\n\nGregory began his political career by running against Richard J. Daley for Mayor of Chicago in 1967. Though he did not win, this would not prove to be the end of his participation in electoral politics.\n\nGregory ran for President of the United States in 1968 as a write-in candidate of the Freedom and Peace Party, which had broken off from the Peace and Freedom Party. He garnered 47,097 votes, including one from Hunter S. Thompson, with fellow activist Mark Lane as his running mate in some states. His running mate in New Jersey was Dr. David Frost of Plainfield, a biologist, Rutgers professor, and Chairman of NJ SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy).Famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock was the running mate in Virginia and Pennsylvania garnering more than the party he had left. The Freedom and Peace Party also ran other candidates, including Beulah Sanders for New York State Senate and Flora Brown for New York State Assembly. His efforts landed him on the master list of Nixon's political opponents.\n\nGregory then wrote the book \"Write Me In\" about his presidential campaign. One anecdote in the book relates the story of a publicity stunt that came out of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago. The campaign had printed dollar bills with Gregory's image on them, some of which made it into circulation, causing considerable problems, but priceless publicity. The majority of these bills were quickly seized by the federal government. A large contributing factor to the seizure came from the bills resembling authentic United States currency enough that they worked in many dollar-cashing machines of the time. Gregory avoided being charged with a federal crime, later joking that the bills could not really be considered United States currency, because \"everyone knows a black man will never be on a U.S. bill.\"\n\nShortly after this time, Gregory became an outspoken critic of the findings of the Warren Commission concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. On March 6, 1975, Gregory and assassination researcher Robert J. Groden appeared on Geraldo Rivera's late night ABC talk show \"Goodnight America\". An important historical event happened that night when the famous Zapruder film of JFK's assassination was shown to the public on TV for the first time. The public's response and outrage to its showing led to the forming of the Hart-Schweiker investigation, which contributed to the Church Committee Investigation on Intelligence Activities by the United States, which resulted in the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation.\n\nGregory was an outspoken feminist, and in 1978 joined Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, Margaret Heckler, Barbara Mikulski, and other suffragists to lead the \"National ERA March for Ratification and Extension\", a march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the United States Capitol of over 100,000 on Women's Equality Day (August 26), 1978, to demonstrate for a ratification deadline extension for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, and for the ratification of the ERA. The march was ultimately successful in extending the deadline to June 30, 1982, and Gregory joined other activists to the Senate for celebration and victory speeches by pro-ERA Senators, Members of Congress, and activists. The ERA narrowly failed to be ratified by the extended ratification date.\n\nOn July 21, 1979, Gregory appeared at the Amandla Festival where Bob Marley, Patti LaBelle, and Eddie Palmieri, amongst others, performed. Gregory gave a speech before Marley's performance, blaming President Carter, and showing his support for the international Anti-Apartheid Movement. \n\nGregory was an outspoken activist during the US Embassy Hostage Crisis in Iran. In 1980, he traveled to Tehran to attempt to negotiate the hostages' release and engaged in a public hunger strike there, weighing less than 100 pounds (45 kg) when he returned to the United States.\n\nGregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with that of John F. Kennedy. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as \"Rush to Judgment\". The pair wrote the King conspiracy book \"Code Name Zorro\", which postulated that convicted assassin James Earl Ray did not act alone. Gregory also argued that the moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks is incorrect, among other conspiracy theories.\n\nIn 1998, Gregory spoke at the celebration of the birthday of Dr Martin Luther King Jr., with President Bill Clinton in attendance. Not long after, the President told Gregory's long-time friend and public relations consultant Steve Jaffe, \"I love Dick Gregory; he is one of the funniest people on the planet.\" They spoke of how Gregory had made a comment on Dr. King's birthday that broke everyone into laughter, when he noted that the President made Speaker Newt Gingrich ride \"in the back of the plane,\" on an Air Force One trip overseas.\n\nGregory was diagnosed with lymphoma in late 1999. He said he was treating the cancer with herbs, vitamins, and exercise, which he believed kept the cancer in remission.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, Gregory was a figure in the health food industry by advocating for a raw fruit and vegetable diet. He wrote the introduction to Viktoras Kulvinskas' book \"Survival into the 21st Century\". Gregory first became a vegetarian in the 1960s and lost a considerable amount of weight by going on extreme fasts, some lasting upwards of 50 days. He developed a diet drink called \"Bahamian Diet Nutritional Drink\" and went on TV shows advocating his diet and to help the morbidly obese.\n\nIn 2003, Gregory and Cornel West wrote letters on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to Kentucky Fried Chicken's CEO, asking that the company improve its animal-handling procedures.\n\nIn 2008, Gregory stated he believed that air pollution and intentional water contamination with heavy metals such as lead and possibly manganese may be being used against black Americans, especially in urban neighborhoods, and that such factors could be contributing to high levels of violence in black communities.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Gregory announced that he was going on a hunger strike. In a commentary that was published by the Centre for Research on Globalisation Web site in Montreal, he said that he doubted the official U.S. report about the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nIn 1984, he founded Health Enterprises, Inc., a company that distributed weight-loss products. With this company, Gregory made efforts to improve the life expectancy of African Americans, which he believed was being hindered by poor nutrition and drug and alcohol abuse. In 1985, Gregory introduced the \"Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet\", a powdered-diet mix. He launched the weight-loss powder at the Whole Life Expo in Boston under the slogan \"It's cool to be healthy\". The diet mix, if drunk three times a day, was said to provide rapid weight loss. Gregory received a multimillion-dollar distribution contract to retail the diet.\n\nIn 1985, the Ethiopian government adopted, to reported success, Gregory's formula to combat malnutrition during a period of famine in the country. Gregory's clients included Muhammad Ali.\n\nIn 2014, Dick Gregory updated his original 4X formula, which was the basis for the Bahamian Diet and created his new and improved \"Caribbean Diet for Optimal Health\".\n\nSome of his health treatments have been described as \"unorthodox\" and \"profitable rot\".\n\nA week prior to his death, Gregory was hospitalized in Washington, D.C., with a bacterial infection. He died at the hospital in Washington, D.C., on August 19, 2017, at the age of 84. The cause was heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This festival is dedicated to Sri Krishna. On this auspicious day, an image of Krishna, richly adorned and besmeared with colored powder (Abir in Bengali and assam and Odisha), is taken out in procession, in a swinging palanquin, decorated with flowers, leaves, colored clothes and papers. The procession proceeds forward to the accompaniment of music, blaring of conch shells, trumpets and shouts of 'Jai' (victory).\n\nDol Purnima becomes all the more significant for Bengalis, because this is also the birthday of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1485–1533). He was a great Vaishnava saint, who popularized modern sankirtana. He elevated the passion of Radha and Krishna to a high spiritual plane. He underlined the emotional at the cost of the ceremonial side of devotion. Followers of Chaitanya School of Vaishnavism, believe Chaitanya to be the manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu believed that the essence of sadhana is always the loving remembrance of Hari. \nDays of Celebration\nThe first day of Deul is known as gondh .In the evening time, the full incarnation of Lord Vishnu, god Krishna become ready to visit Ghunucha’s (one of the wife of Krishna) place. His followers make a bonfire in front of the kirtan-ghar and with the beat of Vaishnavite drums, cymbals, idol of Krishna carried round the firework and then to the doul. During the festival, all the regular religious functions of kirtan ghar (prayer house) are performed. \n\nThe second day of Deul is known as Bhor-Deul – meaning main Dol. Bhor Deul is celebrated for just one day in the month of Chot and two three days in the month of Phalgun. The idols are coloured with faku on this day.\n\nThe third day of Deul is also spent in the same manner as that of the second day. \n\nThe last and the fourth day of Doul festival is called Sueri. On that day, god Krishna is supposed to go back to the house of mother Lakshmi from the house of Ghunucha .Devotees bring down god Krishna to a palanquin (dola) and carried in a procession. Participation of people from various regions creates a sea of devotees there. In the rhythm of the Vaishnavite drums, cymbals, conches, etc., Holi songs rend the sky. People throw coloured powders to one another. When the procession arrived at kirtan ghar, the gate is block with bamboos by the followers of Mother Lakshmi. It is believed that, Mother Lakshmi become angry with her husband god Krishna, because He stayed at Ghunucha’s place for all these days. The followers of Mother Lakshmi therefore stop the opposite group from entering her house. But at last, the bamboos are broken and Lord Krishna entered the campus and takes seven round of kirtan ghar. ‘He tires and takes rest for a while. Taking advantage of the peace, a devotee from Lakshmi’s side ‘reproves’ him; one of his devotees returns the reproof. An interesting verbal duel thus ensues. In the end he admits defeat, like a peace loving husband, satisfies her with money and other presents and earns His admittance into the shrine. There ends the great Deul festival’ (Das, 1972:89-90).\nThe 2018 date is March 1.\n\n"}

The Fellowship brought together many independent churches and mission halls, which had been somewhat isolated.\n\nThe FIEC is in the Independent tradition. According to the National Director of FIEC, \"An ‘Independent’ church is self-governing. Each individual local church has ultimate control over its own affairs. It does not belong to any external body or institution which has control over it.\" The FIEC leadership claims it exercises 'something comparable to the sub-apostolic' ministry of Timothy and Titus. Some trace the routes of Independency to separatists, such as Robert Browne in the time of Elizabeth I and James I of England, but \"separatism\" may be an unhelpful term to use in the present day to describe FIEC, because although a church has to be autonomous and self-governing to affiliate to the FIEC, one of the main purposes of the FIEC is that local churches should work together to share resources as they seek to advance the Christian Faith. However, it is correct to note that a number of churches joined FIEC when they separated from a denomination that moved away from what they considered to be historic orthodox biblical Christianity. For example, Westminster Chapel, a leading church in the Independent tradition, joined the FIEC when the Congregational Union merged with the English Presbyterian Church to form the United Reformed Church denomination (URC). Many Independent churches within the FIEC are Baptist churches but the FIEC is open both to churches that only baptise adults and also to churches that baptise the children of believers.\n\nFormer Presidents include Rev. Theodore Harold Bendor-Samuel (1967, 1978).\n\nFIEC Limited is a registered charity and trust corporation working under the title FIEC Practical Services. It holds church property in trust for many churches and also provides legal advice to churches and other charities. In most cases where it holds property in trust for churches, its role is limited to acting in accordance with the lawful instructions of the church for which it holds the property, although in some cases, it does also have decision making powers concerning the use of the property.\n\nThe FIEC has been very active in church planting over recent years and has a number of resources available to help churches and individuals considering starting a new church. \n\nThe main FIEC website also provides a map of recent church plants here\n\nThe \"Go Into\" project from the FIEC highlights 50 places across Great Britain with little or no evangelical witness relative to population size to help those thinking about starting a new church.\n\nThe FIEC is led by a team of directors. The senior director is the National Director, John Stevens. Other directors are Adrian Reynolds (Training), Andy Patterson (Mission), Richard Underwood (Pastoral), Andy Hunter (Scotland), Gemma Adam (Practical Services) and Trevor Archer (London).\n\nFIEC is the largest corporate partner of Affinity, which was previously called the British Evangelical Council.\n\nThey also believe that Ecumenism in the form of Churches Together is not a positive move, citing various reasons including the liberal stance of other churches. The Trust Board has recently affirmed that formal membership of Churches Together (CT) is inconsistent with the FIEC Statement on Ecumenism. However a number of fellowships publicly profess their affiliation to CT.\n\nAllegations of engagement in ecumenism by a missionary to Poland of Carey Baptist Church have also been made in articles in the July 2009 and January 2010 issues of the \"Bible League Quarterly\", a journal once edited by the Fellowship's own founder, Rev E. J. Poole-Connor. it now has a circulation of just over 1000 copies per issue. This issue is regarded by some as controversial as it is alleged to be a violation of the Fellowship's own statement in 1996 opposing ecumenism. As an association of autonomous churches, the FIEC has defended the responsibility of Carey's elders to examine the allegations, but declined to examine them independently. The concerns were first raised in November 2008. On 23 March 2012 a modified statement on ecumenism was published and the old withdrawn.\nFurther concerns about connections between prominent FIEC personalities and the Polish ecclesiastical scene were raised in 2012 by the same journal.\n\nThe FIEC offers numerous services to pastors, including a national support team, help for pastors looking to find a church to serve in or for churches looking for a pastor to come and serve, accreditation, training and support.\n\nThe FIEC believes the classical Complementarian view which recognises that the distinctive calling to be a pastor or elder in the local church, and to be the head of the home, is a calling for men. It also recognises and encourages a wide calling of ministries within the church for women and men.\n\"Key: B = Baptist; C = Church; CC = Community Church; E = Evangelical; F = Free\"; \"I = Independent\".

The city is also notable for its association with the 16th century Mughal Emperor Akbar - several monuments in the town date to the Akbar period, including the Mughal Gardens of Wah, Hakimon ka Maqbara, and Tomb of Lala Rukh. Hasan Abdal is also near the city of Taxila – a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its Buddhist and ancient Greek ruins.\n\nHasan Abdal is located in a strategic part of northern Punjab, and was the location from which Mughal war expeditions were sent to the northwestern frontier. In modern times, Hasan Abdal lies at the intersection of the Karakoram Highway, and the M1 Motorway. As part of the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Hasan Abdal area will serve as the terminus for CPEC's Western Alignment, while the Hakla–Dera Ismail Khan Motorway will commence at Hasan Abdal.\n\nThe famous Chinese traveler Xuanzang who visited the place in the 7th century A.D. mentions the sacred spring of Elapatra about 70 li to the northwest of Taxila which has been identified as the spring at of Gurdwara Panja Sahib.\nThe town is mentioned in Ain-i-Akbari in the context that Shams al-Din built himself a vault there in which lies Hakim Abu’l Fath buried. Akbar’s visit to the town on his way back from Kashmir is also mentioned.\n\nWilliam Finch who travelled through India between 1608 and 1611 describes Hasan Abdal to be a \"pleasant town with a small river and many fair tanks in which are many fishes with golden rings in their noses ...; the water so clear that you may see a penny in the bottom\".\n\nThe town was seat for Mughal warring expeditions to the northwest frontier. The Mughal emperor Jehangir mentions in his Tuzk-e-Jahangiri this town by the name of Baba Hasan Abdal where he stayed for three days. He also praises the city in these words: \"The celebrated place at this station is a spring which flows from the foot of a little hill, exceedingly clear, sweet and nice...\". Hasan Abdal was visited by various Mughal kings on their way to Kashmir\n\nRaja Man Singh built the nearby Wah Gardens during the reign of Akbar. The terraced gardens were divided into four parts. Shah Jahan rested at Hasan Abdal's Wah Gardens on his four expeditions to Kabul. Emperor Aurangzeb stayed at the for over a year beginning in 1674, in order to quell the Afridi Revolt. The presence of Emperor Aurangzeb at the gardens convinced many local Pashtun tribes to abandon the rebellion, and join forces with the Mughals.\n\n\"The Muslim version of the story is that one Hasan, a Gujjar, had many buffaloes; that a Faqir named Abdal came and asked him for a draught of milk. Hasan said, I would gladly give you some, but my buffaloes are at present dry. Abdal laid his hand on one of them and said, \"Now milk it.\" He did so, and soon gave him a copious draught. Abdal expressed his gratitude to Hasan, and asked what he could do for him. Hasan replied that they were much straitened for want of water, on which Abdal struck the neighbouring hills in two places, from which the two streams of Hasan Abdal have come forth. On the departure of the Faqir, Hasan said the spot should hereafter be called after them jointly\".\n\nIn 1521 the founder of the Sikh faith, Guru Nanak, arrived in Hasan Abdal, a Gurdwara was built on the spot that he stayed containing a sacred rock that is believed to contain the hand print of Guru Nanak. Punja or panja ( ; ਪੰਜਾ ) :hand or paw. There are different traditions about the origin of the Hand print.\n\nHasan Abdal is located near the intersection of the Karakoram Highway heading northwest, and the M1 Motorway that connects Hassan Abdal to points northwest and southeast. As part of the multibillion-dollar China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Karakoram Highway will be rebuilt, while the Hasan Abdal area will serve as the terminus for CPEC's Western Alignment. From the nearby village of Hakla, the Hakla–Dera Ismail Khan Motorway will run southwest out of the city and link Hassan Abdal to Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nThere is a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and numerous privately owned clinics in and around the city. Despite the exponential growth in population, the health care facilities are extremely insufficient. Many hospitals are located nearby Wah Cantonment or in Rawalpindi.\n\nThe city has several state owned primary schools, a high school each for boys and girls, a higher secondary school each for boys and girls and a degree college for women. There are a number of privately run schools to make up for the shortfall of the state owned ones.presentation convent high school is also established since 1956.\n\nCadet College Hasan Abdal is the first Cadet College in Pakistan and was established by the government of Punjab at the initiative of General Muhammad Ayub Khan, the then Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, originally to serve as a feeder institution to the Services Academies. For this purpose, Military Wings were started in 1952 in Government College, Sahiwal, and Islamia College, Peshawar. On the completion of buildings at the present location, the Military Wings were shifted to Hasan Abdal and the Cadet College started functioning as Punjab Cadet College in April 1954. In 1960, the government constituted a Board of Governors to exercise administrative control over the college. Hugh Catchpole was the founder Principal of the College.\n\nThe college is located on the Rawalpindi/Peshawar road about 29 miles (48 km) from Rawalpindi/Islamabad, in natural surroundings near the junction of the National Highway and Grand Trunk Road.\n\nSurrounded by the fresh water springs with crystal clear water and Loquat orchards the city used to be an idyllic place till recent past. Its beauty as mentioned in the earliest accounts has somehow survived the ill planning that has resulted in an exponential increase in its population.\n\n\n"}

Hershele was a prankster from Ostropol, Ukraine, who lived in poverty and targeted the rich and powerful, both Jew and Gentile. Common folks were not safe from his shenanigans, either, but usually got off lightly. He is also remembered by Ukrainian gentiles as something of an ethnic folk hero, who could take on establishment forces much larger than himself with nothing but his humor.\n\nWhile his exploits have been mythologized over the years, the character of Hershele is based on a historic figure, who lived in what is today Ukraine during the late 18th or early 19th century. He may have used his wits to get by, eventually earning a permanent position as court jester of sorts to Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh.\n\nIn the Hershele stories, he was chosen by members of Rabbi Boruch's court in order to counter the rebbe's notorious fits of temper and lift his chronic melancholy.\n\nIt is believed that Hershele died of a fatal accident that was brought about by one of Rabbi Boruch's fits of anger. Hershele lingered for several days and died in Rabbi Boruch's own bed surrounded by Rabbi Boruch and his followers. He is thought to be buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh, though his grave is unmarked.\n\nHershele was the subject of several epic poems, a novel, a comedy performed in 1930 by the Vilna Troupe, and a US TV program in the 1950s.\n\nTwo illustrated children's books, \"The Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol\", and \"Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins\", have been published. Both books were written by Eric Kimmel and illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman.\n\nA tale about him, \"When Hershel Eats-\" by Nathan Ausubel, was included in Joanna Cole's 1982 work, \"Best-Loved Folktales of the World\".\n\nIn 2002, a play entitled \"Hershele the Storyteller\" was performed in New York City.\n\nin 1999, Shari Aronson of Z Puppets Rosenschnoz received permission from Eric Kimmel to adapt the book \"Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins\" for the stage. This adaptation has since been produced four times by MInnesota Jewish Theatre Company, with puppets by Chris Griffith winning a 2009 MN Ivey Award, and multiple times by Jewish Community Centers across the U.S.\n\nDuring dinner, his father noticed that Hershele's shirt was grease-stained and that the goose's left foot was missing.\nThat evening, Hershele took his father out to a lake near their village. A flock of geese were sleeping on the banks, each tucking one foot into its body so that only the other was visible.\n\nAgreeing with his wife, the innkeeper allowed Hershele to stay for the night, going so far as to offer him a large meal and a place at their table. After dinner, he offered Hershele one of his finest rooms, to which the vagabond happily agreed.\n\nHershel of Ostropol was adapted into a 30-minute short film by Lukas Gordon in 2015, which received release on YouTube.\n\n"}
{"id": "588076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588076", "title": "Hinduism and other religions", "text": "Hinduism and other religions\n\nIn the field of comparative religion, many scholars, academics, religious figures have looked at the relationships between Hinduism and other religions\n\nAyyavazhi and Hinduism are two belief systems in India. Though Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a Hindu denomination, members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction from Hindu are the Ayyavazhi religion's concepts of good, evil and dharma.\n\nHindus view Vedas, Gita, and other texts from the Shastra as canonical scriptures, instead of the Akilam. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. Kaliyan bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including Agamas and Puranas lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about Venneesan \"Avan pilathaal vedamondruntakki\" (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to Smartism and its Advaita beliefs in thought\n\nHinduism and Jainism have a rather similar view on the topic of asceticism, or, in simpler terms, abstinence. It is thought that their beliefs on the topic come from the early belief that some meditative and monastic practices cleanse the body of impurity. The Hindu theory of Karma gave Jainism a great deal of support to start promoting asceticism. Both of these traditions attribute human greed, hatred, and delusion to the presence of impure residues (samskaras or vasanas) that must be cleansed as the individual person moves towards \"freedom\" (death). Both of these religions believe that practicing asceticism is not only to the benefit of the individual but also to the benefit of the society as a whole. Nonviolence plays a large role in both of these religions so the concept of asceticism relies greatly on both of their beliefs.\nThe historical interaction between Sikhism and Hinduism occurred because both were founded on the Indian Subcontinent and have the majority of their followers there.\n\nRam Mohan Roy criticized Christian doctrines, and asserted that how \"unreasonable\" and \"self-contradictory\" they are. He further adds that people, even from India were embracing Christianity due to the economic hardship and weakness, just like European Jews were pressured to embrace Christianity, by both encouragement and force.\n\nVivekananda regarded Christianity as \"collection of little bits of Indian thought. Ours is the religion of which Buddhism with all its greatness is a rebel child, and of which Christianity is a very patchy imitation.\"\n\nPhilosopher Dayanand Saraswati, regarded Christianity as \"barbarous religion, and a 'false religion' religion believed only by fools and by the people in a state of barbarism,\" he included that Bible contains many stories and precepts that are immoral, praising cruelty, deceit and encouraging sin.\n\nIn 1956 the Niyogi Committee Report On Christian Missionary Activities was published by the Government of Madhya Pradesh. This influential report on controversial missionary activities in India recommended that suitable controls on conversions brought about through illegal means should be implemented. Also in the 1950s, K.M. Panikkar's work \"Asia and Western Dominance\" was published and was one of the first post-Independence Indian critiques of Christian missions. It argued that the attempt to convert Asia has definitely failed, and that this failure was due to the missionaries' claim of a monopoly of truth which was alien to the Asian mind; their association with imperialism and the attitude of moral and racial superiority of the Christian West. The Indian writer and philosopher Ram Swarup was \"most responsible for reviving and re-popularizing\" the Hindu critique of Christian missionary practices in the 1980s. He insisted that monotheistic religions like Christianity \"nurtured among their adherents a lack of respect for other religions\". Other important writers who criticized Christianity from an Indian and Hindu perspective include Sita Ram Goel and Arun Shourie. Arun Shourie urged Hindus to be \"alert to the fact that missionaries have but one goal - that of harvesting us for the church\"; and he wrote that they have \"developed a very well-knit, powerful, extremely well-endowned organizational framework\" for attaining that goal. In his \"widely read and cited\" book \"Missionaries in India\", Shourie tried to build a case that Christian evangelistic methods were cynically calculating and materialistic, and to Shourie, missionary strategizing \"sounded more like the Planning Commission, if not the Pentagon, than like Jesus\".\n\nIndian philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, wrote: \n\nThere has been some debate on historical connections between Christianity and Indian religion, it has focused on both Buddhism (via Greco-Buddhism) as well as Hinduism. While it is evident that a number of Indian sages visited Constantinople in Classical Antiquity, claims of significant influence in either direction have failed to gain wide acceptance. Christianity revolves heavily around the life of Jesus Christ as detailed in the Bible, whereas Hinduism is not based on any one personality or one book, but rather on the philosophy that there is a god, or no god and just self, etc. Nevertheless, some scholars have studied whether there are links between the story of Jesus and that of Krishna; \"Krishnology\" is a term coined to express these claimed theological parallels between Krishnaism and the Christological dogmas of Christianity.\n\nAlthough little is known of the immediate growth of the church, Bar-Daisan (AD 154–223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it.\n\nContemporary Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. Hinduism's historical tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners; this continues today. The declaration \"Nostra aetate\" by the Second Vatican Council officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus, promoting common values between the two religions (among others). There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population, still making it the largest Christian church in India. \n(See also: Dalit theology).\n\nBuddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit: swarga) and hell (naraka) are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed. After a soul suffers its due punishment in hell, or after a soul has enjoyed enough in heaven, it again enters the life-death cycle. There is no concept in Hinduism of a permanent hell like that in Christianity; rather, the cycle of \"karma\" takes over. Permanent heaven or bliss is \"moksha\".\n\nThe Holy Trinity of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the Trimurti of Hinduism, whose members -- Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva—are seen as the three principal manifestations of Brahman, or Godhead. The specific formulation of this trinitarian relationship is not identical between the two religions; for example, in Hinduism there is a Parabrahma, or an ultimate creator who created the Trimurti, for which there exists no parallel in Christianity. Some consider Brahma to be more similar to the demiurge of Christian gnosticism, in that he (at least initially) wrongly thought himself as the \"Creator\" and also as the highest or even the only god. In this case, the Hindu version of the Trinity could be seen as Brahma (Father), Sankarshan or Vishnu (Holy spirit), and Mahesh or Shiva (Son; analogous to Christ).\n\nThere have been Christian writers such as the 17th century mystic Jane Leade and the 19th-20th century theologian Sergei Bulgakov, who have described the feminine Sophia (wisdom) as an aspect of the Godhead. This may serve as a rough analogue to Hinduism's description of Sita in the Ramayana, who is saved by Hanuman (an incarnation of Shiva) from the demon king Ravana to be reunited with her husband Rama, representing God. Nevertheless, although the concept that we can come to know God through \"sophia\" has played a role in Christian thought, no major Christian denominations profess Sophia as an independent aspect of God.\n\nIn Hinduism (also in Jainism and Sikhism), the concept of moksha is akin to that of Buddhism's nirvana, but some scholars further claim that it is akin as well to Christianity's doctrine of salvation. Hindu sannyasi Swami Tripurari states:... in theory the sinners of the world are the beneficiaries of Christ’s sacrifice, but it is God the father for whose pleasure Christ underwent the crucifixion, even when the father’s joy in this scenario lies in the salvation of sinners. Christ represents the intermediary between God and humanity, and his life aptly illustrates the fact that it is sacrifice by which we come to meet our maker. Thus in Christ the Divine teaches us “the way” more than he does the goal. The Christ conception represents “the way” in the sense that the way is sacrifice, out of which love arises. The Krishna conception represents that for which we not only should, but must sacrifice, compelled by the Godhead’s irresistible attributes, etc. depicted therein.\n\nThe Christian Ashram Movement, a movement within Christianity in India, embraces Vedanta and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu ashram model, and Christian monasticism with the Hindu \"sannyasa\" tradition. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers,(See also: Pierre Johanns, Abhishiktananda, Bede Griffiths). While others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers.\n\nHindu – Islamic relations began when Islamic influence first came to be found in the Indian subcontinent during the early 7th century. Hinduism and Islam are two of the world’s three largest religions. Hinduism is the socio-religious way of life of the Hindu people of the Indian subcontinent, their diaspora, and some other regions which had Hindu influence in the ancient and medieval times. Islam is a strictly monotheistic religion in which the supreme deity is Allah ( : see God in Islam), the last Islamic prophet being Muhammad ibn Abdullah, whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the Qur'an. Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the other Indian religions, including Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Islam shares common characteristics with Abrahamic religions–those religions claiming descent from the prophet Abraham–being, from oldest to youngest, Judaism, Christianity, Islam.\n\nThe Qur'an is the primary Islamic scripture. Muslims believe it to be the verbatim, uncreated word of Allah. Second to this in religious authority, and whence many practices of Islam derive, especially for Sunnis, are the Sunni six major collections of hadīth, which are traditional records of the sayings and acts of Muhammad. The scriptures of Hinduism are the \"Shrutis\" (the four \"Vedas\", which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads); Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the \"Smritis\" (including the \"Rāmāyana\", the \"Bhagavad Gītā\" [part of the Mahabharata cycle], and the \"Purānas\"), which are considered to be of secondary authority and of human creation of sages but the 18 Puranas are compilation of great Universal Wisdom,cosmic knowledge & prediction of B.C /A.D sects or religions of Present epoch 'Kaliyug' from BhavishyaPuran was destined to be true Vishnu's Divine Incarnation form KrishnaDwaipyan VedVyas 27th , Shrimad Bhagwad mahaPuran ultimately gave Peace scripted with Devoted Mind to his OriginSource of almighty Universal Supreme Krishna .The Bhagavad Gita however enjoys a special status in that, it is considered on par with the Vedas by most Hindus.\nHinduism and Judaism are amongst the oldest existing religions in the world. They have shared a notable relationship throughout historical and modern t.\n\nHinduism is recognized in the Bahá'í Faith as one of four known religions and its scriptures are regarded as predicting the coming of Bahá'u'lláh (Kalki avatar). Krishna is included in the succession of Manifestations of God. The authenticity of the Hindu scriptures is seen as uncertain.\n\nHinduism and Zoroastrianism share a common root in Proto-Indo-Iranian religion. Zoroastrianism in India shares more than a thousand year of history with the culture and people of India. The Zoroastrians of India are called there Parsis.\n\n\n\n"}

He is well known for his many appearances in the media of Brazil and other countries as well.\n\nInri Cristo regularly participates in lively debates with religious figures, such as priest Oscar González Quevedo (Cristo claims Fr Quevedo is the reincarnation of the Spanish Inquisitor Tomás de Torquemada), and also appears in interviews and comedy shows. His provocative statements about evolutionism, vegetarianism, overpopulation, birth control, abortion, atheism, socialism and capitalism, growth of overall disillusionment, and a potential World War III have stirred much commentary and controversy.\n\nInri Cristo was raised by two Roman Catholic farmers of German ancestry, Wilhelm and Magdalena Theiss. Inri had a humble childhood and studied for about three years at the Adolfo Konder School. He quit studying in order to help his mother, whom he calls \"the woman who raised him\", with domestic supplies, since his father was retired owing to a work accident.\n\nSince childhood, Inri has claimed to obey a \"powerful voice\" that speaks inside his head. Obedient to this voice, he left home at thirteen to live independently of his family. In adolescence he worked as a greengrocer, baker, delivery boy, peddler and waiter. Eventually, Inri severed all ties to Christianity, becoming an atheist, until he received what he calls the \"revelation of his identity\".\n\nIn 1969, at the age of 21, Inri began his public life as a self-professed prophet and astrologer, introducing himself as \"Iuri de Nostradamus\".\n\nIn 1971, he began speaking on television, with TV Morena (an affiliate of Brazilian Rede Globo), and this opportunity introduced him to a wider audience. In 1976, claiming to blaze the trail of spiritual transcendence, Inri became vegetarian. In 1977 he lived for some time in Copacabana Palace hotel, in Rio de Janeiro, a part of high society. In 1978, he left Brazil on a tour through Latin America, speaking on radio.\n\nIn 1979, obeying the same powerful voice that he claims to have heard since childhood, he underwent a fast in Santiago, Chile. On this occasion, he says, the voice said in a rasping voice, \"I am your Father\", and revealed itself to be the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.\n\nThis voice, he says, said that he was the same Christ crucified two thousand years ago under Pontius Pilate. It also said that the second letter of his name (the \"u\" in \"Iuri\") would henceforth be upside down, making his name \"Inri\", the acronym for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum. Inri launched a pilgrimage over many countries, dressed in a white tunic and sandals, announcing that his mission would be accomplished in the dawn of a New Age of peace.\n\nInri wandered over 27 countries spreading his message. In 1980, Inri was expelled from the United States, from Venezuela and from England. France sheltered him for nine months and even announced in Antenne 2: \"Le Christ est revenu sur la terre\" (\"Christ is back on Earth\"). On this occasion, Inri was invited to speak in the Grande École Polytechnique de Paris. Back in Brazil, on February 28, 1982 Inri performed what he calls a \"libertarian act\". He broke into the cathedral in Belém in Pará state. Accused of profanation and vandalism by the clergy, he was sent to jail for fifteen days. On this occasion, he established a new mystical order, SOUST (\"Suprema Ordem Universal da Santissima Trindade\"), that he calls the formalization of the promised Kingdom of God on Earth. On April 20, 1982, Inri Cristo officially establishment of SOUST in Curitiba, Paraná, where he remained for 24 years in a \"provisional\" headquarters.\n\nHe has been detained by police more than forty times, owing to his statements and unusual way of dressing.\n\nHe is often invited to give lectures in many colleges and universities throughout Brazil, and is usually well received by students.\n\n\n"}

The floor of each of the three halls can be at a different level. If the \"ai-no-ma\" is paved with stones it is called \"ishi-no-ma\", whence the name of the style. It can, however, be paved with planks or \"tatami\". Its width is often the same as the \"honden's\", with the \"haiden\" from one to three \"ken\" wider.\n\nThis style, rather than the structure of a building, defines the relationship between member structures of a shrine. Each member then belongs to a particular architectural style. For example, the \"honden\" and \"haiden\" at are single-storied, \"irimoya-zukuri\" edifices. Because they are connected by a passage called \"ishi-no-ma\" and are covered by a single roof, however, the complex is classified as belonging to the \"ishi-no-ma-zukuri\" style.\n\nOne of the oldest examples is Kitano Tenman-gū in Kyoto. The \"gongen-zukuri\" name comes from Nikkō Tōshō-gū in Nikkō, which enshrines the Tōshō Daigongen (Tokugawa Ieyasu) and adopts this structure.\n\n"}
{"id": "1569728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1569728", "title": "Jessie Oonark", "text": "Jessie Oonark\n\nJessie Oonark, ( ᔨᐊᓯ ᐅᓈᖅ; 2 March 1906 – 7 March 1985) was a prolific and influential Canadian Inuit artist of the Utkuhihalingmiut \"Utkuhiksalingmiut\" whose wall hangings, prints and drawings are in major collections including the National Gallery of Canada. She was born in 1906 in the Chantrey Inlet (\"Tariunnuaq\") area, near the\nestuary of the Back River in the Keewatin District of the Northwest Territories (now Nunavut)—the traditional lands of the Utkukhalingmiut \"Utkukhalingmiut\", \"Utkukhalingmiut\" (\"the people of the place where there is soapstone\"). Her artwork portrays aspects of the traditional hunter-nomadic life that she lived for over five decades, moving from fishing the camp near the mouth of Back River on Chantrey Inlet in the Honoraru area to their caribou hunting camp in the Garry Lake area, living in winter snow houses (igloos) and caribou skin tents in the summer. Oonark learned early how to prepare skins and sew caribou skin clothing. They subsisted mainly on trout (lake trout and Arctic char), whitefish, and barren-ground caribou. The knife used by women, the \"ulu\", their clothing, the \"kamik\", the \"amauti\" were recurring themes in her work. Oonark has had a major museum retrospective with accompanying scholarly monograph. Despite a late start – she was 54 years old when her work was first published – she was a very active and prolific artist over the next 19 years, creating a body of work that won considerable critical acclaim and made her one of Canada's best known Inuit artists.\n\nShe was a fluent speaker of the language of the Utkuhiksalingmiut language, Utkuhiksalingmiut is a subdialect of Natsilik Netsilik (\"Natsilik\") within the Western Canadian Inuit dialect continuum. Like other first generation Inuit artists from that area, Luke Anguhadluk and Marion Tuu'luq, Utkuhiksalingmiut oral history and legends, were strongly reflected in her artwork. In later years in Baker Lake they became a small minority and fewer people could speak the language.\n\nJessie Oonark's parents were Qiliikvuq and Aghlquarq(Aglaguaq). Aglaguaq and his brothers hunted muskox. Oonark's spent most of her time the in Chantrey Inlet where there were lots of fish. The Utkukhalingmiut had many taboos, one of which was the drawing of images. According to Marie Bouchard— a researcher, art historian, and community worker who lived in Baker Lake for many years— \"Oonark's grandmother repeatedly warned her that images could come to life in the dark of night.\" Oonark's mother married Qiqniikpak after the death of Oonark's father. Oonark lived with her mother.\n\nThe Danish explorer, Knud Rasmussen, crossed the Canadian Arctic by dogsled and visited the Jessie Oonark's camp when she was just a teenager during his Fifth Thule Expedition. Utkuhikhalingmiut represented the first white contact. In the 1980s, Mame Jackson taped Jessie Oonark's description of the encountered broadcast on CBC radio.\n\nOonark was married at a young age to Qabluunaq, (Kabloona, Kabloonak) the son of Naatak and Nanuqluq from Gjoa Haven. Natak joined them in their hunting camp. Although Kabloona was \"a good hunter and a respected fur trader\", the family was often hungry. Their oldest daughter remembers the periods of hunger. Oonark's mother-in-law, Naatak, would boil a caribou skin into a \"broth\" in an attempt to appease the hunger. Even in 2007, Baker Lake Inuit kept animal bones for marrow \"patek\".\nTheir first daughter, Janet Kigusiuq, was born at Putuqsuqniq in the Back River area in 1926. She had eleven more children including Joshuan Nuilaliq, Mamnguqsualuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuq, Miriam Nanuqluq, Mary Yuusipik, Peggy Gabluunaq, Nancy Pukingnaq (born 1940–), William Noah, Isumataq, Qaqurialuq, Amarouk, and Makitgag.\n\nIn the 1940s, Oonark was assigned a Disc number by the Canadian federal government— E2-384. In the 1940s, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) conducted a census of Inuit populations. They assigned the infamous identification numbering system using discs. These disc numbers were dropped during \"Operation Surname\" in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1950s there was a slump in the fox fur trade. Sometime around 1953 and 1954, Kabloonak and her four youngest children died of illness in the Garry Lake area when William Noah was still a child and Nancy Pukingrnak was in her early teens and they were still dependent on her. Luke Anguhadluq, camp leader helped her at this time.\n\nThe annual caribou migration shifted away from the area where they lived, leaving many Inuit to starve. The Back River Inuit, including Oonark and her family, had a hard time during the starvation period of the 1950s. The winter of 1957–1958 was marked by a severe shortage of country food in the Back River area. Oonark and her daughter Nancy Pukingrnak were starving. William Noah walked from their camp to Baker Lake in March to seek help. They were airlifted by the Canadian armed forces to Baker Lake.\n\nWhen Oonark first arrived in Baker Lake in 1958 she survived by \"cleaning skins for her friend, Sandy Lunan, at the Hudson's Bay Company post, cooking meals, washing dishes and sewing traditional Arctic garments for local sale\" and eventually worked as janitor at the Anglican Church. Baker Lake residents \"derisively referred to the Back River people as \"qangmaliqs\" (the people who only come in to trade) and considered them to be socially backwards.\n\nIn the 1950s, because of a severe famine in the Keewatin District, many Inuit arrived in Baker Lake. A federal dayschool was opened at Baker Lake in 1957. Pre-fabricated subsidized government housing constructed from the mid-1950s. The Northern Services Officer—Doug Wilkinson— encouraged the development of the arts and crafts industry in Baker Lake. At that time the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources (DIAND) established arts and crafts projects in Inuit hamlets as part of socio-economic development (Goetz, 1985:43). Bill Larmour was the DIAND arts and crafts officer in Baker Lake from 1961 to 1962.\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Oonark's 1969 wall hanging depicting a hunting scene, made of duffel, felt and embroidery floss, sold for $70,800, a new record for the Baker Lake artist. The wall hanging was one of 333 pieces of art up for sale, organized by Walker's Fine Art Auctions in Ottawa.\n\nIn 1958 after observing school children drawing in Baker Lake, Oonark casually remarked to the school teacher that she could draw better than that. The next summer in 1959, the teacher shared this comment with Canadian Wildlife Service biologist, Dr. Andrew Macpherson, who was in Baker Lake studying Arctic fox. Macpherson gave her coloured pencils and paper, purchased her drawings and brought some of them to Ottawa. Macpherson continued to send her coloured pencils and a drawing pad after his return to Ottawa in the late fall of 1959. In the spring of 1960 Oonark sent him twelve completed drawings in the sketchbook via the Northern Services Officer Tom Butlers.\n\nEdith Dodds, the wife of the Northern Service Officer, Sam Dodds, sent six of Oonark's drawings to James Archibald Houston at the West Baffin Co-operative in Cape Dorset. Two of her drawings—\"Inland Eskimo Woman/Eskimo Woman\" and \"Tattooed Faces\"— were made into single colour stone cut prints under the name of Una (Kazan River) at the newly established Cape Dorset print shop and included in the 1960 Cape Dorset print collection and catalogue. A print from her drawing \"People of lnland appeared\nin the 1961 Cape Dorset Print collection. It was the first and only time the Cape Dorset print shop included work from an Inuk outside Cape Dorset.\n\nIn 1961 William Larmour, crafts officer with the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs established a federal government arts and crafts program with Jessie Oonark as one of their key artists. In 1963 Gabriel Gely developed a printmaking program in Baker Lake. Ten experimental prints were made in 1964 and two of them were based on Oonark's drawings—\"Drum Dancer\" (1964).\n\nBoris Kotelewetz, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs' arts and crafts officer, who arrived in Baker Lake in March 1966, provided Oonark with studio space and a salary.\n\nIn 1969 Jack and Sheila Butler were recruited as the new DIAND arts and crafts officers on the advice of George Swinton, artist, academic, collector of Inuit art, author of the influential book entitled \"Sculpture of the Eskimo.\" By the time they arrived Oonark was already an accomplished artist. In that year she completed a large applique wallhanging which hangs in the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly's Chamber in Yellowknife.\n\nIn 1970 the first Baker Lake Print Collection was released and exhibited at the Art Gallery of Alberta. The stone cut print by Thomas Manik of Oonark's drawing entitled \"Woman\" (1970) was featured on the cover and her work was prominent in the exhibition. She continued to contribute images to the Baker Lake Print collections until 1985.\n\nIn 1970, the National Museum of Man in Ottawa organized a touring exhibition of fifty of Oonark's drawings and works by sculptor John Pangnark. It toured major galleries in Canada for eight months. Later that year, Avrom Isaacs featured Inuit artists such as Oonark and Karoo Ashevak in solo exhibitions in 1970 in the Isaacs Innuit Gallery—in the gallery's opening year. Isaacs Innuit Gallery became one of Toronto's most prestigious galleries for over thirty years. It was Oonark's first solo exhibition and in 1971 Isaacs had an exhibition of Oonark's wallhangings.\n\nThe Baker Lake Sanavik Co-operative was incorporated in 1971. The print-makers who rendered Oonark's drawings into limited edition fine art prints included Thomas Sivuraq. The printing technique in Baker Lake included colour stonecuts, stencil and lithograph on Japanese wove paper. These include the chop for Oonark and Sanavik. In the same year, Oonark received a travel grant from the Canada Council of the Arts to travel to Toronto and Montreal for the opening of the exhibitions of her drawings. The Toronto wall hangings solo-exhibition took place in April at the Innuit Gallery of Eskimo Art. In Montreal, the exhibition was held at the Canadian Guild of Crafts.\n\nOonark's work illustrated a 1972 anthology of Inuit poetry from the circumpolar regions including Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia 1972. In the spring of 1972, Baker Lake print collection is released and it includes five Oonark prints, two of which are based on small wall hangings. The stencil print, \"Young Woman,\" is featured on the cover of the catalogue. Later that year, an Oonark wall hanging is commissioned by The Ivey Business School, University of Western Ontario, is featured on the cover of their publication, \"The Business Quarterly.\"\n\nIn May 1975 Oonark was elected a Member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Later that year, the Baker Lake print collection is released featuring 11 Oonark prints, a new record for the artist. By 1976, Oonark is well known in her community. That year, her work was featured on 2 stamps for the United Nations commemorating the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements. The first day of Issue was May 28, 1976.\n\nIn 1984 she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 1986 the Winnipeg Art Gallery mounted a retrospective of her work with a major touring exhibition and catalogue both entitled \"Jessie Oonark: a Retrospective\". By 1987 Oonark already has eleven solo exhibitions and more than fifty national and international group exhibitions.\n\nIn 1998 the Macdonald Stewart Art Centre presented a major exhibition with catalogue entitled \"Qamanittuaq (Where the River Widens): Drawings by Baker Lake Artists\" which including first-generation artist Jessie Oonark and the distinctive drawings of four of her children: Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuk, Nancy Pukingrnak, and William Noah among many others.\n\nIn 1994 Bernadette Driscoll-Ellgelstad, curated the exhibition entitled \"Northern Lights: Inuit Textile Art from Arctic Canada\" which included wall hangings by Jessie Oonark and her daughters, Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsllaluk, her relatives Ruth Qaulluaryuk and other women from the Back River area along with artists from Baker Lake.\n\nIn the first generation of Inuit artists working in printmaking, Oonark, together with Pitseolak Ashoona and Kenojuak were recognized quickly as significant figures, receiving solo exhibitions, scholarly attention and professional awards.\nRosemary Tovell wrote in the catalogue entitled \"Baker Lake Prints 1985\" that When Oonark died in 1985, the Canadian Eskimo Art Council (CEAC) were quoted as saying that they were pleased with the quality of her last prints and they recognized that \"[W]ithout Oonark, Baker Lake as a centre for prints may never have happened. It was largely due to her enormous talent that the world's attention came to the community.\"\n\nOn September 4, 2016, the CBC released an article titled, \"Inuit Art Centre to Reveal Beauty of the North in the South\" discussing Winnipeg's $65-million centre that will house the world's largest collection of Inuit art. In it, they reference the important role printmaking played, especially for female artists like Oonark, Kenojuak Ashevak and Helen Kalvak, who gravitated towards visual arts, while men focused on stone-carving which required more physical strength.\n\nAll her children, Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuq Kayuryuk, Josiah Nuilalik, Nancy Pukirniq, Miriam Qiyuq, Peggy, Mary Yussipik and William Noah are artists.\n\nOonark's work is in major collections including the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Queen's University, (Kingston, ON), American National Insurance Company, Amon Carter Museum of Western Art (Fort Worth, Texas), Amway Environmental Foundation Collection (Ada, Michigan), Art Gallery of Greater Victoria (Victoria, BC), Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (Halifax, NS), Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto,ON) Ontario Art Gallery of Windsor, Ontario Art Gallery of York University (Downsview, Ontario), Beaverbrook Art Gallery (Fredericton, NB), Canada Council Art Bank (Ottawa, ON), Canadian Catholic Conference Art Collection (Ottawa, ON), Canadian Guild of Crafts Quebec (Montreal, QC), Canadian Museum of Civilization (Hull, QC), Churchill Community Centre (Churchill, MB), Clifford E. Lee Collection (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB), Collection of His Holiness John Paul II (Vatican City, Rome, Italy), Collection of the Supreme Patriarch of All Armenia, His Holiness, Catholicos Vazken I, Dennos Museum Center, Northwestern Michigan College (Traverse City, Michigan), Edmonton Art Gallery (Edmonton, AB), Glenbow Museum (Calgary, AB), Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology (Brown University, Bristol, Rhode Island), Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery (Kitchener, ON), Klamer Family Collection, Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto, ON), Macdonald Stewart Art Centre (Guelph, ON), McMaster University Art Gallery (Hamilton, ON), McMichael Canadian Art Collection (Kleinburg, ON) Ontario Mendel Art Gallery, (Saskatoon, SK), Museé des beaux-arts de Montreal (Montréal, QC), Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC), National Arts Centre (Ottawa, ON), National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, ON), New Brunswick Museum (Saint John, NB), Owens Art Gallery, Mount Allison University (Sackville, NB), Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre (Yellowknife, NT), Shell Canada Collection (Calgary, AB), Simon Fraser Gallery, Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, BC), University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB), University of Lethbridge Art Gallery (Lethbridge, AB), Alberta Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies (Banff, AB) and the Winnipeg Art Gallery (Winnipeg, MB). There are a number of commercial Fine Art Inuit art galleries that carry her work including the Marian Scott Gallery in Vancouver, BC., the Houston North Gallery and the Spirit Wrestler Gallery, the Hermon Collection of Native American Art at the University of Delaware Art Gallery. Her untitled wall hanging (1973), one of her largest art works, is in the main lobby (foyer) of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.\n\n\"A strong, bold graphic sense informs all of Oonark's work. Traditional dress, women's facial tattoos, and shamanistic themes are common in her art, yet they usually appear as isolated, fragmentary forms, shaped into a graphically bold image rather than a comprehensible narrative. Oonark is also well known as a textile artist, whose wool and felt wall-hangings reveal her as a master of color and form.\"\n\nOonark's work includes visual puns and shape-shifting, descriptive works depicting clothing, tools and cultural objects of importance to the Utkuhihalingmiut as well as images based on storytelling, legends and shamanism.\n\nMame Jackson, George Swinton and Jean Blodgett noted that Oonark's work reflects a high tolerance for ambiguity, a kind of double vision. For example, her work entitled \"Two Fish Looking for Something to Eat\" (1978), when viewed as a horizontal image, suggests two swimming fish-like creatures and depicts her version of the cannibal fish legend. When viewed vertically one figure resembles a standing woman whose face fills the amaut. Is she birthing or eating the small blue fish? The fish-figure wearing a man's parka seems to be kiss-touching rather than eating.\n\nJessie Oonark, although familiar with oral traditions and legends, is never satisfied with a one-layered literal illustration. The horizontal print Two Fish Looking for Something to Eat depicts her version of the cannibal fish story but her double vision leaves room for ambiguity. The cannibal fish also appears in her print \"Untitled (Yellow fish)\" (1977).\n\nJessie Oonark's verbal descriptions of her own work are often cryptic, \nOonark's father Aglaguaq and her grandfather were said to be shamans. Aglaquarq used his shamanic powers infrequently but Oonark vividly remembered his helping spirit— \"Uupitanaisuak.\" Aglaguaq had a daughter who is Oonark's stepsister, Kayuruq. When Janet Kigusiuk was still a baby, Anglican missionaries, Canon James and his Inuk assistant catechist Thomas Tapatai came to Oonark's hunting camp. She adopted the Anglican religion and they gave her a prayer book and a Bible. The arrival of Christian missionaries divided their small camp into two divisions—those who became Christian and those who held onto the old ways. Oonark did not participate in drum dancing nor did she follow the ways of shamanism. However she continued to depict the drum dance and aspects of shamanism in her artwork such as \"Horned Spirits\" (1970), \"Shaman\" (1970) and \"The People Within\" (1970).\n\nThe colour stonecut and stencil print on laid Japanese paper printed by Thomas Sivuraq of a drawing by Jessie Oonark called \"A Shaman's Helping Spirits\" (1971), in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada depicts a horned shaman, with animal helping spirits and with a small spirit on his head. Oonark's father—Aglaquarq—used his shamanic powers infrequently but Oonark vividly remembered his helping spirit— \"Uupitanaisuak.\"\nShe no longer participated in the drum dance either but she depicted images of the drum dance for example in \"Drum Dance\" (1970).\n\nShape-shifting was a popular theme seen in \"Day Spirit\" (1970).\n\nOonark's mother and father and her mother-in-law Naatak, (Natak) were storytellers and these stories are richly represented in Oonark's work, such as the 1970 print entitled \"Dream of the Bird Woman\", referring to the Kiviuq (Qiviuk), an Inuk who faced dangerous obstacles in his journeys by kayak, which was described by Franz Boas as the most widely known Inuit legend in the circumpolar region.\n\nThe knife used by women, the \"ulu\", their clothing, the \"amauti\" were recurring themes in her work. \"People of the Inland\" (1961) depicts the Back River people. One of her best known works is \"Woman\" (1970) described as,\nBernadette Driscoll explained the presence of birds— in the drawing and print \"Dream of the Bird Woman\" and in Oonark's other artworks— demonstrated the \"symbolic significance of the importance of birds as a symbol of flight and in several instances as a reference to shamanism as in \"Angagkok Conjuring Birds (1979) but also as a harbinger of spring and itself a symbol of fecundity and rebirth.\"\n\nReverend Alan Whitton was the Anglican minister at Saint Aidan's Church, Baker Lake, from 1963 until 1972. During that time his wife Elizabeth Whitton, befriended Oonark. In 1966 Elizabeth organized a sewing projects with Oonark and others where they produced mittens, parkas, slippers, duffle socks as well as appliqued images from scraps for sale. At Easter in 1968 Elizabeth Whitton asked Oonark to do drawings about their church for their local women's auxiliary magazine. Oonark's drawings included depictions of Reverend Whitton, catechist Thomas Tapatai, local Ihuit parishioners including women with traditional Inuit tattoos and the church exterior. Oonark continued to use these themes in later work, for example in her 1971–1972 wall hanging for Saint Jude's Cathedra1 in Iqaluit and in a 1971–1972 wall hanging of wool and stroud in the permanent collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. Oonark described this wall-hanging,\n\nIn her 1984 essay entitled \"Christianity and Inuit Art\" and in the 1986 \"Jessie Oonark, A Retrospective\" Blodgett notes how Oonark blended traditional Inuit clothing and symbols with Christian motifs.\n\nOonark began to experience numbness in her hands and feet and in 1979, when a surgical intervention failed to check the symptoms, she lost much of her manual dexterity and produced only a few more pieces afterwards.

At the age of 14, he joined the \"Kadettenschule\" there. Aged 17, he was conscripted to the k.u.k. infantry regiment of Milan I king of Serbia. On 17 December 1883 he was appointed to infantry, four days later he became a Gefreiter (private). In 1888, he was promoted to lieutenant.\n\nIn 1889, he joined the quasi-masonic \"Schlaraffia-Loge\". He published his first book, \"Seyfrieds Runen\", in 1903, under his real name, as \"Karl Maria Wiligut (Lobesam)\", mentioning his real and additional artist name. 1908 followed the \"Neun Gebote Gôts\", where Wiligut first claimed to be heir to an ancient tradition of Irminism.\n\nDuring World War I, Wiligut served at the southern and eastern fronts and he was decorated for gallantry. On 1 August 1917, he was promoted to colonel. In May 1918, he was retired from the front and commanded a convalescence camp near Lviv.\n\nAfter almost 40 years in military service, he retired on 1 January 1919 with an impeccable record, and moved to Morzg near Salzburg where he dedicated his time to occult studies. He renewed his acquaintance with Theodor Czepl of the Ordo Novi Templi, who in winter 1920/21 spent seven weeks in Wiligut's house. Czepl compiled a report for the archive of the O.N.T., where he describes Wiligut as \"a man martial in aspect, who revealed himself as bearer of a secret line of German kingship\".\n\nWiligut supposedly founded the postwar newspaper \"Der Eiserne Besen\", although no evidence for such a newspaper exists.\n\nIn 1906, he married Malwine Leuts von Treuenringen of Bozen, with whom he had two daughters, Gertrud and Lotte. A twin brother of one of the girls died as an infant, a devastating tragedy for Wiligut, who was desperate for a male heir to which he could pass on his \"secret knowledge\", which estranged him from his wife.\n\nWiligut's wife remained unimpressed by her husband's above claim to kingship, and blaming him for their destitution she pushed for his committal to a mental hospital. While in a cafe with some friends, on 29 November 1924, Wiligut was arrested by police and taken to the local mental institution where he was held for a couple of years.\nWiligut's medical records reflect violence at home, including threats to kill his wife, grandiose projects, eccentric behavior and occult interests. Eventually, in 1924, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and megalomania and was declared legally incompetent by a Salzburg court and then committed to a Salzburg asylum, where he remained until 1927. In 1932, he abandoned his wife and family, and emigrated from Austria to Germany, residing in Munich. He is known to have corresponded with many admirers and disciples, including Ernst Rüdiger and members of the Order of the New Templars.\n\nShortly after being introduced to Reichsführer-SS Himmler in September 1933 at a conference of the \"Nordische Gesellschaft\", Wiligut was inducted into the SS (under the pseudonym \"Karl Maria Weisthor\") to head a Department for Pre- and Early History which was created for him within the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA). In April 1934 he was promoted to the SS equivalent of his old colonel rank (Standartenführer), and then made head of Section VIII (Archives) for RuSHA in October 1934. In November 1934 a promotion followed to the rank of Oberführer (lieutenant-brigadier), and then in the spring of 1935 Wiligut was transferred to Berlin to serve on Himmler's personal staff. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadeführer in September 1936.\n\nIn Berlin, where he worked in the office of Karl Wolff, chief adjutant of the SS, Wiligut developed his plans for the rebuilding of the Wewelsburg into an allegorical \"center of the world\". Wiligut's friend Manfred von Knobelsdorff attempted to practise Wiligut's Irminism on the Wewelsburg. An Irministic 'baptism' of Karl Wolff's eldest son Thorisman was performed by Wiligut on 4 January 1937, attended by SS dignitaries Reinhard Heydrich and Karl Diebitsch.\n\nIn summer 1936, Gunther Kirchhoff and Wiligut, undertook a private 22-day expedition to the Murg Valley near Baden-Baden in the Black Forest, where there was a settlement described as consisting of \"old half-timbered houses, architectural ornament, crosses, inscriptions, and natural and man-made rock formations in the forest,\" which, they claimed, showed it to be an ancient Krist settlement (Krist was a messianic Germanic figure allegedly associated with Irminism). Wiligut identified Schloss Eberstein as a center of Irminism. In Saxony, he discovered another \"Irminist complex\", identifying as \"spirit point\", Bodenburg as \"will point\", Gandersheim as \"central awareness point\", as \"force hand point\", Kalefeld as \"heart point\" of the crucified Balder, as \"generative point\", Naensen as \"material hand point\" and Ebergötzen as \"skould point\".\n\nWiligut identified Irminism as the true German ancestral religion, claiming that Guido von List's Wotanism and Armanen runic row was a schismatic false religion. \nWiligut contributed significantly to the development of Wewelsburg as the order-castle and ceremonial center of SS pseudo-religious practice. He designed the Totenkopfring, which Himmler personally awarded to prestigious SS officers.\n\nIn November 1938, Karl Wolff, chief adjutant of Himmler's personal staff and the second-highest-ranking officer in the SS, visited Wiligut's wife and learned of Wiligut's earlier involuntary commitment to a mental institution, which proved embarrassing to Himmler.\n\nWiligut's staff was notified that his \"application\" for retirement on grounds of age and poor health had been granted in February 1939, and the official retirement was dated 28 August 1939, only a few days prior to the outbreak of World War II.\n\nWiligut's final years were insecure: he moved to Aufkirchen in 1939, to Goslar in 1940, and to Wörthersee in 1943, and after the war to a refugee camp in St. Johann near Velden, where he suffered a stroke. After this he was permitted to return to Salzburg, but he soon moved on to Arolsen in Hesse, where he died on 3 January 1946. His gravestone is inscribed with \"UNSER LEBEN GEHT DAHIN WIE EIN GESCHWÄTZ\" (\"Our Life Passes Away Like Idle Chatter\").\n\nIn 1889, Wiligut joined the Schlaraffia, a quasi-masonic lodge. When he left the lodge in 1909, he held the rank of knight and the office of chancellor. His first book, \"Seyfrieds Runen\", was published in 1903 under his full real name with the addition Lobesam. \"Seyfrieds Runen\" was a collection of poems about the Rabenstein at Znaim on the Austrian-Moravian border. In 1908, followed the \"Neun Gebote Gots\", where Wiligut first claimed to be heir to an ancient tradition of Irminism. Both List and Wiligut were influenced by Friedrich Fischbach's 1900 \"Die Buchstaben Gutenbergs\".\nWiligut claimed to be in the tradition of a long line of Germanic mystic teachers, reaching back into prehistoric times. He also claimed to have spiritual powers that allowed him direct access to genetic memories of his ancestors thousands of years previously. \nFrom 1908, Wiligut was in contact with the occultist Ordo Novi Templi in Vienna. Wiligut claimed that the Bible had originally been written in Germanic, and testified to an \"Irminic\" religion – \"Irminenreligion\" or Irminism – that contrasted with Wotanism. He claimed to worship a Germanic god \"Krist\", whom Christianity was supposed later to have appropriated as their own saviour Christ.\n\nAccording to Wiligut, Germanic culture and history reached back to 228,000 BC. He proposed that at this time, there were three suns, and Earth was inhabited by giants, dwarfs and other mythical creatures. Wiligut claimed that his ancestors, the Adler-Wiligoten, ended a long period of war. By 12,500 BC, the Irminic religion of Krist was revealed and from that time became the religion of all Germanic peoples, until the schismatic adherents of Wotanism gained the upper hand. In 1200 BC, the Wotanists succeeded in destroying the Irminic religious center at Goslar, following which the Irminists erected a new temple at the \"Externsteine\", which was in turn appropriated by the Wotanists in AD 460. Wiligut's own ancestors were supposedly protagonists in this setting: the Wiligotis were \"Ueiskunings\" (\"Ice kings\") descending from a union of Aesir and Vanir. They founded the city of Vilna as the center of their Germanic empire and always remained true to their Irminic faith.\n\nWiligut's convictions assumed a paranoid trait in the 1920s as he became convinced that his family was the victim of a continuing persecution of Irminists, at present conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, the Jews, and the Freemasons, on which groups he also blamed the defeat of World War I and the downfall of the Habsburg Empire.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Wiligut wrote down 38 verses (out of a number purportedly exceeding 1,000), the so-called \"Halgarita Sprüche\", that he claimed to have memorized as a child, taught by his father. Wiligut had designed his own \"runic alphabet\" for this purpose.\n\nWerner von Bülow and Emil Rüdiger of the \"Edda-Gesellschaft\" (Edda Society) translated and annotated these verses. They claimed that numbers 27 and 1818 are connected with the Black Sun. Verse number 27 according to Willigut is a 20,000-year-old \"solar blessing\":\n\nWerner von Bülow translates this as follows:\nLegend tells, that two Suns, two wholesome in change-rule UR and SUN, alike to the hourglass which turned upside down ever gives one of these the victory / The meaning of the divine errant wandering way / dross star in fire's sphere became in fire-tongue revealed to the Earth-I-course of the race of Paradise / godwilling leaders lead to the weal through their care in universal course, what is visible and soon hidden, whence they led the imagination of mankind / polar in change-play, from UR to SUN in sacrificial service of waxing and waning, in holy fire Santur is ambiguously spent in sparks, but turns victorious to blessing.\n\n\"Santur\" is interpreted as a burnt-out sun that was still visible at the time of Homer. Rüdiger speculates that this was the center of the solar system hundreds of millennia ago, and he imagines a fight between the new and the old Suns that was decided 330,000 years ago. \"Santur\" is seen as the source of power of the Hyperboreans.\n\nIn esoteric currents of Neo-Nazism, Neofolk, National Socialist black metal and Neopaganism, Wiligut's writings enjoyed renewed interest in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1934, Wiligut developed a rune row loosely based on the Armanen runes of Guido von List even though Wiligut rejected List's runes and his overall philosophy.\n\nWiligut claimed to have been initiated into \"runic lore\" by his grandfather Karl Wiligut (1794–1883).\nHis rune row has 24 letters, like the Elder Futhark. Like von List's Armanen runes that are closely based on the Younger Futhark, many of Wiligut's runes are identical to historical runes, with some additions. The historical Futhark sequence is not preserved.\n\nWiligut's names for his runes are: Tel, Man, Kaun, Fa, Asa, Os, Eis, Not, Tor, Tyr, Laf, Rit, Thorn, Ur, Sig, Zil, Yr, Hag-Al, H, Wend-horn, Gibor, Eh, Othil, Bar-Bjork.\n\nRunes without precedent in the historical runes are Tel (a crossed ring, similar to the sun cross symbol), Tor (like a Latin T), Zil (like a rotated Latin Z), Gibor (taken from von List's runes). The shape of Wend-horn is similar to Tvimadur.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Pew Research Center and Public Religion Research Institute have conducted studies of reported frequency of attendance to religious service. The Harris Poll has conducted surveys of the percentage of people who believe in God.\n\nIn a 2009 Gallup International survey, 41.6% of American citizens said that they attended church or synagogue once a week or almost every week. This percentage is higher than other surveyed Western countries. In answering, \"Is religion important in your daily life,\" the Gallup organization reported a U.S. response of 65% reporting yes, compared to the United Kingdom with a 27% affirmative response. Church attendance varies considerably by state and region. The figures ranged from 63% in Mississippi to 23% in Vermont. The most religious region of the United States is American Samoa (99.3% religious).\n\nA 2013 survey reported that 31% Americans attend religious services at least weekly. It was conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute with a margin of error of 2.5. In 2006, a world-wide online Harris Poll surveyed 2,010 U.S. adults and found that 26% of those surveyed attended religious services \"every week or more often\", 9% went \"once or twice a month\", 21% went \"a few times a year\", 3% went \"once a year\", 22% went \"less than once a year\", and 18% never attend religious services. A 2013 Harris Poll reported an 8% decline in a belief in God, since a prior 2009 poll.\n\nAccording to a 2011 Gallup poll, the state with the greatest percentage of respondents identifying as \"very religious\" was Mississippi (59%), and the state with the smallest percentage were Vermont and New Hampshire (23%), while Florida (39%) and Minnesota (40%) were near the median. A 2014 Pew Research poll found that the states with the greatest percentage of respondents who stated that religion was \"very important\" or \"somewhat important\" to their lives were Alabama (90%) and Louisiana (90%), which the state with smallest percentage was Vermont (57%).\n\nThe third column below is the percentage reporting that religion is \"very important\" or \"somewhat important\" to their lives by U.S. state in 2014.

{"id": "8269997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8269997", "title": "Perfect Master (Meher Baba)", "text": "Perfect Master (Meher Baba)\n\nPerfect Master is the English term Meher Baba began to use in his writing as early as 1925 to denote the Eastern idea of a sadguru (Vedanta) or a qutub (Sufism). A Perfect Master, according to Baba, is a God-realized person (one whose limited individualized consciousness has merged with God) who can use his Divine attributes of Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss for the spiritual upliftment of others. In describing Meher Baba's specialized use of the term Charles Purdom writes, \"The title ‘Perfect Master’ . . . means one who has himself reached the goal to which he directs others: one who, pointing to God, has himself realized God.\" \n\nMeher Baba stated in his book \"God Speaks\" that when a spiritually advanced soul loses its consciousness as a separate being, it merges in God in one of three distinct states:\n\nMeher Baba calls people who are in the third state Perfect Masters or \"Mukammil\". He distinguishes the second state from Perfect Masters, calling them instead \"Perfect Ones\" or \"Kamil\". One of the aspects that he says demarcates the Perfect Master from the Perfect One is that the Perfect Master has disciples, while the Perfect One does not. Also Baba says that a Perfect Master can make like himself any number of souls or even the whole of creation, while the Perfect One can only make one soul like himself. However, Meher Baba makes it clear in his system as outlined in \"God Speaks\" that the consciousness of these souls is absolutely One and the same. To explain this apparent contradiction he likens the difference between these two classifications of God realized souls to a difference in the 'office' of the God Realized person.\n\nMeher Baba says that at all times on Earth there are 56 incarnate God-realized souls, but that of these only five are deemed the five Perfect Masters of their era. When one of the five Perfect Masters \"drops\" his physical body, Baba says, another God-realized soul among the 56 incarnate at that time replaces him by taking up that office in that moment. Thus, Meher Baba says there are 56 God-realized souls on Earth at all times, but only and exactly five hold the office of Perfect Master.\n\nIn addition, Baba says there is one very rare type of God-realized person who has no disciples but who has duties included in his office. These he says are called Most Perfect Ones or \"Akmal\".\n\nMeher Baba is unique among Indian teachers in that he said that the number of Perfect Masters on the Earth is exactly five at all times. He said further that at the time of his own God-realization the five Perfect Masters were Sai Baba of Shirdi, Upasni Maharaj, Hazrat Babajan, Hazrat Tajuddin Baba and Narayan Maharaj and that these five brought him down to human consciousness as the Avatar on Earth in this cycle of time. \"During the Avataric period,\nthe five Perfect Masters make God incarnate as man.\" He also said, \"What I am, what I was, and what I will be as the Ancient One is always due to the five Perfect Masters of the Age. Sai Baba, Upasni Maharaj, Babajan, Tajuddin Baba and Narayan Maharaj - these are the five Perfect Masters of this age for me.\" All of these have since died and Meher Baba did not say who their replacements were, except to indicate that for the time being they will be in the East. He further indicated that although the 'offices' of the five Perfect Masters are always filled, when they drop their bodies they 'also shed forever their Subtle and Mental vehicles and pass away utterly as God, retaining infinite Individuality and experiencing the Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss'.\n\nMeher Baba also said that while there are numerous planets in the Universe with human life on them, Earth is the only planet where God realization is possible and where the five Perfect Masters take birth.\n\nMeher Baba asserts that beyond the five Perfect Masters of the age, (distinguished as those God-realized souls which fulfill the office of Perfect Master temporarily until they drop their physical bodies), there is also the Avatar. \"The number of God-Realized souls on earth is eternally fixed at fifty-six and is never altered, except during Avataric ages when God directly descends as a man.\" The Avatar, according to Meher Baba, is a special Perfect Master who was the original Perfect Master, or the Ancient One, who never ceases to incarnate in spite of his original attainment of God-realization. Baba says that this particular soul personifies the preserver or sustainer state of God which in Hinduism is called \"Vishnu\" and in Sufism is called \"Parvardigar\". According to Meher Baba the Avatar appears on Earth every 700–1400 years, and is brought down into human form by the five Perfect Masters of that age to aid in the process of moving creation in its never-ending journey toward Godhood. He said that in other ages this role was fulfilled by Zoroaster, Rama, Krishna, Gautama Buddha, Jesus, and lastly by Muhammad. \"Of the most recognized and much worshiped manifestations of God as Avatar, that of Zarathustra is the earliest – having been before Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad.\" \n\nBesides Perfect One \"(Kamil)\", Most Perfect One \"(Akmal)\", and Perfect Master \"(Mukammil)\", Meher Baba described one other type of incarnate soul that has transcended the finite ego and merged in a state of God-consciousness, but cannot help others. This type is the \"Majzoob\" (Arabic: \"Absorbed\"). Unlike the Perfect Master, or any of the other sub-types of God-realized souls, the Majzoob is absorbed in God to such a degree that he cannot be of any direct assistance to anyone else in creation though he can be of indirect help to those who honor him. This is because he is a perfect mast and as such has no experience of the external physical or internal mental worlds. According to Meher Baba the Majzoob has no experience of the gross, subtle, or mental worlds, but is entirely absorbed in the bliss of his state of Godhood.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2725670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2725670", "title": "Pharmakos", "text": "Pharmakos\n\nA pharmakós (, plural pharmakoi) in Ancient Greek religion was the ritualistic sacrifice or exile of a human scapegoat or victim.\n\nA slave, a cripple or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the Thargelia, a festival of Apollo at Athens, two men, the \"Pharmakoi\", were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation.\n\nSome scholia state that \"pharmakoi\" were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the \"pharmakos\" (the iambic satirist Hipponax) shows the \"pharmakoi\" being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.\n\nIn \"Aesop in Delphi\" (1961), Anton Wiechers discussed the parallels between the legendary biography of Aesop (in which he is unjustly tried and executed by the Delphians) and the \"pharmakos\" ritual. For example, Aesop is grotesquely deformed, as was the \"pharmakos\" in some traditions; and Aesop was thrown from a cliff, as was the pharmakos in some traditions.\n\nGregory Nagy, in \"Best of the Achaeans\" (1979), compared Aesop’s \"pharmakos\" death to the “worst” of the Achaeans in the \"Iliad\", Thersites. More recently, both Daniel Ogden, \"The Crooked Kings of Ancient Greece\" (1997) and Todd Compton, \"Victim of the Muses: Poet as Scapegoat, Warrior and Hero\" (2006) examine poet \"pharmakoi\". Compton surveys important poets who were exiled, executed or suffered unjust trials, either in history, legend or Greek or Indo-European myth.\n\nWalter Burkert and René Girard have written influential modern interpretations of the \"pharmakos\" rite. Burkert shows that humans were sacrificed or expelled after being fed well, and, according to some sources, their ashes were scattered to the ocean. This was a purification ritual, a form of societal catharsis. Girard likewise discusses the connection between catharsis, sacrifice, and purification. Some scholars have connected the practice of ostracism, in which a prominent politician was exiled from Athens after a vote using pottery pieces, with the \"pharmakos\" custom. However, the ostracism exile was only for a fixed time, as opposed to the finality of the \"pharmakos\" execution or expulsion.\n\nPharmakos is also used as a vital term in Derridean deconstruction. In his essay \"Plato's Pharmacy\", Derrida deconstructs several texts by Plato, such as \"Phaedrus\", and reveals the inter-connection between the word chain \"pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus\" and the notably absent word \"pharmakos\". In doing so, he attacks the boundary between inside and outside, declaring that the outside (pharmakos, never uttered by Plato) is always-already present right behind the inside (\"pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus\"). As a concept, Pharmakos can be said to be related to other Derridian terms such as \"trace\".\n\n\n"}

However, Mazyar returned in 822/23 with the support of the Abbasid Caliphate to take revenge. Shapur, who was the son and successor of Shahriyar I, was defeated and killed along with Vinda-Umid. Mazyar then united Tabaristan under his own rule.\n\nMazyar, however, later rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate, an act which was widely supported by the native Zoroastrians, who began plundering the Muslim villages. The Tahirid ruler Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani and the Abbasid caliph al-Mu'tasim shortly sent five corps that entered Tabaristan from all sides. Mazyar made his brother Quhyar as the defender of the Qarinvand mountains, and the Bavandid Qarin I as the defender of eastern Tabaristan. However, the fall of Tabaristan went quickly: several cities were caught by surprise, while Qarin I betrayed Mazyar and agreed to aid the Abbasids in exchange for being restored as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. The people of Sari shortly revolted against Mazyar, and Quhyar betrayed Mazyar, and had him captured and given to al-Mu'tasim.\n\nMazyar was shortly brought to Samarra, where he was executed.

He emerged as an apologist for faith in Evangelical Christianity during the 1970s. He and his soon-to-be wife, Gretchen, had already begun to collaborate in a ministry of Christian evangelism toward adherents of the Jehovah's Witnesses when they became acquainted with the Baptist pastor and countercult writer Walter Martin. Martin was the founder of the apologetics ministry Christian Research Institute. In 1974 Martin relocated the Institute from New Jersey to southern California where he re-established his ministry in association with the Melodyland School of Theology. Martin officiated as the minister at the marriage ceremony of the Passantinos.\n\nThe Passantinos assisted Martin in the ministry of the Christian Research Institute for approximately five years from 1974 to 1979. In that context Martin privately taught them the rudiments of the discipline of apologetics and of investigative reporting in countercult ministry. During the 1970s and 1980s Gretchen served as an editorial assistant in preparing revised editions of some of Martin's books such as \"The Rise of the Cults\", \"The Kingdom of the Cults\" and \"The Maze of Mormonism\". As a couple, the Passantinos began to develop their profile as speakers in evangelical churches delivering presentations about cults and general apologetics questions concerning the existence of God and the historicity of the Bible. Together they then branched out from working at Christian Research Institute and began to operate their own apologetics and countercult ministry known as Christian Apologetics: Research and Information Service (CARIS). This ministry subsequently was renamed as Answers In Action.\n\nThey founded Answers In Action with the intent to help both Christians and non-Christians apply logic and reason to religious inquiry and to assist in answering questions about apologetics, religion, philosophy, evangelism, and theology. Robert's approach to religion was to \"represent their belief system as accurately as you would have them represent yours.\"\n\nSome of their initial writing appeared as researched chapters in Martin's book \"The New Cults\". Their first co-written book \"Answers to the Cultist at Your Door\" was designed as a popular apologetics handbook for Christians. The book consisted of brief chapters about the phenomenon of cults followed by specific chapters containing evangelical apologetic responses to the doctrines taught by the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Unification Church, Hare Krishna, and the Way International.\n\nPassantino contributed an essay on Jehovah's Witnesses in Ronald Enroth's book \"Evangelising the Cults\". This essay centered a basic Evangelical apologetic argument that challenged the stance taken by Jehovah's Witnesses on three doctrines: the Trinity, Christ, and Salvation. He also contributed a lengthy essay that explored the theory, techniques, and application of religious research to the Evangelical Ministries to New Religions' symposium volume \"Contend for the Faith\" that was published in 1992.\n\nDuring the 1990s the Passantinos emerged as critical evangelical voices on a number of questions connected to Protestant understandings about the subject of Satanism and the Occult. One of their early exposés, first published in Cornerstone magazine, concerned Lauren Stratford's fraudulent claims of satanic ritual abuse. They were highly skeptical about claims concerning Satanic Ritual Abuse and they argued that the basis of these claims could be explained as a combination of folklore and moral panic. In both published essays and books they called into question what they regarded as misconceptions commonly held by Christians about the beliefs and practices of Satanist groups. This included their alarm at how Satanists were often accused in Christian literature or in popular media as being perpetrators of organized crime.\n\nPassantino's commitment to a libertarian concept of free-agency led to critical evaluations of theological, philosophical, and socio-psychological forms of determinism. Against a wide current of Christian and non-Christian opinion, the Passantinos published a controversial article in Cornerstone magazine in 1994, titled \"Overcoming The Bondage Of Victimization: A Critical Evaluation of Cult Mind Control Theories\" , in which they criticized the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of \"mind control\" and \"exit counseling\" models. The article was reprinted in a later edition of Martin's \"The Kingdom of the Cults\", but has since been removed due to allegations that it didn't represent Martin's own views.\n\nThe Passantinos were highly influential on other apologists as evidenced by the acknowledgements made by other apologists who refer to them concerning their input and research. This was particularly so because it was new and no one had really addressed the subject prior to the 1970s.\n\nRobert Passantino died on November 17, 2003, age 52, due to cardiac arrest. He is buried at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California. His wife, Gretchen, died from cardiac dysrhythmia as a result of undiagnosed diabetes on October 2, 2014, age 61, at Hoag Hospital Newport Beach. They are survived by their three children.\n\nIn October 2007, Norman Geisler and Chad Meister published a collection of essays written in honor of Passantino titled \"Reasons for Faith: Making a Case for the Christian Faith\".\n\n\n"}

Most contained syncretistic elements from Western esotericism.\nForms of Witchcraft religions inspired by the Semitic milieu, such as \"Jewitchery\", may also be enclosed within the Semitic Neopagan movement. These Witchcraft groups are particularly influenced by Jewish feminism, focusing on the goddess cults of the Israelites.\n\nThe most notable contemporary Levantine Neopagan group is known as Am Ha Aretz (, lit. \"People of the Land\", a rabbinical term for uneducated and religiously unobservant Jews), \"AmHA\" for short, based in Israel. This group grew out of Ohavei Falcha, \"Lovers of the Soil\", a movement founded in the late 19th century.\n\nElie Sheva, according to her own testimony an \"elected leader of AmHA\" reportedly founded an American branch of the group, known as \"Primitive Hebrew Assembly\".\n\n\"Beit Asherah\" (\"House of Asherah\"), was one of the first Jewish Neopagan groups, founded in the early 1990s by Stephanie Fox, Steven Posch, and Magenta Griffiths.

Its Latin masthead is \"Pro Vita, Pro Ecclesia Dei et Pro Hibernia\" 'for life, for the Church of God and for Ireland'. It is called after the Dutch Carmelite priest-journalist Blessed Titus Brandsma, who lived in Ireland for a period in the 1930s and was subsequently martyred by the Nazis.\n\nThe magazine was founded in the wake of the X Case and the resignation of Bishop Casey of Galway in 1992 and it has maintained a consistent pro-life position since then, regarding euthanasia and embryo experimentation as much as abortion.\n\nThe legend 'Ecclesia Dei' is a reference to the 1988 document of Pope John Paul II, \"Ecclesia Dei Adflicta\" which deals with the Tridentine Mass, but this is not a unanimous position within the editorial board. Board members of the Latin Mass Society of Ireland have contributed pieces over the years. At the same time, the Review tries to cultivate a broad presentation of Catholic culture and has correspondents in North America, continental Europe and the Antipodes. It sometimes publishes articles by non-Catholics (generally Evangelical Protestants and eastern Orthodox, but sometimes Jews, Muslims and conservative secularists have contributed) on matters of common concern.\n\n\"The Brandsma Review\" has published many articles criticising the state of catechesis in Irish Catholic schools and the existence of unorthodox liturgical practices and doctrinal statements within sections of Irish Catholicism. It has also been critical of the tendency of some traditionalists to adopt extreme-right views. The March–April 2008 issue (vol. 17 no.2) p. 2 has an editorial \"Beware of French Letter Liberals - And Jew Baiters!\" which describes \"our sniff test for articles submitted for publication. The left nostril is for pro-contraceptionists... the right nostril, for Jew baiters. Both are incompatible with real Catholicism, and so both are a no-no.\" It has also published articles questioning the alleged Marian apparitions at Medugorje.\n\nThe founder editor of \"The Brandsma Review\" is Nick Lowry, a retired news editor from Radio Telefís Éireann who contributes signed editorials and a regular column \"Straws for the Camel's Back\" commenting on current events within Irish Catholicism. Lowry retired in February 2012 and was replaced by Peadar Laighleis, who was also President of the Latin Mass Society of Ireland. The original model used was that of the \"Ballintrillick Review\", which was in circulation in Ireland in the 1980s, until its editor Doris Manley died of cancer; the \"Ballintrillick Review\" was outspokenly pro-life but was somewhat more communitarian on economic matters and had no particular interest in the Tridentine Mass. Many of the original \"Brandsma Review\" subscribers had subscribed to the more strident \"Faith and Family\" which earned notoriety at the time by being banned from the Catholic book store Veritas.\n\n"}

Garrido Canabal served as dictator and governor of the state of Tabasco from 1920 to 1924 and again from 1931 to 1934, and was particularly noted for his Anti-Catholicism. During his term he fiercely persecuted the Church in his state, killing many priests and laymen and driving the remainder underground.\n\nTomás Garrido Canabal was born in the hacienda Catazajá in the northernmost part of the Mexican state of Chiapas. During the Mexican Revolution, he was drawn into politics. He was named interim governor of Tabasco for a brief spell in 1919 (and then of the Yucatán in May and June 1920) until in December 1920 \"Garrido again \nbecame provisional governor of Tabasco. From this point until August 1935 (except for a brief hiatus during the de la Huerta rebellion) he controlled the state.\" Garrido's rule, which marked the apogee of Mexican anti-clericalism, was supported by the Radical Socialist Party of Tabasco (PRST) of which he was the leader.\nA character thought to be based on Canabal, in the novel The Power and the Glory, was called an \"atheist and a puritan\" by Peter Godman. Canabal was a fervent anticlericalist and anti-Catholic, who supported President Plutarco Elías Calles's war against the Cristeros, a rebellion opposed to the enforcement of anticlerical laws. He founded several organizations \"that terrorized Roman Catholics\", most notably the so-called \"Camisas Rojas\" or \"Red Shirts\", and as a result some have labeled him a \"fascist\", but he named one of his sons after Vladimir Lenin, a Marxist and anti-fascist, and considered himself a Marxist Bolshevik. The anthem of his Redshirts was The Internationale, widely considered to be the socialist anthem. Some scholars have argued that his authoritarian policies were more akin to European right-wing dictatorships, though he wished to turn the traditionally conservative state of Tabasco into a socialist model and fought for socialist causes and Tabasco has been called a \"socialist tyranny\" by Martin C. Needler, Dean of the School of International Studies at the University of the Pacific in California. He also invited the First Congress of Socialist Students to meet in the state of Tabasco and created a form of socialist education which he termed \"Rationalist\".\n\nGarrido Canabal's revolutionary fervor was reflected in the names of his children: Lenin and Zoila Libertad. He even had a farm with a bull named God, an ox and a hog named Pope, a cow named after Mary, and a donkey named Christ. In Tabasco, satirical plays were also organised, with for instance \"the parading of a stud bull called 'the bishop' or an ass labeled 'the pope.'\"\n\nRoberto Hinojosa, the Bolivian revolutionary, described Garrido's Tabasco as \"the Bethlehem of the Socialist dawn in America\" and Garrido as an \"academic and farmer, intellectual and rancher, a guide and soldier of socialism\".\n\nGarrido Canabal's administrative achievements included stimulating the social development of the state of Tabasco by means of agricultural and social policies and his support for the enfranchisement of women. In 1934, he introduced women's suffrage to Tabasco, making him the second governor to do so after Felipe Carrillo Puerto of the Yucatán twelve years earlier. In Mexico, Garrido Canabal's Tabasco was one of several \"vying with one another for the title 'Laboratory of the Revolution'.\" As Governor, however, he also issued rigid decrees against corsets and alcohol and outlawed tombstones.\n\nWhen Lázaro Cárdenas was elected president in 1934, his first cabinet was hand-picked by his patron, Plutarco Elías Calles, the \"Jefe Máximo\" and power behind the presidency. Calles named fellow anticlerical Garrido Canabal as Secretary of Agriculture to Lázaro Cárdenas's cabinet. Garrido Canabal brought the Red Shirts to Mexico City. Soon after Cárdenas took office, he turned against Garrido Canabal. In 1935, after Garrido Canabal ordered his Red Shirts to kill Catholic activists in Mexico City seeking to return to Tabasco, Cárdenas forced Garrido Canabal to step down and into exile in Costa Rica. Dismissing Garrido Canabal was part of Cárdenas's political maneuvering against Calles, who had expected to continue to be the power behind the presidency. Politically, eliminating Garrido Canabal and Calles gained Cárdenas the grudging support of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. Garrido Canabal's paramilitary groups were subsequently disbanded. He was allowed to return to Mexico in 1941 and died two years later of cancer in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe lieutenant in Graham Greene's \"The Power and the Glory\" is clearly based on Garrido Canabal, though his name is never mentioned. The novel's protagonist is a (also unnamed) \"whisky priest\", a theme often used in Garrido Canabal's antireligious propaganda.\n"}
{"id": "362474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362474", "title": "Visitor", "text": "Visitor\n\nA visitor, in English and Welsh law and history, is an overseer of an autonomous ecclesiastical or eleemosynary institution, often a charitable institution set up for the perpetual distribution of the founder's alms and bounty, who can intervene in the internal affairs of that institution. Those with such visitors are mainly cathedrals, chapels, schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals.\n\nMany visitors hold their role \"ex officio\", by serving as the British sovereign, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Chief Justice, or the bishop of a particular diocese. Others can be appointed in various ways, depending on the constitution of the organization in question. Bishops are usually the visitors to their own cathedrals. The Queen usually delegates her visitatorial functions to the Lord Chancellor. During the reform of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the 19th century, Parliament ordered Visitations to the universities to make inquiries and to reform the university and college statutes.\n\nThere is a ceremonial element to the role, and the visitor may also be called upon to give advice where an institution expresses doubt as to its powers under its charter and statutes. However, the most important function of the visitor was within academic institutions, where the visitor had to determine disputes arising between the institution and its members. The right of the visitor, and not the courts, to adjudge on alleged deviations from the statutes of academic colleges was affirmed in the case of \"Philips v. Bury\", 1694, in which the House of Lords overruled a judgement of the Court of King's Bench. Traditionally, the courts have been exempted from any jurisdiction over student complaints. There had been much speculation that this contravened the Human Rights Act 1998. However, the Higher Education Act 2004 transferred the jurisdiction of Visitors over the grievances of students in English and Welsh universities to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.\n\nThe position has also existed in universities in other countries which have followed the English and Welsh model (there being no such office in Scotland), although in many countries the visitor's role in complaints has been transferred to other bodies.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Universities Act, 1997 redefines the appointment, function and responsibility of a visitor. Where a university does not have a Visitor, a visitor may be appointed by the Government and must be either a current Judge of the High Court or a retired Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court.\n\nIn Fiji the Court of Appeal in Muma v USP [1995] FJLawRp 16 declared that in default of appointment, the country's President was the Visitor of a university established by the Queen since Fiji had subsequently become a republic.\n\nThe Governor of Victoria is the visitor to all Victorian universities, but has only ceremonial duties.\n\nThe Governor of New South Wales is the visitor to Macquarie University, Sydney Grammar School, and the University of Sydney pursuant to statute. The governor is also the visitor of the University of Wollongong by the University of Wollongong Act 1989. Only ceremonial duties can be exercised by the Governor of NSW in his or her role as visitor; this is mandated under the same Act.\n\nIn Canada, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as a member of the Canadian Royal Family, has served as visitor to Upper Canada College, in Toronto, Ontario, since 1955.\n\nAlso in Canada, the Queen's Representative in Ontario, His Honour the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, serves as the visitor to the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. A similar arrangement has the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador serving as the Visitor to Memorial University of Newfoundland. On a slightly higher level, the Governor General of Canada automatically serves as the official visitor of McGill University. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal is visitor to Bishop's University in Lennoxville, Quebec while the Anglican Bishop of Huron is the visitor to Renison University College in Waterloo, Ontario.\n\nIn India, the President of India is the visitor to 126 Central government institutes (e.g. the IITs).\n\nIn the United States, the office of visitor, from its early use at some colleges and other institutions, evolved specifically into that of a trustee. Certain colleges and universities, particularly of an earlier, often colonial founding, are governed by boards of visitors, often chaired by a rector (rather than regents or trustees, etc.). Examples include the College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia.\n\nIn Nigeria, the Visitor in publicly funded tertiary institution is the most senior member of government. This is usually the President in federally funded Universities or the Governor for State funded Universities. \n\n\n"}

He wrote the work, as the full title states, at the command of Charlemagne. As Charlemagne is only called king of the Franks and Lombards, not Emperor, the work must have been written before the year 800.\nThe form of the book is that of a dialogue between pupil and teacher. The pupil propounds the difficulties and the teacher gives the solution. Wigbold, however, did not compose these answers himself, but gives verbatim, statements by eight Church Fathers: St. Augustine, St. Gregory, St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. Hilary, St. Isidore, St. Eucherius and St. Junilius. For the greater part of Genesis only Jerome and Isidore are drawn on, and later Isidore almost entirely. The two members of the Congregation of Saint-Maur, Martène and Durand, who found the manuscript in the monastery of St. Maximin of Trier, have, therefore, only given the portion to the first three chapters of Genesis in their \"Collectio amplissima\", IX, (Paris, 1733), 295-366. This portion has been reprinted in P. L., XCVI. 1101-68.\nThe work is chiefly valuable for its preservation of the texts of the Fathers quoted. The commentary is preceded by three Latin poems in hexameter. In the first Wigbold felicitates his book, because it is to be taken into the palace of the king; in the second he praises the king, particularly because Charlemagne has brought together books from many places, and because he knows the Bible well; in the third he treats the seven days of creation. The first two are largely taken from the introductory poems written by Eugenius II of Toledo to the work of Dracontius, the third is the closing poem to Dracontius (\"Monum. German. Histor.: Poet. Latin.\", I, 95-97). The manuscript used by Martène and Durand is now unknown. Two manuscripts without the poems are at Admont and Vienna.\nNothing positive is known as to the author. Martène and Durand mention Wigbald, who was vice- chancellor under the chancellors Itherius and Rado, and Widbod, who was Count of Périgueux about 778. The last mentioned hardly seems possible.\n"}
