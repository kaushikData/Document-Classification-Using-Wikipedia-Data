{"id": "174443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174443", "title": "Azazel", "text": "Azazel\n\nAzazel (; ; ) appears in the Bible in association with the scapegoat rite. In some traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, it is the name for a fallen angel.\n\nIn the Bible, the term is used thrice in Leviticus 16, where two male goats were to be sacrificed to Yahweh and one of the two was selected by lot, for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots. One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , \"for Azazel\". This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of Yom Kippur.\n\nIn older English versions, such as the King James Version, the phrase \"la-azazel\" is translated as \"as a scapegoat\", however, in most modern English Bible translations, it is represented as a name in the text:\n\nLater rabbis, interpreting \"azazel\" as \"azaz\" (rugged) and \"el\" (of God), take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down.\n\nDespite the expectation of Brandt (1889) to date no evidence has surfaced of Azazel as a demon or god prior to the earliest Jewish sources among the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nIn the Dead Sea Scrolls, the name Azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4Q203, \"The Book of Giants\", which is a part of the Enochic literature found at Qumran.\n\nAccording to the Book of Enoch, which brings Azazel into connection with the Biblical story of the fall of the angels, located on Mount Hermon, a gathering-place of demons of old, Azazel is one of the leaders of the rebellious Watchers in the time preceding the Flood; he taught men the art of warfare, of making swords, knives, shields, and coats of mail, and taught women the art of deception by ornamenting the body, dyeing the hair, and painting the face and the eyebrows, and also revealed to the people the secrets of witchcraft and corrupted their manners, leading them into wickedness and impurity until at last he was, at Yahweh's command, bound hand and foot by the archangel Raphael and chained to the rough and jagged rocks of [Ha] Dudael (= Beth Ḥadudo), where he is to abide in utter darkness until the great Day of Judgment, when he will be cast into the fire to be consumed forever.\n\nThe translators of the Greek Septuagint understood the Hebrew term as meaning \"the sent away\", and read: \"and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scapegoat (Greek \"apopompaio\" dat.).\n\nFollowing the Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate, Martin Luther and the King James Version also give readings such as Young's Literal Translation: \"And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for a goat of departure\".\n\nAccording to the \"Peshitta\", Azazel is rendered \"Za-za-e'il\" (the strong one against/of God), as in Qumran fragment 4Q180.\n\nAccording to the Book of Enoch (a book of the Apocrypha), Azazel (here spelled \"‘ăzā’zyēl\") was one of the chief Grigori, a group of fallen angels who married women. This same story (without any mention of Azazel) is told in the book of Genesis 6:2–4: \"That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. […] There were giants in the earth in those days; and also afterward, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\"\n\nEnoch portrays Azazel as responsible for teaching people to make weapons and cosmetics, for which he was cast out of heaven. The Book of Enoch 8:1–3a reads, \"And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates; and made known to them the metals [of the earth] and the art of working them; and bracelets and ornaments; and the use of antimony and the beautifying of the eyelids; and all kinds of costly stones and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways.\"\n\nThe corruption brought on by Azazel and the Grigori degrades the human race, and the four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel) “saw much blood being shed upon the earth and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth […] The souls of men [made] their suit, saying, \"Bring our cause before the Most High; […] Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were in heaven, which men were striving to learn.\"\n\nGod sees the sin brought about by Azazel and has Raphael “bind Azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert – which is in Dudael – and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there forever, and cover his face that he may not see light.”\n\nSeveral scholars have previously discerned that some details of Azazel's punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat rite. Thus, Lester Grabbe points to a number of parallels between the Azazel narrative in Enoch and the wording of Leviticus 16, including \"the similarity of the names Asael and Azazel; the punishment in the desert; the placing of sin on Asael/Azazel; the resultant healing of the land.\" Daniel Stökl also observes that \"the punishment of the demon resembles the treatment of the goat in aspects of geography, action, time and purpose.\" Thus, the place of Asael’s punishment designated in Enoch as Dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the Yom Kippur ritual. Stökl remarks that \"the name of place of judgment (\"Dudael\") is conspicuously similar in both traditions and can likely be traced to a common origin.\"\n\nAzazel's fate is foretold near the end of Enoch 2:8, where God says, “On the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. […] The whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin.\"\n\nIn the fifth-century 3 Enoch, Azazel is one of the three angels (Azza [Shemhazai] and Uzza [Ouza] are the other two) who opposed Enoch's high rank when he became the angel Metatron. Whilst they were fallen at this time they were still in Heaven, but Metatron held a dislike for them, and had them cast out.\n\nIn the extra-canonical text the Apocalypse of Abraham (c.1stC CE), Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird who came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared. (This is in reference to Genesis 15:11: \"Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away\" [NIV]).\n\nThe text also associates Azazel with the serpent and hell. In Chapter 23, verse 7, it is described as having seven heads, 14 faces, \"hands and feet like a man's [and] on his back six wings on the right and six on the left.\"\n\nAbraham says that the wicked will \"putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel, and be burned by the fire of Azazel's tongue\" (Abr. 31:5), and earlier says to Azazel himself, \"May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth! Go, Azazel, into the untrodden parts of the earth. For your heritage is over those who are with you\" (Abr. 14:5–6).\n\nHere there is the idea that God's heritage (the created world) is largely under the dominion of evil – i.e., it is \"shared with Azazel\" (Abr. 20:5), again identifying him with Satan, who was called \"the prince of this world\" by Jesus. ( niv)\n\nThe Mishnah (Yoma 39a) follows the Hebrew Bible text; two goats were procured, similar in respect of appearance, height, cost, and time of selection. Having one of these on his right and the other on his left, the high priest, who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates, put both his hands into a wooden case, and took out two labels, one inscribed \"for Yahweh\" and the other \"for Azazel\". The high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said, \"A sin-offering to Yahweh\" (thus speaking the Tetragrammaton); and the two men accompanying him replied, \"Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.\" He then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat \"for Azazel\"; and laying his hands upon it again, recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness: \"O Lord, I have acted iniquitously, trespassed, sinned before Thee: I, my household, and the sons of Aaron Thy holy ones. O Lord, forgive the iniquities, transgressions, and sins that I, my household, and Aaron's children, Thy holy people, committed before Thee, as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, 'for on this day He will forgive you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord; ye shall be clean.'\"\n\nThis prayer was responded to by the congregation present. A man was selected, preferably a priest, to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of Jerusalem. Ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from Jerusalem to the steep mountain. At each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink, which he, however, refused. When he reached the tenth booth those who accompanied him proceeded no further, but watched the ceremony from a distance. When he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts, one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat's horns, and then pushed the goat down (Yoma vi. 1–8). The cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below, its limbs were utterly shattered. Men were stationed at intervals along the way, and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice, they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags, until the information reached the high priest, whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual.\n\nThe scarlet thread is symbolically referenced in ; and the Talmud states (ib. 39a) that during the forty years that Simeon the Just was High Priest of Israel, the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice: a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven. In later times the change to white was not invariable: a proof of the people's moral and spiritual deterioration, that was gradually on the increase, until forty years before the destruction of the Second Temple, when the change of color was no longer observed (l.c. 39b).\n\nThe medieval scholar Nahmanides (1194–1270) identified the Hebrew text as also referring to a demon, and identified this \"Azazel\" with Samael. However, he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring Azazel as a deity, but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin, the source of all impurity. The very fact that the two goats were presented before God, before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness, was proof that Azazel was not ranked alongside God, but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of God.\n\nMaimonides (1134–1204) says that as sins cannot be taken off one’s head and transferred elsewhere, the ritual is symbolic, enabling the penitent to discard his sins: “These ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent, as if to say, ‘We have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible’.”\n\nThe rite, resembling, on one hand, the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of Shinar in the vision of Zechariah (), and, on the other, the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague (), was, indeed, viewed by the people of Jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year. So would the crowd, called Babylonians or Alexandrians, pull the goat's hair to make it hasten forth, carrying the burden of sins away with it (Yoma vi. 4, 66b; \"Epistle of Barnabas,\" vii.), and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of Bet Ḥadudo, twelve miles away from the city, was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of Jerusalem, who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills (Yoma vi. 6, 8; Ta'an. iv. 8). Evidently the figure of Azazel was an object of general fear and awe rather than, as has been conjectured, a foreign product or the invention of a late lawgiver. More as a demon of the desert, it seems to have been closely interwoven with the mountainous region of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Vulgate contains no mention of \"Azazel\" but only of caper emissarius, or \"emissary goat\":\nEnglish versions, such as the King James version, followed the Septuagint and Vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat. The modern English Standard Version provides the footnote \"16:8 The meaning of Azazel is uncertain; possibly the name of a place or a demon, traditionally a scapegoat; also verses 10, 26\". Most scholars accept the indication of some kind of demon or deity, however Judit M. Blair notes that this is an argument without supporting contemporary text evidence.\n\nIda Zatelli (1998) has suggested that the Hebrew ritual parallels pagan practice of sending a scapegoat into the desert on the occasion of a royal wedding found in two ritual texts in archives at Ebla (24th C. BC). A she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of 'Alini' by the community. There is no mention of an \"Azazel\".\n\nAccording to \"The Expositor's Bible Commentary\", Azazel is the Hebrew word for scapegoat. This is the only place that the Hebrew word is found in the whole Hebrew Old Testament. It says that the Book of Enoch, (extra-biblical Jewish theological literature, dated around 200 B.C.) is full of demonology and reference to fallen angels. The EBC (Vol 2) says that this text uses late Aramaic forms for these names which indicates that The Book of Enoch most likely relies upon the Hebrew Leviticus text rather than the Leviticus text being reliant upon the Book of Enoch.\n\nCyril of Alexandria sees the \"apompaios\" (sent-away one, scapegoat) as a foretype of Christ.\n\nOrigen (\"Contra Celsum,\" vi. 43) identifies Azazel with Satan.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches that the scapegoat, or \"Azazel\", is a symbol for Satan. This was commonly taught among Christians of other centuries as well. The scapegoat scenario has been interpreted to be a prefigure of the final judgment by which sin is removed forever from the universe. Through the sacrifice of Jesus, the sins of the believers are forgiven them, but the fact that sins were committed still exist on record in the \"Books\" of heaven (see ). After the final judgment, the responsibility for all those forgiven sins are accredited to the originator of sin, Satan, after which Satan is destroyed in the Lake of Fire. Sin will no longer exist anywhere.\n\nThey believe that Satan will finally have to bear the responsibility for the sins of the believers of all ages, and that this was foreshadowed on the Day of Atonement when the high priest confessed the sins of Israel over the head of the scapegoat ().\n\nSome critics have accused Adventists of giving Satan the status of sin-bearer alongside Jesus Christ. Adventists have responded by insisting that Satan is not a saviour, nor does he provide atonement for sin; Christ alone is the substitutionary sacrifice for sin, but holds no responsibility for it. In the final judgment, responsibility for sin is passed back to Satan who first caused mankind to sin. As the responsible party, Satan receives the wages for his sin – namely, death. Jesus alone bore the wage of death for the sinful world, while the guilt of sin is ultimately disposed of on Satan who carried the responsibility of \"leading the whole world astray.\" Thus, the unsaved are held responsible for their own sin, while the saved depend on Christ's righteousness. The SDA Sabbath School quarterly, 2013 asks the question, \"Does Satan then play a role in our salvation, as some falsely charge we teach? Of course not. Satan never, in any way, bears sin for us as a substitute. Jesus alone has done that, and it is blasphemy to think that Satan had any part in our redemption.\"\n\nIn Islamic tradition, Azazel (Arabic: عزازيل \"Azāzīl\", also known as Arabic: حارث \"Ḥārith\" ) is depicted as a former archangel, who is identified with Iblis, that means \"to despair\". Accordingly Azazel despaired from God, thus earning him the name \"Iblis\". The name Azazel is also related to the Arabic words \"Aziz\" and \"il\" with the meaning either \"God's strength\" or \"God's dear\", the latter referring to Azazil, as God's once favorite angel. Although Azazel is not mentioned by name in Quran, he is commonly mentioned in some reports of the \"Sahabah\" especially those attributed to Ibn Abbas. \n\nSometimes Azazel is recognized as an angel different from Iblis, who accompanied Harut and Marut to earth. In this case, Azazel appears in direct reference to the Watchers.\n\nTraditionally Azazel is depicted as an angel with four wings, who was the leader and teacher of the other angels. Additionally he was appointed as the ruler of the lower heavens and the earths and was member of an angelic group called 'jinn', who were the guardians of Jannah. Then the former inhabitants of earth caused corruption, Azazel came down from the heavens with an army of angels to defeat them. Then God created human to supersede the former inhabitants of earth, Azazil grow haughty, since he thought, the angels were now the favorite creation of God, thereupon He ordered the angels to prostrate before human as a test. Azazel along with the angels argued, why God should create a human being, who will shed blood and confusion like the former inhabitants, whom they had just defeated before, while the angels prostrate before God and sing his glory day and night, thus would never fail Gods orders. Since Azazel insisted on being superior than any other creature, even compared to other angels, he refused to prostrate himself, whereupon he was cast out of heaven.\n\nThe eleventh-century Islamic scholar Al-Tha`labi listed in his work \"Arāʾis al-madjālis fī ḳiṣaṣ al-anbiyā\" the ten punishments of Azazel for his refusal:\n\nFurther Al-Tha`labi relates a story, in which Azazel tried to sneak back into the Garden Eden and tricked its keeper by hiding inside the mouth of a serpent and with the aid of a peacock.\n\nIn Malays lore, Azazel appears both as an angel and \"Al-Jann\". Accordingly, Azazel used to be an angel, but was turned into Jann after his refusal to bow down before Adam and then begot the Jinn. They once dwelled in the lowest heaven, but descended to earth, then they battled each other and become disobedient towards God.\n\nAnother example can be seen in the Isma'ili literature of the Ginans. Pir Sadardin explains in the fourth verse of his Ginan \"Allah ek kassam\":\n<poem>All the present angels performed their prostrations to human and human accepted the prostrations\nAzāzīl did not obey The Commandment, and as such he was reduced in his status earned [that is, of an angel and the blessings thereof]</poem>\n\nIn the Ismaili work Umm al-Kitab, Azazel is the first emanation of the \"high king\" (God) and loaned the power of creation from Him. Because he was also able to create, he boasted himself being another god besides his Creator. God answered him: \"It is impossible, that there will be two gods.\" Afterwards God made a creation which exceeds these of Azazel, so Azazel may confess, he wholly depends on God. But Azazel refuses to accept the new creation 'Salman', therefore he sinned again. Everytime, Azazel sinned, God took away a colour until he and those who sided with him, became darker and more inferior. Finally they reach the earthen plane, that is accordingly made out of the essence of Azazels creation. In contrast, the lifeforce of human originated from the heavenly realm. Azazel whereupon seduces humans, leading them into the material realm, trying to keep them trapped there. The depiction of Azazel in Umm al-Kitab, resembles the Gnostic Demiurge.\n\nAccording to Alevi oral tradition regarding the creation of the world, the archangel Cebrail (Gabriel) taught the other archangels Mikail, Israfil, Azrail and Azazel, they are all creatures made by God. All of these angels believed him, except Azazel. Thus Cebrail introduced Azazel to follow, showing him the truth about their origin. Thereupon Cebrail led Azazel to a lamp, which had seven doors, but these doors won't open. A voice sounded, they shall serve here for 1001 days. They all did, after that the doors opened and the angels entered the lamp. Inside the lamp there were two lights forming one body. A voice sounded again, commanding the angels to prostrate themselves before the light. Azazel responded: \"This is also a created body\", and refused to prostrate himself before the lights, but remained in service of God. In Alevi perspective, this narration shows that Azazel served God, until the \"last door\" opened, but then he despised it and moved into the \"Ego-world\". This causing the later enmity between Satan and humanity.\n\nAccording to Sufism, Azazel commonly served God over thousands of years before the creation of the world. God forbid him to worship something else than his Creator. Therefore Azazel declined, then God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam. He did not know, that worshiping by the command of God is equivalent to worshipping God. Thus, in reference to Surah , God's curse lies upon Azazel until the Day of Judgment and he became the representative for God's attributes in respect to misleading, darkness and majesty. After the world perishes, Azazel's curse is broken and he will return to his place in heaven. Some Sufi writers such as the tenth-century mystic Mansur Al-Hallaj, hold that Azazel will indeed be dammned and not restored after the Day of Judgment.\n\nMansur Al-Hallaj mentioned Azazel in his collection \"Tawasin\". Chapter Six of that writing is dedicated to the self-defence of Azazel, and in one section Hallaj explains how each of the letters of Azazel's name relate to his personality.\n\nAzazel is also mentioned three times in Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmīs Masnavi, stating: <poem>Due to obedience the heaven became filled with light and due to obedience the angels became flawless and holy. Impudence darkened the sun and because of his impudence Azazil was shown the door.</poem> In the second mentioning, \"Azazil\" is used synonymously with \"Eblis\" (Iblis) and yet in another instance, ecstasy of excessive self-awareness turned him from \"Azazil\" to \"Elbis\".\n\nIn Yazidism, Azazel appears as one of the Archangels, along with Jabra'il, Mika'il, Rafa'il (Israfil), Dadra'il, Azrail and Shamkil (Shemna'il). According to a Yazidi legend, Azazel was once banished to hell, but then repented his sin, crying until the fires of hell were extinguished, eventually returned to God's grace.\n"}

{"id": "3240670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3240670", "title": "Bloodletting in Mesoamerica", "text": "Bloodletting in Mesoamerica\n\nBloodletting was the ritualized self-cutting or piercing of an individual's body that served a number of ideological and cultural functions within ancient Mesoamerican societies, in particular the Maya. When performed by ruling elites, the act of bloodletting was crucial to the maintenance of sociocultural and political structure. Bound within the Mesoamerican belief systems, bloodletting was used as a tool to legitimize the ruling lineage's socio-political position and, when enacted, was important to the perceived well-being of a given society or settlement.\n\nBloodletting was performed by piercing a soft body part, generally the tongue or penis, and scattering the blood or collecting it on paper, which was subsequently burned. The act of burning the sacrificed blood symbolized the transferral of the offering to the gods via its transformation into the rising smoke.\n\nPiercing was accomplished using obsidian prismatic blades, stingray spines, or shark's teeth. Under some circumstances, a rope with attached thorns or obsidian flakes would be pulled through the tongue or earlobes.\n\nJade or stone spines and teeth have been found in the archaeological record. Some of these jade artifacts have rather dull points but might have been used once the initial cut was made, or might purely be ritualistic objects not used in actual bloodletting.\n\nThe location of the bloodletting on the body often correlated with an intended result or a corresponding symbolic representation. For example, drawing blood from the genitals, especially the male sex organs, would be done with the intent of increasing or representing human fertility.\n\nRitualized bloodletting was typically performed by elites, settlement leaders, and religious figures (e.g., shamans) within contexts visible to the public. The rituals were enacted on the summits of pyramids or on elevated platforms that were usually associated with broad and open plazas or courtyards (where the masses could congregate and view the bloodletting). This was done so as to demonstrate the connection the person performing the auto-sacrifice had with the sacred sphere and, as such, a method used to maintain political power by legitimizing their prominent social, political, and/or ideological position.\n\nWhile usually carried out by a ruling male, prominent females are also known to have performed the act. The El Perú tomb of a female (called the \"Queen's Tomb\") contains among its many grave goods a ceremonial stingray spine associated with her genital region.\n\nOne of the best-known lintels from Mesoamerica, Yaxchilan Lintel 24 (right), shows Lady Xoc drawing a barbed rope through her tongue. In front of her, her husband and the ruler of Yaxchilan, Shield Jaguar, is shown holding a torch.\n\nAmong all the Mesoamerican cultures, sacrifice, in whatever form, was a deeply symbolic and highly ritualized activity with strong religious and political significance. Various kinds of sacrifice were performed within a range of sociocultural contexts and in association with a variety of activities, from mundane everyday activities to those performed by the elites and ruling lineages with the aim of maintaining social structure. The social structure was maintained by showing that rulers blood sacrifice to the gods showed the power they had. \n\nAt its core, sacrifice symbolized the renewal of divine energy and, in doing so, the continuation of life. Its ability of bloodletting to do this is based on two intertwined concepts that are prevalent in the Maya belief system. The first is the notion that the gods had given life to humankind by sacrificing parts of their own bodies. The second is the central focus of their mythology on human blood, which signified life among the Maya. Within their belief system, human blood was partially made up of the blood of the gods, who sacrificed their own divine blood in creating life in humans. Thus, in order to continually maintain the order of their universe, the Maya believed that blood had to be given back to the gods. The rulers are giving their blood to empower the gods in return for giving them life. \n\nUnlike later cultures, there is no representation of actual bloodletting in Olmec art. However, solid evidence for its practice exists in the jade and ceramic replicas of stingray spines and shark teeth as well as representations of such paraphernalia on monuments and stelae and in iconography.\n\nA proposed translation of the Epi-Olmec culture's La Mojarra Stela 1, dated to roughly AD 155, tells of the ruler's ritual bloodletting by piercing his penis and his buttocks, as well as what appears to be a ritual sacrifice of the ruler's brother-in-law.\n\nBloodletting permeated Maya life. Kings performed bloodletting at every major political event. Building dedications, burials, marriages, and births all required bloodletting. As demonstrated by Yaxchilan Lintels 24 and 25, and duplicated in Lintels 17 and 15, bloodletting in Maya culture was also a means to a vision quest, where fasting, loss of blood, and perhaps hallucinogenics lead to visions of ancestors or gods.\n\nContemporaneous with the Maya, the south-central panel at the Classic era South Ballcourt at El Tajín shows the rain god piercing his penis, the blood from which flows into and replenishes a vat of the alcoholic ritual drink \"pulque\".\n\nFollowing the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in 1521, many Spanish missionary-ethnographers arrived and recorded graphic and often unsympathetic descriptions of these rituals among both the Mayan and Nahuatl speaking peoples. Although most understood the religious significance of the rites, such idolatry merely confirmed the need for rapid conversion to Christianity. Many also confused genital bloodletting with circumcision, not least because they believed Indians were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. One of the first to recognise the distinction was Diego de Landa in a 1566 manuscript:\"At times they sacrificed their own blood, cutting all around the ears in strips which they let hang as a sign. At other times they perforated their cheeks or the lower lip; again they made cuts in parts of the body, or pierced the tongue crossways and passed stalks through, causing extreme pain; again they hewed at the superfluous part of the penis, leaving the flesh in the form of two floppy ears. It was this custom which misled [\"engaño\"] the historian-general of the Indies to say that they practised circumcision.\"(\"original translation\")\nNonetheless, the misconception that the Aztec and Maya people practised circumcision persists to this day.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42601640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42601640", "title": "Bukhar Khudahs", "text": "Bukhar Khudahs\n\nThe Bukhar Khudahs or Bukhar Khudats (Sogdian: \"βuxārak Xwaday\") were a local Sogdian dynasty, which ruled the city of Bukhara from an unknown date to the reign of the Samanid ruler Isma'il ibn Ahmad, who incorporated Bukhara into the Samanid state.\n\nThe word “Bukhar” means Bukhara, while “khuda” means “lord”. Thus the word means “the lord of Bukhara”.\n\nThe founding date of the Bukhar Khudahs remains unknown; the 10th-century Iranian historian Narshakhi is known to have mentioned several names of rulers of Bukhara, but it is not known if they were all from the same dynasty. The first ruler mentioned by Narshakhi is Abru'i (also spelled Abarzi). According to Narshakhi, he was a cruel ruler, who was overthrown by a certain Turkic king named Qara Jurjin. The next ruler is named Kana, who is said to have introduced the minting of coins in Bukhara, which is, however, doubted by modern scholars. The next ruler is given as Makh, who was credited with the building of a bazaar that was named after him. The first ruler mentioned with the title of Bukhar Khudah is named Bindu, who was killed in 681 by the Umayyad general Salm ibn Ziyad during the first Arab attempts to conquer Transoxiana. He was succeeded by his few months-old son Tughshada. However, the kingdom was in reality controlled by Tughshada's mother, who is only known by her title of Khatun, and is celebrated in the local historical tradition for her wisdom and capable management. She is reported to have held court daily, \"inquired into the affairs of state and issued orders and prohibitions,\" while at a distance stood \"two hundred youths from the landowners and the princes ready for service, girded with gold belts and bearing swords.\" In 676 she dispatched a contingent to aid an Arab assault on Samarqand.\n\nIn 706, a civil war erupted in Bukhara and its surrounding cities and towns; the ruler of the nearby Wardana, known as the \"Wardan Khudah\", had seized most of the principality, while a Sogdian magnate named Khunuk Khudah, managed to rally the nobles of Bukhara around him and declared himself as the Bukhar Khudah. At the same time, the new Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, had captured Paykand, a city near Bukhara. The city soon revolted, and the Arabs responded by sacking the city. The brutality of the sack of Paykand shocked the Sogdian world, and led the nobles of Bukhara under Khunuk to make an alliance with the Wardan Khudah. However, during the fighting between the Arabs and Sogdians, the Wardan Khudah was killed, which probably constituted a heavy blow to the Bukhara-Wardana alliance. Bukhara was shortly after captured by Qutayba, who imposed a tribute of 200,000 \"dirhams\", and installed an Arab garrison to secure against rebellion. During the same time, another Sogdian king named Tarkhun, who was the ruler of Samarkand, acknowledged the authority of the Umayyad Caliphate. After having settled an affair in Tokharistan, Qutayba restored Bukhara to the young Tughshada, and the faction of Khunuk including himself were executed.\n\nLater, in 712/3, in order to spread Islam in Bukhara, Qutayba built a mosque in the city's citadel, and even encouraged the natives to convert by paying them to attend the prayers. However, Islamization proceeded very slowly, and the rulers of Bukhara would remain Zoroastrian until their downfall. Tughshada, however, still tried to achieve independence from the Umayyad Caliphate, and in 718, along with Tarkhun's successor Gurak, Narayana, the king of Kumadh, and Tish, the king of Chaghaniyan, he sent an embassy to the Tang dynasty of China, where they asked for aid against the Arabs. In ca. 728, a anti-Arab revolt erupted in Bukhara, which was suppressed one year later. Tughshada was assassinated by two angry \"dehqan\" nobles in 739, and was succeeded by his son Qutayba, who was named in honour of the Umayyad general.\n\nIn 750, the Umayyad Caliphate was conquered by the Abbasid Caliphate, who became the new masters of Central Asia. However, this erupted in a local rebellion in Bukhara led by a certain Sharik ibn Shaikh. The Abbasid general Abu Muslim Khorasani sent an army under Ziyad ibn Salih to suppress the rebellion, but the rebels managed to emerge victorious. Qutayba, at the head of an army numbering 10,000 soldiers, aided the Abbasids in their fight against Sharik, and in the end managed to defeat and kill the latter. However, because of Qutayba's attitude towards the Arabs, he was murdered in 750 at the orders of Abu Muslim Khorasani, and was succeeded by his brother Sakan, who ruled until ca. 757 when he too was murdered by Abbasid agents. He was succeeded by another brother named Bunyat, who, because of his support to al-Muqanna, was murdered in 783. After the rule of Bunyat, there is no information about any of his successors, except for the last ruler of Bukhara, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, whose kingdom was annexed by the Samanid ruler Isma'il ibn Ahmad. Abu Ishaq died in 913, but his descendants' royal status was still known during the lifetime of Narshakhi.\n\nThe majority of the inhabitants of Bukhara, including the rulers of the city, were Zoroastrians. However, there were also traces of Nestorian Christianity, and even a church in Bukhara during the rule of the Bukhar Khudahs is mentioned by Narshakhi.\n\n"}
{"id": "8846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8846", "title": "Datura", "text": "Datura\n\nDatura is a genus of nine species of poisonous vespertine flowering plants belonging to the family Solanaceae. They are commonly known as daturas, but also known as devil's trumpets, not to be confused with angel's trumpets, its closely related genus \"Brugmansia\". They are also sometimes called moonflowers, jimsonweed, devil's weed, hell's bells, thorn-apple, and many more. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the Americas and North Africa, however, is most likely restricted to the United States, Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and Tunisia in Africa where the highest species diversity occurs.\n\nAll species of \"Datura\" are poisonous, especially their seeds and flowers.\n\nSome South American plants formerly thought of as \"Datura\" are now treated as belonging to the distinct genus \"Brugmansia\" (\"Brugmansia\" differs from \"Datura\" in that it is woody, making shrubs or small trees, and it has pendulous flowers, rather than erect ones). Other related taxa include \n\"Hyoscyamus niger\", \"Atropa belladonna\", \"Mandragora officinarum\", Physalis, and many more.\n\nThe name \"Datura\" is taken from Sanskrit धतूरा ' 'thorn-apple', ultimately from Sanskrit धत्तूर ' 'white thorn-apple' (referring to \"Datura metel\" of Asia). In the Ayurvedic text Sushruta different species of Datura are also referred to as ' and '. Dhatura is offered to Shiva in Hinduism. Record of this name in English dates back to 1662. Nathaniel Hawthorne refers to one type in \"The Scarlet Letter\" as \"apple-Peru\". In Mexico, its common name is \"toloache\".\n\n\"Datura\" species are herbaceous, leafy annuals and short-lived perennials which can reach up to 2 m in height. The leaves are alternate, 10–20 cm long and 5–18 cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The flowers are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of \"Brugmansia\"), trumpet-shaped, 5–20 cm long and 4–12 cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The fruit is a spiny capsule 4–10 cm long and 2–6 cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous seeds. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.\n\n\"Datura\" belongs to the classic \"witches' weeds\", along with deadly nightshade, henbane, and mandrake. Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of potions and witches' brews.\n\nIn India it has been referred to as \"Poisonous\" and as an aphrodisiac. In little measures it was used in Ayurveda as a medicine from the ancient times. It is used in rituals and prayers to Shiva. It is also used in Ganesh Chaturthi.\n\nThe larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including \"Hypercompe indecisa\", eat some \"Datura\" species.\n\nIt is difficult to classify \"Datura\" as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these \"new species\" are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as \"D. wrightii\" and \"D. inoxia\", are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, \"Datura\" species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering bush half as tall as an adult human of average height, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle-high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves.\n\nToday, experts classify only nine species of \"Datura\":\n\n\nAmerican Brugmansia and Datura Society, Inc. (ABADS) is designated in the 2004 edition of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as the official International Cultivar Registration Authority for \"Datura\". This role was delegated to ABADS by the International Society for Horticultural Science in 2002.\n\n\n\"Datura\" species are usually planted annually from the seed produced in the spiny pods, but with care, plants can be overwintered. Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so anaerobic organic enrichment such as anaerobically composted organic matter or manure, should be avoided.\n\nAll \"Datura\" plants contain tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and atropine, primarily in their seeds and flowers. Because of the presence of these substances, \"Datura\" has been used for centuries in some cultures as a poison. There can be a 5:1 toxin variation between plants, and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. These variations make \"Datura\" exceptionally hazardous as a drug.\n\nIn traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of \"Datura\" was critical to minimize harm. Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting \"Datura\". For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of adolescents and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting \"Datura\". There are also several reports in the medical literature of deaths from \"D. stramonium\" and \"D. ferox\" intoxication. Children are especially vulnerable to atropine poisoning.\n\n\"Datura\" toxins may be ingested accidentally by consumption of honey produced by several wasp species, including \"Brachygastra lecheguana\", during the \"Datura\" blooming season. It appears that these semi-domesticated honey wasps collect \"Datura\" nectar for honey production which can lead to poisoning.\n\nIn some parts of Europe and India, \"Datura\" has been a popular poison for suicide and murder. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in Agra, India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting \"Datura.\"\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested \"Datura\" used as an ingredient in stew.\n\nIn some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell, or cultivate \"Datura\" plants.\n\nDue to the potent combination of anticholinergic substances it contains, \"Datura\" intoxication typically produces effects similar to that of an anticholinergic delirium (usually involving a complete inability to differentiate reality from fantasy); hyperthermia; tachycardia; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe mydriasis (dilated pupils) with resultant painful photophobia that can last several days. Muscle stiffness and temporary paralysis is often reported and pronounced amnesia is another commonly reported effect.\n\nIn \"Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs\", Freye asserts:\nFew substances have received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has \"Datura\". The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of \"Datura\" find their experiences extremely unpleasant both mentally and often physically dangerous. However, anthropologists have found that indigenous groups, with a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of \"Datura\", have been known to use Datura spiritually (including the Navajo and especially the Havasupai). Again, knowledge of Datura's properties is necessary to facilitate a healthy experience.\nSouthern Paiute Indians believe Datura can help locate missing objects.\n\nDue to their agitated behavior and confused mental state, victims of \"Datura\" poisoning are typically hospitalized. Gastric lavage and the administration of activated charcoal can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material. The drug physostigmine is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. Benzodiazepines can be given to curb the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24–36 hours after ingestion of the \"Datura\".\n\n\n\n"}

The Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1986. Fanjingshan is a sacred mountain in Chinese Buddhism, considered to be the bodhimaṇḍa of the Maitreya Buddha. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018.\n\nThe mountain's name \"Fanjing\" is an abbreviation of \"Fantian Jingtu\" (梵天净土), or \"Brahma's Pure Land\". \"Fantian\" is the Chinese name for the Buddhist heavenly king Brahmā, and \"Jingtu\" is Chinese for \"pure land\", the focus of Pure Land Buddhism.\n\nFanjingshan is located in Tongren, Guizhou Province in southwest China. It is the highest peak of the Wuling Mountains. The elevation of its terrain ranges from above sea level.\n\nThe Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1986. The reserve covers a total area of and is a conservation area for primitive vegetation of the mid sub-tropic alpine region of western China. The mountain was designated a World Heritage Site in July 2018.\n\nFanjingshan's relative isolation has ensured a high degree of biodiversity. Endemic species such as the rare Guizhou golden monkey \"(Rhinopithecus brelichi)\" and the Fanjingshan fir \"(Abies fanjingshanensis)\" occur only in a small region centering on Fanjingshan. Several endangered species, including the Chinese giant salamander, forest musk deer, and Reeve's pheasant are also found in Fanjingshan. It is also home to the largest and most contiguous subtropical primeval beech forest.\n\nFanjingshan is considered a sacred mountain of Chinese Buddhism, ranking just behind the Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism. It is considered the bodhimaṇḍa (or \"daochang\")--a spot in which one reached enlightenment--of the Maitreya Buddha. The influence of Buddhism reached Fanjingshan by the Tang dynasty at the latest, especially after Hou Hongren (侯弘仁) constructed the Zangke Road (牂牁道) in 639 AD, which facilitated transport in the mountainous region, and local gazettes record the construction of several temples in the area. More temples were built during the ensuing Song and Yuan dynasties.\n\nBuddhism greatly prospered during the Ming and Qing dynasties, when the cult of Tianguan Maitreya (天冠弥勒) became dominant in Fanjingshan. The Bozhou rebellion in the late 16th century caused great damages to Fanjingshan's temples. After suppressing the rebellion, the Wanli Emperor ordered the monk Miaoxuan (妙玄) to rebuild the Golden Peak of Fanjingshan and the Cheng'en Temple (承恩寺), and many other temples were constructed in the area, ushering in the golden era for Buddhism in Fanjingshan. Most temples during the Ming and Qing dynasties belonged to the Pure Land and the Linji sects of Buddhism.\n\nIn the turmoil that toppled the Qing dynasty, many temples were destroyed by marauding armies and bandits, and few monks remained in the Republic of China era. After further destructions during the Cultural Revolution, Buddhism has enjoyed a renaissance since the 1980s. Many old temples have been rebuilt and new ones constructed, including the Cheng'en Temple, Huguo Chan Temple (护国禅寺), Great Golden Buddha Temple (大金佛寺), and Longquan Temple (龙泉寺).\n\nIn 2010, the Fanjingshan Buddhist Cultural Park was opened, with a Golden Hall that houses a five-meter-tall statue of the Maitreya Buddha made with of gold and thousands of gems. It is said to be the largest gold Maitreya statue in the world.\n"}
{"id": "6072959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6072959", "title": "Festive ecology", "text": "Festive ecology\n\nFestive ecology explores the relationships between the symbolism and the ecology of the plants, fungi and animals associated with cultural events such as festivals, processions, and special occasions. Examples of topics are given below.\n\nThe plants traditionally associated with Christmas – holly, ivy, mistletoe, common yew - have had special roles in earlier religions and past cultures. Some early religions in Europe had midwinter festivals to celebrate the return of the sun from the shortest day. In the 4th and 5th centuries, 25 December was gradually adopted as the date for Christmas in Europe in order to superimpose on the existing mid-winter festivals. The winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, on what is now 17 December, was the start of the Roman festival of Saturnalia. This was a week of public feasting, dancing, singing and gambling. Houses were decorated with evergreens and bunches of holly were given as tokens of friendship. When this festival was absorbed into the Christian calendar, holly and the other evergreens were absorbed as well.\n\nHolly is palatable to livestock despite its spines and was extensively used as a winter fodder for livestock in medieval times in England and Wales, particularly in Cumbria, the Pennines and the Welsh borders. Hay and grains for wintering stock would often have run short in these upland areas. This would mean that the livestock would eventually have to be slaughtered, causing real problems to medieval economies in the following years. Thus, a supply of fresh browse would have been extremely valuable. Written records of payments and agreements involving the use of holly for livestock cover a wide period from the late 12th century to the mid-18th century, by which time the practice had been largely abandoned. An early reference to the practice occurs in “The Dream of Rhonabwy”, a Welsh story from the Mabinogion, a remarkable collection of medieval literature. Written before the 14th century, The Dream of Rhonabwy refers to the mid-12th century in Powys. The floor of the old black house of Heilyn Goch is described as being covered in the urine and dung of cows together with branches of holly whose tips had been eaten by the cattle.\n\nIvy was used in garlands by the ancient Greeks and the Romans for religious ceremonies and for celebrating at other, more secular, occasions. It was strongly associated with Bacchus (Dionysus), the Greco-Roman god of wine. Since Roman times, ivy has been associated with wine and wine-making. Branches of evergreen ivy tied to a pole was often used as the “sign of the bush” indicating a place where wine or alcohol was for sale. Hence, the proverb “Good wine needs no bush” meaning that it is not necessary to advertise well-made goods. Ivy is less commonly seen in houses in Britain at Christmas compared to holly and mistletoe and it may be that established religions opposed its use in Christmas wreaths because of its association with drunkenness.\n\nMistletoe is an evergreen plant well known for its association with oak trees and Druids first documented by Pliny the Elder who wrote about the ceremonies of the Celtic Druids in Gaul in his \"Naturalis Historia\". These Druids held the oak in particular veneration, used oak leaves in their ceremonies, and regarded anything growing on oak trees as having been sent from heaven. On the rare occasions when mistletoe was found growing on an oak, it would be gathered with great ceremony. A priest in white clothing would cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle and allow it to fall onto a white cloak; two white bulls would then be sacrificed. According to Pliny, it was believed that mistletoe in a drink would make any barren animal fertile and that it was a remedy for all poisons. Special powers are attributed to mistletoe by a wide range of cultures, both within Europe and further afield. The use of mistletoe as an all-heal and a cure for barrenness is reputed to have a very ancient history. The link between mistletoe and fertility persists to this day in Britain in the tradition of kissing underneath bunches of mistletoe at Christmas. In the early 19th century, it was traditional for each man who kissed under the mistletoe to remove one berry. Once all the berries are gone, so is the potency.\n\nYew trees continually put out new stems which coalesce with the existing trunk resulting in trees of great age. The merging of old and decaying wood with vibrant young shoots has led to the yew being traditionally associated with reincarnation and immortality.\n\nThe custom of dressing the Arbor tree – a black poplar growing in Aston-on-Clun in south Shropshire – with flags on flagpoles every 29 May is almost unique in Britain, although \"Bawming the Thorn\" at Appleton Thorn in Cheshire is not dissimilar. New flags are attached to wooden flagpoles on the Arbor tree which remain throughout the year. \n\nThe Arbor tree is a male black poplar tree growing beside a stream at a place where four roads meet. Written records of the Arbor tree only extend back to 1898, but the tradition of dressing the tree is reputed to date back to a local wedding in 1786. The custom has developed and acquired new meanings, particularly since the 1955 when a pageant was devised. The pageant and the celebrations associated with the tree dressing are evolving in response to those living in the local community as well as to the external recognition now accorded to this unique tradition. \n\nThe present black poplar grew from a rooted cutting taken from the old tree which was said to be at least 300 years old when it collapsed in 1995 and had been repeatedly pollarded. Black poplar is an extremely unusual tree to be associated with notable events or traditions, which are more likely to involve pedunculate oak, sessile oak, common yew or hawthorn (\"Crataegus\").\n\nThe black poplar (\"Populus nigra\" var. \"betulifolia\") is an uncommon native tree in Britain. Black poplars are associated with alluvial soils in river valleys and floodplains generally south of a line from the River Mersey to the estuary of the Humber with particular concentrations across the Midlands from the Welsh Marches to East Anglia and notably in the Vale of Aylesbury (Aylesbury Vale). A male clone (cloning) was much planted in the suburbs of Manchester in the late 18th century as it grew well in the polluted atmosphere and it became known as the ‘Manchester poplar’. Growing to a height of some 30 metres, the bark of the black poplar is distinctively ridged and furrowed and has characteristic large burrs or bosses. When mature, the tree forms a huge dome of massive spreading branches which arch outwards. This spreading habit is dramatically different from the elongated shape of the Lombardy poplar (\"Populus nigra\" ‘Italica’) which, surprisingly, is a cultivated variety of the black poplar that was imported to Essex from Turin in 1758 and widely planted because of its unusual shape. The black poplar is also a different species from the more widespread black Italian poplar (\"Populus\" x \"euramericana\" or \"Populus\" x \"canadensi\"s) which is a hybrid between the black poplar and the North American eastern cottonwood (\"Populus deltoides\").\n\nPoplars are unusual in that there are separate male and female trees. Male black poplars are far more numerous than female trees in Britain and seedlings are, therefore, very rare. Regrowth occurs from the branches or trunk of fallen trees which root into the underlying soil. Growing in river valleys and floodplains, the trees can be uprooted by floods and grow again in a new location.\n\nAccounts of other traditional customs on 29 May are usually linked to Royal Oak Day (Oak Apple Day) and include the surviving customary rights in Grovely Wood at Great Wishford, Wiltshire, and Garland King Day at Castleton (Derbyshire).\n"}

She is considered part of the Art Brut canon.\n\nJeanne Tripier was born in 1869 in Paris. Daughter of a wine merchant, she spent her childhood in the country with her grandmother. As an adult she lived in the Montmartre district of Paris, working as a salesgirl at a department store. At 58 she developed a passion for Spiritualist doctrines and divination. These activities became central to her existence, so much so that she eventually stopped going to work. In 1934 she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Paris.\n\nJeanne Tripier began creating works which blended image and text when she was in her 50s. Tripier's work emerged during trance states and utilized materials such as sugar and hair dye. She also produced figurative embroidery pieces. She ascribed responsibility for her output of texts, drawings, and embroideries to spiritual entities.\n\nJeanne Tripier's work is primarily held in the Collection de l'Art Brut museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Her works have been lent to other institutions for exhibitions, including the 2015 exhibit \"Art Brut in America: The Incursion of Jean Dubuffet\" at the American Folk Art Museum.\n\nJean Dubuffet acquired Tripier's work for his Collection de l'Art Brut.\n\nTRIPIER jeanne\n"}

He completed his graduate work at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth. Larry and Melva married in 1972, and together they have 3 children. He became the youth pastor of Beverly Hills Baptist Church in Dallas, where the youth department shot up from 40 to 1,000. While pastoring Church on the Rock in Rockwall, Texas, He also served as Dean of Theological and Spiritual Affairs at Oral Roberts University.\n\nFollowing a stint as an itinerant preacher in the late 1970s, Lea was invited to pastor Church on the Rock in 1980 with 12 people in Rockwall, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Within 5 years, the congregation had increased to over 5,000. In 1986, Lea began to travel again, holding what he called \"Prayer Clinics\" and later, \"Prayer Rallies\" or \"Prayer Breakthroughs\". Also, that year marked the beginning of Lea's television program, called \"Change Your Life\". Also, that year, Lea released his first book, the best-seller \"Could You Not Tarry One Hour?\", which was his teaching on The Lord's Prayer. He also began a partnership group where his partners were referred to as \"Prayer Warriors\".\n\nIn June 1990, Lea stepped aside as pastor to oversee Church on the Rock, which was a group of churches that was called a \"virtual denomination\" according to \"Christianity Today\". (The successor of this organization, still named COTRI, is led by former Church on the Rock assistant pastor Dr. Lawrence Kennedy. Under Lea COTRI had 45 churches nationwide; now the number includes over 350 in the U.S. and thousands worldwide.)\n\nLea found himself in some controversy later that year, when Lea and several ministers met at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Lea's ministry was heavily criticized by an assortment of gay-rights activists, pro-choice activists, and Wiccans led by Eric Pryor (who later converted to Christianity). On Halloween (the first night of the crusade), there was a massive protest leading to many who came to the Civic Auditorium having to come through a very hostile crowd outside and concerns about potential violence forced Lea to drop plans for 5,000 attendees to conduct a prayer march through the city's streets.\n\nA year later, ABC's \"PrimeTime Live\" aired an exposé involving Lea and fellow Dallas-area televangelists W.V. Grant and Robert Tilton. The incident involving Lea came as a result of his fundraising appeals, questions as to how much money was going to mentioned projects (specifically a program involving helping start churches in Poland), and accusations that Lea implied a fire at one of his homes left his family almost destitute even though they still had a five-million-dollar home in the Dallas area.\n\nLea's organization had grown so quickly, he made the decision to allow the National Religious Broadcasters financial integrity arm, EFICOM (Ethics and Financial Integrity Commission), to audit his ministry to look into the charges. While EFICOM would determine he had been delinquent in sending his financial information, the group determined that Lea had not misused the funds for the Poland project. The EFICOM committee also accused ABC News of misleading Lea about the interview's purpose and ignoring \"significant facts\"; such as signed affidavits from Polish church officials that would have confirmed Lea's claims. By May 1992 (after ending his \"Change Your Life\" broadcasts the previous December after the expose), Lea would make a return to the airwaves with a show titled \"America, Let's Pray\".\n\nHis credibility and prominence in the charismatic community evaporated (though not as quickly as Tilton's), as he traveled with Morris Cerullo at the latter's crusades in the mid-1990s. Lea also claimed that he suffered a relapse of bipolar disorder. In 1994, he took a position as a pastor in San Diego. This lasted until 1997.\n\nAfter 27 years of marriage, Larry filed for divorce in April 1999. During the divorce, his wife attended Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Lea's son John started the Life Church in Rockwall, Texas in the same Dallas suburb where Larry and his ex-wife began Church on the Rock in 1980. Lea has since remarried and has returned to the Rockwall area.\n\nThe Church on the Rock main campus was later sold to Lake Pointe Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist megachurch in the Rockwall area which relocated to the site and renamed itself Lake Pointe Church; while the church itself moved to the nearby Rowlett area and was renamed Church in the City in January 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "7423428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7423428", "title": "Limmud", "text": "Limmud\n\nLimmud is a British-Jewish educational charity which, in the UK, produces a large annual winter festival and several other regional events throughout the year on the theme of Jewish learning. Limmud is not affiliated to any strand of Judaism and markets itself as open to \"anyone interested in Jewish learning\".\n\nLimmud (from the Hebrew word meaning \"to learn\") was originally a conference for \"educators\", basing itself on CAJE, the Conference on Alternatives in Jewish Education of North America, formed in 1976. From CAJE, it took a volunteer ethos, not paying presenters, and not using people's titles. During the 1990s there was the significant change as Limmud reinvented itself as a community gathering, giving rise to a significant increase in the number of attendees and leading it to be described as \"British Jewry's greatest export\". The Limmud model has now spread to many other countries.\n\nA distinctive feature of Limmud is that the events are organised by volunteers, who also take part as equals in what is now called the Limmud Festival. Limmud's largest group of volunteers are in their 20s and 30s. Around half of the UK \"Forty under 40\" (a community-wide initiative to identify the future leaders of British Jewry, published by \"The Jewish News\") have volunteered for Limmud and a former Chair of Limmud, Elliott Goldstein, topped the list.\n\nLimmud is a company and a charity. It is run by a board of directors and trustees, all of whom are volunteers. Initially, there was no difference between Limmud the organisation and Limmud Conference, the annual event, so the chairs of the Conference/Festival team were the chairs of the organisation. In 1990, a chair for the organisation who was separate from the Conference chairs was appointed for the first time. In 2006, Limmud International was created, as a separate unit within Limmud to manage relationships with other Limmud groups around the world. Limmud International was absorbed back into Limmud at the end of 2016.\n\nChairs of Limmud Conference/Festival\n\n1980 – 1981 Alistair Falk, Michael May, Jonathan Benjamin, Clive Lawton\n\n1982 – 1984 Steve Miller\n\n1985 Tina Elliott\n\n1986 Jonathan Benjamin\n\n1987 Alan Wilkinson\n\n1988 Madeline Ismach\n\n1989 Alistair Falk\n\n1990 – 1994 Andrew Gilbert\n\n1995 Natan Tiefenbrun\n\n1996 Yvonne Krasner, Marc Soloway, Judy Trotter\n\n1997 Micah Gold, Jonny Persey, Marc Soloway\n\n1998 Micah Gold\n\n1999 Jacqueline Nicholls, Claire Straus\n\n2000 Andrew Levy, Abe Sterne\n\n2001 Claire Mandel, Carolyn Bogush\n\n2002 Juliet Simmons\n\n2003 Fleurise Luder, Eliot Kaye\n\n2004 Batya Elliott, Paul Turner\n\n2005 David Century, Shoshana Bloom\n\n2006 Jason Caplin, Natalie Grazin\n\n2007 Kevin Sefton\n\n2008 Libby Burkeman and Charles Darwish\n\n2009 Rebecca Lester and David Israel\n\n2010 Danielle Nagler and Steven Fisher\n\n2011 Shoshana Bloom and Jonathan Walters\n\n2012 David Renton\n\n2013 Oliver Marcus and Richard Verber\n\n2014 Shana Boltin and Jonathan Robinson\n\n2015 Joanna Ish-Horowicz, Michael Gladstone and Claire Samuel\n\n2016 Benjamin Crowne and Steven Weller\n\n2017 Abigail Jacobi and Anna Lawton\n\n2018 Jonathan Robinson\n\n2019 Ben Lewis, Hannah Brady and Dan Heller\n\nChairs of Limmud\n\n1990 – 1997 Andrew Gilbert\n\n1998 – 2001 Judy Trotter\n\n1998 – 2000 Natan Tiefenbrun\n\n2001 – 2003 Claire Straus\n\n2003 – 2005 Claire Mandel\n\n2006 – 2009 Elliott Goldstein\n\n2010 – 2012 Carolyn Bogush\n\n2013 – 2015 Kevin Sefton\n\n2016 – 2019 David Hoffman\n\n2019 - 2021 Shoshana Bloom\n\nChairs of Limmud International\n\n2006 – 2009 Andrew Gilbert\n\n2010 – 2012 Uri Berkowitz, Helena Miller\n\n2013 – 2014 David Hoffman\n\n2015 – 2016 David Bilchitz\n\nChair of Limmud North America\n\n2017 - 2018 Shep Rosenman\n\nChair of Limmud Israel\n\n2018 Danielle Nagler\nLimmud's first professional appointment in 1998 was of Clive Lawton as part-time Executive Director; he gradually became backed by a full-time administrator. In 2006 Limmud recruited its first full-time Executive Director, Raymond Simonson, former Director of UJIA Makor: The Centre for Informal Jewish Education. When Simonson became Chief Executive of London's Jewish Community Centre, now JW3, in 2012, he was succeeded by Shelley Marsh. She stepped down from the role in 2015. Mike Schindler was the Limmud Director of Operations and the senior professional in the organisation between March and August 2015, and then Dani Serlin was Acting Executive Director until February 2016. In February 2016, Limmud appointed the current Chief Executive, Eli Ovits, as senior professional.\n\nLimmud Festival (until 2017 known as Limmud Conference), takes place every year in the last week of December and is the organisation's flagship event. It was inspired by the CAJE conference in the United States and now attracts more than 2,000 participants annually; in 2015 the numbers rose to 2,750. A typical day at Limmud Festival includes around 200 sessions spanning religious, cultural and political aspects of Jewish life. After the first conferences at Carmel College (Oxfordshire), Limmud Conference has been held at Portsmouth Polytechnic (1984), Oxford Brookes University (1986–1994), Worcester (1995–96), Manchester (1997), the University of Nottingham (1998–2006) and Warwick University (2007–14). Since 2015 this annual event has been held at the hotels surrounding Pendigo Lake, near Birmingham.\n\nLimmud held a summer event in the last week of August which was called Limmud Fest from 2004 to 2012 and Limmud in the Woods from 2013 to 2016. It involved camping as well as staying indoors, had a less intense programme centred on Shabbat and is more cultural and outdoors-focused than its winter sibling. Limmud Fest had a peak attendance of 650 people; Limmud in the Woods was attended by around 200–250 young adults and young families.\n\nThe first Day Limmud was in Sheffield in the early 1980s, followed by Leeds in the mid-1990s. Day and weekend Limmuds are now held at a number of venues in the UK, including Birmingham, Cambridge, Harrow, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and the Thames Valley.\n\nIn the past, Limmud events have also been held in Bournemouth, Brighton, Glasgow, Hackney, Newcastle, South London and South East London.\n\nOther events run by Limmud in the UK. either on their own or in partnership with others. have included music events and the Florence Melton Adult Mini-School, organised in partnership with the London Jewish Cultural Centre.\n\nThe Limmud model has now spread to many other countries. More than ninety communities in 42 countries on six continents have hosted Limmud events including, in 2013 for the first time, Hong Kong, Peru, India and Montenegro.\n\nUK\n\nLimmud Bristol SW, Limmud Cambridge, Limmud Festival, Limmud Harrow, Limmud Hull, Limmud Leeds, Limmud Liverpool, Limmud Manchester, Limmud Midlands, Limmud Scotland, Limmud Thames Valley\n\nAfrica, Asia and Australasia\n\nAustralia- Limmud Canberra, Limmud Oz Melbourne, Limmud Oz Perth, Limmud Oz Sydney\nLimmud New Zealand \nLimmud China- Limmud Beijing, Limmud Shanghai \nLimmud India \nLimmud Réunion \nLimmud SA- Limmud Cape Cape Town, Limmud Durban, Limmud Johannesburg \n\nNorth America\n\nUSA- Limmud AZ, Limmud Bay Area, Limmud Boca, Limmud Boston, Limmud Chicago + MW, Limmud LA, Limmud Miami, Limmud Michigan, Limmud NOLA, Limmud NY, Limmud Philly, Limmud Seattle, \nCanada- Limmud Kingston, Limmud Ottawa, Limmud Toronto, Limmud Vancouver, Limmud Winnipeg\n\nLatin America\n\nArgentina- Limmud Buenos Aires, Limmud Mar Del Plata\nLimmud Bogota\nLimmud Caracas\nLimmud Chile\nLimmud Costa Rica\nLimmud Mexico\n\nEurope\n\nLimmud Baltics (covers Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania)\nLimmud Czech Republic- Slovak Republic\nLimmud ExYu (covers Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia)\nLimmud France- Limmud Paris, Limmud Marseille\nLimmud Germany- Limmud Berlin, Limmud Cologne, Limmud Essen, Limmud Frankfurt A.M, Limmud Freiburg, Limmud Hamburg, Limmud Munich\nLimmud Helsinki\nLimmud Hungary\nLimmud Italia -Limmud Italia in Jerusalem\nLimmud Keshet Bulgaria\nLimmud Latvia\nLimmud Lithuania\nLimmud Netherlands\nLimmud Oresund (covers Copenhagen, Lund and Malmo)\nLimmud Poland- Limmud Wrocław\nSpain- Limmud Barcelona, Limmud Madrid, Limmud Mallorca\nLimmud Stockholm\nLimmud Turkey\nLimmud Vienna\n\nIsrael\n\nLimmud Arava\nLimmud Galil\nLimmud Golan\nLimmud Haifa\nLimmud Jerusalem\nLimmud Modi'in\nLimmud Tel Aviv\nLimmud Yeroham\n\nFSU\n\nLimmud FSU Belarus\nLimmud FSU Canada\nLimmud FSU Europe\nLimmud FSU Israel\nLimmud FSU Moldova\nLimmud FSU Moscow\nLimmud FSU NY\nLimmud FSU St Petersburg\nLimmud FSU Ukraine\nLimmud FSU Volga-Urals\nLimmud FSU West Coast\n\nEvents based upon the Limmud concept\n\nSwitzerland- Jom Ijun\nRussia- Lsaran\nUnited Kingdom- British Islam Conference\nUnited States- Tidewater Yom Limmud, Jewish Community Day of Learning Naples\n\nThe former London United Synagogue Beth Din's Head Dayan (rabbinic judge), Chanoch Ehrentreu, advised Orthodox rabbis not to attend Limmud Conference. However, in the UK many United Synagogue pulpit rabbis have attended Limmud. In December 2010 Rabbi Yitzchak Schochet of Mill Hill United Synagogue, who had been seen as a notable absentee and critic of Limmud, attended, took part in and taught at Limmud's 30th annual Conference. Following this he wrote on the synagogue's website: \"\"upon return all I could ask myself was, 'where was I until now?\"'\" \n\nJonathan Sacks did not attend Limmud whilst being Chief Rabbi but attended when he was the head of Jews College. Sacks, when looking back on his rabbinate, considers Limmud to be one of the great successes of his time.\n\nControversy erupted again in 2013 when newly elected Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis announced his decision to attend. Subsequently, a public notice signed by seven leading Orthodox rabbis including Dayan Chanoch Ehrentreu and Rabbi Avrohom Gurwicz and published in the \"Jewish Tribune\", attacked pluralism and urged \"God-fearing Jews\" not to participate in Limmud. This sparked condemnation by non-Charedi communal leaders, with Jewish Leadership Council chairman Mick Davis, Board of Deputies president Vivian Wineman and United Synagogue president Stephen Pack writing to \"The Jewish Chronicle\" saying that the statement showed \"a shocking failure of leadership\". \"The Jewish Chronicle\" itself described the statement as \"crass, ill-judged and ultimately self-defeating\". Mirvis's attendance at the 2013 Limmud Conference was well received by fellow participants. At least nine other United Synagogue rabbis also attended the event.\n\n\n"}

After his education he moved to Kano, Nigeria in about 1945, where he became known for his controversial preachings on the Qur'an. Although a Koranic scholar, he seemingly rejected the hadith and the sunnah and regarded the reading of any other book but the Koran as paganism. Maitatsine spoke against the use of radios, watches, bicycles, cars and the possession of more money than necessary. \n\nThe British colonial authorities sent him into exile, but he returned to Kano shortly after independence. By 1972 he had a notable and increasingly militant following known as \"Yan Tatsine\". In 1975 he was again arrested by Nigerian police for slander and public abuse of political authorities But in that period he began to receive acceptance from religious authorities, especially after making hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. As his following increased in the 1970s, so did the number of confrontations between his adherents and the police. His preaching attracted largely a following of youths, unemployed migrants, and those who felt that mainstream Muslim teachers were not doing enough for their communities. By December 1980, continued Yan Tatsine attacks on other religious figures and police forced the Nigerian army to become involved. Subsequent armed clashes led to the deaths of around 5,000 people, including Maitatsine himself. Maitatsine died shortly after sustaining injuries in the clashes either from his wounds or from a heart attack.\n\nAccording to a 2010 article published by the Sunday Trust magazine the military cremated Maitatsine's remains, which now rest in a bottle kept at a police laboratory in Kano.\n\nDespite Mohammed Marwa's death, Yan Tatsine riots continued into the early 1980s. In October 1982 riots erupted in Bulumkuttu, near Maidaguri, and in Kaduna, to where many Yan Tatsine adherents had moved after 1980. Over 3,000 people died. Some survivors of these altercations moved to Yola, and in early 1984 more violent uprisings occurred in that city. In this round of rioting, Musa Makaniki, a close disciple of Maitatsine, emerged as a leader and Marwa's successor. Ultimately more than 1,000 people died in Yola and roughly half of the city's 60,000 inhabitants were left homeless. Makaniki fled to his hometown of Gombe, where more Yan Tatsine riots occurred in April 1985. After the deaths of several hundred people Makaniki retreated to Cameroon, where he remained until 2004 when he was arrested in Nigeria.\n\nThe Islamist Quranist group Kala Kato are an off-shoot of the Yan Tatsine.\n\nSome analysts view the terrorist group Boko Haram as an extension of the Maitatsine riots.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62038", "title": "Man Ray", "text": "Man Ray\n\nMan Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky; August 27, 1890 – November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned fashion and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called \"rayographs\" in reference to himself.\n\nDuring his career as an artist, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray.\n\nMan Ray's birth name was Emmanuel Radnitzky in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US, in 1890. He was the eldest child of Russian Jewish immigrants Max, a tailor, and Minnie Radnitzky. He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dora and Essie, the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray. Man Ray's brother chose the surname in reaction to the ethnic discrimination and antisemitism prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was called \"Manny\" as a nickname, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.\nMan Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing patchwork items from scraps of fabric. Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background, but their tailoring left an enduring mark on his art. Mannequins, flat irons, sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, swatches of fabric, and other items related to tailoring appear in almost every medium of his work. Art historians have noted similarities between Ray's collage and painting techniques and styles used for tailoring.\n\nMason Klein, curator of a Man Ray exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York, \"Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention\", suggests that the artist may have been \"the first Jewish avant-garde artist.\"\n\nMan Ray was the uncle of the photographer Naomi Savage, who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.\n\nMan Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's Boys' High School from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in drafting and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied the works of the Old Masters. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his studio. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a commercial artist and was a technical illustrator at several Manhattan companies.\n\nThe surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at Alfred Stieglitz's \"291\" gallery and works by the Ashcan School. However, with a few exceptions, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled in the Ferrer School in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Man Ray was visually influenced by the 1913 Armory Show and galleries of European contemporary works. His early paintings display facets of cubism. After befriending Marcel Duchamp, who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in \"The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows\" (1916).\n\nIn 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after he had taken up residence at an art colony in Grantwood, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City. His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled \"Self-Portrait\", was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918.\n\nMan Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with Dada, a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of \"Rope Dancer\", he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he did \"readymades\"—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His \"Gift\" readymade (1921) is a flatiron with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and \"Enigma of Isidore Ducasse\" is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. \"Aerograph\" (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.\n\nIn 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make the \"Rotary Glass Plates\", one of the earliest examples of kinetic art. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, Katherine Dreier, and Duchamp founded the Société Anonyme, an itinerant collection that was the first museum of modern art in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to Yale University Art Gallery.\n\nMan Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of \"New York Dada\" in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York. He wrote that \"Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival.\"\n\nIn 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887–1975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.\n\nIn July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France. He soon settled in the Montparnasse quarter favored by many artists. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse (Alice Prin), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Kiki was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s. She became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images and starred in his experimental films, \"Le Retour à la Raison\" and \"L'Étoile de mer\". In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer Lee Miller. Miller left him in 1932.\n\nFor the next 20 years in Montparnasse, Man Ray was a distinguished photographer. Significant members of the art world, such as James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Bridget Bate Tichenor, and Antonin Artaud, posed for his camera.\n\nMan Ray was represented in the first Surrealist exhibition with Jean Arp, Max Ernst, André Masson, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled \"Object to Be Destroyed\", and the \"Violon d'Ingres,\" a stunning photograph of Kiki de Montparnasse, styled after the painter/musician Ingres. \"Violon d'Ingres\" is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.\n\nIn 1934, surrealist artist Méret Oppenheim, known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a printing press.\n\nWith Lee Miller, his photographic assistant and lover, Man Ray reinvented the photographic technique of solarization. He also created a type of photogram he called \"rayographs\", which he described as \"pure dadaism\".\n\nMan Ray was in a relationship with the model Adrienne Fidelin during some time between 1936 and 1940, the two parting ways after Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, while Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family.\n\nMan Ray directed a number of influential avant-garde short films, known as \"Cinéma Pur\". He directed \"Le Retour à la Raison\" (2 mins, 1923); \"Emak-Bakia\" (16 mins, 1926); \"L'Étoile de Mer\" (15 mins, 1928); and \"Les Mystères du Château de Dé\" (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film \"Anemic Cinema\" (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on Fernand Léger's \"Ballet Mécanique\" (1924). In René Clair's film \"Entr'acte\" (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing chess with Duchamp.\n\nDuchamp, Man Ray, and Francis Picabia were friends and collaborators. The three were connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.\n\nMan Ray was forced to return from Paris to the United States due to the Second World War. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, Man Ray met Juliet Browner, a first-generation American of Romanian-Jewish lineage. She was a trained dancer, who studied dance with Martha Graham, and an experienced artists' model. The two married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning. In 1948 Man Ray had a solo exhibition at the Copley Galleries in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the \"Shakespearean Equations\" series.\n\nMan Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue Ferou near the Luxembourg Gardens in St. Germain des Pres, where he continued his creative practice across mediums. During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later Arturo Schwarz.\n\nIn 1963, he published his autobiography, \"Self-Portrait\", which was republished in 1999.\n\nHe died in Paris on November 18, 1976, from a lung infection. He was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. Ray's epitaph reads \"unconcerned, but not indifferent\". When Juliet Browner died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads \"together again\". Juliet organized a trust for his work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of the contents were stored at the Pompidou Center.\n\nIn 1974, Man Ray received the Royal Photographic Society's Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship \"in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense.\" In 1999, \"ARTnews\" magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, \"his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, collage, assemblage and prototypes of what would eventually be called performance art and conceptual art.\" \"ARTnews\" further stated that \"Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a creative intelligence that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would.\" Seeking pleasure and liberty was one of Ray's guiding principles, along with others such as doing things that are socially prohibited.\n\nIn March 2013, Man Ray's photograph \"Noire et Blanche\" (1926) was featured in the United States Postal Service's \"Modern Art in America\" series of stamps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The S.T.M. typically is designed to enhance a student's academic credentials for entrance to a doctoral program.\n\nS.T.M. degrees are typically awarded after having completed twenty-four hours of study at the Master's level beyond that required for the first theological degree. In some programs this degree may be awarded solely on the basis of taught academic courses. However, many S.T.M. programs require or permit the student to write a thesis as a part of the degree requirements. The thesis is especially helpful for those individuals who wish to use the S.T.M. to further their qualifications for doctoral study and who did not complete a thesis as a part of the first professional degree. Some seminaries will also credit part of the work done for the S.T.M. towards a student moving on to the Ph.D. in theology degree once the S.T.M. has been awarded.\n\nIn Roman Catholic universities with pontifical charters, the equivalent is the Licentiate in Sacred Theology (S.T.L.), the intermediate degree between the S.T.B. (bachelor's) and S.T.D. (doctorate). The S.T.L. is an additional two years of study beyond that required for the S.T.B. However, McGill University's graduate school of religious studies, considered partly a Catholic school of theology, offers the academic S.T.M. similar to the Protestant one. \n\nIn addition, the title \"Sacrae Theologiae Magister\" (S.T.M.) or \"Master of Sacred Theology\" is also the name given to an honorary title bestowed by the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers (Dominicans) on its most distinguished scholars. Thus it is a \"master's degree\" in the most ancient sense and thus can be likened to an honorary doctorate conferred only upon Dominicans who are already scholars of theology. The recipient must be a full-time professor for ten years and have published books and articles of international scholarly repute. The initial nomination is made by the friar's own province (local distrinct) and then must be approved by the intellectual commission of the Generalate in Rome. The final decision is then made, after review, by the Master of this Order and his council. The regalia of the S.T.M. is a four-finned black biretta today usually trimmed with scarlet, and a ring, which may be set with an amethyst. The S.T.M., has the perpetual right to the title \"very reverend.\" The Dominican archbishop of Cincinnati, John T. McNicholas, OP, was famous for refusing to use \"D.D.\" (Doctor of Divinity) after his name; he insisted on using \"S.T.M.\" because it was the more distinguished academic title. His STD, of course, is a yet more distinguished title than either DD or STM as the STD is an earnt degree and not an honorary one.\n\n"}

It is derived from the Roman-era personal name \"Maurus\".\n\nLe Mormont is about halfway between lakes Neuchatel and Geneva, forming a watershed between the Rhine and the Rhone basins, separating the Venoge and the Orbe valleys to the south and north, respectively. The mountain is topographically connected to the Jura Mountains to the west. East of Le Mormont runs the \"Entreroches\" gorge (460 m), through which the Canal d’Entreroches was dug in the 17th century, enabling water transportation between the Rhone and the Rhine rivers. The canal ceased to be profitable in the 18th century, and when a bridge across the canal collapsed in 1829, it was shut down altogether.\nThe course of the historical canal is now traversed by a railway tunnel of the Lausanne-Yverdon line.\nLe Mormont has been substantially mined for chalk used in cement production.\nIt was planned to extend the mining pit to the hill's summit in 2006 to 2009; because of this, the cantonal archaeological office of Vaud performed a watching brief excavation, which led to the discovery of a late La Tène period (c. 100 BC) Helvetic cult site.\nThe site was reported as being of unprecedented size and richness for the period. A total of 250 pits containing sacrificial deposits were recorded.

It was later developed in the university debate by Antony Flew, who made several important changes such as changing the gardeners to explorers and making original \"long neglected garden\" a clearing in the jungle. It is often used to illustrate the perceived differences between assertions based on faith and assertions based on scientific evidence, and the problems associated with unfalsifiable beliefs. Flew's main claim in using the parable is that religious believers do not allow anybody to \"falsify\" their assertions, instead they simply change their beliefs to suit the questioner. Thus Flew concludes that religious believers cause God to \"die the death of a thousand qualifications\". In Flew's version, the tale runs as follows:\nOnce upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, \"Some gardener must tend this plot.\" The other disagrees, \"There is no gardener.\" So they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. \"But perhaps he is an invisible gardener.\" So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. (For they remember how H. G. Well's \"The Invisible Man\" could be both smelt and touched though he could not be seen.) But no shrieks ever suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. \"But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible, to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves. At last the Skeptic despairs, \"But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?\"\n"}

It is one of the 28 primary attributes (\"mūla guņa\") of both Śvētāmbara and Digambara monks.\n\n\"Pratikramana\" is the combination of two words, \"Pra\" meaning \"return\" and\n\"atikramana\" meaning \"violation\". Literally, it means \"returning from\nviolations\".\n\nThere are five types of \"Pratikramana\":\n\n\"Devasi Pratikramana\"' is performed daily in the evening.\n\n\"Rayi Pratikramana\" is performed in the early morning.\n\n\"Pakhi Pratikramana\" is done once every fifteen days. \n\n\"Chaumasi Pratikramana\" is done once in four months on the Purnima (full moon) of the Kartik, Falgun and Aṣaṛh months of the Vira Nirvana Samvat calendrical year for the sins committed during that period.\n\nSamvatsari Pratikraman is done once per year on the last day of Paryushana mahaparv for the sins committed during the whole year.\n\nSamvatsari Pratikraman includes all six things a \"Śrāvaka\" (householders) must do:\n\nJainism considers the soul, in its pure form, to have infinite perception, knowledge, and vigor, and to be non-attached. These attributes are not seen in a worldly soul because it is soiled with karmas. By following religious principles principals and activities, Jains believe they overcome karmas and promote liberation of the soul. There are various rituals, of which Pratikraman is the most important. During pratikraman, Jains repent for non-meritorious activities on a daily basis.\n\n\"Pratikraman\" must be performed twice every day, or at least once every day after sunset. If that is not possible, at least on every Pakkhi (24 times in a year).\n\n\"Pratikramana\" is also done while performing the \"sāmāyika\" (periodic concentration). In performing \"sāmāyika\", the \"śrāvaka\" has to stand facing north or east and bow to the \"Pañca-Parameṣṭhi\". He then sit down and recites the Namokara mantra a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in:\n\nChauvisantho, also called Chaturvinshatistava, means adoration of the twenty-four Tirthankaras. While reciting it, Jains show their respect for the Tirthankaras and are reminded of how victorious these Jinas were, who overcame inner enemies like anger, ego, greed, deceit, etc. Chauvisantho encourages Jains to emulate Tirthankars and strive to be like them.\n\nThis is a formal renunciation of certain activities, which stops or reduces the inflow of karmas to a great extent. This activity helps us to learn to control our desires and prepares us for a much bigger renunciation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8917125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8917125", "title": "Religion and divorce", "text": "Religion and divorce\n\nThe relationship between religion and divorce is complicated and varied. This article attempts to summarize the dominant views in a number of major world faiths.\n\nThe great majority of Christian denominations affirm that marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The Roman Catholic Church treats all consummated sacramental marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been annulled. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with. Other Christian denominations, including the Eastern Orthodox Church and many Protestant churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. For example, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:\n\nIn societies that practised Puritanism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The Church of England also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a divorced person to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.\n\nBible commentary on divorce comes primarily from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the epistles of Paul. Jesus taught on the subject of divorce in three of the Gospels, and Paul gives a rather extensive treatment of the subject in his First Epistle to the Corinthians chapter 7: \"Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife\" (1 Corinthians 7:10-11), but he also includes the Pauline privilege. He again alludes to his position on divorce in his Epistle to the Romans, albeit an allegory, when he states \"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. . . . So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress\" (Romans 7:2-3).\n\nIn , and , Jesus came into conflict with the Pharisees over divorce concerning their well-known controversy between Hillel and Shammai about —as evidenced in Nashim Gittin 9:10 of the Mishnah. Do Jesus’ answers to the Pharisees also pertain to Christians? Are Christians who adopt these teachings Judaizers? The differences in opinions about these questions usually arise over whether Jesus opposed the Law of Moses or just some of the viewpoints of the Pharisees, and whether Jesus just addressed a Jewish audience or expanded his audience to include Christians, for example \"all nations\" as in the Great Commission. \nSince Deuteronomy 24:1-4 did not give Jewish women the right to directly initiate a divorce (See \"Agunah\"), did Jesus' answers \"in the house\" to his disciples expand the rights of women or did they merely acknowledge that some Jewish women, such as Herodias who divorced Herod Boethus, were wrongfully taking rights because Jewish women were being assimilated by other cultures? (See , .) In other words, did Jesus confine his remarks to the Pharisaical questions, and did he appeal to his own authority by refuting the oral authority of the Pharisees with the formula \"You have heard...But I say to you\" in ? Expressions used by Jesus such as \"you have heard\", \"it hath been said\", \"it is written\", \"have you never read\", \"keep the commandments\", \"why do you break the commandments with your traditions?\" and \"what did Moses Command you?\" seem to indicate that Jesus generally respected the Hebrew Bible and sometimes opposed Pharisaical Opinions. He was critical of the Pharisees.\n\nBuddhism has no religious concept of marriage (see Buddhist view of marriage). In Buddhism, marriage is a secular affair, subject to local customs.\n\nAccording to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, but when marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231). Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are \"talaq\" (repudiation), \"khulʿ\" (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place. Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by sharia, as interpreted by traditional Islamic jurisprudence, and they differed depending on the legal school. Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory. In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained \"within the orbit of Islamic law\", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.\n\nJudaism has always accepted divorce as a fact of life, though an unfortunate one: e.g., see Deuteronomy chapters 22 and 24. Judaism generally maintains that it is better for a couple to divorce than to remain together in a state of bitterness and strife. It is said that \"shalom bayit\" (domestic harmony) is a desirable state.\n\nIn general, it is accepted that for a Jewish divorce to be effective the husband must hand to the wife, and not vice versa, a bill of divorcement, called a get, which also acts as proof of the divorce. From ancient times, the get was considered to be very important to show all those who needed to have proof that the woman was in fact free from the previous marriage and free to remarry. In Jewish law, besides other things, the consequences of a woman remarrying and having a child while still legally married to another is profound: the child would be a mamzer, to be avoided at any cost. Also, the woman would be committing adultery should she remarry while still legally married to another. An enactment called Herem de-Rabbenu Gershom (literally, the proscription of Rabbenu Gershom)--accepted universally throughout European Jewish communities—prohibited a husband from divorcing his wife against her will.\n\nIn Jewish law divorce is an act of the parties to the marriage, which is different from the approach adopted by many other legal systems. That is, a Jewish divorce does not require a decree from a court. The function of the court, in the absence of agreement between the parties, is to decide whether the husband should be compelled to give the \"get\" or for the wife to accept the \"get\". But, notwithstanding any such ruling, the parties remain married until such time as the husband actually delivers the \"get\".\n\nJewish law, in effect, does not require proof or even an allegation of moral or other fault by either party. In the first place, as noted above, if both parties agree to a divorce and follow the prescribed procedure, then the court would not need to establish responsibility for the marriage break-down. In the second place, if either party does not wish to continue co-habiting with the other is sufficient grounds for divorce. (Anything else, it is said, would amount to rape of the woman.) In this sense it is a \"no-fault\" approach to divorce. This approach has been accepted for thousands of years . It was the approach advocated by followers of Hillel, a very influential school of thought in ancient Judea, which predated the current era. This is the approach which is now generally accepted in most, if not all, Jewish communities around the world.\n\nOn the other hand, the refusal of a husband to give his wife a get (the document) can be for purely vindictive or even extortion motives. This situation has resulted in numerous social problems in modern times. For example, where pre-nuptial agreements are enforceable in civil courts, appropriate provisions may be made to compel the giving of the get by the husband in the event of a civil divorce being obtained. A woman who has been refused a get is typically referred to as an \"agunah\".\n\nA wife can initiate a divorce process on several grounds (including lack of satisfaction in her sexual life). However, this right extends only so far as petitioning a court to force her husband to divorce her. Also see \"Jewish Attitude Toward Divorce\".\nand Get in the Conflict of Laws.\n\nFurthermore, from the philosophical and mystical point of view, divorce is a unique procedure of tremendous importance and complexity, because it nullifies the holiest of connections that can exist in the Universe (similar to a connection between a person and God). Because of the danger of the birth of illegitimate children (mamzerim) if the process is not performed properly, and because divorce law is extraordinarily complex, the process is generally supervised by experts.\n\nIn some Jewish mythologies, Adam had a wife before Eve named Lilith who left him. The earliest historically documentation of this legend appears in the 8th-10th centuries \"Alphabet of Ben Sira\". Whether this particular tradition is older is not known.\n\nAfter finding he intended to marry Glauce; for what Jason said was political ties; Medea murdered Glauce and her father with a burning dress; than proceeded to kill her own children Tisander and Alcimenes fearing they would be imprisoned. Afterwords she left to Athens on a chariot of dragons given to her by her grandfather Helios.\n\nThe Wiccan equivalent of a divorce is described as a \"handparting\". Wiccans traditionally see either a high priest or high priestess to discuss things out before a divorce. However a handfasting (marriage) that falls apart peacefully does not necessarily need a handparting.\n\nIn Unitarian Universalism, divorce is allowed and should be a decision by the individual person and is seen as ending a rite of passage. Such divorces have sometimes taken the form of divorce rituals as far back as the 1960s. Divorces are largely seen as a life choice.\n\nhttp://www.bibleissues.org, https://web.archive.org/web/20091027092358/http://geocities.com/dcheddie/divorce1.html, http://students.eng.fiu.edu/~denver/divorce1.html \n"}

He also served for a number of years on the board of reference for the ministry the Spiritual Counterfeits Project in Berkeley, California. In 1987 he delivered the Tanner Annual Lecture at the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. In 1994, Westmont College awarded Enroth twice for both Faculty Researcher of the Year and also Teacher of the Year in Social Sciences.\n\nEnroth has written, co-written and edited a number of books and essays where he presents an evangelical interpretation of the sociology of cults and new religious movements. He has also written and edited works specifically concerned with the evangelization of adherents of cults.\n\nHe was an early chronicler of the countercultural movement within evangelicalism that was known in the 1970s as the Jesus People movement or the Jesus revolution movement. His co-written book \"The Jesus People\" covered para-church organizations that held to Christian orthodox doctrines, and also examined controversial groups whose orthodoxy was open to dispute among evangelicals (such as the Children of God.)\n\nAnother early work of his examined the emergence, sociology and theology of gay churches within Protestantism.\n\nIn the late 1970s he wrote \"Youth, Brainwashing and the Extremist Cults\", where he explored the dynamics of conversion and member participation through some case studies of various controversial minority religious groups such as: Hare Krishna (ISKCON), Children of God, Alamo Christian Foundation, the Love Family, the Unification Church, the Way International, and the Divine Light Mission. Enroth argued there were characteristics to cult commitment that were aberrant, such as the separation of youth from their families, intensive and manipulative activities of instruction and recruitment, and tests of loyalty to the group. He argued that the sociological and psychological processes of recruitment and indoctrination involved some form of brainwashing or mind control. The final part of his study explored the spiritual problems he discerned with cults from the standpoint of evangelical Christianity.\n\nAlthough Enroth argued in support of the brainwashing theory of cult conversions, he was nonetheless very critical of the tactics of secular anti-cult individuals who engaged in deprogramming. In the early 1980s Enroth criticized the views of the deprogrammer Ted Patrick. In an interview with Neil Duddy, Enroth rejected deprogramming as a remedy for dealing with cults. J. Gordon Melton also reported Enroth's views about opposing deprogramming in \"Christianity Today\" magazine.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s Enroth had a formal and frank exchange of views with J. Gordon Melton on a range of questions and methodological approaches to studying cults. This dialogue first appeared in an abridged version in \"Christianity Today\" in March 1984, and was then expanded into a book \"Why Cults Succeed Where The Church Fails\". One of the important outcomes of this dialogue was an agreement between Enroth and Melton that a technically precise demarcation was needed to differentiate the Christian countercult movement from the secular anti-cult movement.\n\nEnroth complained that Melton, together with co-author Robert L. Moore, had lumped Christians in with secularists in their 1982 book \"The Cult Experience\". Enroth also accused David Bromley, Anson Shupe, and Lowell Streiker, of committing the same error in their writings. Enroth stated: \"I recognize the distinction Gordon was mentioning between the Christian and the secular anticult movement, but he doesn't, unfortunately, make the distinction in his published writing. We're all painted with the same brush.\" (p. 30). Melton, who acknowledged the distinct differences between the two movements, promised to rectify this point in his writings. In the 1986 edition of his \"Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America\" Melton introduced religious studies scholars to the neologism Christian countercult as a means of demarcating it from the secular anti-cult movement.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s Enroth turned his attention on to the subject of marginal or fringe churches. In his studies Enroth has pinpointed church groups that operate outside mainstream denominations that promote a legalist understanding of the gospel, and operate with manipulative processes of membership. He discusses these problems in \"Churches That Abuse\" and \"Recovering from Churches That Abuse\".\n\nAlthough Enroth has explored sociological questions in many of his books, he has also been an advocate of Christian evangelism toward members of so-called cults and new religious movements. In his book \"Evangelizing the Cults\" he recommends that Christians explain the gospel message to adherents. He emphasizes the role of prayer in this activity. Enroth urges Christians to adopt the style of evangelism used by St.Paul in his Areopagus speech in affirming the search while unwavering from the gospel.\n\nIn his recent text \"A Guide to New Religious Movements\", Enroth reiterates many of these points. However he also suggests that Christians follow the example set in Christian missions' literature of understanding the customs, culture and beliefs of groups and adopting a less confrontational attitude in evangelism and apologetics.\n\nIn general, Enroth's writings have been acknowledged in Christian circles as significant contributions on the subject of \"cults\". In 1992 J. Gordon Melton made special mention of Enroth as an important figure in the Christian countercult movement. Unlike most of the apologists who concentrate on doctrinal questions, Enroth is distinguished as one of the few writers in the movement to both hold credentials in sociology and to apply sociological tools in his analyses. Melton stated that Enroth was \"the single most widely read of the Evangelical Christian counter-cult writers.\" \n\nIn 1993, Enroth's book \"Recovering from Churches That Abuse\" set off a \"firestorm of debate among religious scholars,\" centered around a chapter on the group Jesus People USA which included several stories of alleged abuse within the group.\n\nJames T. Richardson, former president of the Association for the Sociology of Religion and currently Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies (University of Nevada, Reno), criticized Enroth's book and research methods in an issue of JPUSA's Cornerstone magazine, writing in part:\n\nEnroth's book can be viewed as another in a long line of popular books that teach people how to become good victims by reinterpreting their past. Ironically, this thoroughly non-sociological book makes use of a sociological truth--that people are constantly reinterpreting their past to make their view of that past more functional for their present--as he delivers the message that people's problems are not really their fault. Someone else is always to blame. This line of thought is controversial from several perspectives, of course, including the theological and the therapeutic. ... Enroth reminds the reader several times that he is a sociologist, thus implying that he is doing sociology in the book, but this slim volume is not sociological. There is no attempt to sample properly, or to limit generalizations in any explicit way. There is no effort to discuss the issue of self-serving accounts that plague all such books of this 'anticult' bent, and there is a glossing over of the writer's own particular religious persuasion. Furthermore, there is virtually no recognition of the considerable scholarly research that might be used to counter the apparent thesis of Enroth, who seems to believe that religious groups that require heavy discipline and commitment should be avoided in favor of less demanding mainstream groups.\n\nJPUSA elders, who attempted to convince Enroth to remove the chapter prior to the release of the book, referred to the chapter as \"poison in the well.\" Ruth Tucker, a professor at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School also defended JPUSA saying Enroth was \"sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed.\"\n\nIn defense of Enroth's work, Paul R. Martin, the director of Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center, one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of cults and \"abusive groups,\" supported Enroth's findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA \"displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly authoritarian and totalistic groups.\"\n\nRonald Enroth himself responded to the controversy (some of which had occurred prior to the release of the book) in the book itself, in part with:\n\nThere has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who have cooperated with my research efforts.\n\nAs a result of the book's chapter on JPUSA, according to a later newspaper article, \"scores\" of members read it and decided to leave the group.\n\nEnroth has written and edited the following books:\n\n"}

He was a student of Sivananda Saraswati, the founder of the Divine Life Society, and founded the Bihar School of Yoga in 1964. He wrote over 80 books, including \"Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha\".\n\nSatyananda Saraswati was born 1923 at Almora, Uttaranchal, into a family of farmers and zamindars.\n\nAs a youth he was classically educated and studied Sanskrit, the Vedas and the Upanishads. He says that he began to have spiritual experiences at the age of six, when his awareness spontaneously left the body and he saw himself lying motionless on the floor. Many saints and sadhus blessed him and reassured his parents that he had a very developed awareness. This experience of disembodied awareness continued, which led him to many saints of that time such as Anandamayi Ma. He also met a tantric bhairavi, Sukhman Giri, who gave him shaktipat and directed him to find a guru to stabilise his spiritual experiences. However, in one of his early publications, \"Yoga from Shore to Shore\", he says he would become unconscious during meditation and that \"One day I met a mahatma, a great saint, who was passing by my birthplace...So he told me I should find a guru.\" \n\nAt age eighteen, he left his home to seek a spiritual master. In 1943 at the age of twenty, he met his guru Sivananda Saraswati and went to live at Sivananda's ashram in Rishikesh. Sivananda initiated him into the Dashnam Order of Sannyasa on 12 September 1947 on the banks of the Ganges and gave him the name of Swami Satyananda Saraswati. He stayed with Sivananda for a further nine years but received little formal instruction from him.\n\nIn 1956, Sivananda sent Satyananda away to spread his teachings. Basing himself in Munger, Bihar, he wandered as a mendicant travelling through India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Burma and Ceylon for the next seven years (although on several occasions he said he travelled only through India), extending his knowledge of spiritual practices and spending some time in seclusion.\n\nIn 1962 Satyananda established the International Yoga Fellowship Movement (IYFM) in Rajnandgaon. IYFM inspired the establishment of ashrams and yoga centers spiritually guided by Swami Satyananda in India and all over the world. \nIn 1964, he founded the Bihar School of Yoga (BSY) at Munger, with the intention that it would act as a centre of training for future teachers of yoga as well as offer courses on yoga.\n\nAmong those who attended courses at BSY were students from abroad and students who subsequently emigrated from India. Some of these people in turn invited Satyananda to teach in their own countries. He lectured and taught for the next twenty years, including a tour of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, North America between April and October 1968. The foreign and expatriate students also established new centres of teaching in their respective countries.\n\nIn 1988 Satyananda handed over the active work of his ashram and organisation to his spiritual successor, Niranjanananda Saraswati, and left Munger.\n\nFrom September 1989 he was in Rikhia, Deoghar, Jharkhand. There he lived as a paramahamsa sannyasin and performed vedic sadhanas including panchagni, an austerity performed before five blazing fires outdoors during the hottest months of the year. At Rikhia, Satyananda conducted a 12-year Rajasooya Yajna which began in 1995 with the first Sat Chandi Maha Yajna, invoking the Cosmic Mother through a tantric ceremony. During this event, Satyananda passed on his spiritual and sannyasa sankalpa to Niranjanananda.\n\nHe died on 5 December 2009.\n\nSatyananda's teachings emphasise an \"Integral Yoga\" with a strong emphasis on Tantra, known as the \"Bihar Yoga\" system or \"Satyananda Yoga\". This system addresses the qualities of head, heart and hands – intellect, emotion and action - and attempts to integrate the physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions of yoga into each practice. His system of tantric yoga involves the practice of:\ncomponents of Kriya yoga, in combination with other practices such as asana, pranayama, mudras\nand badhas. Kriya Yoga aims to awaken the dimensions of consciousness where our dormant potential\nand creativity lies. \n\nSatyananda classified and expounded the techniques given in the tantras as a series of different stages and levels of pratyahara, such as antar mouna, and different stages of meditation. He invented a technique of yoga-nidra, now known worldwide as Satyananda Yoga Nidra, and defined and codified the different stages of the technique.\n\nSatyananda wrote over 80 books, including \"Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha\". Satyananda's writings have been published by the Bihar School of Yoga and, since 2000, by the Yoga Publications Trust established by his disciple Niranjanananda to promote his teachings.\n\n\n"}

In the 21st century, secular and non-religious currents have seen a precipitous decline due to the rising popularity of the Georgian Orthodox Church and the fact that religious faith in general “has become fashionable” in Georgian society.\n\nAccording to a 2015 statistically sampled opinion research, 37% of the Georgian population thought that childbearing by women outside of wedlock (a sin for most traditional faiths in Georgia) was sometimes or always justified. Georgian public opinion on the matter of pre-marital sex (also a sin for traditional faiths in Georgia), showed different levels of tolerance for women and men: 23% of the public thought that female pre-marital sex was sometimes or always justified, but a higher 55% thought the same about male pre-marital sex.\n\nAlthough the Georgian Orthodox Church views abortion as a \"terrible sin\", and 69% of Georgians say they can never justify abortion, as of 2005 a Georgian woman was estimated to have an average of three abortions in her lifetime. In recent years, the abortion rates have been somewhat reduced, but due to the increase in the use of contraception among Georgians, which the Church also condemns.\n\nGeorgian population maintains negative views about homosexuality.However according to a 2013 statistically sampled survey of Tbilisi on the subject of anti-gay violence, 87% of residents said that violence is \"always unacceptable\" and 91% agreed that \"everyone should be equal before the law - including the clergy\". At the same time, 57% thought that clergy who participated in violence against LGBT persons should not face trial. 40% of respondents disagreed with the notion that church should be intolerant towards sexual minorities, 45% agreed with church intolerance of sexual minorities, while 15% were uncertain. 57% stated that the successful organization of a peaceful demonstration marking the annual IDAHOT would endanger Georgia in some way.According to 2011 social attitude questionnaires, homosexuals remained one of the most disliked groups in society – with most respondents preferring an alcoholic rather than homosexual colleague at work. According to the same questionnaires, an estimated 91.5 percent of Georgians think that homosexuality is \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nArticle 9 of the current Constitution of Georgia guarantees \"complete freedom of belief and religion.\" While recognizing the \"special role ... in the history of Georgia\" of the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC), the Church remains separate of the State. A special Concordat (legal agreement) between the Georgian state and the GOC was ratified in 2002, giving the GOC special legal rights not given to other religious groups—including immunity for the Georgian Orthodox Patriarch, exemption from military service for GOC clergy, and a consultative role in education and other aspects of the government. \n\nIn December 2015, the head of GOC Ilia II stated that he would like to have the power to grant pardons to individuals convicted of crimes, which is a power afforded by the Georgian Constitution only to the President. The proposal caused a backlash among Georgian civil society groups, who warned against creeping \"theocracy\". The Speaker of the Parliament David Usupashvili politely dismissed the Patriarch's idea, saying that issuing pardons and forgiving sins are two separate matters and that legal pardons are a prerogative of the Head of State. Following the backlash, GOC backtracked Patriarch's request for pardon powers, saying that it was made after meeting with prison inmates in a \"very emotional\" atmosphere and that the idea was to be taken as an expression of compassion towards the inmates, and \"not as a demand to discuss this proposal at a legislative level\".\n\nIn 2013, GOC unsuccessfully lobbied the Georgian government to ban abortions, which it described as a \"terrible sin\" and \"heinous murder\", while blaming it for the supposed \"grave demographic situation\" in the country. Georgia's then Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili brushed off the proposal, stating that solving demographic problems \"first and foremost needs economic development\".\n\n"}

The following are the list of activities that a Sikh should engages in:\n\n5 Banis - The initiated Sikh is asked by the Panj Piare during the Amrit Sanchar ceremony to recite the following 5 banis every morning as a commitment to the Sikh Gurus and Waheguru. The 5 Banis are: Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Anand Sahib, Benti Chaupai and Tav parsad Savaiye - these banis are usually recited daily by all devoted Sikhs in the early morning.\nFive Ks or \"panj kakaar/kakke\", are five items of faith that baptised Khalsa Sikhs wear at all times at the command of the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh who so ordered at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699. The Five Ks are not merely symbols but articles of faith which collectively form the external visible symbols to identify and clearly and outwardly advertise and display one's commitment and dedication to the order (Hukam) of the tenth master. Guru Gobind Singh ordered his followers to wear the Five Ks so that they could actively use them to make a difference to their own and to others' spirituality. However, Sikhism recognises the concept of a multi-level approach to achieving one's target as a disciple of the faith as well. For example, “Sahajdhari” (slow adopters) are those Sikhs who have not yet donned the full Five Ks.\n\nFive Thieves or pancadokh or panj vikar as they are referred to in Sikh Scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, are, according to Sikhism, the five thieves that steal the senses of the human personality and sre at variance with its spiritual essence.These five \"thieves\" comprise Kam (Lust), Krodh (Rage), Lobh (Greed), Moh (Attachment) and Ahankar (ego) in Punjabi.\n\nFive Virtues - For Sikhs, the final goal of life is to reunite or merge with God (Mukti). The Sikh Gurus taught that to achieve this goal it was important to work hard at developing positive human qualities which lead the soul closer to God. The Gurus taught that all human beings have the qualities they need to reunite with God but they must train their minds to make the most of these qualities. In order to reach the final goal of life, Sikhs believe that they must constantly develop their love for God by developing compassion for all God’s creation.\n\nSimran - In Sikhism, Simran () refers to the repetition or recital of the God Names: Nām or of the Holy Text from the Two Granths of the Sikhs: the Sri Guru Granth Sahib and the Dasam Granth. The word is derived from Sanskrit word \"smarana\" meaning Remembrance. Also translates to ‘Meditation’ – The verb \"Simar\", which is derived from \"Simran\" means \"meditating\".\n\nSewa - To perform selfless service, without any thought of reward or personal benefit. All Sikhs are encouraged by their Guru (Shiri Guru Granth Sahib) to perform Seva or Selfless Service. This is not only good for community relations but also is good for the moral upliftent. You will find Sikhs engaged in free service in Gurdwaras washing dishes or cleaning the floors, etc. Sikhs are also encouraged to help the community by performing unpaid work in Hospitals, Old Peoples' Homes, Community Centres, etc.\n\nThree pillars of Sikhism\n"}

Leutner crawled to a road where she was found; she recovered after six days in the hospital. Weier and Geyser were found not guilty by reason of insanity and, by February 2018, convicted and sentenced to long periods in mental health institutions.\n\nSlender Man is a fictional entity created for a 2009 Photoshop contest on Something Awful, an online forum, the goal of which was to create paranormal images. The Slender Man mythos was later expanded by a number of other people who created fan fiction and additional artistic depictions of the entity.\n\nSlender Man is a tall, thin character, with a featureless white face and head. He is depicted as wearing a black suit, and is sometimes shown with tentacles growing out of his back. According to the Slender Man mythos, the entity can cause amnesia, bouts of coughing and paranoid behavior in individuals. He is often depicted hiding in forests or stalking children.\n\nWeier, Geyser, and Leutner were all 12 years old at the time of the stabbing, and were classmates enrolled in the same school. Their principal later said that none had any disciplinary issues. They had been at a sleepover together the night before the stabbing. The attackers had discovered Slender Man on the Creepypasta Wiki, a website that hosts creepypasta. They later said they had believed Slender Man to be real, and had wanted to prove their loyalty to him so they could become his \"proxies\", prove his existence, and prevent him from harming their families; they believed that the only way to do this would be to kill someone, after which they would become servants of the Slender Man and live in his mansion, which they thought was located in Nicolet National Forest.\n\nWeier and Geyser initially planned to attack Leutner on May 30, 2014, during a sleepover. They planned to tape the victim's mouth shut, stab her in the neck, and flee. They did not carry out that attack; Geyser is believed to have wanted to give Leutner one more day to live. A second plan called for attacking Leutner in a bathroom at a local park.\n\nThe actual attack took place in a nearby forest during a game of hide-and-seek on May 31, 2014. Leutner was pinned down and stabbed 19 times in the arms, legs, and torso with a five-inch-long (13 cm) kitchen knife. Two wounds were to major arteries and one missed her heart by less than a millimeter and the other went through her diaphragm, cutting into her liver and stomach. Weier and Geyser then told Leutner they would get help for her, but instead simply left. Leutner dragged herself to a nearby road where she was found by a cyclist.\n\nWeier and Geyser were apprehended near Interstate 94. The knife used in the stabbing was in a bag they carried. Weier and Geyser were described as feeling guilty for stabbing their friend, but felt that the attack was needed to appease Slender Man.\n\nLeutner left the hospital six days after the attack. She returned to school in fall 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Weier plead guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide; a jury then found her \"not guilty by mental disease or defect\".\nGeyser accepted a plea offer under which she would not go to trial and would be evaluated by psychiatrists to determine how long she should be placed in a mental hospital. She later pleaded guilty and was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\n\nWeier was sentenced to 25-years-to-life, an indeterminate sentence involving at least three years locked confinement and involuntary treatment in a state psychiatric institute, followed by communal supervision until age 40. Her accomplice, Morgan Geyser, was sentenced to the maximum 40-years-to-life, an indeterminate sentence involving at least three years locked confinement, in addition to involuntary treatment in a state psychiatric institute until complete resolution of symptoms or until age 53, whichever may happen first; followed by continued communal supervision, periodic reevaluations and/or reinstitution and further treatment per-needed as required by the sentenced imposed.\n\nIn the aftermath of the stabbing, the Creepypasta Wiki was blocked throughout the Waukesha School District. On the Tuesday following the stabbing, a statement from the creator of the Slender Man was posted to the Creepypasta Wiki expressing condolences for all those involved. Sloshedtrain, the administrator of the Creepypasta Wiki, said that the stabbing was an isolated incident that did not accurately represent the creepypasta community. He also stated that the Creepypasta Wiki was a literary website and that they did not condone murder or satanic rituals.\n\nMembers of the creepypasta community held a 24-hour live stream on YouTube June 13-14, 2014, to raise money for the stabbing victim. Joe Jozwowski, an administrator on a creepypasta website, said the purpose of the stream was to show that members of the community wanted to help the victim and to demonstrate that they were not horrible people just because they liked scary stories.\n\nOn August 12, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker issued a proclamation declaring Wednesday, August 13, 2014, \"Purple Hearts for Healing Day\" and encouraged the people of Wisconsin to wear purple on that day to honor the victim of the stabbing. He also praised the \"strength and determination\" exhibited by the victim during her recovery.\n\nThe city of Madison, Wisconsin, held a one-day bratwurst festival to honor the victim on August 29, several days before the victim returned to school. Hot dogs and bratwurst were sold to raise money towards the victim's medical costs. The event was run by over 250 volunteers, and raised over $70,000 for the victim.\n\nThe stabbing resulted in extensive debate about the role of the Internet in society and its impact on children. Russell Jack, Waukesha Police Chief, said that the stabbing \"should be a wake-up call for all parents\", adding that the Internet \"is full of information and wonderful sites that teach and entertain\", but that it \"can also be full of dark and wicked things\". John Egelhof, a retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, argued that the Internet had become a \"blackhole\" with the ability to expose children to a more sinister world. He suggested that the best way to avoid future incidents was for parents to keep track of their children's web habits and to educate them on the differences between right and wrong. Shira Chess, an assistant professor of mass media arts at the University of Georgia, stated that creepypasta was no more dangerous than stories about vampires or zombies. She argued that creepypasta websites were beneficial, and that they gave people the opportunity to become better writers.\n\nA documentary film on the incident called \"Beware the Slenderman\" was released by HBO Films in March 2016, and was broadcast on HBO on January 23, 2017.\n\nA season 16 episode of \"\", titled \"Glasgowman's Wrath\", is loosely based on the event. The Criminal Minds episode \"The Tall Man\" (Episode 14.05, airdate October 31, 2018), was also inspired by this story. \n\nOn October 14, 2018, a movie inspired by the Slender Man stabbing called \"Terror in the Woods\" aired on Lifetime. The film stars Ella West Jerrier, Sophia Grace McCarthy, Skylar Morgan Jones, Angela Kinsey, Drew Powell, and Carrie Hood. Christina Ricci serves as the executive producer of the film.\n\n\n"}

The three volumes, published in 1818, 1842 and 1847, detail the lives of the Fairchild children. Part I, which was in print for over a century, focuses on Emily, Lucy and Henry's realization of their \"human depravity\" (original sin) and their consequent need for redemption; Parts II and III emphasize more worldly lessons such as etiquette and virtuous consumerism.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, \"The Fairchild Family\" was renowned for its realistic portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". In the twentieth century the books have most often been viewed as quintessential examples of the didactic style of children's writing popular before \"Alice\".\n\nSherwood published the first part of \"The Fairchild Family\" in 1818 with the firm of John Hatchard in Piccadilly, thereby assuring it \"social distinction\". Hatchard was associated with the Clapham Sect of evangelicals, which included Hannah More, and his customers were wealthy businessmen, gentry, and Members of Parliament. The book was popular, remaining in print until 1913. Urged by her readers, her printer and her own desire to capitalize on Part I's success, Sherwood published Parts II and III in 1842 and 1847, respectively.\n\n\"The Fairchild Family, Part I\" tells the story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also proper earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting, for example, are immoral). The text incorporates a series of tract-like stories into an overarching narrative in order to illustrate these moral lessons. The stories of the deaths of two neighborhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, for instance, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to prepare their own hearts for salvation. The faithful and \"true\" Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience (much like Charles Dickens's Little Nell in \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" (1840–1)), suggesting that he was saved; by contrast, the heedless and disobedient Augusta, who plays with candles, burns up and is presumably damned.\n\nParts II and III have a similar structure; an overarching narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have \"a new and divine nature, which works against your evil natures, causing you to know when you have done wrong, and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin.\" Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus to a greater extent on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the gibbet to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.\n\nIn all three books, thematically-relevant prayers and hymns by the likes of Philip Doddridge, Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and Ann and Jane Taylor follow each chapter.\n\nThe theme that dominates \"The Fairchild Family, Part I\" is the evangelical need to recognize one's innate \"depravity\" and prepare oneself for eternity. In this volume, the most important lessons in life are \"faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God.\" Sherwood articulates this theology in the very first pages of the book:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Fairchild loved and feared God, and had done so, by the mercy of God, ever since their younger days. They knew that their hearts were very bad, and that they could not be saved by any good thing they could do: on the contrary, that they were by nature fitted only for everlasting punishment: but they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and loved him for having died for them; and they knew he would save them, because he saves all those who trust in him. \n\nThe book encourages its readers to adopt these beliefs not only through its stories but also through its prayers:\n\nHear, therefore, my prayer, O Lord, and send thy Holy Spirit to shew unto me the wickedness of my own heart; that I may hate myself, and know, that, had I my deserts, I should now be living with the devil in hell. [sic]\n\nBut unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes, such as John Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\" (1678), Sherwood domesticated her story—all of the actions in the children's day-to-day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was looking at her, but the eye of God, who sees every thing we do, and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, did not think of God.\"\n\nAs Sherwood scholar M. Nancy Cutt argues, \"the great overriding metaphor of all [Sherwood's] work is the representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden). . . No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed in the sight of God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God.\" This is made clear in the Fairchild parents' description of their own authority:\n\nWhilst you are a little child, you must tell your sins to me; and I will shew [sic] you the way by which only you may hope to overcome them: when you are bigger, and I and your papa are removed from you, then you must tell all your sins to God.\n\nChildren's literature scholar Patricia Demers has referred to this connection between the family and the divine as the Romantic element in Sherwood's writing, arguing that her \"characters’ zeal in finding and defining an earthly home prompts their almost automatic longing for a heavenly home. Sherwood's is a consciously double vision, glimpsing the eternal in the natural, the sublime in the quotidian.\"\n\nAll three parts of \"The Fairchild Family\" \"taught the lessons of personal endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status.\" Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to \"larger economic and political forces.\" This is particularly true for the poor characters in the texts, such as the Truemans in the first volume and the beggar children, Jane and Edward, in the second volume.\n\nParts II and III reflect Sherwood's changing values as well as those of the Victorian period. Significantly, the servants in Part I, \"who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house.\" The second two volumes also outline narrower roles for each sex. In Part I Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin, but in Part II, Henry's scrapes involve letting loose a bull while the girls focus intently on how to make purchases in an economical yet fair fashion. The most extensive thematic change in the series, however, was the disappearance of its strident evangelicalism. Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children's \"human depravity\" and encourage the reader to think in terms of the afterlife, in Parts II and III, other Victorian values such as \"respectability\" and filial obedience are brought to the fore. Children's literature scholar Janis Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence; in Parts II and III, the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in Part I.\n\n\"The Fairchild Family\" continued to be a bestseller despite the increasingly popular Wordsworthian image of childhood innocence and the sentimental picture of childhood presented in novels such as Charles Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\" (1837–39). One scholar has suggested that it \"influenced Dickens's depictions of Pip's fears of the convict, the gibbet, and 'the horrible young man' at the close of Chapter 1\" in \"Great Expectations\" (1860–61). Children's literature scholar Gillian Avery has argued that \"The Fairchild Family\" was \"as much a part of English childhood as \"Alice\" was later to become.\" As late as the 1900s, Lord Frederic Hamilton states that he attended a party at which each guest dressed up as a character from the book. Although the book was popular, some scraps of evidence have survived suggesting that readers did not always interpret it as Sherwood would have wanted. Lord Hamilton writes, for instance, that \"there was plenty about eating and drinking; one could always skip the prayers, and there were three or four very brightly written accounts of funerals in it.\"\n\nWhen the series was republished later in the century, the books were severely edited; often Mr. Fairchild's sermons were removed from Part I and the phrase \"human depravity\" was replaced with the word \"naughtiness.\" Many of the changes also served to further emphasize the authority of the parents: \"as the religious framework was weakened or removed, the parent became the ultimate authority, and the Victorian cult of the family was reinforced in a way that Mrs. Sherwood had never intended.\"\n\nAlthough \"The Fairchild Family\" has gained a reputation in the twentieth century as an oppressively didactic book, in the early nineteenth century it was viewed as delightfully realistic. It was often described as humorous and Charlotte Yonge (1823–1901), a critic who also wrote children's literature, praised \"the gusto with which [Sherwood] dwells on new dolls\" and \"the absolutely sensational naughtiness\" of the children. Although twentieth-century critics have tended to view the tale as harsh (John Rowe Townsend described it as \"unspeakably cruel\"), often pointing to the Fairchilds' visit to the gibbet, Cutt and others argue that the positive depiction of the nuclear family in the text, particularly Sherwood's emphasis on parents' responsibility to educate their own children, was an important part of the book's appeal. She argues that Sherwood's \"influence,\" via books such as the \"Fairchild Family\", \"upon the domestic pattern of Victorian life can hardly be overestimated.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell had a very negative view. \"This evil book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is well worth reading in the original version. It gives one some idea of the lengths to which child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr. Fairchild, for instance, when he catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs delight to bark and bite' between blows of the cane, and then takes them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a murderer is hanging.\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9822881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9822881", "title": "The Northern Celestial Masters", "text": "The Northern Celestial Masters\n\nThe Northern Celestial Masters type of the Way of the Celestial Master () Daoist movement existed in the north of China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation of the Way of the Celestial Masters as it had been practiced in Sichuan province by Zhang Lu and his followers. After the community was forced to relocate in 215 CE, a group of Celestial Masters established themselves in Northern China. Kou Qianzhi, from a family who followed the Celestial Master, brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the Northern Wei. The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion, thereby creating a new Daoist theocracy that lasted until 450 CE. The arrival of Buddhism had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners. Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence. When the theocracy collapsed, many Daoists fled to Louguan, which quickly became an important religious center. The Northern Celestial Masters survived as a distinct school at Louguan until the late 7th century CE, when they became integrated into the wider Daoist movement.\n\nKou Qianzhi was a member of Celestial Master family that came from an area near Chang'an. Inspired by the burgeoning Daoist movement in Southern China, Kou retreated to Mount Song in Henan to receive inspiration. On the mountain, as described by the text \"The History of the Wei Dynasty\", he was visited twice by Laozi. In his first visit in 415, Laozi revealed to Kou a text known as the \"Laojun Yinsong Jiejing\" (New Code). This text contained precepts designed for a new religious community. In 423, a messenger of Laozi came and offered Kou a new text called the \"Lutu Zhenjing\" (Perfect Scripture of Registers and Charts), which is now lost, and appointed him as the new Celestial Master.\n\nIn 424, Kou took these texts with him to the Wei court. There, he was welcomed by Emperor Taiwu and garnered the support of Cui Hao, the prime minister. Even though Cui Hao was a Confucianist, he greatly admired Kou and was immediately drawn to him. Cui also appreciated Kou's mathematical skills and hoped that he might help him improve his own longevity techniques. They also shared a dream of a 'purified society,' a land where peace and justice prevailed. Kou's 'New Code' was promulgated throughout the realm, and a large altar was built near the capital where 120 Daoist practitioners performed rites and prayers daily. Cui gained a great deal of power in the court, and in 444 began to purge the Buddhist clergy. This led to a major persecution against Buddhists in 446. In 448, Kou Qianzhi was 'released' from his body, and Cui lost his greatest supporter at the court. Shortly after Kou's death, Cui had a national history of Wei dynasty containing unflattering portraits of its rulers carved in stone. This so enraged the emperor, that he had Cui executed in 450. After Cui's execution, the Daoist community was forced to flee, with many of them settling at the Daoist center of Louguan.\n\nBy the late 470s, Daoists fleeing from the Northern Wei court had transformed Louguan into an important religious center. According to legend, Louguan used to be the home of Yin Xi, the first recipient of the \"Dao de jing\". At this time, the center's buildings were greatly expanded, and many Daoist scriptures were collected, including materials from the Lingbao and Shangqing schools. During the 7th century, the school had a prominent role in a series of debates that examined whether Buddhism or Daoism would be better suited to bring stability to the realm. The first debate surrounded Fuyi, a scholar and Daoist who proposed that Buddhism be abolished in China. Naturally, the Buddhists were not happy with his suggestions and countered his arguments in several treatises. The second debate concerned Lu Zhongqing, a friend of Fu Yi, who wrote about Buddhism's inferiority to Daoism. The Tang emperors were in support of the Daoists, and in 637 issued an edict that secured the precedence of Daoism over Buddhism. This edict remained in place until 674, when Empress Wu Zetian came to power. At the same time, Louguan also served as a refuge for Daoists fleeing the persecution of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty to the south. The final Northern Celestial Master, Yin Wencao arrived at Louguan in 636 and later achieved the favor of the Gaozong Emperor. After Yin's death in 688, Louguan remained an important place of Daoist learning, but ceased to be considered part of a distinct school.\n\nThe most important text from the Northern Wei period of the Northern Celestial Masters is the \"Laojun Yinsong Jiejing\" (New Code). This text was revealed to Kou Qianzhi in 415, and is now mostly lost apart from a few fragments. The surviving text contains thirty-six precepts that outline rules which a Daoist had to abide by. The behavioral rules outlined proper public conduct and what to do in case of sickness. There were also guidelines describing how banquets were to be set up, as well ritual instructions concerning funeral rites, immortality practice and petitions.\n\nOne of the most important text's from the school's Louguan period is called the \"Xishengjing\" (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the \"Daode Jing\" to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.\n\nThe Northern Celestial Master variety of Daoism was both similar and different from Zhang Lu's earlier form. Unlike prior incarnations of the Celestial Masters, which supported sexual practices as a means of achieving immortality, Kou's text urged that the sexual arts be purged from the religion. In addition, he also states that religion must be purged of the imposition of religious taxes on the faithful and the inheritance of religious titles. In the Northern Celestial Masters, Laozi became closely linked with the Buddha, who was claimed to be a student of Laozi. There were also very specific dietary requirements that had to be followed, as well as other rules, many of which were influenced by Buddhism. The Northern Celestial Masters were also the first Daoists to practice a form of monasticism, another idea that came from Buddhism. Kou also condemned messianic movements and called for texts such as the \"Daodejing\" to be copied and recited. Those people who were good in life would gain immortality in a new age, whereas those who were bad would be reborn as insects or animals.\nSome similarities between earlier Celestial Master Daoism include the role of Laozi. Laozi was viewed as the personification of the Dao, who existed for eternity and created the world. He was believed to be the creator of the universe and came to earth intermittently to bring forth sacred scriptures, including the \"Daode Jing\" and \"Xisheng Jing\". Moreover, Laozi continued to appear periodically and bring forth new scriptures to both Kou Qianzhi and adherents at Louguan, surrounded by a celestial entourage and announced by a celestial envoy. Laozi was also extremely closely linked with the Buddha, and in certain sources, even became the Buddha or announced Yinxi as the Buddha.\n\nThe Northern Celestial Masters followed certain regular, communal rites. One of these communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could last as long as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.\n\nWhile monasticism had existed in Chinese Buddhism, the Northern Celestial Masters were one of the first Daoist groups to practice it. Kou lived a monastic lifestyle on Songshan, known today for being the location of the Shaolin Monastery. Monasticism developed further during the Louguan phase of the Northern Celestial Masters due to this influence of Buddhism. During this period, a clear distinction developed between lay and monastic followers in Daoism. The ordination, precepts and way in which monks sought salvation were all influenced by Buddhism.\n\nMany art objects were produced in Northern China during the time of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45671382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45671382", "title": "The Statue of Hermes", "text": "The Statue of Hermes\n\nThere are five fables of ancient Greek origin that deal with the statue of Hermes. All have been classed as burlesques that show disrespect to the god involved and some scepticism concerning the efficacy of religious statues as objects of worship. Statues of Hermes differed according to function and several are referenced in these stories. Only one fable became generally retold in later times, although two others also achieved some currency.\n\nThe fable appears as number 88 in the Perry Index and was to become a favourite in Europe from the Renaissance on. It is directed against self-conceit in general and concerns a visit to a statue maker made in human disguise by the god Hermes. Finding that Jove, the king of the gods, was set at a low price and his queen at only a little more, he felt sure that, since he was their messenger, his own statue must command much more. When he asked about it, however, the sculptor told him that if he would buy the other two statues he could have that one free.\n\nA Neo-Latin poem on the theme appeared in Gabriele Faerno's \"Centum Fabulae\" (1563) with the moral that 'Many who fancy themselves are set at nothing'. In England prose versions appeared in the collections of Roger L'Estrange (1692) and Samuel Croxall (1722). In all of these, the name of the Greek god is changed to Mercury, his Latin equivalent. There were also two English verse retellings. In Edward Arwaker's \"Truth in Fiction\" (1708), the story is subtitled \"Vain-glory mortified\" and is a much more circumstantial account. Statues of the gods are described as currently ‘a drug on the market’ to explain the low price asked and, in addition, the statue of Juno is cheaper since she is a woman. In 1820, Jefferys Taylor wrote a sprightly version for children in which the sculptor assures Mercury that his statue merely serves as a make-weight when a set of the gods is bought.\n\nIllustrations of the tale, starting from the miniature in the Greek Medici Manuscript of about 1470, invariably feature the god pointing out his statue to the sculptor. An English copper engraving by David Jones for the specially commissioned \"Seven Fables of Aesop\" (1928) shows an up-to-date sculptor at work on the statue. The Australian linocut by John Ryrie is more sly in its updating. The god wears a collar, tie and smart overcoat as he enters into negotiation with the aproned workman. It is only the detail of sandals on his feet and the wings fluttering from beneath the trousers at his ankles that give his identity away.\n\nThe fable is numbered 308 in the Perry Index and is a broad piece of Greek scatalogical humour. There is a poetical version in the Greek of Babrius, but thereafter written accounts do not seem to continue. The Victorian translator of his work, Rev. John Davies, omitted it from his \"Fables of Babrius\" (1860), although the story is harmless enough. A dog of a pious turn of mind salutes the god's four-sided herma, a statue of the kind used to mark boundaries and stages along a road. When the animal announces its intention to anoint him, the god hastily begs it not to and says he does not need to be honoured any further.\n\nThe story is numbered 307 in the Perry Index and there are poetical versions in the Greek of Babrius and the Latin of Avianus, although the latter account is told of Bacchus. The type of statue involved in this case would be of the god as a handsome young man. Two customers approach the statuary, one wishing to place his work in the tomb of his son, one proposing to use it for private worship. Deciding to sleep on the matter, he is visited by Hermes in a dream and is told that he has in his hands the decision to make him either a dead man or a divinity. Although the fable is light-hearted, the 2nd century physician and philosopher, Galen, gave it a more serious turn by applying the story to human potentiality. In a work on ethics, he tells the fable and then continues by commenting that similarly “You have a choice between honouring your soul by making it like the gods and treating it contemptuously by making it like the brute beasts”.\n\nThe fable numbered 99 in the Perry Index was not translated into English until it appeared in the substantial collection of Roger L'Estrange under the title “An image expos’d to sale”.\nA sculptor hawks his newly finished statue at market by declaring that this is a wonder-working god and will profit its owner. When asked why he is selling such a valuable asset, the huckster replies that he is in need of immediate funds while Hermes takes his time in granting favours. Later English versions include \"The Seller of Images\" in George Fyler Townsend's \"Aesop's Fables\" (1867) and V.S. Vernon-Jones' new translation as \"The Image Seller\" in 1912.\n\nThe story is numbered 285 in the Perry Index and was versified in Greek by Babrius, drawing the moral that evil men will only comply when insulted. In this case, the wealth-bringing Hermes does not deliver the expected benefits and his frustrated worshipper smashes the image on the floor. When a flood of gold coins pours from the head, the man reproaches the kind of personality that will not render good for good but does so when ill-treated. While Babrius specifically named the god involved, Hieronymus Osius did not when he versified the fable in Latin, while Pantaleon Candidus specifically states that he does not know in his Latin poem,\"Homo et statua\". Neither did William Caxton and Roger L'Estrange say who it is in their English prose versions, which end with reflections on misdirected worship. Jean de la Fontaine is equally reticent about the god's identity in his \"L’homme et son idole de bois\" (The man and his wooden idol, \"Fables\" IV.8).\n\nIt has been surmised that one explanation for the scepticism of these last two fables was that Hermes was the god of trade and merchants and the Greeks had a certain ambivalence towards wealth making. The 10th century Byzantine Greek lexicon known as the Suda explains what form of statue is involved here. \"They say Hermes was responsible for profit and an overseer of the businesses: consequently they set up the statue of him weighing a purse.\" It is to such sculptures that the statue on the stairs of the Winter Palace of Prince Eugene in Vienna can be referred, although it is itself ambiguous. The sculptor rests with chisel in hand on the statue's right as it looks down towards another similarly dressed individual on the other side who raises his hand towards the god. It might therefore remind viewers of the first of the fables here, which was well known. But it is the purse held well away in the god's right hand which seems to be drawing the gaze of the man below, whose hand is cupped as if in supplication. The statue can therefore be read alternatively as referencing either of the last two fables here.\n"}
{"id": "1999116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999116", "title": "The Tao of Zen", "text": "The Tao of Zen\n\nThe Tao of Zen is a nonfiction book by Ray Grigg, published by Charles E. Tuttle Company in 1994, and reprinted by Alva Press in 1999.\n\nThe work argues that what we recognize as traditional Chinese Ch’an/Japanese Zen Buddhism is in fact almost entirely grounded in Chinese Taoist philosophy, though this fact is well shrouded by the persistence of Mahayana Buddhist institutional trappings. Utilizing an array of scholarly commentary on the two traditions and historical deduction from what can be considered to be the best primary source material available, the author traces the development of Taoism and Buddhism in China and Japan for two millennia. \n\nThe story unfolds in China as Buddhism appears on the scene and is accepted by the Chinese population as a “simplified version of Taoism” that the Western barbarians (subcontinent Indians and Central Asians, e.g. Tibetans, et al.) could understand. They shared many philosophical similarities that made Chinese acclimation to Buddhism much easier – but the more dogmatic ways in which Buddhism was practiced helped it to get the fast track on becoming the predominant religion in China. \n\nIts predisposition to monastic institutionalization throughout the empire allowed it to eventually assimilate and co-opt Taoist perspectives. The dominance of the Ch’an Buddhist tradition was most responsible for this trend. However, when it was eventually exported to Japan, the Taoist strands had the opportunity in a new cultural framework to once again assert themselves. \n\nGrigg is able to trace the submergence and eventual resurgence of Taoism in Japan and the modern West by identifying how its specific tendencies (paradox, nonduality, aversion to institutionalization, emphasis on informal and varied paths to “enlightenment”, focus on the practical matters of influencing the social world, etc.) clearly manifested themselves in very different times and places. \n\nWhat he seeks to do in this book is vindicate the importance of Taoist thought in the Chinese religious history and displace the notion of Zen Buddhism as a coherent whole. To him, these are very different spiritual systems that only coexist today because of the almost wholly unacknowledged lingering of the original Buddhist colonization of Taoist China. The popularity of Zen today owes much more to its persistent Taoist origins than to Buddhist doctrine.\n\n"}

He is remembered as one of the most religious in the history of the \"zaques\", after Idacansás.\n\nIn the centuries before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, the central highlands of Colombia were ruled by \"zaques\" (northern Muisca Confederation) and \"zipas\" (southern territories of the Muisca). The first confirmed human \"zaque\" and \"zipa\" were respectively Hunzahúa and Meicuchuca, inaugurated in 1450. The time before those rulers are based on mythology.\n\nThomagata allegedly had a tail, as that of a jaguar that reached to the ground, hence the name \"Cacique Rabón\" (\"Taily Chief\"). Thomagata had four ears and only one eye because he was blind on the other.\n\nThomagata was a saint, traveling each night between Tunja and the Temple of the Sun in Sugamuxi along the Iraka Valley. His walks were a pilgrimage, ten times back and forth, praying in the sacred sites he encountered on his way. Muisca traditions tell he was so holy that whom he made angry, he converted into a snake, lizard or other animal. Thomagata got this ability from Idacansás and the Sun.\n\nThomagata looked upon his vassals with disrespect and turned them into animals, so the Muisca didn't dare look him in the face. \"Zaque\" Tomaghata never married.\n\nBishop Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita, chronicler of most of the Muisca mythology and traditions, wrote in the 17th century about Thomagata:\n\n...habiéndose inclinado en su mocedad al matrimonio y queriéndolo efectuar, reconoció que estaba inhabilitado para ello porque desagradado el Sol de semejante pretensión y empeñado en que le sucediese en el reino Tutazúa, su hermano, lo despojó la noche antes de la potencia germinativa, por lo cual vivió toda la vida en celibato y después de ciento y tantos años murió...\n\ntranslated as\n...having tended towards marriage in his youth and wanting to carry that out, he recognized that he was unable for that because the Sun was too ambitious and determined that Tutazúa, his brother, would succeed the reign of the zacazgo [\"kingdom\"], [the Sun] deprived him from his genital power so he lived all his life in celibacy and after more than 100 years he died...\nTutazúa succeeded Thomagata as \"cacique\" of Hunza. In the Chibcha language Tutazúa means \"son of the Sun\". The first confirmed human \"zaque\" of the northern Muisca, Hunzahúa, is said to have descended from Thomagata.\n\nThomagata Patera, a volcano on Jupiter's moon Io has been named after Thomagata.\n\n"}

{"id": "28677895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28677895", "title": "Transcendental Meditation technique", "text": "Transcendental Meditation technique\n\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique or TM is a form of silent mantra meditation, developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The meditation practice involves the use of a mantra and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day while sitting with one's eyes closed. It is one of the most-widely practiced, and among the most widely researched meditation techniques, with over 340 peer-reviewed studies published. Beginning in 1965, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been incorporated into schools, universities, corporations, and prison programs in the USA, Latin America, Europe, and India. In 1977, a U.S. district court ruled that a curriculum in TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) being taught in some New Jersey schools was religious in nature and in violation of the First Amendment. However, the technique has since been included in a number of educational and social programs around the world.\n\nThe technique has been described as both religious and non-religious, as an aspect of a new religious movement, as rooted in Hinduism, and as a non-religious practice for self-development. Over its 50-year history the technique has had high visibility in the mass media and effective global propagation, and used celebrity and scientific endorsements as a marketing tool. Advanced courses supplement the TM technique and include an advanced meditation called the TM-Sidhi program. In 1970 the Science of Creative Intelligence, described as \"modern science with ancient Vedic science\", became the theoretical basis for the Transcendental Meditation technique. The Science of Creative Intelligence is a pseudoscience.\n\nThe technique is recommended for 20 minutes twice per day. According to the Maharishi, \"bubbles of thought are produced in a stream one after the other\", and the Transcendental Meditation technique consists of experiencing a \"proper thought\" in its more subtle states \"until its subtlest state is experienced and transcended\". Because it is mantra based, the technique \"ostensibly meets the working definition of a concentration practice\"; however, the TM organization says that \"focused attention\" is not prescribed, and that the \"aim is unified and open attentional stance\". Other authors describe the technique as an easy, natural technique or process, and a \"wakeful hypometabolic physiologic state\". Practice of the technique includes a process called \"unstressing\" which combines \"effortless relaxation with spontaneous imagery and emotion\". TM teachers caution their students not to be alarmed by random thoughts and to \"attend\" to the mantra. Scottish chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson has said that his TM practice gives \"a feeling of serenity, energy and balance\", but does not provide \"any powerful insight into your own mind\". Laura Tenant, a reporter for \"The Independent\", said that her TM experience includes going \"to a place which was neither wakefulness, sleeping or dreaming\", and becoming \"detached from my physical self\". Worldwide, four to ten million people are reported to be practitioners.\n\nThe TM technique consists of silently repeating a mantra with \"gentle effortlessness\" while sitting comfortably with eyes closed and without assuming any special yoga position. The mantra is said to be a vehicle that allows the individual's attention to travel naturally to a less active, quieter style of mental functioning. TM meditators are instructed to keep their mantra secret to ensure maximum results (\"speaking it aloud, apparently defeats the purpose\"), to avoid confusion in the mind of the meditators, and as a \"protection against inaccurate teaching\".\n\nThe Maharishi is reported to have standardized and \"mechanized\" the mantra selection process by using a specific set of mantras and making the selection process \"foolproof\". Professor of psychiatry Norman E. Rosenthal writes that during the training given by a certified TM teacher, \"each student is assigned a specific mantra or sound, with instructions on its proper use\". The Maharishi said that the selection of a proper thought or mantra \"becomes increasingly important when we consider that the power of thought increases when the thought is appreciated in its infant stages of development\". He said that mantras chosen for initiates should \"resonate to the pulse of his thought and as it resonates, create an increasingly soothing influence\", and that the chosen mantra's vibrations \"harmonize\" with the meditator, and suits their \"nature and way of life\". TM students are therefore given a \"specially suited mantra\". Author George D. Chryssides writes that according to the Maharishi, \"using just any mantra can be dangerous\"; the mantras for \"householders\" and for recluses differ. The Transcendental Meditation mantras are appropriate mantras for householders, while most mantras commonly found in books, such as \"Om\", are mantras for recluses and \"can cause a person to withdraw from life\".\n\nFormer TM teacher and author Lola Williamson reports that she told her TM students that their mantra was chosen for them based on their personal interview, while sociologist Roy Wallis, religious scholar J. Gordon Melton and Bainbridge write that the mantras are assigned by age and gender. In 1984, 16 mantras were published in \"Omni\" magazine based on information from \"disaffected TM teachers\". According to Chryssides, TM teachers say that the promised results are dependent on a trained Transcendental Meditation teacher choosing the mantra for their student.\n\nIn his 1963 book \"The Science of Being and Art of Living\", the Maharishi writes that words create waves of vibrations, and the quality of vibration of a mantra should correspond to the vibrational quality of the individual. Likewise, religious studies scholar Thomas Forsthoefel writes, \"the theory of mantras is the theory of sound\". Author William Jefferson writes that the \"euphonics\" of mantras are important. Sociologist Stephen J. Hunt and others say that the mantra used in the Transcendental Meditation technique \"has no meaning\", but that \"the sound itself\" is sacred. In Kerala, India, in 1955, the Maharishi spoke of mantras in terms of personal deities, and according to religious studies scholar Cynthia Ann Humes, similar references can be found in his later works.\n\nAccording to authors Peter Russell and Norman Rosenthal, the sounds used in the technique are taken from the ancient Vedic tradition, have \"no specific meaning\", and are selected for their suitability for the individual. Nevertheless, the Maharishi mentions that sometimes it is beneficial for the Mantra to be associated with a specific meaning in order to suit one’s own private psychological background. Author Lola Williamson writes that the bija, or seed mantras, used in TM come from the Tantric, rather than Vedic tradition, and that bija mantras are \"traditionally associated with particular deities and used as a form of worship\". According to Needleman, many mantras come from the Vedas or Vedic hymns, which are \"the root for all later Hindu scripture\", while the 1977 court case Malnak vs. Yogi accepted the TM mantras as meaningless sounds. Likewise, philosophy of science scholar and former Maharishi International University professor Jonathan Shear writes in his book \"The Experience of Meditation: Experts Introduce the Major Traditions\" that the mantras used in the TM technique are independent of meaning associated with any language, and are used for their mental sound value alone. Fred Travis of the Maharishi University of Management writes in a 2009 article published in the \"International Journal of Psychophysiology\" that \"unlike most mantra meditations, any possible meaning of the mantra is not part of Transcendental Meditation practice\".\n\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique is taught in a standardized seven-step course over six days by a certified TM teacher. Except for a requirement to refrain from using non-prescription drugs for 15 days before learning TM, all who want to learn are taught provided they can pay the course fee, which is $960 for adults and $480 for students. The technique is taught via private and group instruction by a TM teacher trained to instruct students and provide follow up. Instruction is given on separate days, beginning with a one-hour \"introductory lecture\" intended to prepare the student for subsequent steps. The lecture discusses mind potential, social relationships, health, and \"promoting inner and outer peace\". The second step is a 45 minute \"preparatory lecture\", whose topic is the theory of the practice, its origins and its relationship to other types of meditation. This is followed by the third step: a private, ten-minute, personal interview, allowing the TM teacher to get acquainted with the student and answer questions.\n\nAccording to the TM web site, the personal instruction session takes 1–2 hours, and students are required to bring a clean handkerchief, some flowers and fruit, and their course fee. The initiation begins with a short puja ceremony performed by the teacher. The stated purpose of the ceremony is to show honor and gratitude to the lineage of TM \"masters\", or \"Holy Tradition\" that is listed in the Maharishi's translation and commentary of the Bhagavad-Gita. It is regarded as putting students in the right frame of mind to receive the mantra. The ceremony is conducted in a private room with a \"little\" white altar containing incense, camphor, rice, flowers and a picture of Maharishi's teacher, Guru Dev. The initiate observes passively as the teacher recites a text in Sanskrit. After the ceremony, the \"meditators\" are \"invited to bow\", receive their mantra and begin to meditate.\n\nOn the day after the personal instruction session, the student begins a series of three 90 to 120 minute \"teaching sessions\", held on three consecutive days, called \"three days of checking\". Their stated purpose is to \"verify the correctness of the practice\" and to receive further instruction. The first day's checking meeting takes place in a group on the day following personal instruction, and gives information about correct practice based on each student's own experience. The second day of checking uses the same group format, and gives more details of the mechanics of the practice and potential results of the practice, based on student experiences. The third day of checking focuses on subjective growth and the potential development of higher stages of human consciousness, and outlines the follow-up programs available as part of the course. New meditators later return for private follow-up sessions to confirm that they are practicing the technique properly, a process called \"personal checking\". The preferred schedule for follow up classes is 30 minutes, once per week for one month, and once per month thereafter. The purpose of the follow-up, or \"checking sessions\", is to verify the practice, give an opportunity for one-on-one contact with a TM teacher, and to address any problems or questions. Course graduates may access a lifetime follow-up program which includes consultations, \"refresher courses\", advanced lectures and group meditations. Advanced courses include weekend Residence Courses and the TM-Sidhi program.\n\nAccording to the TM organization, TM course fees cover \"initial training and the lifetime follow-up\" program, while helping to \"build and maintain TM centers\" and schools in India and around the world. The fees also reportedly provide TM scholarships for special needs groups, as well as grants and scholarships through TM's Maharishi Foundation, a government approved 501(c)(3) non-profit, educational organization. The fees may \"vary from country to country\", depending on the cost of living, and has changed periodically during the 50 year period it has been taught.\n\nThe Maharishi has drawn criticism from yogis and \"stricter Hindus\" who have accused him of selling \"commercial mantras\". At the same time, the Maharishi's \"promises of better health, stress relief and spiritual enlightenment\" have drawn \"devotees from all over the world\", despite the fees. According to \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World Religions\", by Brandon Toropov and Father Luke Buckles, insistence on fees for TM instruction has caused critics to question the Maharishi's motives; however, \"the movement is not, to all appearances, an exploitive one\".\n\nThe TM-Sidhi program is a form of meditation introduced by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1975. It is based on, and described as a natural extension of the Transcendental Meditation technique. The goal of the TM-Sidhi program is to accelerate personal growth and improve mind-body coordination by training the mind to think from what the Maharishi has described as a fourth major state of consciousness called Transcendental Consciousness.\n\nYogic Flying, a mental-physical exercise of hopping while cross-legged, is a central aspect of the TM-Sidhi program. With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program in 1976 it was postulated that the square root of one percent of the population - that is, at least 0.01% of people in an area - practicing the TM-Sidhi program, together at the same time and in the same place, would increase \"life-supporting trends\" in that given area. This was referred to as the \"Extended Maharishi Effect\". These effects have been examined in 14 published studies, including a gathering of over 4,000 people in Washington DC in the summer of 1993. While empirical studies have been published in peer-reviewed academic journals this research remains controversial and has been characterized as pseudoscience by skeptic James Randi and others.\n\nThe Maharishi began training TM teachers in the early 1960s, and by 1978, there were 7,000 TM teachers in the U.S. In 1985, there were an estimated 10,000 TM teachers worldwide, and by 2003, there were 20,000 teachers, and a reported 40,000 teachers in 2008. Notable individuals trained to teach the Transcendental Meditation technique include Prudence Farrow, John Gray, Mitch Kapor, and Mike Love.\n\nThe first teacher training course was held in India with 30 participants in 1967 and 200 participants in 1970. A four-month teacher training course was also held in the USA that year. The first part was four weeks long and was offered in both Poland, Maine and Humboldt, California with the final three months being held in Estes Park, Colorado. About 300 people completed the training. In 1973, the TM teacher training course consisted of three months in-residence. A 2007 TM web page and 2009 book, report that the TM teacher training course in more modern times consists of six-months in-residence, and includes courses in Maharishi Vedic Science, extended meditation practice and becoming the \"custodian\" for an \"ancient Vedic tradition\". Additionally, TM teachers are trained to speak on the Transcendental Meditation program, teach it to others, provide \"personal checking\" of their student's meditation, create lectures on related topics, organize and lead advanced TM courses and programs. The Maharishi trained his teachers to \"make logical presentations in language suitable to their audiences\", and teachers lead their students through a sequence of predetermined steps.\n\nA 2007 research study reported that details of the training and knowledge imparted to teachers are kept private. In 1976, Janis Johnson wrote in \"The Christian Century\" that TM teachers sign a \"loyalty-oath employment contract\", saying \"It is my fortune, Guru Dev, that I have been accepted to serve the Holy Tradition and spread the Light of God to all those who need it.\" Author William Bainbridge writes that a section of a training bulletin for TM teachers called \"Explanations of the Invocation\" draws a \"connection to Brahma, the Lord of Creation\". A 1993 article in the \"Ottawa Citizen\" reported a partial translation of the puja as \"Whosoever remembers the lotus-eyed Lord gains inner and outer purity. To Lord Naryan, to Lotus-born Brahman the creator, to Vaishistha, to Shakti, to Shankaracharya the emancipator, hailed as Krishna, to the Lord I bow down and down again. At whose door the whole galaxy of gods pray for perfection day and night\".\n\nScientists have been conducting Transcendental Meditation (TM) research since the late 1960s and hundreds of studies have been published. The Transcendental Meditation technique is a specific form of mantra meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and has become one of the most widely researched meditation techniques. TM research has played a role in the history of mind-body medicine and helped create a new field of neuroscience.\n\nEarly studies examined the physiological parameters of the meditation technique. Subsequent research included clinical applications, cognitive effects, mental health, medical costs, and rehabilitation. Beginning in the 1990s, research focused on cardiovascular disease supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. Research reviews of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique have yielded results ranging from inconclusive to clinically significant. More research is needed to determine the therapeutic effects of meditation practices and sources vary regarding their assessment of the quality of research. Some cite design limitations and a lack of methodological rigor, while others assert that the quality is improving and that when suitable assessment criteria are applied, scientific evidence supports the therapeutic value of meditation. Reviewers Canter and Ernst assert that some studies have the potential for bias due to the connection of researchers to the TM organization while TM researchers point to their collaboration with independent researchers and universities as signs of objectivity.\n\nTranscendental Meditation in education (also known as Consciousness-Based Education) is the application of the Transcendental Meditation technique in an educational setting or institution. These educational programs and institutions have been founded in the USA, United Kingdom, Australia, India, Africa and Japan. The Transcendental Meditation technique became popular with students in the 1960s and by the early 1970s centers for the Students International Meditation Society were established at a thousand campuses in the USA with similar growth occurring in Germany, Canada and Britain. The Maharishi International University was established in 1973 in the USA and began offering accredited, degree programs. In 1977 courses in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) were legally prohibited from New Jersey (USA) public high schools on religious grounds by virtue of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. This \"dismantled\" the TM program's use of government funding in U.S. public schools \"but did not constitute a negative evaluation of the program itself\". Since 1979, schools that incorporate the Transcendental Meditation technique using private, non-governmental funding have been reported in the USA, South America, Southeast Asia, Northern Ireland, South Africa and Israel.\n\nA number of educational institutions have been founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Transcendental Meditation movement and its supporters. These institutions include several schools offering public and private secondary education in the USA (Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment), England (Maharishi School), Australia, South Africa (Maharishi Invincibility School of Management), and India (Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools). Likewise, Maharishi colleges and universities have been established including Maharishi European Research University (Netherlands), Maharishi Institute of Management (India), Maharishi University of Management and Technology (India), Maharishi Institute (South Africa) and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic University (India). According to an article in Newsweek, \"critics believe that TM is a repackaged form of Eastern religious philosophy\" and opposed its use in public schools while a member of the Pacific Justice Institute says practicing Transcendental Meditation in public schools with private funding is constitutional.\n\nTranscendental Meditation has been utilized in corporations, both in the U.S.A and in India, under the auspices of the and the Maharishi Development Corporation. As of 2001, USA companies such as General Motors and IBM were subsidizing the TM course fee for their employees. A number of Indian companies provide the TM technique to their managers. These companies include AirTel, Siemens, American Express, SRF Limited, Wipro, Hero Honda, Ranbaxy, Hewlett Packard, BHEL, BPL Group, ESPN Star Sports, Tisco, Eveready, Maruti, Godrej Group and Marico. The \"Sunday Times Herald\" reports that there are \"more than 100 Japanese companies where TM was introduced at induction.\"\n\nThe TM technique has been incorporated in a variety of U.S. social programs for criminals, the homeless and war veterans. In 1979, the TM technique was offered to inmates at Folsom prison, San Quentin and the Deuel Vocational Institute. According to a TM representative, meditation has been included at \"over 25 prisons and correctional institutions\" in the U.S.\n\nIn Senegal, \"more than 11,000 prisoners and 900 correctional officers\" in 34 prisons received instruction in the Transcendental Meditation technique between 1985 and 1987, and the wardens at 31 prisons signed a proclamation recommending that TM be offered throughout the entire system. More recently, the TM technique has been introduced to prisoners in the Oregon Correctional System and a research study is underway to record the effects of the program. Since the late 1980s the TM technique has been offered as part of the programs at Fundacion Hogares Claret sanctuary for homeless and orphaned children in Medellin, Colombia.\n\nIn 1996, several judges of the 22nd Judicial Circuit of St Louis, Missouri, began \"ordering convicted felons\" to attend the Transcendental Meditation course as one of their conditions for parole. The program was administered by the non-profit, Enlightened Sentencing Project and received endorsements from Federal Judge Henry Edward Autrey, and other members of the Missouri District, Federal, and Supreme Courts.\n\nIn 2010, the Doe Fund of New York City began offering the TM technique to its residents, and homeless men were given instruction in the TM technique through an organization called \"Ready, Willing and Able\". In 2010, the Superintendent of Prisons announced that the TM technique was being offered to inmates at the Dominica State Prison. In 2011, the technique was taught to about 65 individuals at the Children of the Night shelter for teen prostitutes in Los Angeles. Psychiatry professor Norman E. Rosenthal says that TM is compatible with most \"drug treatment approaches\" and could be incorporated \"into an overall treatment program\".\n\nThe TM technique was first employed by the military in 1985, when the US Armed Forces conducted \"a small pilot study\" on Vietnam veterans. The Transcendental Meditation technique was taught to military personnel with post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) as part of two research studies conducted at the University of Colorado and Georgetown University in 2010. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it was \"studying the use of transcendental meditation to help returning veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars\" and the Department of Defense funded a $2.4 million grant to Maharishi University of Management Research Institute and the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center to further investigate the potential effect of the TM technique on PTSD. Other initiatives to teach the TM technique to war veterans at risk for PTSD, were underway as of 2010. The technique has been taught to students at Norwich University, a private military academy, as \"part of a long-term study\" on meditation and military performance.\n\nIn his 1963 book, \"The Science Of Being and Art Of Living,\" Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says that, over time, through the practice of the TM technique, the conscious mind gains familiarity with deeper levels of the mind, bringing the subconscious mind within the capacity of the conscious mind, resulting in expanded awareness in daily activity. He also teaches that the Transcendental Meditation practitioner transcends all mental activity and experiences the 'source of thought', which is said to be pure silence, 'pure awareness' or 'transcendental Being', 'the ultimate reality of life'. TM is sometimes self described as a technology of consciousness. Pathologist Vimal Patel, says TM has been shown to produce states that are physiologically different from waking, dreaming and sleeping. According to author Michael Phelan \"The fundamental premise of the psychology of fulfillment is that within every person exists a seemingly inexhaustible center of energy, intelligence, and satisfaction... To the extent that our behavior depends on the degree of energy and intelligence available to us, this center of pure creative intelligence may be described as that resource which gives direction to all that we experience, think and do.\"\n\nAccording to the Maharishi, there are seven levels of consciousness: (i) waking; (ii) dreaming; (iii) deep sleep; (iv) transcendental consciousness; (v) cosmic consciousness; (vi) God consciousness; and, (vii) unity consciousness. The Maharishi says that transcendental consciousness can be experienced through Transcendental Meditation, and that those who meditate diligently could become aware of cosmic consciousness. An indication of cosmic consciousness is \"ever present wakefulness\" that is present even during sleep. Research on long-term TM practitioners experiencing what they describe as cosmic consciousness, has identified unique EEG profiles, muscle tone measurements, and REM indicators that suggest physiological parameters for this self described state of consciousness. However, the Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness notes that it is premature to say that the EEG coherence found in TM is an indication of a higher state of consciousness.\n\nTranscendental Meditation is linked with changes in the states of consciousness of the practitioners. For centuries, mystics and practitioners of meditation have held that people may attain ‘higher’ states of consciousness through meditation techniques. Transcendental Meditation is sometimes associated with what is called ‘a fourth state of consciousness’, which is gained through the practice of meditation, and is therefore termed ‘higher’ and more valuable because repeated experiences presumably enable a person with increased energy, intelligence and satisfaction.\n\nStudies involving the link between transcendental meditation and altered states of consciousness have existed since the beginning of the practice itself. Many early studies have reported brain wave patterns not seen in other states of consciousness. One, for instance, studied four Indian meditators who showed prominent alpha-wave activity in their normal resting periods, and a marked increase in the amplitude of their alpha waves during meditation. In addition, the Japanese neuropsychiatrists Kasamatsu and Hirrai reported the appearance of waves other than alpha in zen meditators within fifty seconds after the beginning of the meditation period.\n\nBloomfield (1975) links the continuous practice of TM with a ‘fourth state of consciousness’ which is different from the waking, sleeping, and dreaming states of consciousness. He claims that the psychophysiological state gained during the practice of TM is so unique that it qualified as a fourth major state of consciousness. He noted that the state had characteristic brain waves, level of Oxygen consumption and blood chemistry, suggesting that this state is distinctly different from waking, dreaming, and sleeping, as well as altered states such as hypnosis or autosuggestion.\n\nIn 1961, the Maharishi created the \"International Meditation Society for the Science of Creative Intelligence\". In 1971 the Maharishi inaugurated \"Maharishi's Year of Science of Creative Intelligence\" and described SCI as the connection of \"modern science with ancient Vedic science\". Author Philip Goldberg describes it as Vedanta philosophy that has been translated into scientific language. A series of international symposiums on the Science of Creative Intelligence were held between 1970 and 1973 and were attended by scientists and \"leading thinkers\", including Buckminster Fuller, Melvin Calvin, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Hans Selye, Marshal McLuhan and Jonas Salk. These symposiums were held at universities such as Humboldt State University and University of Massachusetts. The following year, the Maharishi developed a World Plan to spread his teaching of SCI around the world.\n\nThe theoretical part of SCI is taught in a 33-lesson video course. In the early 1970s the SCI course was offered at more than 25 American universities including Stanford University, Yale, the University of Colorado, the University of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University. Until 2009, Maharishi University of Management (MUM) required its undergraduate students to take SCI classes, and both MUM and Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland have awarded degrees in the field. \"The Independent\" reports that children at Maharishi School learn SCI principles such as \"the nature of life is to grow\" and \"order is present everywhere\". SCI is reported to be part of the curriculum of TM related lower schools in Iowa, Wheaton, Maryland and Skelmersdale, UK. In 1975 SCI was used as the call letters for a TM owned television station in San Bernardino, California.\n\nThe Science of Creative Intelligence is not science. Theologian Robert M. Price, writing in the \"Creation/Evolution Journal\" (the journal of the National Center for Science Education), compares the Science of Creative Intelligence to Creationism. Price says instruction in the Transcendental Meditation technique is \"never offered without indoctrination into the metaphysics of 'creative intelligence'\". Skeptic James Randi says SCI has \"no scientific characteristics.\" Astrophysicist and skeptic Carl Sagan writes that the \"Hindu doctrine\" of TM is a pseudoscience. Irving Hexham, a professor of religious studies, describes the TM teachings as \"pseudoscientific language that masks its religious nature by mythologizing science\". Sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge describe the SCI videotapes as largely based on the Bhagavad Gita, and say that they are \"laced with parables and metaphysical postulates, rather than anything that can be recognized as conventional science\". In 1979, the court case \"Malnak v Yogi\" determined that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions. Maharishi biographer Paul Mason suggests that the scientific terminology used in SCI was developed by the Maharishi as part of a restructuring of his philosophies in terms that would gain greater acceptance and increase the number of people starting the TM technique. He says that this change toward a more academic language was welcomed by many of the Maharishi's American students.\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi claimed that the quality of life would noticeably improve if one percent of the population practiced the Transcendental Meditation technique. This is known as the \"Maharishi effect\" and according to the Maharishi, it was perceived in 1974 after an analysis of crime statistics in 16 cities. Author Ted Karam claims that there have been numerous studies on the Maharishi effect including a gathering of over 4,000 people in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1993. With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program including Yogic Flying, the Maharishi proposed that the square root of 1 percent of the population practicing this advanced program together at the same time and in the same place would create benefits in society. This was referred to as the \"Extended Maharishi Effect\". The TM organization has linked the fall of the Berlin Wall and a reduction in global terrorism, US inflation and crime rates to the Maharishi effect. \n\nThe Maharishi effect has been endorsed by the former President of Mozambique Joaquim Chissano,\n\nThe effect has been examined in 42 scientific studies. Critics, such as James Randi have called this research pseudoscience. Randi says that he investigated comments made by former Maharishi International University faculty member Robert Rabinoff in 1978. He spoke to the Fairfield Chief of Police who said local crime levels were the same and the regional Agriculture Department who reportedly deemed that farm yields for Jefferson County matched the state average.\n\nThe Maharishi proclaimed 1981 as the Year of Vedic Science. Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) is defined by author Patrick Williams as \"a practical, workable Vedic science that is integrated with modern science\" and a \"scientific approach to human development based on complete knowledge and systematic techniques\". It is based on the Maharishi's interpretation of ancient Vedic texts and includes subjective technologies like the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program plus programs like Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV) and Maharishi Vedic Astrology (MVA) services which apply Vedic science to day-to-day living. Vedic science studies the various aspects of life and their relationship to the Veda.\n\nCharacterizations of the TM technique vary amongst scholars, clergy, practitioners and governments. According to the Maharishi his technique requires no preparation, is simple to do, and can be learned by anyone. The technique is described as effortless and without contemplation or concentration Author Peter Russell says trying to control the mind is like trying to go to sleep at night, it won't work. He says instead, the TM technique utilizes the tendency of the mind to move towards greater satisfaction. According to TM advocates, the technique is \"purely a mechanical, physiological process\", the \"two-minute ceremony\" invokes no deities, the mantras are \"sounds without meaning\" and the technique \"pre-dates Hinduism by 5,000 years\". Anthony Campbell, author of the book \"Seven States of Consciousness\", writes that TM requires no \"special circumstances or preparations\" and does \"not depend upon belief\". A 2011 article in \"Details\" characterizes the TM technique as a \"Hindu meditation practice [\"stripped\"] of its religious baggage\" offered \"as a systematic, stress-reducing, creativity-building technique\". Martin Gardner, a mathematician, has referred to TM as \"the Hindu cult\". According to author R.S. Bajpai, the Maharishi \"secularized the TM [\"sic\"] by purging it of all the religious rites and rituals and spiritual mysticism\".\n\nSome religious leaders and clergy find TM to be compatible with their religious teachings and beliefs, while others do not. Wayne Teasdale, a Catholic monk, said that TM \"is what is called an open or receptive method\" that can be described as giving up control and remaining open in an inner sense. In 1968, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, \"came to the support of Maharishi's theory\". William Jefferson wrote in 1976 that a Jewish Revivalist had called TM \"an insidious form of worship\" while Trappist monks in Spencer, Massachusetts, had found it useful. In 1984, Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, wrote a pastoral statement after Ferdinand Marcos, then president of the Philippines, invited more than 1,000 members of the TM movement to Manila, saying that neither the doctrine nor the practice of TM is acceptable to Christians. In 2003, the Roman Curia published a warning against mixing eastern meditations, such as TM, with Christian prayer, though a 2013 statement suggests that eastern meditations can be useful. Clergy who practice the TM technique and find it compatible with their religious beliefs include: Catholic priest Len Dubi; Orthodox rabbi Abe Shainberg; Irish Jesuit William Johnston; Donald Craig Drummond, a Presbyterian minister; Raphael Levine, the emeritus rabbi of Temple De Hirsh Sinai; Placide Gaboury, a Jesuit priest who teaches at the University of Sudbury; Kevin Joyce, a Catholic priest; and Keith Wollard, a United Church minister.\n\nLay celebrities who have practiced the technique include David Lynch, who was raised a Presbyterian, and Clint Eastwood who says he found \"there were no religious aspects\", comedian Andy Kaufman, political commentator and Roman Catholic Andrew Sullivan, Jerry Seinfeld, who has been practicing the technique for 40 years, and Pulitzer Prize winning music critic Tim Page. Once asked if TM could substitute for religion, musician George Harrison replied that \"It's not a substitute for religion. It is a religion.\" According to John Lennon, \"You can make it with meditation if you're a Christian, a Mohammedan or a Jew. You just add meditation to whatever religion you've got.\"\n\nThe technique has been variously described by sociologists and religious scholars as religious and non-religious. Its adherents says it is a non-religious, \"scientific strategy\", yet it appears to have \"spiritual elements\" such as the puja ceremony performed during the TM instruction. Religious studies scholar Eugene V. Gallagher writes that, \"practitioners describe TM as a science rather than a religious discipline\", but its \"principles were clearly derived from Hindu practice\".\n\nIn the book \"Cults and new religious movements\", author Roy Wallis characterizes TM as a \"world affirming new religion\" that \"lacks most of the features traditionally associated with religion\". Liebler and Moss write that \"unlike some forms of meditation, the TM technique does not require adherence to any belief system\". Religious studies scholars Michael Phelan, James R. Lewis and Tamar Gablinger say that TM participants \"may meditate for relaxation, but otherwise have no contact with TM\", and that TM \"attracts a large number of people with low levels of commitment around a much smaller group of highly committed followers.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Bainbridge finds TM to be a \"... highly simplified form of Hinduism, adapted for Westerners who did not possess the cultural background to accept the full panoply of Hindu beliefs, symbols, and practices\", and describes the TM puja ceremony as \"... in essence, a religious initiation ceremony\". Metropolitan Maximos of Pittsburgh of the Greek Orthodox Church describes TM as \"a new version of Hindu Yoga\" based on \"pagan pseudo-worship and deification of a common mortal, Guru Dev\".\n\nIn the book \"Cults and new religions\", Cowan and Bromley write that TM is presented to the public as a meditation practice that has been validated by science, but is not a religious practice nor is it affiliated with a religious tradition. They say that \"although there are some dedicated followers of TM who devote most or all of their time to furthering the practice of Transcendental Meditation in late modern society, the vast majority of those who practice do so on their own, often as part of what has been loosely described as the New Age Movement.\" They say that most scholars view TM as having elements of both therapy and religion, but that it \"has no designated scripture, no set of doctrinal requirements, no ongoing worship activity, and no discernible community of believers.\" They also say that Maharishi did not claim to have special divine revelation or supernatural personal qualities.\n\nGeorge D. Chryssides and Margaret Z. Wilkins write in \"A reader in new religious movements\" that TM and other new religious movements have been criticized for \"surreptitiously smuggling in forms of Eastern religion under the guise of some seemingly innocuous technique of self improvement or health promotion\". Chryssides went on to say in \"Exploring new religions\" that although one can identify the yogi's Hindu background, Hindu lineage, mantras and initiation ceremony, TM is unlike religion in its \"key elements\": \"there is no public worship, no code of ethics, no scriptures to be studied, and no rites of passage that are observed, such as dietary laws, giving to the poor, or pilgrimages.\" Psychiatry professor Norman E. Rosenthal, author of \"\", wrote that \"Maharishi extracted the TM technique from its religious context and distilled it to its essence, which he believed could be of value to people of all creeds.\"\n\nIn 1968, the yogi conducted a one-hour meeting with Secretary General of the United Nations U Thant. In the 1970s, courses in the TM technique were conducted at 47 military installations around the world (including eight in the U.S.), with 150 enrolling in the course at the West Point military academy. The TM technique was also taught at five U.S. federal prisons, and three in Germany and Canada. During this period, ten U.S. senators and more than 100 Congressional staff members learned the technique. In 1972, the Maharishi met with the Governor of Illinois (Daniel Walker) and received a standing ovation when he addressed the Illinois state legislature before they passed a resolution characterizing Maharishi's Science of Creative Intelligence as useful for Illinois public schools. In 1974, TM was cited in two Congressional records regarding the SCI course being offered at 30 American universities and the technique being \"in use\" in some American prisons, mental institutions and drug rehabilitation centers.\n\nIn 1975, the yogi met with Pierre Trudeau to discuss \"the possibility of structuring an ideal society\" through TM, In 1977 a U.S. district court in New Jersey held that a curriculum comprising the Science of Creative Intelligence and TM was religious in nature (\"Malnak v Yogi\"). The decision was appealed and in 1979 the 3rd Circuit opinion affirmed the decision and held that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those of well-recognized religions and it therefore violated the Establishment Clause. Beginning in 1979 the German government released a number of booklets about problems arising for seven new religious movements in Germany, with the German term for these organizations variously translated as \"psychogroups\" and \"psychotheraphy groups\". These organizations, including TM, filed lawsuits trying to block the reports. The courts ruled that the booklets must only include factual information and exclude speculation, rumors, and matters that are unclear, and the booklets were re-released primarily containing quotations from materials of the organizations themselves. In 1996 a commission appointed by the German government concluded that new religious movements and \"psychotherapy groups\" did not present any danger to the state or to society. In 1987, an Israeli government report defined TM as a \"cult group ... targeted by anti-cult activists\". The 1995 report of the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France included Transcendental Meditation in its list of cults. The U.S. government has characterized the Transcendental Meditation technique as worthy of research and has awarded more than $25 million in funding from different branches of the National Institutes of Health for scientific analysis of the effects of TM on high blood pressure. The U.S. United States Department of Veterans Affairs sees it as a potential tool for the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and commenced research on the technique (and two other meditation systems) in 2012. According to Patrick Gresham Williams, \"the government will pay\" for any U.S. veteran to learn TM if it is prescribed by a Veterans Administration medical doctor.\n\n"}

{"id": "27562382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27562382", "title": "White Horse Prophecy", "text": "White Horse Prophecy\n\nThe White Horse Prophecy is the popular name given an influential but disputed version given by \nEdwin Rushton, in about 1900, of statements supposedly made in 1843 by Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, on the future of the Latter Day Saints (popularly called Mormons) and the United States.\n\nThe Latter Day Saints, according to Rushton's version, would \"go to the Rocky Mountains and... be a great and mighty people,\" associated in the prophecy's figurative language, with one of the biblical four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelation. \n\nSmith's supposed original statement predicts that the US Constitution will one day \"hang like a thread\" but be saved by Latter-day Saints. The embellished version portrays it to be \"by the efforts of the White Horse.\"\n\nOn the basis of either Rushton's version, which is widely known as \"the White Horse Prophecy,\" or Smith's original statement, both some critics of Mormonism and some Mormon folk doctrine enthusiasts hold that Mormons should or actually expect that the US will eventually become a theocracy dominated by the LDS Church. However, some observers interpret the Mormon cultural artifact more blandly.\n\nThe idea that members of the LDS Church will someday or at various times take action to save an imperiled US Constitution has been referenced by numerous of LDS Church leaders, but as to the Rushton version of the Prophecy, the LDS Church has stated that \"the so-called 'White Horse Prophecy'... is not embraced as Church doctrine; while numerous Mormon fundamentalists continue to preach the doctrine.\"\n\nLatter Day Saint Church founder Joseph Smith went to Washington, DC, in November 1839 in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain help for his persecuted followers. Pat Bagley of the \"Salt Lake Tribune\" wrote that from then on, Smith and his followers \"considered themselves the last Real Americans\" and \"the legitimate heirs of the pilgrims and Founding Fathers,\" who would be called upon one day to save the US Constitution. Smith is believed to have said in 1840 that when the Constitution hung by a thread, Latter Day Saint elders would step in \"on the white horse\" to save the country.\n\nJoseph Smith is said to have made his statement in early May 1843, while the Latter Day Saints were headquartered in Nauvoo, Illinois. One of Smith's associates who heard the statement was Edwin Rushton. The most complete copy of Rushton's version of Joseph Smith's statement is contained in a 1902 diary entry made by John Roberts of Paradise, Utah. That rendering asserted that in his statement, Smith had prophesied that the Mormons \"will go to the Rocky Mountains and will be a great and mighty people established there, which I will call the White Horse of peace and safety.\" Smith added \"I shall never go there\" and predicted continued persecution by enemies of the church, and he reportedly said, \"You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber... I love the Constitution; it was made by the inspiration of God; and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse, and by the Red Horse who will combine in its defense.\" Smith also said, according to the diary, that Mormons would send missionaries to \"gather the honest in heart from among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God.\" The account quotes Smith as predicting numerous wars involving Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and other countries, and saying that the European nobility \"knows that [Mormonism] is true, but it has not pomp enough, and grandeur and influence for them to yet embrace it.\" He is also reported to have said that a temple that the Latter Day Saints had planned to build in Jackson County, Missouri \"will be built in this generation.\"\n\nIn 1844, Smith rejected the platforms of the major candidates for president of the United States and decided to conduct his own third-party campaign which was cut short by his murder on June 27 that year. After a succession crisis in which Brigham Young was accepted as Smith's successor by the majority of the Latter Day Saints, the Mormon migration to the Intermountain West began, under Young's direction, in February 1846.\n\nThe authenticity of the White Horse Prophecy is much disputed. Most of its symbolistic content was not attested to during Smith's lifetime but was instead asserted by Rushton many years after Smith's death. Whereas a philosophical kernel in Rushton's version is confirmed by contemporary LDS Church leaders as having been taught by Smith, Rushton's formulation, as a whole, has often been repudiated by the LDS Church over the years since as early as 1918. An analysis of the White Horse Prophesy was included, along with mentions of its questioned authenticity, as an appendix within \"Prophecy: Key to the Future,\" by scriptural scholar and lay theologian Duane Crowther in 1962; and, more recently, the Prophecy has been referenced in the writings of speculative theology by the Mormon fundamentalist Ogden Kraut.\n\nIn 1918, LDS president Joseph F. Smith dismissed the White Horse Prophecy as a \"ridiculous story... and a lot of trash that has been circulated about... by two of our brethren who put together some broken sentences from [Joseph Smith] that they may have heard from time to time.\" In his 1966 book \"Mormon Doctrine\", LDS theologian (and later apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote, \"From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should know better than to believe or spread such false information. One of these false and deceptive documents that has cropped up again and again for over a century is the so-called White Horse Prophecy.\"\n\nIn early 2010, the LDS Church issued a statement stating that \"the so-called 'White Horse Prophecy' is based on accounts that have not been substantiated by historical research and is not embraced as Church doctrine.\" Also in 2010, LDS historian Don L. Penrod examined significant differences in two early handwritten accounts of the prophecy, noted some words and phrases that were not characteristic of Joseph Smith's speaking style or current in his time, and speculated that Rushton had \"in his elderly years recorded some things that [Smith] actually said, mixing in words of his own creation.\" It additionally noted that \"memories of words and events, especially many years later, are often faulty.\"\n\nSeveral sources attribute to Smith the idea that the US Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings about the Constitution.\n\nIn 1855, Brigham Young reportedly wrote that \"when the Constitution of the United States hangs, as it were, upon a single thread, they will have to call for the 'Mormon' Elders to save it from utter destruction; and they will step forth and do it.\"\n\nIn 1858, Orson Hyde, another contemporary of Smith, wrote that Smith believed \"the time would come when the Constitution and the country would be in danger of an overthrow; and... if the Constitution be saved at all, it will be by the elders of [the LDS] Church.\"\n\nIn 1922, the LDS Church's fifth presiding bishop, Charles W. Nibley, stated that \"the day would come when there would be so much of disorder, of secret combinations taking the law into their own hands, tramping upon Constitutional rights and the liberties of the people, that the Constitution would hang as by a thread. Yes, but it will still hang, and there will be enough of good people, many who may not belong to our Church at all, people who have respect for law and for order, and for Constitutional rights, who will rally around with us and save the Constitution.\"\n\nIn 1928, the LDS apostle Melvin J. Ballard remarked that \"the prophet Joseph Smith said the time will come when, through secret organizations taking the law into their own hands... the Constitution of the United States would be so torn and rent asunder, and life and property and peace and security would be held of so little value, that the Constitution would, as it were, hang by a thread. This Constitution will be preserved, but it will be preserved very largely in consequence of what the Lord has revealed and what [the Mormons], through listening to the Lord and being obedient, will help to bring about, to stabilize and give permanency and effect to the Constitution itself. That also is our mission.\"\n\nIn 1942, J. Reuben Clark, an LDS apostle and a member of the church's First Presidency, said that \"You and I have heard all our lives that the time may come when the Constitution may hang by a thread... I do know that whether it shall live or die is now in the balance.\" On the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its \"free institutions,\" separation of powers, and the Bill of Rights. He added that \"if we are to live as a Church, and progress, and have the right to worship... we must have the great guarantees that are set up by our Constitution.\"\n\nIn a 1986 Brigham Young University speech, LDS president Ezra Taft Benson stated, \"I have faith that the Constitution will be saved as prophesied by Joseph Smith. But it will not be saved in Washington. It will be saved by the citizens of this nation who love and cherish freedom. It will be saved by enlightened members of this Church – men and women who will subscribe to and abide by the principles of the Constitution.\"\n\nIn 2010, Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke at a Constitution Day Celebration and warned about the importance of preserving the US Constitution. To that end, he claimed that \"all citizens—whatever their religious or philosophical persuasion\" should maintain several responsibilities regarding the Constitution: understand it, support the law, practice civic virtue, maintain civility in political discourse, and promote patriotism.\n\nQuestions on LDS attitudes towards the United States government, whether they are considered on their own or as parts of the White Horse Prophecy, have arisen from time to time as prominent Latter-day Saints have become involved in American politics. The White Horse Prophecy has been characterized as \"effectively plac[ing] believers on perpetual Red Alert for the Constitution's possible demise\" and as admonishing Mormons to \"come to the rescue and restore the true Constitution by any means necessary.\"\n\nWriters such as Richard Abanes and Elaine Wolff have speculated, on the basis of the prophecy, that Mormons expect that the US will eventually become a \"Mormon-ruled theocracy divinely ordained to 'not only direct the political affairs of the Mormon community, but eventually those of the United States and ultimately the worldk'\" and that \"a Mormon, if he were elected president, would take his orders from Salt Lake City.\"\n\nBesides many LDS members of the Republican Party, some LDS Democrats have also been inspired to run for office by the White Horse Prophecy.\n\nIn 1967, US presidential candidate George W. Romney said the following on the White Horse Prophecy: \"I have always felt that they meant that sometime the question of whether we are going to proceed on the basis of the Constitution would arise and at this point government leaders who were Mormons would be involved in answering that question.\" In 2007, US presidential candidate Mitt Romney, George's son, told the \"Salt Lake Tribune\", \"I haven't heard my name associated with [the White Horse Prophecy] or anything of that nature. That's not official church doctrine... I don't put that at the heart of my religious belief.\"\n\nConservative media figure Glenn Beck, who joined the LDS Church in 1999, has alleged that President Barack Obama \"is going to bring us to the verge of shredding the Constitution, of massive socialism.\" On November 14, 2008, after Obama's election, Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and said that \"we are at the place where the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up.\" Earlier in November, while interviewing US Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, also a Mormon, Beck had remarked, \"I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread.\" Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring, \"I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread.\"\n\nLDS blogger and religious commentator Joanna Brooks has said that \"it is likely that Beck owes his brand of Founding Father–worship to Mormonism... Many Mormons also believe that Joseph Smith prophesied in 1843 that the US Constitution would one day 'hang by a thread' and be saved by faithful Mormons.\" \"Washington Post\" journalist Dana Milbank has described Beck's views as essentially \"White Horse Prophecy meets horsemen of the apocalypse,\" but Milbank has also observed that the White Horse Prophecy is \"actually a fairly benign prophecy. They're talking about restoring law and order and peace and tranquility. It doesn't sound like a violent thing.\"\n\nIn 2009, Idaho gubernatorial candidate Rex Rammell announced plans to hold a series of meetings with believing Mormon men, which were to include discussion of the White Horse Prophecy. In response, LDS Church officials issued a statement that said that the church is \"politically neutral\" and hoped that \"the campaign practices of political candidates would not suggest that their candidacy is supported by or connected to the church.\"\n\nRammell later retracted his original plan to limit his meetings to LDS men and apologized to \"all those citizens who are not members of the LDS faith, who have expressed a sincere interest in attending my meetings and discussing this prophecy and how we can step forward and save the United States Constitution.\"\n\n"}

In response, B.o.B released a similar diss track, entitled \"No Future\" that also references Tyler's group, Odd Future. Tyler praised the song, and initially did not think it was a diss track. Bruno Mars, in response to the verse \"stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\", said, \"[Tyler] has to wait in line if he wants to stab me...[Tyler's] definitely not the first guy that's said something like that to me and he's not going to be the last.\" The late American rapper Capital Steez sampled it in his song \"Negus\", using the same opening line: \"I'm a fucking walking paradox\".\n\nThe music video for \"Yonkers\" was released on February 10, 2011 on the official Odd Future YouTube channel.\n\nThe video is shot in black-and-white using a perspective control lens.

Claire Suddath of \"Time\" named \"Yonkers\" the eighth best song of 2011, describing it as \"minimalistic rap\" and \"a piece of performance art\", concluding that \"'Yonkers' creates a thrilling sense of uneasiness that the music world hadn't seen since the early days of punk.\" \"Pigeons and Planes\" named the single the twenty-first best song of 2011. \"XXL\" named it the twenty-second best song of 2011, noting that \"Yonkers\", the single's video, and his performance of \"Sandwitches\" on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", propelled him to stardom. \"Rolling Stone\" named the song the twenty-third best single of 2011, stating that Tyler \"stabs Bruno Mars and disses Jesus\", although \"somehow, all the bad vibes are mesmerizing.\"\n\nAll songs written and produced by Tyler, the Creator (T.
