He introduced to the church the anaphoras of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius beside the more ancient liturgical rite of Addai and Mari. Though his tenure as catholicos saw Christians in the region threatened during the Persian-Roman wars and attempts by both Sassanid Persian and Byzantine rulers to interfere with the governance of the church, his reign is reckoned a period of consolidation, and a synod he held in 544 as (despite excluding the Diocese of Merv) instrumental in unifying and strengthening the church. He is thought to have written and translated a number of religious works. After his death in February 552, the faithful carried his casket from his simple home across the Tigris to the monastery of Mar Pithyon.\n\nAba is a highly regarded and significantly venerated saint in the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, and the Chaldean Catholic Church, which has named a seminary in San Diego, California, USA, after him. His feast day is celebrated on both the seventh Friday after Epiphany and on February 28.\n\nHe is documented in the \"Ausgewählte Akten Persischer Märtyrer\", and \"The Lesser Eastern Churches\", two biographies of Eastern saints.\n\nBorn in a Zoroastrian family of Persian origin in Hala, Mesopotamia. Mar Aba was secretary to the governor of Beth Garmai province before he converted to Christianity, studied, and later taught at the School of Nisibis. Highly regarded as a scholar, he studied Greek in Edessa and is attributed with the translation (or with having overseen the translation) of key texts, including the works of Theodore and Nestorius, from Greek into Syriac. He is also remembered as the author of original works including Biblical commentaries, homilies, and synodal letters.\n\nHe favoured the Biblical interpretation and commentaries of Theodore of Mopsuestia, at the time a controversial position: the Byzantine emperor Justinian attempted to meet with Mar Aba around 532 (before his installation as patriarch) to persuade him to denounce Theodore's teachings. Justinian was preparing to anathematize Theodore and his works, obviously in sharp opposition to Mar Aba's own views. Acquiescence to Justinian's demands would also have been politically undesirable for Mar Aba, whose Church of the East had secured independence from the Christian west (which Justinian represented) at the Council of Dadisho in 424. Mar Aba was not at the meeting.\n\nAba's tenure as catholicos followed a 15-year period of schism within the church, during which remote areas had elected their own rival bishops. Aba was able to resolve this schism, visiting the disputed areas and negotiating agreements to reunite the church. In 544, he convened a synod to ratify these agreements; the synod agreed that the metropolitans of those regions under the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon would, in the future, elect catholicoi at formal meetings. This agreement was, however, substantially subverted in later years, not least when the Persian ruler Khosrau I influenced the selection of Joseph, Aba's successor as catholicos.\n\nThe acts of the synod also documented an \"orthodoxy of faith\", written by Aba himself. Some of its prescriptions indicate the particularly Persian character of the church in the East, including a set of marriage rules prohibiting unions between close kin, apparently formulated in deliberate response to Zoroastrian practice.\n\nTensions between the Persian and Byzantine empires ran high during Mar Aba's lifetime, and, after hostilities between the two intensified in the 540s, persecution of Christians in Persia became more common. Zoroastrians hostile to Aba as an apostate pressured Khosrau to act against him, and, as punishment for proselytizing among the Zoroastrians, Aba was placed under house arrest and eventually exiled to Adurbadagan (Azarbaijan). He was allowed to return to the See after seven years and continued as Catholicos until 552, when he died — in some accounts, as a result of torture and exposure inflicted during his imprisonment.\n\nThe first seminary of the Chaldean Catholic Church outside of Iraq was established in July 2008 in El Cajon, San Diego, as the Seminary of Mar Abba the Great.\n\n"}

Jenson also served the church as president of the Scandinavian Mission.\n\nAnders Jensen was born in Torslev parish, Hjørring, Denmark. His parents joined the LDS Church when he was four. He left Denmark for the United States in 1866. He traveled across the North American Great Plains in Andrew H. Scott's ox company. On coming to Utah Territory he anglicized his name to \"Andrew Jenson\" and settled in the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nIn 1873, Jenson was ordained a seventy in the LDS Church by George Q. Cannon and sent on a mission to Denmark. In 1876, he translated the history of Joseph Smith into Danish. Jenson served a second mission to Denmark from 1879 to 1881. While in Denmark, Jenson established a monthly periodical called \"Morgenstjernen\", which he continued to publish in Utah after his return. After eight years, the periodical changed its name to the \"Historical Record\" and was published in English.\n\nIn 1886, Jenson became a part-time employee of the LDS Church, receiving a small monthly allowance. His assignments included conducting interviews and gathering photographs, historic documents, and other documentation during a trip to historic church sites in the eastern United States. Jenson also gathered similar documents from various church stakes and missions throughout the church, which led to the writing of a manuscript history for each LDS Church ward and stake. Jenson was appointed as a full-time Assistant Church Historian in 1897. Along with John Jaques, Jenson was the Acting Church Historian from 1899 until the appointment of Anthon H. Lund as Church Historian in 1900. Jenson would continue on again as Assistant Church Historian until his death.\n\nDuring his time in the Church Historian's office, Jenson was a prolific writer, presenting the history of the Latter-day Saints from an orthodox perspective. He was also a remarkable archivist of historical material and continued to collect records and diaries for the Church Historian's office.\n\nJenson compiled the four-volume \"Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia\", a church chronology and an early Latter-day Saint biographical dictionary. He was also closely involved with the compilation of the \"Journal History of the Church\", which has been described by Utah historiographer Gary Topping as \"...an immense scrapbook compilation consisting of several hundred volumes of various historical records (in its later years mostly newspaper clippings) documenting Mormon history from the beginning of the church until well into the twentieth century.\" Jenson's contribution included its chronological organization and a running subject index on thousands of index cards. He also compiled the \"Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\". Among the men he worked with in Church Historian's office was Joseph Fielding Smith, who later served as Church Historian and eventually as President of the Church.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Jenson collected all the records he could find concerning the Mountain Meadows massacre. This archive including his own field notes, excerpts of witnesses' diaries, affidavits, newspaper reports, and the transcriptions from the LDS Church's internal investigations. Many participants in the massacre were granted complete confidentiality for the contents of these interview transcriptions. Since Jenson's time, these files were closed to the public and were not available for use by historians. However, in August 2008, LDS historians Ronald W. Walker, Richard E. Turley Jr., and Glen M. Leonard published \"Massacre at Mountain Meadows\" through Oxford University Press. A decade in the making, research for the book finally draws from the Jenson archive.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1236579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1236579", "title": "Bishop (Latter Day Saints)", "text": "Bishop (Latter Day Saints)\n\nBishop is the highest priesthood office of the Aaronic priesthood in the Latter Day Saint movement. It is almost always held by one who already holds the Melchizedek priesthood office of high priest. The Latter Day Saint concept of the office differs significantly from the role of bishops in other Christian denominations, being in some respects more analogous to a pastor or parish priest. Each bishop serves with two counselors, which together form a bishopric.\n\nThe role of a bishop varies in the different Latter Day Saint denominations; however, they derive from a common history.\n\nEdward Partridge became the first man called to the office of bishop in the early Latter Day Saint church on February 4, 1831. The duties of the office were to oversee the temporal affairs and accounts of the church through the implementation of the law of consecration. Partridge was called to preside over the Missouri church in Joseph Smith's absence and soon thereafter Partridge and his family emigrated to the church's growing colony in Jackson County, Missouri, where he continued to act as bishop of the branch of the church. Newel K. Whitney was then called as a bishop to oversee the temporal affairs of the church in Kirtland, Ohio.\n\nWhen the Latter Day Saints were headquartered in Nauvoo, Illinois, the membership was separated into three \"wards\" or geographical precincts (\"Upper,\" \"Middle\" and \"Lower\"), and a bishop was called to oversee the temporal affairs of each ward. Partridge presided over the \"Upper Ward,\" Whitney presided over the \"Middle Ward\" and Vinson Knight presided over the \"Lower Ward.\" Over time in the church's history, the position of Presiding Bishop was created. Partridge is considered the church's \"First Presiding Bishop\", although neither he nor his contemporaries saw him as a superior to other bishops of the church in that time period.\n\nAfter the 1844 succession crisis, the offices of bishop and presiding bishop developed separately in the various resulting denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\nAccording to Latter Day Saint scripture, a bishop in the church does not need to be a high priest nor does he need counselors if he is a Levite and a direct descendant of Aaron, the brother of Moses. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), apostle Joseph Fielding Smith taught that this provision applied only to the Presiding Bishop of the church and not to bishops of wards.\n\nThe Presiding Bishop of the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, W. Kevin Romer, is recognized as a “literal descendant of Aaron” and holds the title of Aaronic High Priest.\n\nIn the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), bishops are called from among the members of a local congregation, known as a ward, and traditionally serve, without pay, for four to seven years (the length of service varies). A bishop must be a married high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood. The bishop acts as the presiding high priest of the ward. A bishop simultaneously serves as the president of the Aaronic priesthood and president of the priests quorum in the ward. In a branch, the branch president fulfills the same functions as a bishop; however, a branch president does not need to be a high priest. \n\nThe bishop is often called \"the father of the ward\" as he is the priesthood leader who is most intimately involved with individual church members. The bishop is not paid for the time he devotes to his position. All local positions in the LDS Church operate as a lay ministry; members donate their time to perform the duties assigned with each calling. Each bishop serves with two counselors, which together form a bishopric. The counselors to a bishop are generally high priests, but there are exceptions, such as in a singles ward, where the counselors may be elders.\n\nThe immediate priesthood leader of the bishop is the stake president, who provides direction, training and counsel to the bishops of the wards within his stake boundaries; the stake president is assisted in these duties by two counselors and the stake high council. New bishops are recommended by the stake president, but each bishop is formally approved by and called in writing by the church's First Presidency. Prior to ordination, the proposed ordination of a bishop must also be accepted by common consent by the members of the ward.\n\nThe bishop holds the primary responsibility for everything in the ward, both spiritually and temporally. Although he can delegate specific assignments to his counselors, the ultimate responsibility falls to him. His duties include presiding over and conducting meetings and worship services; serving as president of the ward's quorum of priests; acting as a \"judge in Israel\" or \"common judge\"; providing temporary financial relief for ward members; serving as the presiding high priest of the ward; and organizing and managing the ward's auxiliary organizations. After being called, a bishop is ordained a high priest (if he does not already hold that priesthood office) and then ordained a bishop and set apart as the bishop and presiding high priest of the specific ward. He is also given the priesthood \"keys\" which authorize him to serve as a representative for the Lord in performing his duties. The ordinations, setting apart, and the conferral of keys is performed by the laying on of hands by the stake president. After a bishop is released from his responsibilities over the ward, he retains the priesthood office of bishop for life.\n\n\nIn small congregations that are not large enough to be a ward, a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood is usually called to be a branch president. In rare instances where no worthy Melchizedek priesthood holder is available, a priest in the Aaronic priesthood may instead be called as the branch president. The branch president generally has the same responsibilities as a bishop and is assisted by two counselors. A branch president and his counselors may or may not be a high priest, and a branch president is not ordained to the priesthood office of bishop.\n\nThe LDS Church also has a Presiding Bishopric which oversees the temporal affairs of the church (including its Welfare Services) and provides assistance and instruction to the various bishoprics worldwide.\n\nThe calling of \"traveling bishop\" was prominent during the early Utah period of church history. Traveling bishops were not assigned to a specific congregation, but were tasked to visit various wards and branches to take care and supervise over temporal matters.\n\nIn many ways bishops of the Community of Christ continue to resemble those found in the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith. They are not pastors or branch presidents, but financial officers and ministers of stewardship. While in theory a literal descendant of Aaron could hold this office, no such claim has ever been made, and therefore all bishops are members of the high priesthood, as a high priest can serve in any \"lesser office\". All bishops are members of the Order of Bishops, with presidency vested in the Presiding Bishopric (consisting of the Presiding Bishop and two counselors). \n\nWhile all bishops are attached to a congregation (in the sense that every member of the church has a home congregation), bishops are not congregational officers, but preside as financial officers over larger jurisdictions, or support those who do. For example, each mission center will have a bishop in charge of all the finances of that area, who may or may not be assisted by other bishops. Likewise, some nations have a national bishop, and, historically, stakes also had bishops. Consequently, this makes the office of bishop somewhat uncommon. In recent years, some mission centers have had multiple bishops in order to help promote the various ministries associated with good stewardship. \n\nOther bishops have been appointed as \"field bishops\" who are assigned to assist one of the twelve apostles. The Presiding Bishopric is also regarded as the presidency of the entire Aaronic priesthood. Bishops in general are therefore sometimes seen as ideal resources to provide support and mentoring to local members of the Aaronic priesthood.\n\n"}
{"id": "373023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=373023", "title": "Brahmacharya", "text": "Brahmacharya\n\nBrahmacharya (; Devanagari: ब्रह्मचर्य) is a concept within Indian religions that literally means \"conduct consistent with Brahma\". \n\nIn one context, \"brahmacharya\" is the first of four \"ashrama\" (age-based stages) of a human life, with \"grihastha\" (householder), \"vanaprastha\" (forest dweller), and \"sannyasa\" (renunciation) being the other three \"asramas\". The \"brahmacharya\" (bachelor student) stage of life – from childhood up to twenty-five years of age – was focused on education and included the practice of celibacy. In this context, it connotes chastity during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a \"guru\" (teacher), and during later stages of life for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation (Sanskrit: \"moksha\").\n\nIn another context, \"brahmacharya\" is the virtue of celibacy when unmarried and fidelity when married. It represents a virtuous lifestyle that also includes simple living, meditation and other behaviors.\n\nIn the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monastic traditions, \"brahmacharya\" implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage. It is considered necessary for a monk's spiritual practice. Western notions of the religious life as practiced in monastic settings mirror these characteristics.\n\nThe word \"brahmacharya\" stems from two Sanskrit roots:\n\nIn ancient and medieval era Indian texts, the term \"brahmacharya\" is a concept with a more complex meaning indicating an overall lifestyle conducive to the pursuit of sacred knowledge and spiritual liberation. \"Brahmacharya\" is a means, not an end. It usually includes cleanliness, ahimsa, simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods, intoxicants, and behaviors (including sexual behavior).\n\n\"Brahmacharya\" is traditionally regarded as one of the five yamas in Yoga, as declared in verse 2.30 of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. It is a form of self-restraint regarded as a virtue, and an observance recommended depending on an individual's context. For a married practitioner it means marital fidelity (not cheating on one's spouse); for a single person it means celibacy. Sandilya Upanishad includes \"brahmacharya\" as one of ten yamas in Chapter 1, defining it as \"refraining from sexual intercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech or body\".\n\nPatanjali in verse 2.38 states that the virtue of brahmacharya leads to the profit of \"virya\" (वीर्य). This Sanskrit word, \"virya\", has been variously translated as virility and, by Vyasa, as strength and capacity. Vyasa explains that this virtue promotes other good qualities. Other ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism describe the fruits of this virtue differently. For example, Pada Chandrika, Raja Marttanda, Sutrartha Bodhini, Mani Prabha and Yoga Sudhakara each state that \"brahmacharya\" must be understood as the voluntary restraint of power. Chandogya Upanishad in verses of chapter 8.5 extols \"brahmacharya\" as a sacrament and sacrifice which, once perfected, leads to realization of the soul or Self (Atman), and thereafter becomes the habit of experiencing the soul in others and everything. Tattva Vaisharadi and Yoga Sarasangraha assert that \"brahmacharya\" leads to and increase in \"jñana-shakti\" (power of knowledge) and \"kriya-shakti\" (power of action).\n\nThe great epic Mahabharata describes the objective of brahmacharya as knowledge of Brahman (Book Five, Udyoga Parva, the Book of Effort). Brahmacharya leads one to union with the Supreme Soul or Self (Chapter 43). By subduing desire, the practice of self-restraint enables the student to learn, pay attention in thought, word and deed to the \"guru\" (teacher), and discover the truth embodied in the Vedas and Upanishads. According to the epic, the practice of studying and learning requires the \"aid of time,\" as well as personal effort, ability, discussion, and practice, all of which are helped by the virtue of brahmacharya. A brahmacharya should do useful work, and the earnings he obtains should be given away as \"dakshina\" (\"fee,\" \"gift of thanks\") to the guru. The epic declares that brahmacharya is one of twelve virtues, an essential part of \"angas\" in yoga and the path of perfecting perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n\"Brahmacharya\" is one of the five major vows prescribed for the \"śrāvakā\" (layman) and ascetics in Jainism. For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of \"brahmacharya\" requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner. For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage. \"Uttam Brahmacharya\" (Supreme Celibacy) is one of the ten excellencies of a \"Digambara monk\". \"Brahmacharya\" is mentioned as one of the \"das dharma\" (ten virtues) in ancient Jain texts like \"Tattvartha Sutra\", \"Sarvārthasiddhi\" and \"Puruşārthasiddhyupāya\".\n\nAmong the sramanic traditions (Buddhism, Jainism, Ājīvika and Carvaka schools ), \"brahmacharya\" is the term used for a self-imposed practice of celibacy generally considered a prerequisite for spiritual practice. The fourth of the five great vows of Jain monks, for example, is the vow of celibacy, which in this case means a total abstinence from the sensual pleasure of all five senses, including the avoidance of sexual thoughts and desires. The yogin who is firmly grounded in the virtue of \"brahmacharya\" is said to gain great vitality.\n\nHistorically \"brahmacarya\" referred to a stage of life \"(asrama)\" within the Vedic ashram system. Ancient Hindu culture divided the human lifespan into four stages: \"Brahmacharya\", \"Grihastha\", \"Vanaprastha\" and \"Sannyasa\". \"Brahamacharya asrama\" occupied the first 20–25 years of life roughly corresponding to adolescence. Upon the child's \"Upanayanam\", the young person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula (the household of the Guru) dedicated to learning all aspects of \"dharma\" that is the \"principles of righteous living\". \"Dharma\" comprised personal responsibilities towards himself, family, society, humanity and God which included the environment, earth and nature. This educational period started when the child was five to eight years old and lasted until the age of 14 to 20 years. During this stage of life, the traditional vedic sciences and various sastras were studied along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. This stage of life was characterized by the practice of celibacy.\n\nNaradaparivrajaka Upanishad suggests that Brahmacharya (student) stage of life should extend from the age a child is ready to receive teachings from a \"guru\", and continue for a period of twelve years.\n\nThe graduation from Brahmacharya stage of life was marked by the Samavartanam ceremony. The graduate was then ready to either start Grihastha (householder) stage of life, or wait, or pursue a life of Sannyasa and solitude like Rishis in forest. Vyasa in Chapter 234 of Shanti Parva in the Mahabharata praises \"Brahmacharya\" as an important stage of life necessary for learning, then adds \"Grihastha\" stage as the root of society and important to an individual's success.\n\nThe Vedas and Upanishads do not restrict the student stage of life to males. Atharva Veda, for example, states\n\nGonda states that there were no age restrictions for the start of Brahmacharya in ancient India. Not only young men, but older people resorted to student stage of life, and sought teachers who were authoritative in certain subjects. The Chandogya Upanishad, in Section 5.11, describes \"wealthy and learned householders\" becoming Brahmacharis (students) with Rishi Kaikeya, to gain knowledge about Atman (Soul, inner Self) and Brahman (Ultimate Reality).\n\nThe Vedas discuss Brahmacharya, both in the context of lifestyle and stage of one's life. Rig Veda, for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions knowledge seekers as those with \"Kesin\" (long haired) and soil-colored clothes (yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of \"Mananat\" (mind, meditation). Rigveda, however, refers to these people as \"Muni\" and \"Vati\". The Atharva Veda, completed by about 1000 BC, has more explicit discussion of \"Brahmacharya\", in Book XI Chapter 5. This Chapter of Atharva Veda describes Brahmacharya as that which leads to one's second birth (mind, Self-awareness), with Hymn 11.5.3 painting a symbolic picture that when a teacher accepts a Brahmachari, the student becomes his embryo.\n\nThe concept and practice of \"Brahmacarya\" is extensively found among the older strata of the Mukhya Upanishads in Hinduism. The 8th century BC text Chandogya Upanishad describes in Book 8, activities and lifestyle that is Brahmacharya:\n\nA hymn in another early Upanishad, the Mundaka Upanishad in Book 3, Chapter 1 similarly states,\nThe Vedas and early Upanishadic texts of Hinduism in their discussion of Brahmacharya, make no mention of the age of the student at the start of Brahmacharya, nor any restraint on sexual activity. One of the earliest discussion and contrasting viewpoints on sexual intercourse during \"Brahmacharya\" is in section 11.5.4 of Satpatha Brahamana. The verses 11.5.4.16 and 11.5.4.17 present two different viewpoints on sexual activity, one against and one as a choice. Similarly, in verse 11.5.4.18, the Satapatha Brahamana presents contrasting viewpoints on an eating restraint for the Brahmachari.\n\nIn Indian traditions, a \"Brahmachari\" is a male and \"Brahmacharini\" a female.\n\nAmong Brahma Kumaris, \"Brahmacharya\" is practised by married couples and householders too, as a way of formalizing sexual behavior into a conscious, co-creative practice rather than merely an unconscious habit.\n\nIn ISKCON, a bhakti sect or devotional movement within Hinduism, a male devotee is called \"brahmachari\" and female devotee \"brahmacharini.\" The unmarried male \"brahmacharis\" wear saffron robes, while married male householders wear white robes. \"Brahmacharinis\" wear saris of any color. The terms \"brahmachari\" and \"brahmacharini\" are reserved for those practicing celibacy. Married devotees, in contrast, are called \"grihastha\" (householders).\n\nVarious \"Ashrams\" (आश्रम, hermitage) and \"Matha\" (मठ, college of ascetics) of various schools of Hinduism call their male and female initiates as Brahmachari and Brahmacharinis.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the cultural legends, this creature has bright red/orange hair, and resembles a man or a dwarf, but its feet are turned backwards. \"Curupira\" lives in the forests of Brazil and uses its backward feet to create footprints that lead to its starting point, thus making hunters and travelers confused. Besides that, it can also create illusions and produce a sound that's like a high pitched whistle, in order to scare and drive its victim to madness. It is common to portray a \"Curupira\" riding a collared peccary, much like another Brazilian creature called \"Caipora\".\n\nA \"Curupira\" will prey on poachers and hunters that take more than they need of the forest, and he also attacks people who hunt animals that were taking care of their offspring. \nThere are many different versions of the legend, and so the creature's appearance and habits may vary from each region in Brazil.

It was found during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt and now stored at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Pap. 215). The work claims to date back to the time of pharaoh Teos of the 30th Dynasty, although in fact it's a later work datable to the 3rd century BCE, likely composed under the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes.<br>\nDespite its esoteric and cryptic text, analysis of the \"Demotic Chronicle\" have allowed, among other things, to integrate the order of succession of the treated pharaohs with the informations provided by Manetho's epitomes.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5939605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5939605", "title": "Dhabihah", "text": "Dhabihah\n\nIn Islamic law (or zabiha, \"\" , 'slaughter') is the prescribed method of ritual slaughter of all lawful halal animals. This method of slaughtering lawful animals has several conditions to be fulfilled. The name of God or \"In the name of God\" (\"Bismillah\") must be called by the butcher upon slaughter of each halal animal separately, and it should consist of a swift, deep incision with a very sharp knife on the throat, cutting the wind pipe, jugular veins and carotid arteries of both sides but leaving the spinal cord intact.\n\nThe method is used to comply with conditions stated in the Quran and in Islamic tradition.\n\n\"Dhabīḥah\" is regulated by a set of rules intended to ensure the health of the animal to be slaughtered and conformance to Islamic religious law, which is derived from the Quran and hadiths.\n\nThe following verses of the Quran mention the items which are forbidden to be eaten in Islam; however others have cited many other reasons that discourage the consumption of blood, pork, and carrion.\n\nAccording to the laws of dhabīḥah ḥalāl, certain prerequisites must be met before an animal is slaughtered:\n\"Eat not of that (meat) on which Allah's name has not been pronounced.\" [al-Anʻam 6:121]\nThus an animal slaughtered by a Christian who did not mention anything at the time of slaughter would be permissible to some, while other scholars would hold it impermissible.\n\nThe act of slaughtering itself is preceded by mentioning the name of God. Invoking the name of God at the moment of slaughtering is sometimes interpreted as acknowledgment of God's right over all things and thanking God for the sustenance he provides: it is a sign the food is taken not in sin or in gluttony, but to survive and praise Allah, as the most common blessing is, \"Bismillah,\" or \"In the name of God\".\n\nThus the slaughter itself is preceded by the words \"In the name of Allah (\"Bismillah\")\". It is not regarded appropriate to use the phrase \"Bismillah al Raḥmān Al Raḥīm\" (In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful) in this situation, because slaughtering is an act of subdual rather than mercy.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, the animal is brought to the place of slaughter and laid down gently so as to not injure it. It is Sunnah but not Fard that the head of the animal be facing the Qiblah. The blade must be kept hidden until the very last moment while the jugular of the animal is felt. The conventional method used to slaughter the animal involves cutting the large arteries in the neck along with the esophagus and trachea with one swipe of a non-serrated blade. Care must be taken that the nervous system is not damaged, as this may cause the animal to die before exsanguination has taken place. During the swipe of the blade, the head must not be decapitated. While blood is draining, the animal is not handled until it has died. While this is an acceptable method, the Egyptian Fatwaa Committee has agreed that an animal can be rendered insensible to pain via electronarcosis and still be halal. It's also important to note that these guidelines also respect the laws in place by the United States government to allow the practice to be permissible in the United States.\n\nIt is also compulsory that each animal must be slaughtered individually and in seclusion. In a poultry farm or slaughter house, one animal must not witness another animal being slaughtered.\n\nThis method adheres to Islamic law (it ensures the animal does not die by any of the Haraam methods) and helps to effectively drain blood from the animal. This may be important because the consumption of blood itself is forbidden in Islam; however, it is not clear that bleeding the animal removes all traces of blood from the carcass, so the meat may remain unclean. In fact it is stated by Islamic authorities that it is only necessary to drain \"most\" of the blood from the animal.\n\nStunning the animal with a bolt-gun, as is the standard practice in USDA FSIS inspected slaughtering houses, may cause instant death. Muslims regard meat from such a slaughter to be haraam, considering such meat as carrion.\n\nIt is for these reasons that there are ongoing questions and conversations within the North American Muslim community as to whether meat processed in these slaughter houses meets the standard of \"halal\" (as opposed to dhabīḥah). At center of this debate is the doubt as to whether this meat could qualify under the allowed category of the food of the People of the Book (Jewish and Christians). The first consideration being that standard slaughtering methods could cause the animal to die in a way other than slaughter (death through exsanguination).\n\nDebate continues among Muslim jurists and the general Muslim population about whether or not stunning, anesthetics, or other forms of inducing unconsciousness in the animal prior to slaughter are permissible as per Islam. Several halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning where the shock is less painful and non-fatal and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock.\n\nAccording to the British Halal Food Authority, stunning is permissible. However, there are different forms of stunning; some of which are prohibited, and some are permitted. According to the HFA, the following are prohibited:\n\n\nThere are two types of stunning that the Halal Food Authority approves:\n\n\nOpponents of dhabīḥah ḥalāl, most notably some animal welfare groups, contend that some methods of slaughter \"cause severe suffering to animals\" compared to when the animal is stunned before slaughter, which is why the Egyptian Fatwaa Committee has agreed to the electronarcosis. In the United Kingdom, the government funded an independent advisory body Farm Animal Welfare Council but recommended that conventional dhabīḥah (along with kosher slaughter (sheḥitah)) without prior stunning be abolished. The FAWC chairwoman of the time, Dr Judy MacArthur Clark, said, \"This is a major incision into the animal and to say that it doesn't suffer is quite ridiculous.\" According to Dr Peter Jinman, president of the British Veterinary Association, vets are \"looking at what is acceptable in the moral and ethical society we live.\" Muslims counter this by referring to the problems connected with stunning and the alleged benefits of slaughter without stunning.\n\nIt is argued that this method of slaughter without prior stunning leaves the spinal cord, and thus the capacity to feel pain until death, intact.\n\nThe UK Farm Animal Welfare Council says that the method by which kosher and halal meat is produced causes severe suffering to animals and it should be banned immediately. According to FAWC it can take up to two minutes for cattle to bleed to death, thus amounting to animal abuse. Compassion in World Farming also supported the recommendation saying \"We believe that the law must be changed to require all animals to be stunned before slaughter.\" The UK government rejected its recommendations.\n\nVarious research papers on cattle slaughter collected by Compassion In World Farming mention that \"after the throat is cut, large clots can form at the severed ends of the carotid arteries, leading to occlusion of the wound (or \"ballooning\" as it is known in the slaughtering trade). Nick Cohen wrote in the \"New Statesman\", \"Occlusions slow blood loss from the carotids and delay the decline in blood pressure that prevents the suffering brain from blacking out. In one group of calves, 62.5 per cent suffered from ballooning. Even if the cut to the neck is clean, blood is carried to the brain by vertebral arteries and it keeps cattle conscious of their pain. \"Experiments carried out by the principal of the Swedish Veterinary Institute (\"Veterinärhögskolan\") by order of the Swedish government in 1925 and published in 1928 determined that the blood carried to the brain by the vertebral arteries in bovines is reduced after slaughter by the Jewish method shehitah from 1/30 to 1/40, and on the basis of this and one other experiment Professor Axel Sahlstedt declared the method humane and not cruel. However, on the basis of other experiments that had showed different results, Sahlstedt recommended post-stunning as standard.\n\nHowever, in a study between 1974 and 1978 Wilhelm Schulze and his colleagues carried out a study at the School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover University in Germany: \"Attempts to Objectify Pain and Consciousness in Conventional (captive bolt pistol stunning) and Ritual (knife) Methods of Slaughtering Sheep and Calves\" is reported on Islamic websites to have concluded that \"the Islamic way of slaughtering is the most humane method of slaughter and that captive bolt stunning, practiced in the West, causes severe pain to the animal.\" However, recent studies have countered the Schulze study, which is dated and relied on older EEG measurement techniques. Dr. Schulze himself also warned in his report that the stunning technique may not have functioned properly.\n\nHalal and kosher butchers deny that their method of killing animals is cruel and expressed anger over the FAWC recommendation. Majid Katme of the Muslim Council of Britain also disagreed, stating that \"it's a sudden and quick haemorrhage. A quick loss of blood pressure and the brain is instantaneously starved of blood and there is no time to start feeling any pain.\"\n\nIn April 2008, the Food and Farming minister in the UK, Lord Rooker, stated that halal and kosher meat should be labeled when it is put on sale, so that members of the public can decide whether or not they want to buy food from animals that have been bled to death. He was quoted as saying, \"I object to the method of slaughter ... my choice as a customer is that I would want to buy meat that has been looked after, and slaughtered in the most humane way possible.\" The RSPCA supported Lord Rooker's views.\n\nFor the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Humane Society International, \"the animals that are slaughtered according to kosher and halal should be securely restrained, particularly the head and neck, before cutting the throat\" as \"movements (during slaughter) results in a poor cut, bad bleeding, slow loss of consciousness, if at all, and pain.\"\n\nIn Europe, the DIALREL project addressed religious slaughter issues by gathering and disseminating information and by encouraging dialogue between the spiritual and scientific communities. Funding for DIALREL was provided by The European Commission, and it began functioning in November 2006. DIALREL produced many fact sheets and ultimately published a final report in 2010, \"Report on good and adverse practices - Animal welfare concerns in relation to slaughter practices from the viewpoint of veterinary sciences.\"\n\nCertain Muslim and Jewish communities expressed frustration with the process of dialogue skewed for non-religious audiences.\n\nResearch undertaken in 2010 by Meat & Livestock Australia on animal pain and distress concluded, \"technologies available to alleviate such suffering overwhelmingly supports the use of pre-slaughter stunning\".\n\nIn 2015, in the United Kingdom, concern has been expressed regarding the slaughtering of animals without prior stunning.\n\nFollowers of some religions are prohibited from consuming meat slaughtered in the fashion described above.\nThe Rehat Maryada of Sikhism states that in Sikhism, \"consumption of any meat killed in a ritualistic manner\" is strictly prohibited, therefore prohibiting both halal and kosher meat.\n\nThere are many similarities between the rules concerning dhabihah and shechita, Jewish ritual slaughter. The word \"dhabihah\" is linguistically similar to the Hebrew term זבח \"zevaḥ\" (sacrifice).\n\nMuslims are divided as to whether or not Jewish slaughter suffices as a replacement for Islamic dhabihah halal. Some claim that Jewish slaughter leaves out the takbīr (saying \"God is great\") and changes the method of slaughter; thus, their meat is haraam. Others claim that the slaughtering processes are similar enough in practice and in theory to render animals slaughtered by Jewish laws as halal.\n\nJeremiah J Berman wrote in 1941:\n\"At the present day in most of the Islamic world Muslims purchase Jewish meat, though they will not buy Christian meat. This is true in Istanbul, Beirut, Jerusalem and Mogador. Contemporary Muslims in these cities consider Jewish slaughtering as fulfilling all the requirements of their law, while they regard the slaughtering performed by Christians as done in contravention thereof. In Yemen ... Jewish meat is not acceptable.\" Berman also reports that Jewish meat slaughtered in Salonica (Thessaloniki) was not acceptable to Muslims.\n\nTo be kosher, fit for consumption by those of the Jewish faith, meat must be slaughtered by a Jewish shohet who holds a licence from a rabbi and has been examined on the laws of shechitah. This alone means that halal meat is forbidden to those of the Jewish faith. The requirements for the shape of the knife are more severe, the knife must be free from a single nick and the method of cutting is exactly defined. In addition there is an inspection of the lungs (bedikah) that mammals must pass, which Muslims do not have.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the banks of the River Godavari at the city of Nanded in the state of Maharashtra, Western India. The gurudwara within the complex is known as Sach-Khand (Realm of Truth).\n\nThe structure is built at the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji got shaheed. The inner room of the gurdwara is called the \"Angitha Sahib\" and is built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh was cremated in 1708. The gurdwara was built between 1832 and 1837 by order of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji (1780–1839).\n\nHazur Sahib marks the site where Guru Gobind Singh had his camp in 1708. The Guru held his court and congregation here and was convalescing after being attacked by two would-be assassins. One of the attackers stabbed the Guru, and was killed by him with a single stroke of his talwar (curved sword). The other was killed by his followers as he tried to escape. The Guru's wound was deep, but initially healed after being stitched by an English surgeon sent by Bahadur Shah I, who served as his doctor, and Dara Shikoh before him. However the wound re-opened a few days later when the Guru was stringing a bow for one of his Sikhs and the Guru died after declaring the Guru Granth Sahib as his successor.\n\nThe Sikhs built a room over the platform where Guru Gobind Singh would sit while holding his court and installed the Guru Granth Sahib on it. They called it Takhat Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh, while conferring Guruship on the holy Book, had himself named Nanded as \"Abchalnagar\" (literally \"Steadfast city\") after the first word of a hymn read at random on the occasion.\n\nIn October 2008, the 300th anniversary celebration of the Guruship of Guru Granth Sahib took place here. This site is now one of five Takhats which are places of primary importance to the Sikhs. The other four takhats are: Akal Takhat at Amritsar, Takhat Keshgarh Sahib at Anandpur, Takhat Patna Sahib in Bihar and Takhat Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo, Bhatinda, Punjab.\n\nSachkhand (literally \"region of Truth\") had been used by Guru Nanak to mean the abode of God. Ranjit Singh had the present building of the Takhat Sahib constructed with money, artisans and labor sent from the Punjab during the early 1830s. Around the same time the Nizam of Hyderabad State a Muslim ruler of the Deccan Region raised a contingent of Northern Sikhs as part of his army. Most of these men settled permanently in Hyderabad State and also devout Hindus of the Deccan embraced Sikhism in the 19th century. Hindus also have a high regard for the Guru Gobind Singh and gurudwara.\n\nThe control of Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazoor Sahib, which had formerly passed into the hands of Udasi Sikh priests was regained by the Sikhs under the influence of the Singh Sabha Movement of the late nineteenth century. Some of the 'rituals and ceremonies connected with working' are peculiar to this Takhat Sahib. In 1956 an Act was passed by the legislature of Hyderabad under which the management of the Takhat Sahib and other historical Gurdwaras was legally placed under a 17-member Gurudwaras Board and a five-member Managing Committee.\n\nThe Takht houses both the sri Guru Granth Sahib ji and the Sri Dasam Granth. This follows the pattern of Takht Sri Patna Sahib.\n\nNanded being the holy city where Baba Banda Singh Bahadur had his ashram and Baba Banda Singh started his journey of Khalsa victory from Nanded only, has a very high place in national history of India.\n\nThis shrine differs from other historical places of Sikh worship, here all ancient customs which were practised at the time of the Guru are still practised for example, sandal-wood tilak is still applied on the foreheads of priests and local devotees.\n\nThe most important aspect of this holy shrine is that there are two sanctum sanctorum here. While all the functions are carried out by the priests in the outer room, the inner room is a vault which houses priceless objects, weapons and other personal belongings of the Guru. No one except the head priest can enter this holy vault.\n\nIn 2008, the 300th Gurudomship ceremony of Guru Granth Sahib and 300th death anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh were celebrated on a grand scale at Hazoor Sahib, Nanded. The then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh also addressed to the Sath-Sangat on the main event function. To publicise the event the \"Jagriti Yatra\" was arranged which travelled through different cities across the country and also some places in abroad.\n\nRecently, a laser-ray show has been started at Gobind Bagh near the main gurudwara. In this show the lives of the ten Gurus are briefly described. The show became very popular in a short period not only among Sikhs (local or visitors) but also people of other religions. It is the second largest laser show in Asia.\n\n\n\nBhai Jagat Singh (1917–1978) was an eminent Ragi who did Seva at the Takhat from AD 1934 to 1978(till death). He had taken his Vidiya of \"Raag\" based Kirtana at Chief khalsa diwan's Khalsa Pracharak Vidyalaya aka Taran taran taksal, Amritsar, Punjab (unpartitioned Punjab).\n\n\n\n"}

The Revised Standard Version used the name \"Bethzatha\", but other versions (the King James Version and Geneva Bible) have \"Bethesda\". The place is called \"Probatica, or in Hebrew Bethsaida\", in the Douai-Rheims translation.\n\nJohn's Gospel account describes how Jesus, visiting Jerusalem for a Jewish feast (), encounters one of the disabled people who used to lie here, a man who had been paralysed for thirty-eight years. Some manuscripts of the Gospel include a passage considered by many textual critics to be an interpolation added to the original text, which explained that \"an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had\" ( - see John 5). Jesus asks the man if he wants to get well. The man explains that he is unable to enter the water when the water is stirred up, because he has no one to help in and others go down ahead of him. Jesus tells him to pick up his bed or mat and walk; the man is instantly cured and is able to do so.\n\nThe Gospel then explains that this healing took place on the Sabbath, and the local Jews told the cured man that the Law forbade him to carry his mat on this day. He tells them that he had been told to do so by the man who had healed him. They ask him who this healer was but he is unable to tell them because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd. \n\nLater, Jesus finds the man in the Temple, and tells him not to sin again, so that nothing worse happens to him. The man goes away and tells the Jewish people that it was Jesus who had made him well (. The Gospel account explains that the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he was healing on the Sabbath. He responds by saying that \"My Father is still working, and I also am working\" (. This assertion makes the Jews all the more determined to kill him, because not only is he breaking the Sabbath but he is making himself equal to God by calling God his father ().\n\nIn a similar healing event is recorded, in which the Apostles Peter and John visit the Temple and heal a disabled person in Jesus' name. The setting is comparable, in each case a specific location in Jerusalem is named, and in each case the fact that the healed person walked away is highlighted.\n\n"}

Jackman has won international recognition for his roles in a variety of film genres. He is known for his long-running role as Wolverine in the \"X-Men\" film series, as well as for his lead roles in films such as the romantic-comedy fantasy \"Kate & Leopold\" (2001), the action-horror film \"Van Helsing\" (2004), the magic-themed drama \"The Prestige\" (2006), the epic fantasy drama \"The Fountain\" (2006), the epic historical romantic drama \"Australia\" (2008), the film version of \"Les Misérables\" (2012), the thriller \"Prisoners\" (2013), and the musical \"The Greatest Showman\" (2017). His work in \"Les Misérables\" earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in 2013.\n\nIn Broadway theatre, Jackman won a Tony Award for his role in \"The Boy from Oz\". A four-time host of the Tony Awards themselves, he won an Emmy Award for one of these appearances. Jackman also hosted the 81st Academy Awards on 22 February 2009.\n\nJackman was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to Grace McNeil (née Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, a Cambridge-trained accountant. His parents were English and had come to Australia in 1967 as part of the \"Ten Pound Poms\" immigration. One of his paternal great-grandfathers, Nicholas Isidor Bellas, was Greek, from the Ottoman Empire (now in Greece). His parents were devout Christians, having been converted by Evangelist Billy Graham after their marriage. Jackman has four older siblings and was the second of his parents' children to be born in Australia. He also has a younger half-sister, from his mother's remarriage. His parents divorced when he was eight, and Jackman remained in Australia with his father and two brothers, while his mother moved back to England with Jackman's two sisters. As a child, Jackman liked the outdoors, spending a lot of time at the beach and on camping trips and school holidays all over Australia. He wanted to see the world: \"I used to spend nights looking at atlases. I decided I wanted to be a chef on a plane. Because I'd been on a plane and there was food on board, I presumed there was a chef. I thought that would be an ideal job.\"\n\nJackman went to primary school at Pymble Public School and later attended the all-boys Knox Grammar School on Sydney's Upper North Shore, where he starred in its production of \"My Fair Lady\" in 1985 and became the school captain in 1986. Following graduation, he spent a gap year working at Uppingham School in England as a Physical Education teacher. On his return, he studied at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating in 1991 with a BA in Communications. In his final year of university, he took a drama course to make up additional credits. The class did Václav Havel's \"The Memorandum\" with Jackman as the lead. He later commented, \"In that week I felt more at home with those people than I did in the entire three years [at university]\".\n\nAfter obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course \"The Journey\" at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, \"It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'.\" After completing \"The Journey\", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera \"Neighbours\" but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.\n\nJackman has said he \"always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'\"\n\nOn the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on \"Correlli\": \"I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds.\" \"Correlli\", devised by Australian actress Denise Roberts, was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. \"Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it,\" he said, as the show lasted only one season. After \"Correlli\" Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played Gaston in the local Walt Disney production of \"Beauty and the Beast\", and Joe Gillis in \"Sunset Boulevard\". During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 Midsumma festival cabaret production \"Summa Cabaret\". He also hosted Melbourne's Carols by Candlelight and Sydney's Carols in the Domain. Jackman's early film works include \"Erskineville Kings\" and \"Paperback Hero\" (1999), and his television work includes \"Law of the Land\", \"Halifax f.p.\", \"Blue Heelers\", and \"Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River\".\n\nJackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the Royal National Theatre's acclaimed stage production of \"Oklahoma!\", in London's West End. The performance earned him an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said \"I totally felt like it can't get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career.\" He also starred in the 1999 film version of the same stage musical, which has been screened in many countries.\n\nJackman had his breakthrough role playing Wolverine in Bryan Singer's \"X-Men\" (2000)—a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name. Co-starring Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Famke Janssen and Ian McKellen, the film tells the story of a group of mutants, whose superhuman powers make them distrusted by normal humans. The role was originally written for Russell Crowe who instead suggested Jackman for the part. Jackman says that his wife advised him against taking on the role, as she found it \"ridiculous\". He initially studied wolves to develop his character, as he thought that Wolverine alluded to wolves. \"X-Men\" was successful at the box-office, earning US$296 million. The role earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor.\n\nWolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but a lot of emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the \"Dirty Harry\" movies and Mel Gibson in \"Mad Max 2\". \"Here were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it.\" Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. \"We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty.\" Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. \"Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned.\"\nJackman, at stands 30 cm taller than Wolverine, who is said in the original comic book to be . Hence, the filmmakers were frequently forced to shoot Jackman at unusual angles or only from the waist up to make him appear shorter than he actually is, and his co-stars wore platform soles. Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the fourth film in the series, he bench-pressed over 136 kg (300 lb).\n\nJackman reprised his role in 2003's \"X2\", 2006's \"\", and the 2009 prequel \"\", where Troye Sivan played the younger version of James Howlett. He also cameoed as Wolverine in 2011's \"\". He returned for the role of Wolverine again in 2013's \"The Wolverine\", a stand-alone sequel taking place after the events of \"X-Men: The Last Stand\", and reprised the character in the 2014 sequel \"\" and the 2016 follow-up \"\". In 2015, Jackman announced that the 2017 sequel to \"The Wolverine\", \"Logan\", was the final time that he would play the role.\n\nJackman starred as Leopold in the 2001 romantic comedy film \"Kate & Leopold\", a role for which he received a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination. Jackman plays a Victorian English duke who accidentally time-travels to 21st-century Manhattan, where he meets Kate (Meg Ryan), a cynical advertising executive. In 2001, Jackman also starred in the action/drama \"Swordfish\" with John Travolta and Halle Berry. This was the second time Jackman worked with Berry, and the two have worked together thrice more in the \"X-Men\" movies. He hosted an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Jackman sang the role of Billy Bigelow in the musical \"Carousel\" in a special concert performance at Carnegie Hall with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. In 2004, Jackman won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical for his 2003–2004 Broadway portrayal of Australian songwriter and performer Peter Allen in the hit musical \"The Boy from Oz\", which he also performed in Australia in 2006. In addition, Jackman hosted the Tony Awards in 2003, 2004, and 2005, garnering positive reviews. His hosting of the 2004 Tony Awards earned him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performer in a Variety, Musical or Comedy program.\n\nAfter 2003's \"X2\", Jackman played the title role of monster killer Gabriel Van Helsing in the 2004 film \"Van Helsing\". Jackman and the film were noted in Bruce A. McClelland's book \"Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead\".\n\nJackman was asked to consider taking on the role as James Bond before Daniel Craig was chosen to play the character, but turned it down due to other commitments. Speaking to the British Press Association in 2011, Jackman said: 'I was about to shoot X-Men 2 and Wolverine had become this thing in my life and I didn't want to be doing two such iconic characters at once.'\n\nAlongside Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson, Jackman starred in \"The Prestige\" (2006), a mystery thriller from Christopher Nolan. Jackman portrayed Robert Angier, an aristocratic magician who builds up a rivalry with contemporary Alfred Borden (Bale) in attempt to one-up each other in the art of deception. After reading the script, Jackman expressed interest in starring in the film, and Nolan believed that the actor had the qualities of the character. Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. \"The Prestige\" was acclaimed and a box-office success.\n\nJackman portrayed three different characters in Darren Aronofsky's science-fiction film \"The Fountain\": Tommy Creo, a neuroscientist, who is torn between his wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), who is dying of a brain tumor, and his work at trying to cure her; Captain Tomas Creo, a Spanish conquistador in 1532 Seville; and a future astronaut, Tom, travelling to a golden nebula in an eco-spacecraft seeking to be reunited with Izzi. Jackman said \"The Fountain\" was his most difficult film thus far due to the physical and emotional demands of the part.\n\nJackman also starred in Woody Allen's 2006 film \"Scoop\" opposite Scarlett Johansson. That year he also reprised the role of Wolverine in \"\". He rounded out 2006 with two animated films: \"Happy Feet\", directed by George Miller, in which he voiced the part of Memphis, an emperor penguin; and \"Flushed Away\", where Jackman supplied the voice of a rat named Roddy who ends up being flushed down a family's toilet into the London sewer system. \"Flushed Away\" co-starred Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (Jackman's fourth time working with him).\n\nIn 2007, Jackman produced and guest-starred in the television musical-dramedy series \"Viva Laughlin\", which was cancelled by CBS after two episodes.\n\nIn 2008, director Baz Luhrmann cast Jackman to replace Russell Crowe as the male lead in his much-publicized epic film, \"Australia\", which co-starred Nicole Kidman. The movie was released in late November 2008 in Australia and the U.S. Jackman played a tough, independent cattle drover, who reluctantly helps an English noblewoman in her quest to save both her philandering husband's Australian cattle station and the mixed race Aboriginal child she finds there. Of the movie, Jackman said, \"This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself all the way through the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures... I'll die a happy man knowing I've got this film on my CV.\"\n\nJackman co-starred with Daniel Craig on Broadway at the Schoenfeld Theatre in a limited engagement of the play \"A Steady Rain\", which ran from 10 September 2009, to 6 December 2009.\n\nJackman has reprised his role as the Wolverine in \"X-Men\" spin-off films.

The show had a run-time of approximately 100 minutes, and also included slide shows of Jackman's youth, family, and work, as well as some one-on-one interaction with the audience. Jackman was backed by fellow musical theatre veterans Merle Dandridge and Angel Reda. He later returned to Broadway in a new show, \"\" at the Broadhurst Theatre, which began performances on 25 October 2011 and concluded on 1 January 2012.\n\nIn a November 2012 release, Jackman voiced the role of E.Aster Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny) in the animated film \"Rise of the Guardians\". Jackman starred as Jean Valjean in the film \"Les Misérables\", an adaptation of the musical. The film opened on 25 December 2012. For the role, he lost 15 pounds and later had to regain 30 pounds to mirror his character's newfound success. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in January 2013 for this performance. Jackman appeared alongside Kate Winslet in \"Movie 43\", an ensemble comedy, in January 2013.

The religion is followed by 1.47% of the country's population according to the 2011 census, compared to 91.06% Christians and 4.57% not religious, atheists, agnostics and sceptics.\n\nIslam was first introduced to Croatia by the Ottoman Empire during the Croatian–Ottoman Wars that lasted from 15th to 16th century. During this period some parts of the Croatian Kingdom were occupied which resulted in numerous Croats converting to Islam, some after being taken prisoners of war, some through the devşirme system. Nonetheless, Croats strongly fought against the Turks during these few centuries which resulted in the fact that the westernmost border of the Ottoman Empire in Europe became entrenched on the Croatian soil. In 1519, Croatia was called the \"Antemurale Christianitatis\" by Pope Leo X.\n\nThe Islamic Community of Croatia (\"Mešihat Islamske Zajednice u Hrvatskoj\") is the main organization of Muslims in Croatia that is officially recognized by the state. The President of the Islamic Community is Aziz Effendi Hasanović.\n\nAs of 2011, 62,977 Muslims live in Croatia. Most of them declare themselves as Bosniaks (45,225) while others declare themselves as: Albanians (9,594), Roma (5,039), Turks (343), Macedonians (217), Montenegrins (159) and other (2,420).\n\nThe first mosque in Croatia was built in Gunja in 1969. Today there are 4 mosques and 2 Islamic centers in Croatia (in Zagreb and Rijeka).\n\nThe Turkish Ottoman Empire conquered part of Croatia from the 15th to the 19th century. Numerous Croats converted to Islam, some after being taken prisoners of war, some through the devşirme system. The westernmost border of Ottoman Empire in Europe became entrenched on Croatian soil. In 1519, Croatia was called the \"Antemurale Christianitatis\" by Pope Leo X.\n\nThe historical names of many officials in the Ottoman Empire reveal their origin (Hirwat = Hrvat or Horvat, which is a Croatian name for Croat): Rüstem Pasha (Rustem Pasha Hrvat - Opuković), Piyale Pasha (Pijali Pasha Hrvat), Memipaša Hrvat, Tahvilpaša Kulenović Hrvat etc.\nThere was some considerable confusion over the terms \"Croat\" and \"Serb\" in these times, and \"Croat\" in some of these cases could mean anyone from the wider South Slavic area.\n\nIn 1553, Antun Vrančić, Roman cardinal, and Franjo Zay, a diplomat, visited Istanbul as envoys of the Croatian-Hungarian king to discuss a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire. During the initial ceremonial greetings they had with Rüstem Pasha Hrvat (a Croat) the conversation led in Turkish with an official interpreter was suddenly interrupted. Rustem Pasha Hrvat asked in Croatian if Zay and Vrančić spoke Croatian language. The interpreter was then dismissed and they proceeded in the Croatian language during the entire process of negotiations.\n\nIn 1585, traveler and writer Marco A. Pigaffetta, in his \"Itinerario\" published in London, states: \"In Constantinople it is customary to speak Croatian, a language which is understood by almost all official Turks, especially military men.\" Crucially though, the \"lingua franca\" at the time among Slavic elites in the Ottoman Empire was still Old Church Slavonic. For Italians traveling through to Istanbul, the language of the Slavic Croats was often the only exposure they had to any of the Slavic languages; indeed, Bulgarian and Macedonian dialects were far more common in Istanbul than Croatian.\n\nWithin the territory of the present Republic of Croatia, Muslim believers were registered for the first time during the 1931 census: 1,239 of them were in Zagreb and their overall number in Croatia being only about 4000.\n\nDuring the Second World War the mufti of Zagreb was Ismet Muftić. After the war he was tried and eventually publicly hanged by the Partisans in 1945 because of his collaboration with the fascist regime of the Croatian WWII dictator Ante Pavelić.\n\nIn the next censa in the People's Republic of Croatia, registered Muslim believers numbered as follows:\n\nIn the 1960s, the Bosnians Muslims community advocated for the recognition of the Bosniaks as a nationality in SFR Yugoslavia. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution allowed for the official recognition of the Muslims as a nationality, therefore allowing more individuals to declare their alignment with a compromise categorization of Muslims by nationality (\"Muslimani\"), in this case separated from a religious basis (\"muslimani\" without capital letter). For example, Džemal Bijedić, a communist federal prime-minister was a declared \"Muslim\" and an atheist. The spike in the number of self-declared \"Muslims\" during socialist Yugoslavia times should thus be understood as persons having a family Muslim cultural background (similar to the concept of cultural Christians), rather than practicing believers in Islam.\nBased on the figures recorded during the 1931 to 1961 census, it may also be concluded that a certain number of Muslim believers declared themselves as Croats or Yugoslavs.\n\nAfter the dissolution of Yugoslavia, an additional increase can be attributed to the influx of Bosnian Muslims that took place during and after the 1992-1996 Bosnian conflict.\n\nThe 2001 Croatian census identified a total of 56,777 adherents of Islam, or 1.3% of the total population of Croatia. The following ethnic groups were presumed to be significantly Muslim:\n\nThe published data from the 2011 Croatian census included a crosstab of ethnicity and religion which showed that a total of 62,977 Muslims (1.47% of the total population) was divided between the following ethnic groups:\n\nCroatia's capital Zagreb has one of the biggest mosques in Europe since 1987. During the existence of the Ottoman Empire it had none because Zagreb, as well as most parts of Croatia, was not occupied by the Ottomans during the Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War.\n\nThe Bosniak imam Ševko Omerbašić, was the long-time leader of the Muslim community of Croatia and the Mufti of Zagreb.\n\nA new mosque in Rijeka was opened in May 2013. The Muslim community is also planning to build a mosque in Osijek and Sisak. A mosque in Karlovac is also being considered.\n\n\n"}

The IPB was opposed to both capitalism and communism. David Musa Pidcock, a Sheffield man who converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam while working as an engineer in Saudi Arabia, founded and led the party. The IPB published a quarterly magazine entitled \"Common Sense\".\n\nThe party entered the 1992 general election, standing three unsuccessful candidates in the constituencies of Bradford, a city with a large Muslim minority, and one in London constituency Streatham.\n\nThe Islamic Party never achieved a seat in either house of Parliament. Pidcock represented the party in the Bradford North by-election, 1990, earning 800 votes (2.2%), finishing fourth of ten candidates.\n\nIn the 1992 General Election, the party stood candidates in each of the three constituencies in the City of Bradford. All of them finished last, with Pidcock in Bradford West doing the best, with 471 votes (0.96%). It also stood a candidate in Streatham, coming fifth of seven.\n\nIn its first year, Pidcock claimed that his party was planning co-operation with the ecologist Green Party.\n\nMembers of the party have supported the Respect Party; one of their leading members, home affairs spokesman Mohammad Naseem, stood for and funded the party.\n\nThe party believed in equal treatment under the law regardless of an individual's status, income or ethnicity. The IPB argued that religion is the most important thing in life. It called for reform of the British banking system to make it interest-free and Islamic, and for increased trade with the Islamic world. At one time, the party answered questions sent in by readers. When answering one question, the party argued that homosexuality needed treatment, was not to be tolerated and that homosexuals should be put to death for a \"public display of lewdness\", a policy that was condemned by Peter Tatchell.\n\n"}

Some form or another of the waqf has governed access to the Haram esh-Sharif since the Muslim reconquest of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187, with the latest version instituted by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after its conquest of the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1948 war. Accordingly, the King of Jordan currently supplies all of the funding needed to operate the waqf, which is in effect the civil administration for the holy site.\n\nIsrael occupied the Old City of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War of June 1967. After the end of hostilities, Israel allowed the waqf to retain authority over the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif).\n\nThe waqf administration is headed by a director (or sometimes \"director-general\") who runs the civil administration for the holy sites. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem is in charge of Islamic religious affairs at the site. The Supreme Muslim Council is the Islamic judicial body governing affairs under Islamic law within Israel. The Palestinian Authority has parallel organizations claiming interest in these same matters (i.e., the Ministry of Islamic Waqf at the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian Authority Grand Mufti, or the Palestinian Supreme Fatwa Council), and those are not to be confused with those recognized by Israel, even if some of the same people hold both offices.\n\n"}

Many Lepcha are also found in western and southwestern Bhutan, Tibet, Darjeeling, the Mechi Zone of eastern Nepal, and in the hills of West Bengal. The Lepcha people are composed of four main distinct communities: the Renjóngmú of Sikkim; the Dámsángmú of Kalimpong, Kurseong, and Mirik; the ʔilámmú of Ilam District, Nepal; and the Promú of Samtse and Chukha in southwestern Bhutan.\n\nThe word Lepcha (endonym Roang kup) is considered to be the anglicized version of the Nepalese word lepche meaning \"vile speakers\" or \"inarticulate speech\". This was at first a derogatory nickname but is no longer seen as negative.\n\nThe origin of the Lepcha is Nye Mayel Lyang . They may have originated in Myanmar, Tibet or Mongolia but the Lepcha people themselves firmly believe that they did not migrate to the current location from anywhere and are indigenous to the region. They speak a Tibeto-Burman language which some classify as Himalayish. Based on this, some anthropologists suggest they emigrated directly from Tibet to the north, Japan or from Eastern Mongolia. Others suggest a more complex migration that started in southeast Tibet, a migration to Thailand, Burma, or Japan, then a navigation of the Ayeyarwady River and Chindwin rivers, a crossing of the Patkoi range coming back west, and finally entering ancient India. While migrating westward through India, they are surmised to have passed through southern Bhutan before reaching their final destination near Kanchenjunga. The Lepcha people themselves do not have any tradition of migration, and hence they conclude that they are aboriginal to the region, currently falling under the state of Sikkim, Darjeeling District of West Bengal, eastern Nepal and the southwestern parts of Bhutan. In the Mechi Zone, they form 7% of the population of Ilam District, 2% in Panchthar District, and 10% of the population in Taplejung District. In Sikkim as a whole they are considered to be around 15% of the population of the state.\n\nThe Lepcha have their own language, also called Lepcha. It belongs to the Bodish–Himalayish group of Tibeto-Burman languages. The Lepcha write their language in their own script, called \"Róng\" or Lepcha script, which is derived from the Tibetan script. It was developed between the 17th and 18th centuries, possibly by a Lepcha scholar named Thikúng Mensalóng, during the reign of the third Chogyal (Tibetan king) of Sikkim. The world's largest collection of old Lepcha manuscripts is found with the Himalayan Languages Project in Leiden, Netherlands, with over 180 Lepcha books.\n\nLepchas are divided into many clans (Lepcha: \"putsho\"), each of which reveres its own sacred lake and mountain peak (Lepcha: \"dâ\" and \"cú\") from which the clan derives its name. While most Lepcha can identify their own clan, Lepcha clan names can be quite formidable, and are often shortened for this reason. For example, \"Simíkmú\" and \"Fonyung Rumsóngmú\" may be shortened to \"Simik\" and \"Foning\", respectively. Some of the name of the clans are \"Sada\", \"Barphungputso\", \"Rongong\", \"Karthakmu\", \"Sungutmu\", \"Phipon\", \"Brimu\", etc.\n\nMost Lepchas are Buddhist, a religion brought by the Bhutias from the north, although a large number of Lepchas have today adopted Christianity. Some Lepchas have not given up their shamanistic religion, which is known as Mun. In practice, rituals from Mun and Buddhism are frequently observed alongside one another among some Lepchas. For example, ancestral mountain peaks are regularly honored in ceremonies called \"cú rumfát.\" Many rituals involve local species. In Sikkim, Lepchas are known to use over 370 species of animals, fungi, and plants. According to the Nepal Census of 2001, out of the 3,660 Lepcha in Nepal, 88.80% were Buddhists and 7.62% were Hindus. Many Lepchas in the Hills of Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong are Christians. \n\nThe traditional clothing for Lepcha women is the ankle-length \"dumbun\", also called \"dumdyám or gādā\" (\"female dress\"). It is one large piece of smooth cotton or silk, usually of a solid color. When it is worn, it is folded over one shoulder, pinned at the other shoulder, and held in place by a waistband, or \"tago\", over which excess material drapes. A contrasting long-sleeved blouse may be worn underneath.\n\nThe traditional Lepcha clothing for men is the \"dumprá\" (\"male dress\"). It is a multicolored, hand-woven cloth pinned at one shoulder and held in place by a waistband, usually worn over a white shirt and trousers. Men wear a flat round cap called a \"thyáktuk\", with stiff black velvet sides and a multicolored top topped by a knot. Rarely, the traditional cone-shaped bamboo and rattan hats are worn.\n\nThe Lepcha trace their descent patrilineally. The marriage is negotiated between the families of the bride and the groom. If the marriage deal is settled, the lama will check the horoscopes of the boy and girl to schedule a favourable date for the wedding. Then the boy's maternal uncle, along with other relatives, approach the girl's maternal uncle with a \"khada\", a ceremonial scarf, and one rupee, to gain the maternal uncle's formal consent.\n\nThe wedding takes place at noon on the auspicious day. The groom and his entire family leave for the girl's house with some money and other gifts that are handed over to the bride's maternal uncle. Upon reaching the destination, the traditional Nyomchok ceremony takes place, and the bride's father arranges a feast for relatives and friends. This seals the wedding between the couple.\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to the usage of the common Arabic style merged with modernist style mosque architecture, the vernacular mosques of the Philippines used to be the hut-style and the pagoda-style, which were very common until the late 19th century. Most of the mosques in the Philippines today have common Islamic architectures imported from Arabia, though some vernacular pagoda-style mosques can still be seen in Mindanao such as the Masjid Datu Untong Balabaran of Taviran in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao. There have been proposals to put the Heritage Mosques of the Philippines into the Philippine tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration in the future. The proposals made were to input the historic mosques of the Philippines (mosque in Simunul), to input the vernacular mosques of the Philippines (langga/rangga-style and pagoda-style mosques), or to combine both and input them in the tentative list of UNESCO.\n\nThere are two classifications of mosques in the Philippines, namely: (1) \"Masjid\", which is associated with any place of worship and includes a bulbous dome and a minaret as an architectural element. It is a large and more permanent structure, built on foundations, often to be found near a river or body of water, where the faithful perform rituals of ablution. (2) \"Langgal\" (in Tausug) or \"Ranggar\" (in Maranao), which means “to meet”, refers to a small semi-permanent prayer structure built for the convenience of the faithful and mostly in rural areas. There is a third type which uses a pagoda-style architecture, but have been dethroned by the masjid (Arabian-style mosque).\nVery little is known about the architectural designs of mosque types in the Philippines. This is due to several factors: (1) much of the earliest types of mosques constructed by early missionaries were made of temporary materials like wood, bamboo, and cogon which do not last for years; (2) the remaining earlier types were either demolished, destroyed during earthquakes, or reconstructed/remodelled to suit modern architectural types based on the middle-east designs; (3) the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca radically changed all earliest types; and (4) very little has been written about the subject.\n\nAccording to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the main cultural arm of the Philippine government, it is possible that the sampling of the mosque types in Lanao might represent the “typical” mosques in the Philippines prior to the importation of mosque architecture from Arabia, as Islam was introduced to the Sulu archipelago first, followed by Maguindanao, and then Lanao. Both Sulu and Maguindanao have lost almost all of their non-Arabian style mosque architectural knowledge, making Lanao the last area where such knowledge is still extant, although some pockets still exist in Sulu and Maguindanao. One of the earliest types of mosques in Lanao is a five-tiered building resembling a Chinese pagoda. A variation of this type is a three-tiered or seven-tiered edifice. The earliest mosque in Simunul, Tawi-tawi was initially built through the pagoda-style. Its 4 pillars are still there after more than 400 years. Another example of vernacular mosque in the Philippines is the Masgit sa Buadi Sakayo located, a mosque in Lanao that resembles a Buddhist temple with okir motifs. Other early types of mosques are found in the eastern coasts of Lake Lanao, where some mosques have okir motifs and burak (centaur) depictions some mirrors engraved on the panels of the mosque. Some early type mosques also has inverted jars on top of their domes.\n\nIn Lanao, a huge drum called tabo is suspended horizontally inside the mosque and is beaten to call the believers to the mosque. Among the Yakan, a bamboo drum is used for calling people to worship. Inside the mosque, one does not find a pulpit (mimbar) but an elevated platform, a chair or a structure, where the khatib delivers his sermon. Philippine mosques do not have a sahn (courtyard) like those of Middle East mosques. Instead, they have benches outside where people sit and talk while waiting for the next prayer. According to Filipino Muslims, it is not permitted to discuss unIslamic matter inside the mosques.\n\nOverall, the types of mosque architecture in the Philippines can be divided into three, namely:\n\n\n \n"}

She came to the Catholic faith after a youth spent as a atheist. She has been cited by Cardinal Roger Etchegaray as an example for young people to follow in \"the arduous battle of holiness.\" Madeleine died unexpectedly from a brain hemorrhage in 1964.\n\nMadeleine Delbrel was born in Mussidan, France. Her father was of an artistic disposition, and Madeleine inherited his interest in and talent for writing. Throughout her childhood, she lived in several different places, and was never able to feel at home or make friends anywhere. Her parents were not religious, so Madeleine was an atheist by age of fifteen, experiencing life as absurd. At seventeen she wrote a tract titled: \"God is dead--long live!\" which expresses her view that death is the only certainty in life.\nConsequently, she lived life to the fullest, writing and illustrating poetry, studying philosophy and art at the Sorbonne in Paris, designing her own fashions, and being one of the first women of her society to cut her hair short.\nHowever, when her fiancé suddenly decided to join the Dominicans and her father went blind, her life fell apart. At the same time she began to notice that life did not seem absurd to her Christian friends, who still enjoyed life as much as she did. Suddenly, God's existence did not seem a complete impossibility anymore. She decided to kneel and pray, and also remembered Teresa of Avila's recommendation to silently think of God for five minutes each day.\nMadeleine called the year of 1924 the year of her conversion. For in praying she found God—or as she felt, he found her. To her he was someone to love just like any other person. At first she considered taking the veil and entering the Carmelite order, but then felt called upon to be in touch with people and help them lead happier lives. She joined the Girl Scouts, then led a group of women in Ivry, a small working-class town, with the goal of simply caring, consoling, aiding, and establishing good contact with the people. She then took a degree in Social Studies and was employed by the city government of Ivry, where she worked throughout World War II and thereafter.\n\nThere is a movement underway advocating for her beatification.\n\nFurther information may be found on her \n\n"}
{"id": "37743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37743", "title": "Mead", "text": "Mead\n\nMead (, from Old English \"medu\") is an alcoholic beverage created by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content ranges from about 3.5% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage's fermentable sugar is derived from honey. It may be still, carbonated, or naturally sparkling; dry, semi-sweet, or sweet.\n\nMead was produced in ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia, and has played an important role in the mythology of some peoples. In Norse mythology, for example, the Mead of Poetry was crafted from the blood of the wise being Kvasir and turned the drinker into a poet or scholar.\n\nThe terms \"mead\" and \"honey-wine\" often are used synonymously. Some cultures, though, differentiate honey-wine from mead. For example, Hungarians hold that while mead is made of honey, water and beer-yeast (barm), honey-wine is watered honey fermented by recrement of grapes or other fruits.\n\nPottery vessels dating from 7000 BC discovered in northern China have shown chemical signatures consistent with the presence of honey, rice, and organic compounds associated with fermentation. In Europe, it is first described from residual samples found in ceramics of the Bell Beaker Culture (c. 2800–1800 BCE).\n\nThe earliest surviving description of mead is in the hymns of the \"Rigveda\", one of the sacred books of the historical Vedic religion and (later) Hinduism dated around 1700–1100 BC. During the Golden Age of ancient Greece, mead was said to be the preferred drink. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) discussed mead in his \"Meteorologica\" and elsewhere, while Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) called mead \"militites\" in his \"Naturalis Historia\" and differentiated wine sweetened with honey or \"honey-wine\" from mead. The Hispanic-Roman naturalist Columella gave a recipe for mead in \"De re rustica\", about 60 CE.\n\nThere is a poem attributed to the Brythonic-speaking bard Taliesin, who lived around 550 CE, called the \"\" or \"Song of Mead\". The legendary drinking, feasting and boasting of warriors in the mead hall is echoed in the mead hall \"Din Eidyn\" (modern day Edinburgh) as depicted in the poem \"Y Gododdin\", attributed to the poet Aneirin who would have been a contemporary of Taliesin. In the Old English epic poem \"Beowulf\", the Danish warriors drank mead. In both Insular Celtic and Germanic cultures mead was the primary heroic drink in poetry.\n\nLater, taxation and regulations governing the ingredients of alcoholic beverages led to commercial mead becoming a more obscure beverage until recently. Some monasteries kept up the old traditions of mead-making as a by-product of beekeeping, especially in areas where grapes could not be grown.\n\nThe English \"mead\" – \"fermented honey drink\" – derives from the Old English \"meodu\" or \"medu\", and Proto-Germanic, *\"meduz\" (source also of Old Norse mjöðr, Danish mjød, Old Frisian and Middle Dutch mede, Old High German metu, German Met \"mead\").\n\n\"Madh\", and the related terms \"mad\" (मद, مد) and \"madira\" (मदिरा, مدِرا), also mean alcohol. These words are all derived from the Sanskrit language, and are Indo-European cognates of the English \"mead\", Greek \"μέθυ\", Avestan \"madu\", Persian \"may\", Latvian and Lithuanian \"medus\", German \"Met\" and Old Church Slavonic \"мєдъ\" (medŭ).\n\nIn this sense, these terms are also used for additional words related to alcohol. For instance, \"madhushala\" is a Hindi word for an establishment that serves alcohol, as is \"madiralaya\" (lit. \"abode of alcohol\", c.f. himalaya, \"abode of snow\"). \"Madmast\" (मदमस्त, مدمست) means \"intoxicated due to alcohol\", and is a word frequently used in poetry and song in the region, sometimes as a stylized reference to being in an emotional state resembling intoxication for other reasons, such as romantic love.\n\nThe yeast used in mead making is often identical to that used in wine making. Many home mead makers choose to use wine yeasts (particularly those used in the preparation of white wines) to make their meads.\n\nBy measuring the specific gravity of the mead once before fermentation and throughout the fermentation process by means of a hydrometer or refractometer, mead makers can determine the proportion of alcohol by volume that will appear in the final product. This also serves another purpose. By measuring specific gravity throughout fermentation, a mead maker can quickly troubleshoot a \"stuck\" batch, one where the fermentation process has been halted prematurely.\n\nMeads will often ferment well at the same temperatures in which wine is fermented.\n\nAfter primary fermentation slows down significantly the mead is then racked into a second container. This is known as secondary fermentation. Some larger commercial fermenters are designed to allow both primary and secondary fermentation to happen inside of the same vessel. Racking is done for two reasons: it lets the mead sit away from the remains of the yeast cells (lees) that have died during the fermentation process. Second, this lets the mead have time to clear. If the mead maker wishes to backsweeten the product or prevent it from oxidizing, potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate are added. After the mead clears, it is bottled and distributed.\n\nMead can have a wide range of flavors depending on the source of the honey, additives (also known as \"adjuncts\" or \"gruit\") including fruit and spices, the yeast employed during fermentation, and the aging procedure. Some producers have marketed white wine sweetened and flavored with honey after fermentation as mead, sometimes spelling it \"meade.\" This is closer in style to a hypocras. Blended varieties of mead may be known by the style represented; for instance, a mead made with cinnamon and apples may be referred to as either a cinnamon \"cyser\" or an apple metheglin.\n\nA mead that also contains spices (such as cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg), or herbs (such as meadowsweet, hops, or even lavender or chamomile), is called a \"metheglin\" .\n\nA mead that contains fruit (such as raspberry, blackberry or strawberry) is called a \"melomel\", which was also used as a means of food preservation, keeping summer produce for the winter. A mead that is fermented with grape juice is called a \"pyment\".\n\nMulled mead is a popular drink at Christmas time, where mead is flavored with spices (and sometimes various fruits) and warmed, traditionally by having a hot poker plunged into it.\n\nSome meads retain some measure of the sweetness of the original honey, and some may even be considered as dessert wines. Drier meads are also available, and some producers offer sparkling meads.\n\nThere are faux-meads, which are actually wines with honey added after fermentation as a sweetener and flavoring.\n\nHistorically, meads were fermented with wild yeasts and bacteria (as noted in the recipe quoted above) residing on the skins of the fruit or within the honey itself. Wild yeasts can produce inconsistent results. Yeast companies have isolated strains of yeast which produce consistently appealing products. Brewers, winemakers and mead makers commonly use them for fermentation, including yeast strains identified specifically for mead fermentation. These are strains that have been selected because of their characteristic of preserving delicate honey flavors and aromas.\n\nMead can also be distilled to a brandy or liqueur strength. A version called \"honey jack\" can be made by partly freezing a quantity of mead and straining the ice out of the liquid (a process known as freeze distillation), in the same way that applejack is made from cider.\n\nIn Finland, a sweet mead called \"\" (cognate with the root of zymurgy) is still an essential seasonal fermented product connected with the Finnish Vappu (May Day) festival. It is usually spiced by adding both the pulp and rind of a lemon. During secondary fermentation, raisins are added to control the amount of sugars and to act as an indicator of readiness for consumption; they will rise to the top of the bottle when the drink is ready. However, the sugar used in modern practice is typically brown sugar, not honey.\nEthiopian mead is called \"tej\" (ጠጅ, ) and is usually home-made. It is flavored with the powdered leaves and bark of \"gesho\", a hop-like bittering agent which is a species of buckthorn. A sweeter, less-alcoholic version called \"berz\", aged for a shorter time, is also made. The traditional vessel for drinking \"tej\" is a rounded vase-shaped container called a \"berele\".\n\nMead known as iQhilika is traditionally prepared by the Xhosa of South Africa.\n\nMead in Poland is part of culinary tradition for over a thousand years.\n\nIn the United States, mead is enjoying a resurgence, starting with small home meaderies and now with a number of small commercial meaderies. As mead becomes more widely available, it is seeing increased attention and exposure from the news media.\n\n\n\nMead is featured in many Germanic myths and folktales such as \"Beowulf\", as well as in other popular works that draw on these myths. Notable examples include books by J.K. Rowling, Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, T. H. White, and Neil Gaiman. It is often featured in books using a historical Germanic setting and in writings about the Viking age. Mead is mentioned many times in Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel, \"American Gods\"; it is referred to as the drink of the gods. In \"The Inheritance Cycle\" series by Christopher Paolini, the protagonist, Eragon, often drinks mead at feasts. It is also referenced in \"The Kingkiller Chronicle\" novel series by Patrick Rothfuss. The protagonist Kvothe is known to drink metheglin. The non-existent \"Greysdale Mead\" is also drunk, although it is merely water. The drink of mead is mentioned many times in Michael Crichton's \"Eaters of the Dead\" published 1976.\n\n\n"}

It taught the eventual salvation of all human beings and even of the demons, maintained that the soul of man cannot be defiled by bodily sin, and believed in a mystical state of illumination and union with God so perfect that it exempted from all subjection to moral and ecclesiastical laws and was an infallible pledge of salvation.\nBoth its leaders, Egidius Cantoris, an illiterate layman, and the Carmelite William of Hildernissen, near Bergen-op-Zoom, gloried in the visions with which they claimed to have been favoured. Cantoris in a moment of religious exaltation went so far as to run nude through the streets of Brussels, declaring himself the saviour of mankind.\nAbout 1410 Peter d'Ailly, Bishop of Cambrai, seems to have taken the first steps towards the suppression of the heresy. William of Hildernissen consented to a retraction, the sincerity of which appeared doubtful. In 1411, a second investigation resulted in another retraction, but also in a sentence compelling William to return permanently to an extra-diocesan Carmelite monastery after three years' detention in one of the episcopal castles.

Ñāṇavīra Thera's writings together with some the writings from others; Path Press Publications is an independent non-profit publisher of books by Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera and the writings of Samanera Bodhesako. It has its office in the Netherlands. \n\nThe Path Press is also a society whose goal is to explain and spread the doctrine of the Buddha. It was founded in Sri Lanka in 1987 by Samanera Bodhesako. Originally conceived as a limited effort to publish Clearing the Path but later become an entity who is holding copyrights of writing of Ñāṇavīra Thera and it consist of the small group of 4 bhikkhus and 5 layman (upāsakas) who are aspiring to make late Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera's teachings more available for those who are interested.\n\nPath Press was a name of convenience, originally intended to include those who, through the years, have contributed their various talents to bring \"Clearing the Path\" to realization. Path Press was not planned to be an ongoing publishing house. However, it now turns out that there remains sufficient worthwhile materials from the writings of the Venerable Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera to issue other volumes to the present work; and there are a few other writings, unpublished or now out of print, which, like \"Clearing the Path\", are of high quality, worthy of publication or reprinting. Therefore, it was established a publishing house, called 'Path Press Publications'.\n\nThese writings are probably not commercially viable; nor do they represent the views of any established sect, school or university which might sponsor their publication. The idea has been put forward that inasmuch as Path Press has already published one book of this type it could use that experience as a basis for issuing those occasional writings which are of exceptional merit and yet do not attract established publishers.\n\nClearing the Path was the most important work for Path Press. \n\nIn 1963, Ñāṇavīra Thera completed a book called Notes on Dhamma (1960–1963), which was privately published by the Honourable Lionel Samaratunga in the same year (250 copies). Following production of that volume, the author amended and added to the text, leaving at his death an expanded typescript, indicated by the titular expansion of its dates, (1960–1965). \"Notes on Dhamma\" has been variously described as \"arrogant, scathing, and condescending\", as \"a fantastic system\", and as \"the most important book to be written in this century\". Ñāṇavīra Thera himself remarked of the book that \"it is vain to hope that it is going to win general approval... but I do allow myself to hope that a few individuals... will have private transformations of their way of thinking as a result of reading them\". \n\nAnd the influence of \"Notes on Dhamma\" on Buddhist thinkers continues to increase more than three decades after its publication. This book has aroused extreme interest and controversy. The \"Notes\" \"attempt to provide an intellectual basis for the understanding of the Suttas without abandoning \"saddhā\" (faith)\"; that they \"have been written with the purpose of clearing away a mass of dead matter which is choking the Suttas\"; and that, above all, \"the \"Notes\" are designed to be an invitation to the reader to come and share the author's point of view\". The \"Notes\" assume that the reader's sole interest in the \"Pali Suttas\" is a concern for his own welfare. However, the \"Notes\", with their admitted intellectual and conceptual difficulties, are not the only way to discuss right view or to offer right-view guidance. \n\nLetters are a selection of 150 letters written by Ñāṇavīra Thera from his \"kuti\" in the Bundala Forest Reserve to local and foreign readers of the \"Notes\" who had requested explanation and clarification. Some are thinly disguised essays in a wholly modern idiom. The letters which are collected and published in \"Clearing the Path\" are not only something of a commentary on the \"Notes\"; they are, independently, a lucid discussion of how an individual concerned fundamentally with self-disclosure deals with the dilemma of finding himself in an intolerable situation, where the least undesirable alternative is suicide.\n\nWith openness, calmness, and considerable wit Ñāṇavīra Thera discusses with his correspondents (including his doctor, a judge, a provincial businessman, a barrister, a British diplomat, and another British citizen) the illnesses that plague him and what he can and cannot do about them, and about his own existence. His life as a Buddhist monk in a remote jungle abode is not incidental to the philosophy he expounds: the two are different aspects of the same thing, namely a vision that penetrates into the human situation both as universal and as particular, and recognizes that it is this situation which it is the business of each of us to resolve for ourselves. In presenting this view Ñāṇavīra Thera offers a contemporary exposition of the Teaching of the Buddha. In living this view he evokes a dramatic situation wherein an individual resolutely faces those questions which every lucid person must eventually face. The letters are in language, idiom and quotations from a galaxy of thinkers such as Camus, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Kafka. Though familiar to a Western reader, it can be incomprehensible in part, to anyone without such background.\n\nMost of the editorial work connected with Ñāṇavīra Thera's writings was performed by Sāmanera Bodhesako (Robert Smith), who died in Kathmandu in 1988. During the last years of his life in Sri Lanka he founded Path Press which published \"Clearing the Path: Writings of Ñāṇavīra Thera (1960-1965)\". He also worked as editor for the Buddhist Publication Society in Kandy which published \"The Tragic, The Comic & The Personal: Selected Letters of Ñāṇavīra Thera (Wheel 339/341)\" in 1987. Prof. Forrest Williams of the University of Colorado also participated as the co-editor of \"Clearing the Path\". It is now out of print. The Buddhist Cultural Centre decided to issue it in its two constituent parts, \"Notes on Dhamma\" and \"Letters\".\n\n\n"}

Upon the senior Ecleo's death in 1987, he was succeeded by his son Ruben B. Ecleo Jr. PBMA has an estimated million members in the central and southern Philippines and abroad. It was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in Makati, Philippines on October 19, 1965 under the Registration No. 28042. Its main office is located at San Jose, Province of Dinagat Islands.\n\n\"The Manila Times\" estimates the group has raised at least P35 million in entrance fees from its members since its founding\n\nAccording to sect doctrine, Ecleo Sr. was trained by \"voices\" to fluently read and write Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit, and Aramaic, in order to interpret the ancient mysteries. He also made predictions of the future based on Akashic records. PBMA followers also viewed Ecleo Sr. as a Christ-like figure, who could accomplish anything by reciting the Mantra, and like the Christ of the Bible, was also able to resurrect the dead. Ecleo's healing abilities were stated to have directly come from \"our Divine Father by virtue of the sacred or divine prayers which are called in Occultism as Mantras.\"\nSect leaders also stated that Ecleo Sr. has since his childhood been simultaneously present in many disparate locations, possibly as many different people. An example was his doing missionary work in Agusan del Sur, while also traveling in the province of Samar. All of his different persona possessed the ability to heal like the \"Lord Jesus who first applied these powers in Judea...\"\n\nGroup members, described by local media organizations as heavily armed and willing to die for their leader, are thwarting police efforts to arrest Ruben Ecleo Jr. A source for the \"Manila Times\" reported that armed PBMA members have made an oath to protect the \"master,\" referring to Ecleo, who was evading police efforts to arrest him for the murder of his wife, Alona Bacolod-Ecleo, a fourth year medical student. Alona was found strangled in a rubbish bag at the bottom of a cliff on Cebu island in January 2002.\n\nEcleo Jr. was arrested after a bloody raid by law enforcement on Dinagat on June 19, 2002. Gunfire had erupted as a joint force of Philippine National Police and troopers from the Philippine Army's 20th Infantry Battalion moved in to serve an arrest warrant. The raid had begun after negotiations had broken down and approximately 2,000 PBMA followers had surrounded Ecelo's mansion and barred all access. A firefight with Ecleo's elite team of bodyguards, known as the \"White Eagles\", then erupted and lasted through the night. Ecleo finally surrendered to police the next morning at 9 a.m. The gun battle during the night left 23 dead, including 1 police SWAT officer, and 16 armed PBMA members. During the raid, four members of his dead wife's family including Candy Ecleo were gunned down by a member of the PBMA security force in a possible cover-up attempt; the assailant was killed by police moments later, while attempting to flee the scene.\n\nIn October 2006, the Sandiganbayan sentenced Ecleo Jr. to thirty years in prison for entering a 1993 government contract in which the government lost about P2.4 million. He was found guilty of three counts of violation of the Republic Act 3019. His co-defendants, Anadelia Nalauan-Navarra and Ricardo Santillan, were convicted of twice violating the anti-graft laws and sentenced to six to ten years for each count.\n\nEcleo faces the parricide case before the Cebu City Regional Trial Court, Branch 23. However, the case dragged because six judges recused. On April 25, 2008, \n6th Judge Geraldine Faith Econg per 24-page resolution recused herself amid accusations and her own admission that two women approached her to ask how much would she need in payment for dropping the case.\n\nThere is often violence between the PBMA, other Christian groups, and the security forces in the islands. Such an incident occurred when approximately one hundred members of the rival Pulahan sect launched an assault on a PBMA shrine on the island of Dinagat, in turn two hundred PBMA members counterattacked and hacked to death ten Pulahan followers as well as their leader Edecio Quinanola.\n\n\nJesus Christ is the One True God, He is the Father in Creation, the Son in Redemption, the Holy Spirit in our Generation"}

It is also in use by the so-called Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF), where Sea Org staff may be sent as an opportunity to correct themselves, although it is considered by some a means of punishment. In some cases a person sometimes is audited for over a year, until the person considers, himself, \"free of evil intentions\".\n\nThis is a procedure that is intended to handle a psychotic break or complete mental breakdown. This rundown made worldwide headlines during the investigation of Lisa McPherson's death at the Fort Harrison Hotel.\n\nAlso known as \"Life Repair\". According to \"What is Scientology?\" (1978 edition), \"This is a brand new Rundown to be used by the Missions of the Church of Scientology in the handling of new public. This Rundown isolates and addresses the major area the individual has run up against in life that is causing him difficulty, and handles it through a specially formulated program exactly tailored to the individual's need.\" \n\nThe Primary Rundown \"consists of word clearing and Study Tech. It makes a student Super-Literate.\" It involves clearing (looking up in a dictionary and using in sentences) words encountered in past studies that were not understood. Additionally, one clears the more than 2000 words found on the Study Tapes and Student Hat course.\n\nThe PTS (\"Potential Trouble Source\") rundown is administered to Scientologists who have been designated PTS and must be assessed for Suppressive Person status. It is also for Scientologists (especially Sea Org members) who have fallen ill. It is a fundamental Scientology tenet that people with physical illnesses are PTS and/or \"out-Ethics\", meaning it is a \"holding back\" of the organization.\n\nThe Purification Rundown is a detoxification program involving the use of saunas, vitamins, and consuming oils, in excess of what accredited medicine considers safe levels.\n\nIn Hubbard's words, \"This rundown is for delivery to South Africans — those who reside in South Africa as well as those who have emigrated to other parts of the world. The South African Rundown has two parts: a. PTS handling; b. Help Processes.\" \n\nHubbard explaining his reasoning for a \"South African Rundown\", \"The South African native is probably the one impossible person to train in the entire world - he is probably impossible by any human standard.\" \n\nDescribed in the \"Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary\" as \"a super fantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anybody whether un Clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing Super Power of a thetan. This means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create a new world.\" The Super Power Building in Clearwater, Florida was built for the specific purpose of administering this rundown.\n\nAccording to Dan Koon, a former Scientologist, true information about the Super Power Rundown can be found in a document created by Hubbard himself in 1978, called the “Bright Think Rundown,” which describes how someone must “disassociate” from the past while “getting back into the current time frame.”\n\nThe purpose of this rundown is to increase a person's ability and willingness to relay information. This is important for those who brief, instruct, train, or supervise others.\n\nA rundown in which the preclear assesses what he wants to get rid of in his life. According to the \"Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary\", \"Handling of each thing the pc wants handled is dictated by what the \"thing\" (somatic, intention, terminal, condition, doingness) is.\" \n\n"}

In \"Then I was Guided\", the Shi'a author asks its Sunni audience how it is possible for both Abu Bakr and Fatimah to be \"Siddiq\", when contemplating their intense and deep conflicts, implying that logic demands one to be a liar, and arguing it can not be Muhammed's daughter . The Sunni view is that their conflict was a pure misunderstanding, not blemishing their trustworthiness.\n\nIn Hebrew the word/name \"Tzadik\" (צדיק), has a similar meaning.

One of the reliquaries, which is very ornate, is visible nowadays at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nThe reliquary of Stupa No.2 presents has inscriptions in Brahmi mentioning the names of Buddhist monks also appearing in the reliquary of Sanchi Stupa No.2 and Andher Stupas: Kasapagota, Majjhima, Kosikiputa, Gotiputa, and Apagira.

{"id": "50244807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50244807", "title": "Temple of Satet", "text": "Temple of Satet\n\nThe Temple of Satet or Satis was an Ancient Egyptian temple dedicated to the goddess Satet, a personification of the Nile inundation. The temple was located on the Nile Valley island of Elephantine, Egypt. Founded during the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC, it was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards over the next 3000 years until the Ptolemaic Period. The temple of Satet is the best example of an Ancient Egyptian temple whose construction is attested over the entire pharaonic period.\n\nThe earliest temple was built c. 3200 BC and was little more than a cultic niche lodged between three large natural granite boulders. This earliest temple was very small, housing a sanctuary of about that was made of mud bricks. In front of the sanctuary, on the East side, there were some mud brick houses. The temple was enlarged during the 1st and 2nd Dynasties and rebuilt during the Third Dynasty, but its old plan was kept. On the South side outside the niche between the boulders, some granaries were added. The temple was again rebuilt during the Fifth Dynasty, possibly under Nyuserre Ini, at which point the sanctuary located at the center of the rock niche was enlarged. In front of it was now a forecourt, about in size, which was surrounded by an open walkway. A deposit of votive offerings was discovered under the floor of the sanctuary. These were dedicated to the goddess over a few hundred years during the course of the Old Kingdom by both royal and private individuals and comprised mainly small faience figures, showing humans and animals. Beyond that, on the South side, granaries and a mud brick administrative building were located. \n\nPepi I, the second pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty oredered once more a rebuilding of the temple. The old plan was kept, but the brick walls were enlarged and a granite sanctuary for the goddess' statue was added. By this time, the god Khnum was also worshipped in the temple.\n\nTowards the end of the First intermediate period, in the early Eleventh Dynasty, the Theban king Intef III totally renovated the temple. The central chapel was left at its original place between the three natural boulders. The hall which stood in front of the chapel was paved and decorated with limestone slabs for the first time.\n\nShortly after, Mentuhotep II did further modifications in the temple, building an entirely new sanctuary. He added new inscriptions and, on the North side, a columned courtyard and a lake part of an installation to celebrate the Nile flood, which the Ancient Egyptians believed, started in Elephantine. The temple was then still mainly made out of mud bricks, with only the most important walls lined with decorated limestone blocks.\n\nLess than 100 years later, early in the subsequent dynasty, pharaoh Senusret I replaced Mentuhotep's structure with a totally new temple and courtyard. While all earlier building follow the same layout and exclusively used mud bricks, the new temple was entirely made in limestone. By this time, the level of the temple was above the rock niche of the Old Kingdom. However, the main sanctuary was built directly over the old one, therefore keeping the old tradition. The temple of Senusret I was fully decorated, but only few fragments of the decoration survived, these include the remains of a long inscription of the king. At the same time, the god Khnum was given his own separate temple on the island. The temple of Satet was originally adorned with many statues, among which is a statue of the Thirteenth Dynasty king Amenemhat V that bears a dedication to the goddess:\n\nAnother statue once adorning the temple belongs to king Senusret III. There is also a dyad of king Sobekemsaf I adoring the goddess that was certainly once in the temple. Indeed, even though these statues were all discovered in the nearby sanctuary of the local saint Heqaib, according to their inscriptions they must originally have been in the temple of Satet.\n\nDuring the New Kingdom period, the temple was built anew under queen Hatshepsut (1507–1458 BC) in the early 18th Dynasty and further enlarged by her successor, Thutmose III. The temple was then a solid rectangular building, some in size, completely surrounded by a walkway that had 7 × 10 pillars on the outside. The sanctuary of the new temple was placed directly over the sanctuary of the older periods. Evidently the New Kingdom temple kept the old tradition of the sanctuary's place. There are indications for further construction work during the 26th Dynasty (664–525 BC), but very little of that temple has survived. There are several blocks of a gateway that was once about high, that led to a brick enclosure wall, the latter perhaps once belonging to the temple. Shortly before the Persian conquest of Egypt, pharaoh Amasis II (570–526 BC) added a colonnade or kiosk to the temple. Six limestone columns and screen walls were found.\n\nA totally new temple was built under Ptolemy VI (180–145 BC), during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. It was again a rectangular building. At the back on the West side, there was the main sanctuary, in front of it there was a broad hall and in front of the latter two further smaller halls, with smaller rooms leading from them on the short sides. In front of the new temple was erected a free standing kiosk. The sanctuary was no longer built over the place of the Old Kingdom sanctuary. It seems that the location and its importance were forgotten. Ptolemy VIII (182–116 BC) finally added a pronaos to the temple with two by four columns.\n"}

This takes place in auditing, and is said to be a lifetime commitment. According to the church, by reaching Clear status, followers are more self-confident, happy, and generally successful in careers and interpersonal relationships. Beyond the state of Clear, Scientologists move through several auditing steps called Operating Thetan (OT) levels. An OT is a state of spiritual awareness in which an individual is able to control self and the environment. According to D. R. Christensen, Scientology is \"an individualistic religion with a hierarchical organization of the soteriological system, called the Bridge\". The Bridge is described by the church as a series of soteriological steps.\n\nThe Bridge is broken down into two parallel paths, Training and Processing. Processing addresses the Scientologist's \"case\" or how they function in life as influenced by their \"aberrations\". The Training path teaches Hubbard's theories on the nature of life and the universe and the techniques of auditing. Participants feel that this knowledge greatly enhances their ability to be effective in life whether they audit another or not. Scientologists can travel up either side of the Bridge and many do both sides. Although not part of the formal Bridge, the chart also lists many optional courses and training actions that can be done by Scientologists.\n\nThe Bridge was a result of the culmination of the foundational work on Dianetics and Scientology training that Hubbard had established in the mid-1960s. In 1965, Hubbard published The Bridge to Freedom, which includes the “Classification and Gradation Chart,” which, according to new religious movement specialist James R. Lewis, discusses the steps that church members must follow as they learn and study Scientology. The chart was a summary of the results of Hubbard’s experimentation since the Hubbard Dianetics Research Foundation was founded fifteen years before that time. Save for adjustments and addendums over several years, it delineated the program for reaching Clear status and becoming an Operating Thetan.\n\nScientologists believe that if an individual is unable to ascend through the Bridge in this lifetime, he or she can continue the journey up the Bridge in another life.\n\n"}

{"id": "30942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30942", "title": "Tobacco", "text": "Tobacco\n\nTobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus \"Nicotiana\" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is \"N. tabacum\". The more potent variant \"N. rustica\" is also used around the world.\n\nTobacco contains the alkaloid nicotine, which is a stimulant, and harmala alkaloids. Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.\n\nTobacco use is a risk factor for many diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.\n\nThe English word \"tobacco\" originates from the Spanish and Portuguese word \"\". The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived at least in part, from Taino, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taino, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552) or to \"tabago\", a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as \"cohiba\").\n\nHowever, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 to define medicinal herbs believed to have originated from the Arabic \"ṭubbāq\" (also \"ṭubāq\"), a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, as a name for various herbs.\n\nTobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BC. Many Native American tribes have traditionally grown and used tobacco. Eastern North American tribes historically carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item, as well as smoking it, both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement. In some populations, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.\n\nFollowing the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. Hernández de Boncalo, Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the Old World in 1559 following orders of King Philip II of Spain. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of Toledo, more specifically in an area known as \"Los Cigarrales\" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (\"cigarras\" in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the \"midwakh\" or \"kiseru\" or smoking newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah (see thuốc lào for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin.\n\nThe alleged benefits of tobacco also account for its considerable success. The astronomer Thomas Harriot, who accompanied Sir Richard Grenville on his 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island, explains that the plant \"openeth all the pores and passages of the body\" so that the natives’ \"bodies are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted.\" \n\nTobacco smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.\n\nTobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.\n\nIn the late 19th century, cigarettes became popular. James Bonsack created a machine that automated cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the late-20th century.\n\nFollowing the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco became condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became encompassed as a cause for cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the lawsuit in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.\n\nIn the 1970s, Brown & Williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce Y1. This strain of tobacco contained an unusually high amount of nicotine, nearly doubling its content from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to use this strain as evidence that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.\n\nIn 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and its enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. This led to the development of tobacco cessation products.\n\nMany species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs \"Nicotiana\". It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.\n\nMost nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. However, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.\n\nDespite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores, a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on \"Nicotiana\" species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival. As a result, some tobacco plants (chiefly \"N. glauca\") have become established as invasive weeds in some places.\n\nThe types of tobacco include:\n\n\nTobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (\"Epitrix cucumeris\" or \"E. pubescens\"), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco is sown in cold frames or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light.\n\nIn the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor.\n\nAfter the plants are about tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in — all in one motion.\n\nTobacco is cultivated annually, and can be harvested in several ways. In the oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of \"primings\", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Before this, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed, and eventually, entirely harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia.\n\nCuring and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves, and gives a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the \"smoothness\" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which glycates protein, and is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a caramelization process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer. Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.\n\nTobacco can be cured through several methods, including:\n\n\nSome tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as \"fermenting\" or \"sweating\". Cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a \"casing\" solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.\n\nProduction of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced. According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced. The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%. During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased. China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004, it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.\n\nEvery year, about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).\n\nAround the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land. While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income. As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.\n\nIndia's Tobacco Board is headquartered in Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh. India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India. Around 0.25% of India's cultivated land is used for tobacco production.\n\nSince 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Mysore, and West Bengal houses the core research institute.\n\nIn Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity. Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area. In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galpão Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes.\nBrazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco, but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the \"Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar\".\n\nThe International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work. The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations.\nIn late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors. They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.\n\nMajor tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries. This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%. Tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product.\n\nTobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.\n\nTobacco crops extract nutrients (such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) from soil, decreasing its fertility.\n\nFurthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process. Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.\n\nIn 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.\n\nSeveral tobacco plants have been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from \"N. tabacum\" cultivar 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology. Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\" to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. This research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.\n\nBecause of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first GM crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.\n\nMany varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for bioremediation, have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.\n\nCurrently, only the US is producing GM tobacco. The Chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in China in 1997. In the US, cigarettes made with GM tobacco with reduced nicotine content are available under the market name Quest.\n\nTobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:\n\n\nSmoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in Japan, during the Edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.\n\nFollowing the American Civil War, the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with masculinity and power. Today, tobacco use is often stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns. Bhutan is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal. Due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.\n\nResearch on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. An estimated 1.1 billion people, and up to one-third of the adult population, use tobacco in some form. Smoking is more prevalent among men (however, the gender gap declines with age), the poor, and in transitional or developing countries.\n\nRates of smoking continue to rise in developing countries, but have leveled off or declined in developed countries. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006, falling from 42% to 20.8% in adults. In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.\n\nTobacco smoking poses a risk to health due to the inhalation of poisonous chemicals in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide, cyanide, and carcinogens which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and Cancer.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. The WHO estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe tobacco use as \"the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide.\"\n\nThe harms caused by inhalation of poisonous chemicals such as carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke include diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancers). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances present in tobacco smoke.\n\nInhaling secondhand tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.\n\nThe addictive alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of enforcement value. Nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids on drug effect questionnaire liking scales, which are a rough indicator of addictive potential. Users may develop tolerance and dependence. Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene), formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to the harmful effects of smoking. Tobacco's overall harm to user and self score as determined by a multi-criteria decision analysis was determined at 3 percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking 6th most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed.\n\nPolonium 210 is a natural contaminant of tobacco, providing additional evidence for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer. It is also extremely toxic, with one microgram being enough to kill the average adult (250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide by weight).\n\nTobacco has a significant economic impact. The global tobacco market has been approximated to be US$760 billion (excluding China). Statistica estimates that in the U.S. alone the tobacco industry has a market of US$121 billion despite the fact the CDC reports that US smoking rates are declining steadily. In the US, the decline in the number of smokers, the end of the Tobacco Transition Payment Program in 2014, and competition from growers in other countries, made tobacco farming economics more challenging.\n\n\"Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor\", and of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies.\n\nSmoking of tobacco is practised worldwide by over one billion people. However, while smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others and is increasing among women and in developing countries. Between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. Women's smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.\n\nIn Indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. In Egypt, more than 10% of households' expenditure in low-income homes is on tobacco. The poorest 20% of households in Mexico spend 11% of their income on tobacco.\n\nTobacco advertising of tobacco products by the tobacco industry is through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. It is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59090881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59090881", "title": "Women in Daoism", "text": "Women in Daoism\n\nThe roles of women in Daoism have differed from the traditional patriarchy over women in ancient and imperial China. Chinese women had special importance in some Daoist schools that recognized their transcendental abilities to communicate with deities, who frequently granted women with revealed texts and scriptures. Women first came to prominence in the Highest Clarity School, which was founded in the 4th century by a woman, Wei Huacun. The Tang dynasty (618-907) was a highpoint for the importance of Daoist women, when one-third of the Shangqing clergy were women, including many aristocratic Daoist nuns. The number of Daoist women decreased until the 12th century when the Complete Perfection School, which ordained Sun Bu'er as the only woman among its original disciples, put women in positions of power. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women Daoists practiced and discussed \"nüdan\" (女丹, \"women's \"neidan\" inner alchemy\"), involving gender-specific practices of breath meditation and visualization. Furthermore, Daoist divinities and cults have long traditions in China, for example, the Queen Mother of the West, the patron of \"xian\" immortality, He Xiangu, one of the Eight Immortals, and Mazu, the protectress of sailors and fishermen. \n\nSince organized Daoism began in the late Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), women have been active in different schools, which gave them diverse names. In the Tianshi dao (Way of the Celestial Masters), they were called \"nüshi\" (女士 or 女師, \"female masters\") when married to a Master, or \"nüguan\" (女官, \"female officers\") when among chosen \"zhongmin\" (種民, \"seed people\"). In the Shangqing (Highest Clarity) School, Daoist nuns were most often solitary practitioners, and called \"nü daoshi\" (女道士, \"female Daoists\" or \"female Daoist masters\") or \"nüguan\" (女冠, \"female hats\", describing a distinctive ritual headdress) in the Song dynasty. The Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) School uses \"daogu\" (道姑, \"ladies of the Dao\") in reference to both convent nuns and devout laity (Despeux 2000: 384, 2008: 171). \n\nXiwang mu, the Queen Mother of the West, is the most prominent female Daoist divinity, although her traditions predated organized Daoist religions (Despeux 2008: 172). Sources from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) associate the Queen Mother with shamanistic traditions, such as her familiar the three-legged crow, and her peaches of immortality orchard (Despeux 2000: 386). The c. 3rd century BCE \"Shanhaijing\" (Classic of Mountains and Seas) says, \"In appearance, Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, but she has a leopard's tail and the fangs of a tigress, and she is good at whistling. She wears a victory crown on her tangled hair. She presides over the Catastrophes from the Sky and the Five destructive Forces.\" (tr. Birrell 2000: 24)\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), people believed that the Queen Mother could protect them from disease and death, and she became the central figure worshiped by a peasant cult that arose in Shandong and swept through the country in 3 BCE (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 27). Xiwang mu became known as the goddess of epidemics who resided in the west on Kunlun Mountain and ruled over the demons of pestilence. Her cults worshiped the Queen in different regions of China, especially Mount Heng in Hunan, Mount Hua in Shaanxi, and Mount Wuyi in Fujian.\n\nUnder the Six Dynasties, the Queen mother's cult was integrated into the pantheon of Shangqing (Highest Clarity) Daoism and she became one of the school's key goddesses, helping both sexes at this time. Her worship peaked during the Tang period, when she emerged particularly as the protectress of women, and was revered as the representative of the female ideal (Cahill 1993). Since the Song dynasty, Xiwang mu's cult in official Daoism has been increasingly supplanted by that of other goddesses. She has nevertheless continued to be a major figure in sectarian movements and small congregational groups who received messages from her through \"fuji\" spirit writing. Descending onto the altar during séances, under the Ming and Qing she took on the title Wusheng Laomu (無生老母, Unborn Venerable Mother), and still remains a key goddess worshiped by women, especially in popular settings (Despeux 2000: 387).\n\nWomen began to become important in organized Daoism during the Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties (221–590) and Sui dynasty (590–618) periods. In the 4th century the Shangqing School recognized a woman, Wei Huacun (251-334), as the school's founder. Women in this Daoist school transmitted scriptures, taught methods, and served as initiators (Despeux 2008: 171). \n\nMarried to a leading Tianshi officer, Wei Huacun became a respected \"jijiu\" (祭酒, libationer), which means that she received a thorough religious education in the organization, including sexual rites of passage and the reception of official registers (Despeux 2000: 388). Her hagiography says that she attained the Dao on Mount Heng, which at the time was a highly active center of both Buddhist and Daoist practices (Faure 1987). She was accordingly called Nanyue furen (南嶽夫人, Lady of the Southern Marchmount). After this time, she became the object of an important cult which, especially under the Tang (Schafer 1977) became prominent among women Daoists and spread throughout China (Strickmann 1979: 142).\n\nAccording to a Six Dynasties' text, the Tianshi School distinguished five different types of women suited to become Daoist practitioners: young unmarried girls, women unable to marry due to an inauspicious horoscope, women forced into marriage, widows, and rejected wives (Overmyer 1991: 99-101). These were all undesirable classes, rejected by society, to which Tianshi offered a form of escape and an alternative. Such a status allowed these women to have at least some role and not be excluded completely. The same pattern also held true for other Daoist schools and periods, especially during the Tang dynasty (Despeux 2000: 385).\n\nThe status of women in Daoism reached a peak during the Tang dynasty (618–907), particularly in the 8th century, when women formed one-third of the clergy (Despeux 2008: 171). Under the auspices of the Shangqing School, which dominated organized Daoism under the Tang, women reached their most prominent religious positions as initiators, preceptors, and possessors of sacred texts and methods. This was actively supported by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712-56), whose \"passions for women and Daoism extended to women Daoists\". According to the official statistics, there were 1,687 Daoist temples in the 8th century: 1,137 for men and 550 for women. Women thus constituted an important part of the Daoist clergy as it was recognized officially (Despeux 2000: 388).\n\nThe rise of aristocratic Daoist nuns during the Tang was an unprecedented development in Chinese society and history. More than ten imperial daughters became ordained Daoists and converted their residences into convents (Schafer 1985: 1). Separated from the Chinese social order through their religious conversion, the women could both maintain their political influence and avoid palace intrigues. They economically benefited from their new status, enjoying a remarkable degree of personal freedom for a Tang woman, often led a licentious life, traveled extensively, and devoted themselves to the arts (Despeux 2000: 388). \n\nWomen would enter Daoist convents for differing reasons, such as girls purifying their lives before entering society or widows seeking a better life. Sometimes a woman would become a Daoist nun in order to escape an unwanted marriage or to change her husband. Princess Taiping, the youngest daughter of Emperor Gaozong (r. 649-683) and Empress Wu, entered a Daoist convent in 670 to escape a requested marriage of state with the king of \"barbarian\" Turpan (Despeux 2000: 389). Yang Guifei (Most Honorable Consort Yang), the beloved concubine of Emperor Xuanzong, was married to Li Mao, the emperor's eighteenth son, who she left by becoming a Daoist nun in 745, which then allowed her to enter Xuanzong's imperial harem (Schafer 1978).\n\nA celebrated example of noble Daoist nuns was the elaborate 711 ordination ceremony of two imperial princesses, Xining (西寧) and Changlong (昌隆), the eighth and ninth daughters of Emperor Ruizong of Tang (r. 684-90) and sisters of Emperor Xuanzong (Despeux 2008: 172). The Daoist ritualist Zhang Wanfu (張萬福) described the princesses' splendiferous 14-day ordination rite, and noted the widespread criticism from ministers and officials about the high costs (Benn 1991:148-151). The emperor also ordered the construction of two monasteries for his daughter nuns in Chang'an, nearby the imperial concubines (Despeux 2000: 388).\n\nOfficial Daoism incorporated several female-based cults during the Tang. While local cults had always flourished in the north and northwest of China, they predominantly began in the maritime and central regions of the east and south where divine women, including goddesses, shamanesses, and cultic founders, grew in stature and often became objects of pilgrimages undertaken equally by men and women (Schafer 1973). Daoist texts often described the integration of regional divinities into the official pantheon as conquests, and praised female Daoists for their exceptional powers as prophets, healers, and saviors (Despeux 2000: 390).\n\nThe lesser-known Qingwei (清微, Pure Subtlety) school, a tradition that emphasized therapy and exorcism, incorporated a local cult founded by the Daoist priestess Zu Shu (祖舒, fl. 889-904) from Lingling (near present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) (Despeux 2008: 172). Unlike the well-documented biography of Wei Huacun, little is known about Zu. After receiving ordination in the traditions of Daoist Tianshi, Shangqing, and Lingbao schools, she went to Guiyang (present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) where she met Lingguang shengmu (靈光聖母, Holy Mother of Numinous Radiance), who transmitted to Zu Shu the Way of Pure Subtlety together with talismans and exorcism techniques, said to have been passed down from Yuanshi Tianzun (Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning) (Despeux 2000: 390). Later Qingwei followers placed Zu at the head of their \"patriarchal\" lineage, which Chen Cai (陳采) first constructed in the 13th-century \"Qingwei xianpu\" (清微仙普, Account of the Immortals of Pure Subtlety) (Boltz 1987: 38-39). According to Catherine Despeux, Zu Shu seems more like a southern shaman than a religious visionary. Rather than an active founder, she appears in the Pure Subtlety school mainly as a preceptor who transmitted methods that she learned from another woman (2000: 391).\n\nIn the early Song dynasty (960–1279) the number of women Daoists declined to about 3-5% of the registered clergy and only rose again later, with the emergence of the Quanzhen School in the late 12th century during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). Nevertheless, cults of women continued to flourish and there were some senior female practitioners of various techniques (Despeux 2000: 391).\n\nAmong the cults, in addition to the Queen Mother of the West, the Daoist pantheon includes other well-known female divinities. For instance, He Xiangu (Immortal Maiden He), one of the Eight Immortals, whose cult was established between the Tang and Song dynasties (Despeux 2008: 172). \n\nThe cult of Linshui furen (臨水夫人, the Lady of the Water's Edge), or Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑, 767-791), became popular during the Song era. According to Daoist tradition, she was born with various supernatural abilities, but died young and pregnant during a rain-making ritual. Her powers began to manifest after her death and she gradually grew into the protectress of women, children, and \"jitong\" (乩童, boy mediums) (Despeux 2008: 172). The cult first developed in Chen's home state of Min (Fujian), and then was canonized in the Song as Linshui furen. Many practices of this women's movement were shamanistic, Linshui furen and her sisters were praised as magicians, controllers of demons, exorcists, and healers who could undertake shamanic travels into the afterlife. Linshui furen's cult grew and established her more formally as a divinity, and her fame spread more widely (Despeux 2000: 391). Later this Daoist cult became particularly prominent in Taiwan, where the Lady of the Water's Edge served as a focal point for communities of women who refused marriage but did not wish to become celibate, and instead preferred lesbian life (Berthier 1988).\n\nAmong female Daoist practitioners, Cao Wenyi (曹文逸, fl. 1119-1125) was a renowned author who was posthumously honored as the first woman to practice \"neidan\" inner alchemy. Song bibliographies list her writings to include commentaries on various Daoist texts, including the \"Xishengjing\" (Scripture of Western Ascension) and \"Daodejing\", and a long poem on \"neidan\" entitled \"Lingyuan dadao ge\" (靈源大道歌, Song of the Great Dao, the Numinous Source) (Despeux 2008: 172). It begins, \"I am telling all you ladies straight: The stem of destiny grows from perfect breathing that irradiates the body and provides long life, whether empty or not empty, and brings forth the numinous mirror which contains Heaven and all beings.\" (tr. Despeux and Kohn 2003: 137). Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100-1125) heard of Cao's fame, called her to the capital Kaifeng, and conferred the title Wenyi zhenren (文逸真人, Perfected One of Literary Withdrawal). In the Qing dynasty, Lady Cao supposedly appeared in spirit-writing séances and was venerated by several lineages of women's inner alchemy﹒ Some of her writings are preserved in the White Cloud Temple in Beijing, where the Daoist Qingjing (清靜, Purity and Tranquility) school honors her as their patroness (Despeux 2000: 391-392).\n\nWhile women were of lesser importance in Daoism through most of the Song, their position rose again with the growth of the Quanzhen School, in which they served as abbesses of major temples and leaders of local associations. The Quanzhen list of seven masters includes a woman, Sun Bu'er (1119-1183). She was born into a powerful local family in Ninghai in Shandong, received a literary education, and married Ma Yu (馬鈺, 1123-1183) who also became one of the seven masters (Cleary 1989). When the Quanzhen founder Wang Chongyang visited Ninghai in 1167, Ma Yu and Sun Bu'er became active disciples. She later became a senior leader, ordained as Qjngjing sanren (清靜散人, Serene Lady of Purity and Tranquility), with the right to teach and ordain other woman followers (Despeux 2000: 392).\n\nWhile the cult of Sun Bu'er became increasingly important during the Yuan (1271–1368), Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties, the general prestige of Daoist women decreased. Under the Yuan dynasty, when the Mongols governed China, there were 20,000 registered Daoists, many of them women, and institutions run by and for women were established throughout the country (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 152). References to women in Daoism become less frequent in the late Yuan and early Ming periods, and hagiographies of women are rare. The image of women became more complex in Qing sectarianism, which witnessed a revival of the tendency to honor women as matriarchs (Despeux 2008: 172). The Qing rulers instituted the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion, and forced Buddhists and Daoists to use the same institutions. Some Daoist subsects and local groups had lineages that go back to a woman founder. In addition, Qing authors wrote texts specifically dealing with inner alchemy for women (Despeux 2000: 393).\n\nCults of female deities developed mainly in the southern and coastal regions of Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong. Cult sites in these provinces were centers of intense religious activity and pilgrimage sites that attracted both male and female devotees. Beginning in the Tang period, the growth and reputation of the cults depended on their recognition by official Daoist institutions, learned circles, and the imperial court (Despeux 2008: 172).\n\nThe Daoist pantheon adopted several popular goddesses. One of them is the Buddhist goddess Marici, the personification of light and daughter of the creator god Brahma who rules destiny (Getty 1962: 132-134). In Daoism, she appears as Doumu (斗母, Mother of the Big Dipper) and protectress against violence and peril (Despeux 2000: 393). \n\nThe cult of Bixia yuanjun (碧霞元君, Goddess of the Morning Clouds) began in the Song with the discovery of a statue on Mount Tai, and during the Ming she was venerated as the daughter of Dongyue dadi (東岳大帝, Great Deity of Mount Tai), and merciful helper of dead souls (Naquin 1992: 334-345). As documented in the \"Bixia yuanjun huguo baosheng jing\" (碧霞元君護國保生經, Scripture on the Guarding of Life and Protection of the Country through the Goddess of the Morning Clouds), she was officially integrated into the pantheon through formal empowerment by Yuanshi Tianzun (Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning), who reportedly gave her the necessary spells and talismans for helping people (Despeux 2000: 393).\n\nThe water deity Mazu (Ancestral Mother) or Tianfei (天妃, Celestial Consort), the tutelary of seafarers and fishermen, is prominent among the emerging new Daoist goddesses, and parallels the Buddhist goddess of compassion Guanyin who similarly saves mariners. She is the deification of the shamaness Lin Moniang (林默娘, 960-987) a fisherman' s daughter from Meizhou Island off Fujian. Refusing to marry, she practiced self-cultivation until she was able to command nature in order to protect herself, and then used her powers to rescue her father and brothers whenever they were in danger of drowning. After an early death, her spirit powers increased and she became famous for safeguarding fishermen and traveling merchants (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 65). The Mazu cult began in Fujian at the end of the 10th century, and by the 13th had spread throughout the maritime coastal provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui (Despeux 2008: 172). In the present day, her cult has spread throughout Southeast Asia and overseas Chinese communities, with major Chinese sanctuaries in Tianjin and Quanzhou, 510 temples in Taiwan, and 40 in Hong Kong (Despeux 2000: 393-394).\n\nSources on women in Daoism include both collections of biographies of \"xian\" (\"immortals; transcendents\"), technically \"hagiographies\" insofar as \"xian\" are saints, and works by women authors, particularly about \"neidan\" inner alchemy.\n\nDaoist biographical compilations, dating back to the c. 2nd century CE \"Liexian zhuan\" and 4th century \"Shenxian zhuan\", generally include hagiographies of both men and women, but there are two works dealing exclusively with the lives of women in Daoism (Despeux 2008: 173).\n\nThe first text is the 913 \"Yongcheng jixian lu\" (墉城集仙錄, Records of the Immortals Gathered in the Walled City), compiled by the Daoist priest and author Du Guangting (850-933). Du's preface says the original text contained 109 hagiographies of Shangqing masters, but the received text exists in two partial versions, with 37 biographies in the canonical \"Daozang\" and 28 in the \"Yunji Qiqian\" anthology, only two of which are identical. Based on the extant fragments of the collection, the majority of Daoist women presented belonged to the Shangqing School during the Tang. In his preface Du Guangting emphasizes that, according to Shangqing teachings, the Primordial Father (Yuanfu 元父) and the Metal Mother Jinmu 金母) are in charge of entering the names of male and female adepts in the heavenly registers of immortality, which are overseen by Xiwangmu, protectress of the immortals of Yongcheng, the Heavenly Walled City on Mount Kunlun. This description does not imply any form of gender hierarchy or preference, but rather shows a complementarity between the two, echoing earlier periods when worship of the Queen Mother was dominant among popular cults (Despeux 2000: 394-395). The 3rd-century \"Bowuzhi\" (Record of Ample Things) quotes Laozi that, \"all people are under the care of the Queen Mother of the West. Only the destinies of kings, sages, men of enlightenment, immortals and men of Dao are cared for by the Lord of the Nine Heavens.\" (tr. Greatrex 1987: 78).\n\nThe second is the \"Houji\" 後集 (Later Compilation) portion of \"Lishi zhenxian tidao tongjian\" (歷世真仙體道通鋻, Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals and Those Who Embodied the Dao through the Ages), compiled by the Yuan hagiographer Zhao Daoyi (趙道一, fl. 1294-1307) of the Quanzhen school. The text contains 120 biographies, including many found in the \"Yongcheng jixian lu\", and combines mythic Daoist deities, such as Laozi's mother Wushang yuanjun (無上元君, All-Highest Goddess), Doumu, and Xiwangmu, with real women, including fourteen biographies of Song women (Despeux 2000: 394-395).\nEmperor Xuanzong's younger sister Yuzhen gongzhu (玉真公主, Princess of Jade Perfection) who became a Daoist nun wrote two texts, both dated 738: the \"Qionggong wudi neisi shangfa\" (瓊宮五帝內思上法, Highest Methods of Visualizing the Five Emperors of the Jasper Palace) and \"Lingfei liujia neisi tongling shangfa\" (靈飛六甲內思通靈上法, Highest Methods of Visualizing the Flying Spirits of the Six Jia to Communicate with the Divine). Both describe meditation methods used in the Shangqing school, and her calligraphy was preserved in a Tang calligraphic collection by Zhong Shaojing.\n\nThe 848 \"Huangting neijing wuzang liufu buxie tu\" (黃庭內景五臟六腑補瀉圖, Illustrated Description of the Tonification or Dispersion of the Five Organs and Six Viscera According to the Yellow Court Scripture) was written by the Tang Daoist physiologist Hu Jin (胡惜), said to have been taught by the mythological Sunü (素女, Immaculate Girl) on Mount Taibai in Shaanxi. This text contains a discussion of the central organs in the human body, and lists \"neidan\" therapies for internal ailments, including drugs, energy absorptions, dietary restrictions, and gymnastic exercises. They correspond with the meditational techniques from the c. 4th-century \"Yellow Court Classic\" that were popular during the Tang (Despeux 2000: 396). The illustrations have been long lost, but the book is \"full of therapy and pharmacy, throwing valuable light on the borderline between medicine and Taoist physiological alchemy\" (Needham and Lu 1983: 82).\n\nCao Wenyi's 12th-century \"Lingyuan dadao ge\" (靈源大道歌, Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source) is also attributed to He Xiangu, the only female of the Eight Immortals. This lengthy Chan Buddhism- influenced poem does not specifically mention anything female, but Qing Daoists associated its author with women's inner alchemical practices, and the text was accordingly included into collections on the subject (Despeux 2000: 396).\n\nA corpus of Daoist literature concerning \"nüdan\" (女丹, women's [inner] alchemy), or \"kundao\" (坤道, \"the female way\", with \"kun\" \"female; 8th of the 8 trigrams, ☷), comprises about thirty documents of unequal length, dating from 1743 to 1892. These texts are generally attributed to both male and female divinities and said to have been transmitted through spirit-writing (Despeux 2008: 173). The few earlier sources that specifically mentioned \"neidan\" practices for women were typically in terms of yin and yang correlations. Since yin is associated with women and left while yang with men and right, the breath supposedly turns toward the left in men and toward the right in women (Despeux 2000: 406).\n\nThe 1834 \"Daozang xubian\" (道藏續編, Supplement to the Daoist Canon), edited by Min Yide (閔一得), contains two consecutive works about women's internal alchemy. First, the \"Xiwang mu nüxiu zhengtu shize\" (西王母女修正途十則, Ten Principles of the Queen Mother of the West on the Correct Path of Female Cultivation, tr. Wile 1992: 193-201) was revealed in 1795 by Sun Bu'er to Li Niwan (李泥丸). The original title was \"Nü jindan jue\" (女金丹訣, Women's Formula of the Golden Elixir). The text shows some Tantric Buddhist influence, and presents ten rules specifically for women's practice, including techniques on how to intercept menstruation, breast massages, visualization of \"qi\" meridians in the body, and breath meditation exercises (Despeux 2000: 397; 2008: 173). Second, the \"Niwan Li zushi nüzong shuangxiu baofa\" (泥丸李祖師女宗雙修寶筏, Precious Raft of Women's Double Cultivation According to Master Li Niwan), subtitled \"Nügong zhinan\" (女功指南, A Compass of Women's Practice), was also revealed to Li in 1795. The text explains nine rules for the progressive transformation of the adept's body, including calming and purifying the spirit, increasing energy circulation through breast massages, eventually leading to the accumulation of wisdom, and formation of a new spiritual \"body of light\" within the adept's body (Despeux 2000: 397-398).\n\nHe Longxiang's (賀龍驤) \"Nüdan hebian\" (女丹合編, Collected Works on Inner Alchemy for Women) was included in the 1906 edition \"Daozang jiyao\" (道藏輯要, Essentials of the Daoist Canon). His preface notes that he spent thirty years collecting and compiling the collection, based on the practices undertaken by the Daoist women in his family. The materials consist of about twenty prose and poetry texts that outline the various major stages of the inner alchemical path, precisely describe the energy meridians, and make clear distinctions between men's and women's practices (Despeux 2000: 398).\n\nThe \"Nü jindan fayao\" (女金丹法要, Essential Methods of Women's Golden Elixir), by Fu Jinquan (傅金銓, 1765-1844), mostly consists of poems and prose texts revealed by Sun Bu'er through planchette writing. The author emphasizes the importance of cultivating companionship with others and the necessity of performing virtuous acts. Women adepts are supposed to purify their karma, repent their sins, and cultivate goodness, sincerity, filial piety, and proper wifely devotion (Despeux 2000: 398). Fu Jinquan also compiled \"nüdan\" texts in the early 19th century collection \"Daoshu shiqi zhong\" (道書十七種, Seventeen Books on the Dao) (Despeux 2008: 173). \n\nThe \"Nüzi daojiao congshu\" (女子道教叢書, Collection of Daoist Writings for Women), compiled by Yi Xinying (易心瑩, 1896-1976), contains eleven texts, describing women's liturgy, women's Daoist lineages, the principles of body transmutation, interception of menses, and interior cultivation (Despeux 2000: 398).\n\nWritings on inner alchemy for women emphasize the \"shengtai\" (聖胎, \"Sacred Embryo; Immortal Embryo\") of sainthood. The process has three stages transforming the Three Treasures of \"jing\" (, \"essence; semen; menstrual fluid\"), \"qi\" (, \"vitality; energy; breath\"), and \"shen\" (, \"spirit; deity; supernatural being\"). First, refining the \"jing\" essence and transforming it into \"qi\" energy; second, refining the energy and transforming it into \"shen\" spirit; and third, refining the spirit to return to (\"xu\" 虛) emptiness. In the first stage, the adept transforms the various yin and yang forces within the body into an embryo of energy. During the second stage and in the course of ten symbolic months, this embryo gives birth to the \"yuanshen\" (元神, original spirit force). This birth takes place through the fontanelle, because the alchemical process inverts the course of natural procedures. This luminous spirit leaves and re-enters the body, and then is further sublimated in the third stage to eventually merge back completely into cosmic emptiness (Despeux 2000: 406).\n\nOnly the first stage differentiates practices between men and women. In \"neidan\" terminology, semen is called \"baihu\" (白虎, White Tiger) and menstrual blood is \"chilong\" (赤龍, Red Dragon). Instead of refining seminal essence and transforming it into energy, women refine their menstrual blood by progressively diminishing their flow and eventually stopping it altogether. This is known as \"duan chilong\" (斷赤龍, \"cutting off the Red Dragon\") or \"zhan chilong\" (斬赤龍, \"decapitating the Red Dragon\"), and identifies the adept as pregnant with an embryo of pure energy. Menstrual blood is sublimated into a \"new blood\" called the \"baifeng sui\" (白鳳髓, \"white marrow of the phoenix\"), which is refined into a higher level of spiritual power (Despeux 2000: 406-407).\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, menstrual blood and seminal fluid represent the fundamental energies of women and men. The cessation of the menstrual flow in women structurally corresponds with the retention of the semen in men. In both cases, loss of an essential substance is stopped and with it, the loss of original energy. This cessation creates a reversal of the natural processes and allows the symbolic creation of a new internal sprout of energy that turns into an embryo of energy. According to traditional medical literature, menstrual blood is formed from maternal milk, which two days before menstruation, sinks down from the breasts into the uterus where it transforms into blood. The refinement of menstrual blood into energy is therefore a reversal of the natural process and consists of its returning to milky secretions. The process begins with breast massages to stimulate the internal fire of sexual desire, which is then controlled to nurture the inner being. Furthermore, the female adept uses breath meditation to transform menstrual blood back into breast secretions. A warm energy is felt rotating around her navel, the area heats up, and the \"red is transformed into the white\". According to the \"Nü jindan\", \"When yang is close to being transformed into yin and to flow out through the jade channel [vagina], quickly get on the wheel of fire. When the wind of the Xun blows in the upper part, in the original Scarlet Palace [solar plexus], decapitate the periodic flow of blood so that it can never run again!\" (Despeux 2000: 407).\n\nTexts on \"neidan\" practices affirm that since the internal movement of energies corresponds to the gestational capabilities already present in women, their spiritual progress with inner alchemy is consequently faster than that of men. While a male adept has to develop a womb inside himself and learn how to nurture an embryo in it, a woman already has this natural faculty and thus has an easier time learning the practice. He Lοngxiang's preface says, \"In the case of women, we discuss breathing techniques but not embryonic practices\" (Despeux 2000: 402).\n\nWomen played an important role in the long tradition of Chinese shamanism. The word \"wu\" (, \"spirit medium; shaman; sorcerer; doctor\") was first recorded during the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) when a \"wu\" could be either male or female. During the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE) \"wu\" specifically meant \"female shaman; sorceress\" as opposed to \"xi\" (, \"male shaman; sorcerer\"). Later names for shamanesses include \"nüwu\" (女巫, \"woman shaman\"), \"wunü\" (巫女, \"shaman woman\"), \"wupo\" (巫婆, \"shaman old woman\"), and \"wuyu\" (巫嫗, \"shaman hag\"). Shamans communicated with the divine world, serving as diviners, diagnosticians, healers, exorcists, and \"zhaohun\" summoners of souls (Hawkes 1985). Early Daoist movements assimilated popular shamanistic practices, especially revealed texts and automatic writing, and yet also criticized shamans for heterodox worship and black magic (Despeux 2000: 403). \n\nMany Daoist texts were thought to have been revealed to mediums and shamans in states of spirit possession. An early example is the c. 2nd-century CE \"Taipingjing\" (Scripture of Great Peace) that describes itself as a \"tianshu\" (天書, \"celestial book\") (Overmyer and Jordan 1986: 37). The \"Zhen'gao\", which was allegedly revealed to the mystic Yang Xi in the 4th century, has strong shamanistic overtones. For instance, \"If perfected and divine spirits descend into an impure person of the world, they are no longer acting or writing with their own feet and hands. As above and below are so far distant from each other, how can their traces [writings] be truly visible [to humans]?\" (Despeux 2000: 403).\n\nMediumistic literature enthralled Chinese literati, and the Song authors Shen Kuo and Su Dongpo both described spirit-writing practices, especially those associated with the cult of the Zigu (紫姑, Purple Lady), the Toilet God. In the Tang period, she was the second wife of a man whose jealous first wife brutally mutilated her, and slowly burned her to death in the toilet. Since Zigu died on the fifteenth of the first lunar month, that became her feast day, when she would descend into entranced women followers and answer their questions (Maspero 1981: 135-137). She was venerated as the protectress of women, and even the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1522-1566) had a special altar to Zigu. \n\nWomen had privileged positions in mediumistic circles and Daoism. Shamanic elements underlie traditions of both schools with female lineages and women's inner alchemical texts. When organized Daoism adapted the ancient practices of shamanesses, women Daoists took on important new roles and functions (Despeux 2000: 403-404). \n\nThe Daoist spectrum of sexual activities ranged widely across schools, some stressed strict celibacy, others mystically married celestial partners, and still others practiced communal ritual intercourse (Despeux 2008: 173). \n\nIn the early Tianshi movement, all community members were initiated into a religious life of strict moral control and ritual sex. Women in the movement played key organizational roles and were essential in the \"guodu\" (過度, \"rites of passage\") sexual initiation, which went back to ancient \"fangzhong shu\" (房中術, \"bedchamber arts\") longevity techniques, and to shamans' ecstatic unions with the divine (Wile 1992). Best known is the sexual ritual of \"heqi\" (合氣, \"harmonizing the energies\"), during which community members, regardless of their marital affiliations, joined in formal intercourse. The rites took place in the oratorγ or \"jingshi\" (靜室, \"chamber of tranquility\") in the presence of a master and an instructor. The techniques involved visualization of bodily energies and ritualized body movements aligned with Chinese numerology and astrology. In contrast to the sensual bedchamber arts, the ritual sex of Tianshi adepts was believed to result in formation of the Immortal Embryo, which benefits themselves as well as contributed to greater universal harmony (Despeux 2000: 404). Daoxuan's 644 \"Guang hongming ji\" (廣弘明集, Expanded Collection on the Propagation and Clarification [of Buddhism]) says, \"During the rituals held at new and full moon, Daoists attend on their preceptor in their private chambers. Feeling and intention are made akin, and men and women engage in joining together. They match their four eyes and two noses, above and below. They join their two mouths and two tongues, one with the other. Once then yin and yang have met intimately, essence and energy are exchanged freely. Thus, the rites of men and women are performed and the Dao of male and female is harmonized.\" (tr. Despeux and Kohn 2003: 106).\n\nThe Shangqing Clarity tradition takes an ambivalent position toward sexual practices, while not completely rejected, sexuality is considered a lesser technique unable to grant advanced levels of spiritual realization. This Daoist school contends, along with some other religions of the world, that an adept must practice sexual abstinence and chastity in order to see and hear deities. Although the basic theme of sexual union is preserved, it is transposed into imaginary interactions with the divine (Despeux 2000: 405). As the \"Zhen'gao\" says: \"When a perfected appears as a presence of light and one engages with him or her, then this is union with the light, love between two beings of light. Although they are then called husband and wife, they do not engage in marital relations\" (tr. Despeux 2000: 399). Shangqing adepts sought to transcend mundane sexual union and move into the invisible realm, through the mediation of celestial partners and divine marriages (Cahill 1992).\n\nDaoist schools of \"neidan\" inner alchemy have two basic views on women and sexual union. First, retaining the semen during intercourse creates psycho-physiological transformations, which benefit both female and male adepts as equal partners. Second, practicing sexual abstinence emphasizes women's mediumistic abilities and results in autoeroticism, such as massaging her breasts. In both cases, the union's goal is the formation of an Immortal Embryo, the first sprout of the adept's spiritual rebirth (Despeux 2000: 405).\n\nDaoist literature describes the ideal sexual union as an even exchange of energies between partners, but some non-Daoist literature mentions a sort of \"sexual vampirism\" in which one partner selfishly tries to obtain energies at the other's expense. This practice, called \"caizhan\" (採戰, \"plucking [of energy] in [amorous] combat\"), usually benefited men but sometimes also women. For instance, the Queen Mother of the West attained Daoist immortality by nurturing her yin essence. Legends say that she never had a husband, but liked to copulate with young boys (Wile 1992: 102-103). Daoism consistently described such practices as improper and heterodox, even though they were covertly practiced within certain Daoist sects (Despeux 2000: 405).\n\nWomen Daoists who chose to become nuns typically lived in temples known as \"guan\" (觀) that began in the 5th to 6th centuries. Celibacy was associated with early Daoist schools. The reformer Kou Qianzhi (365-448), who probably influenced by the Buddhist model, established celibacy among the Northern Celestial Masters (Despeux 2000: 399). Similarly, the Shangqing School emphasized that chastity was necessary for an adept to visualize deities. Although the Shangqing founder Tao Hongjing (456-536) was celibate, the Maoshan institutions that he directed provided housing for adepts of both sexes and their children (Strickmann 1978: 471). \n\nDaoism has a long history of polemics over sexual abstinence. Some, such as Song Wenming (宋文明) of the early 6th century strongly recommended that all Daoists be celibate; others preferred family life, such as Li Bo (季播) who presented a memorial to the emperor in the early 7th century recommending that he not prohibit Daoist clergy from marrying (Maspero 1981: 411, 425). \nAs mentioned above, Daoist temples during the Tang period segregated women's and men's institutions. Promiscuity was prevalent in some Tang monasteries, for example, the Xianyi guan (咸宜觀, Abbey of Universal Benefit) in Chang'an. It was named after Princess Xianyi, the twenty-second daughter of Emperor Xuanzong, who became a Daoist nun and entered the abbey in 762. Many widows from wealthy families became Xianyi nuns, and continued living in luxury, aided by their servants. The nuns mingled with women from many social classes, such as the celebrated courtesan and poet Yu Xuanji (c. 844-869), who was born into a poor family and married a Tang official as his second wife. After denunciation by his first wife, she joined the abbey, took the poet Wen Tingyun (812-870) as her lover, and became renowned as a leader in Tang poetry (Despeux 2000: 400). \n\nSex segregation in Daoist institutions became stricter under the Song. In 927, Emperor Taizu issued the following edict: \"There are decadent tendencies in the temples, including wearing rough fabric and cohabitation with women and children. This is prohibited for all Daoists. Those with family must live outside of the temple compound. From now on it shall be illegal to install someone as a Daoist without proper official authority.\" (tr. Despeux 2000: 400).\n\nWhen the Quanzhen school spread throughout north China, they established many \"guan\" especially for women, and supported those who had lost family support. Monastic life in Quanzhen temples for both sexes was strictly regulated, and the daily schedule included periods for chanting classics, community work, and individual practices, including inner alchemical exercises (Despeux 2000: 401). \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "788253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=788253", "title": "Yarsanism", "text": "Yarsanism\n\nThe Yarsan or Ahle Haqq (, \"Yarsan\", ; \"People of Truth\"), is a syncretic religion founded by Sultan Sahak in the late 14th century in western Iran. The total number of Yarsanis estimated at around 2,000,000 or 3,000,000. Primarily found in western Iran and eastern Iraq, mostly ethnic Goran Kurds, though there are also smaller groups of Turk, Persian, Lori, Azerbaijani and Arab adherents. Some Yarsanis in Iraq are called \"Kaka'i\". Yarsanis are also found in some rural communities in southeastern Turkey. Yarsanis say that some people call them disparagingly as \"Ali-o-allahi\" or \"worshipers of Ali\" which labels Yarsanis deny. Many Yarsanis hide their religion due to pressure of Iran's Islamic system, and there are no exact statistics of their population.\n\nThe Yarsanis have a distinct religious literature primarily written in the Gorani language which also is known as Hawrami dialects. However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani (a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani) as their mother tongues are Southern Kurdish and Sorani Kurdish, which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish language family. The speakers of Sarli, living near Eski Kalak are adherents, as Edmonds (1957: 195) and Moosa (1988: 168) observed. Their central religious book is called the \"Kalâm-e Saranjâm\", written in the 15th century based on the teachings of Sultan Sahak.\n\nThe goal of Yarsanism is to teach humans to achieve ultimate truth. The Yarsani believe sun and fire are holy things and follow the principles of equalization, purity, righteousness, and oneness, which leads some researchers to find Mithraic roots in this religion.\n\nYarsanism is barely mentioned in historical religious books as its doctrine and rituals are largely secret. The followers of Yarsanism perform their rituals and ceremonies in secret, but this has not relieved the harassment of many of the Yarsani by Islamic or other governments over the centuries. The followers of this religion say that after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, pressure on the Yarsani community has increased and they have been deprived and discriminated against for over 30 years.\n\nOne of the signs of Yarsanic males is an intact mustache, as the Yarsanic holy book Kalâm-e Saranjâm says that every man must have a mustache to take part in Yarsanic religious rites.\n\nThe Yarsani follow the mystical teachings of Sultan Sahak. From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (\"Bātinī\") and the external (\"zāhirī\"), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as Kurdish esoterism which emerged under the intense influence of Bātinī-Sufism during the last two centuries.\n\nAmong other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (\"mazhariyyat\") and the belief in transmigration of the soul (\"dunaduni\" in Kurdish). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the Kalâm-e Saranjâm, otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan – anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.\n\nThe Yarsani faith's features include millenarism, Innatism, egalitarianism, metempsychosis, angelology, divine manifestation and dualism. Many of these features are found in Yazidism, and they also have many things in common with Zoroastrians and Christians. Unlike other indigenous Persian faiths, the Yarsanism explicitly reject class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the Yezidis and Zoroastrians.\n\nAccording to Yarsani philosophy, the universe is evolving in through different Epochs and that these Epochs are:\n\n1. First Epoch, or \"Shari'at,\" which includes the period from Adam and Eve until Muhammad, also known as the \"Prophet\" period.\n\n2. Second Epoch, or \"Tariqat,\" which includes the period from Ali ibn Abi Talib until Shah Khoshin, also known as the \"Doctrine\" period.\n\n3. Third Epoch, or \"Marefat\", which includes the period from Shah Khoshin until Sultan Sahak, also known as the \"Mystical\" period.\n\n4. Fourth Epoch, or \"Haqiqat\", which includes the period from Sultan Sahak until today, also known as the \"Truth\" period.\n\nThe Yarsani are emanationists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive incarnations known as \"mazhariyyats\" (similar to the Hindu avatars). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as \"Haft tan\" which means \"The Seven Persons\"\n\nThe primary \"mazhariyyat\" of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.\n\nThe primary \"mazhariyyat\" of the Second Epoch was Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth Caliph and first imam of Shia Islam. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis Ali-Allahi, 'Believers in the divinity of Ali'.\n\nThe primary \"mazhariyyat\" of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the primary \"mazhariyyat\" is held to be Sultan Sahak. It is said that he was given birth by Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin, and as in the case of Mary, it was a virginal conception. While sleeping under a pomegranate tree a kernel of fruit fell into her mouth when a bird pecked the fruit directly over her.\nAccording to Yarsani legend after Sultan Sahak had completed the revelation of his esoteric teachings (\"haqiqat\") to his first disciples among the Guran he took his leave of them. Disappearing from the Guran country without a trace, he reappeared in Anatolia in the form of Haji Bektash Veli. He taught mystical doctrines and techniques (\"tariqat\") in those lands for almost a hundred years, and then returned to the Guran country. In the perception of his disciples there, he had been away for only an hour.\n\nEach Epoch in Yarsani belief saw the appearance of the seven secondary divine manifestations or \"Haft Tan\". In the First Epoch they appeared in their true angelic form, while in subsequent Epochs they appeared in human incarnations. The \"Haft Tan\" are charged with responsibility for the affairs of the internal realm.\n\nThe secondary \"mazhariyyats\" of the First Epoch include the archangels Gabriel, Michael, Israfil and Azrael, and a female angelic being. \n\nThe \"mazhariyyats\" of the Second Epoch include Salman, Qanbar, Mohammed, Nusayr (who is either Jesus Christ or Theophobus) and Bahlool. It also includes Fatimah, the daughter of Mohammed as the incarnation of the female angel.\n\nThe \"mazhariyyats\" of the Third Epoch include Shah Fazlullah Veli, Baba Sarhang Dudani and Baba Naous.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the \"Haft Tan\" or 'seven persons' charged by Sultan Sahak with responsibility for the affairs of the inner realm consist of the following:\n\nThe \"\"Haft Tan\" (The Seven Archangels) are key figures in the Yarsani belief system and their history. The only female among them is Khatun-e Rezbar, the mother of Sultan Sahak.\n\nThese seven persons are known as \"Haft tan\"\" Which means by word \"The Seven Persons\" \nYarsanis also have a belief in transmigration of the soul (\"dunaduni\" in Kurdish). The Yarsani have a famous saying about death; \"Men! Do not fear the punishment of death! The death of man is like the dive which the duck makes.\" Human beings go through a cycle of 1001 incarnations. During this process, they may become more purified based on their actions. This process is confined however, only to Yarsanis - the \"zarda-gel\" or people created of yellow clay. Everyone else belongs to the \"ḵāk-e sīāh\" or people created of black earth, and are eternally damned.\n\nThe traditions of the Yarsani are preserved in poetry known as \"Kalam-e Saranjam\" (\"The Discourse of Conclusion\"), divinely revealed narratives passed down orally through the generations. These traditions are said to have been written down by Pir Musi, one of the seven companions of Sultan Sahak (also the angel in charge of recording human deeds). The collection consists of the epochs of Khawandagar [God], ‘Alī, Shah Khoshin and Sultan Sahak, the different manifestations of divinity. The epoch of Shah Khoshin takes place in Luristan and the epoch of Sultan Sahak is placed in Hawraman near the Sirwan River, the land of the Goranî. Also important to the Goranî is the Daftar-e kezana-ye Perdivari (\"Book of the Treasure of Perdivar\"), a collection of twenty six mythological poems or \"kalams\".\n\nThe sayings attributed to Sultan Sahak are written in Gorani Kurdish, the sacred language of the Ahl-e Haqq, which also is known as Hawrami dialects. However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani (a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani) as their mother tongues are Southern Kurdish and Sorani Kurdish, which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish language family. Some Yarsani literature is written in the Persian language.\n\nTwo important sanctuaries of the Yarsani are the tomb of Bābā Yādgār about 40km away from Sarpol-e Zahab in Kermanshah Province and the tomb of Dawoud at Zarde about three kilometres east of Sarpol-e Zahab. Another important shrine is that of Sultan Suhak in Sheykhan near Perdīvar bridge in Kermanshah Province. The tombs of Pir Benjamin and Pir Musi in the town of Kerend in Kermanshah Province, Iran are also important shrines.\n\nOne of Yarsani men's apparent signs is to have a full moustache, because in the holy book Kalâm-e Saranjâm it says that every man has to have a moustache to take part in their religious rites.\n\nThe concourse of Yarsanis is called the \"jam khana.\" They gather there for similar to Jem in Alevism and they use \"tambour\" for meditation.\n\nYarsanism is organised into spiritual houses or Khandans, seven of which were established at the time of Sultan Sahak, and four afterwards, making eleven Khandans in all. The Khandans were established when, along with the \"Haft Tan\", Sultan Sahak also formed the \"Haft Tawane\", a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world. They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu'l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the \"Haft Tawane\" was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak's time another four khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.\n\nEvery Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience. The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual 'parents', it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.\n\nThe majority of Yarsanis are found in the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, especially in Hawraman and the Kermanshah province of Iran.\n\nThe Yarsani in Iran are mostly found in Lorestan and Kermanshah provinces There are also large communities of Yarsanis in some regions of Iranian Azerbaijan. The town of Ilkhichi (İlxıçı), which is located 87 km south west of Tabriz is almost entirely populated by Yarsanis. For political reasons, one of which was to create a distinct identity for these communities, they have not been called Goran Kurds since the early 20th century. They are called various names, such as Ali-Ilahis and Ahl-e Haqq. Both the Dersim \"(Zazaki / Zaza)\" people and the Gorani, who speak a language that is considered to belong to the Hawramani branch of the North West Iranian languages, adhere to a form of Kurdish Alawi faith which resembles the religions of the Yezidi, Ali-Ilahians or Druze.\n\nThe Yarsani are known in Iraq as the Kaka'i. There are Yarsani in Iraqi Kurdistan, around Kirkuk and Sulaymaniyah. The speakers of Sarli, living near Eski Kalak in Iraq, are adherents, as Edmonds (1957: 195) surmised and Moosa (1988: 168) observed.\nYarsanis are also found in some rural communities in southeastern Turkey.\n\nA group of native, allegedly Iranian, but archaeologically Mesopotamian, monotheistic religions practiced by Kurds consisting of Yarsani and Êzidî along with Chinarism/Ishikism \"(Ishik Alevism)\" are claimed as \"Yazdânism\" by Mehrdad Izady.\n\nAn excerpt from the French Review of the Muslim World describes the difficulty in nomenclature for Yarsanism and related Shi'ite mysticism. The English translation reads:\n\n\"Ahl-e Haqq\" view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in Ali, and established the stage of \"shai'at\" (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of \"tariqat\" (Sufi teachings), then \"ma'rifat\" (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of haqiqat (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in Sultan Sahak. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari'a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi'ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism). The Ahl-i Haqq neither observe Muslim rites, such as daily prayers and fasting during the month of Ramadan, nor share Islamic theology and sacred space, such as belief in the day of resurrection and sanctity of the mosque.\n\nExtremist Sunni Islamic groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda regard the followers of Yarsanism as unbelievers who have to convert to Islam or die. These militants have prosecuted Yarsanis during the Iraq conflict, possibly prompting some Iraqi Yarsan community leaders to declare in 2013 that their people were actually Muslims to avoid sectarian attacks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50312872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50312872", "title": "Yazda", "text": "Yazda\n\nYazda: Global Yazidi Organization (/ yɑːzdə/, ; ), is a United States-based global Yazidi nonprofit, non-governmental organization (NGO) advocacy, aid, and relief organization. Yazda was established to support the Yazidi, who are a minority ethnoreligious group around the world, especially in northern Iraq, specifically Sinjar and Nineveh Plain, and northeastern Syria, where the Yazidi community has, as part of a deliberate \"military, economic, and political strategy,\" been the focus of a genocidal campaign by ISIL that included mass murder, the separation of families, forced religious conversions, forced marriages, sexual assault, physical assault, torture, kidnapping, and slavery.\n\nIn August 2014, Yazda was founded by a group of Yazidi and Yazidi American activists in the United States centered around Yazidi communities in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Houston, Texas. \n\nIn addition to education initiatives that explain Yazidi culture and religion, Yazda runs a Yazda's Center in Kurdistan, Iraq, and assists victims of the genocide and rape that began in Iraq in 2014.\n\nThe first mission of Yazda was advocating in the United States during ISIL's attack on Sinjar. Yazda helped by providing humanitarian assistance in the form of food and water to approximately 60,000 Yazidis, who were stranded on mountain Sinjar by ISIL during the week of August 3, 2014. At this point, Yazda began its work trying to locate and help free Yazidi women and girls, more than 3,200 of whom were captured, enslaved, and are still held hostage by the Islamic State. Those women and girls are victims of human trafficking and sexual slavery.\n\nYazda's center in Iraq functions as a local non-governmental organization (NGO).\n\nYazda sponsored multiple online petitions to focus on helping captured and enslaved Yazidi women. Activists working with Yazda asked U.S. President Barack Obama to help the women and girls still held captive. A Yazidi high school student from Coventry, England, who relocated to the UK from Iraq, asked U.K. Prime Minister and Home Secretary Theresa May, Secretary of State for International Development Justine Greening, and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Philip Hammond, for a meeting to discuss providing solutions to the crisis.\n\nIn August 2015, Luis Moreno Ocampo, former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, activist Kerry Propper, and multi-media communication specialist Elizabeth Schaeffer Brown, came to the Yazda Center in Dohuk, Kurdistan, to gather testimony and record victim statements. They proceeded to launch It's On U, a lobbying campaign to pressure heads of state and UN Security Council members to refer the Yazdi genocide to the ICC.\n\nOn September 25, 2015, Yazda and Free Yazidi Foundation, with the support of the Kurdish Regional Government of Iraq, submitted a detailed report to the International Criminal Court (ICC) that explains how ISIL, with a disproportionate number of foreign fighters, committed genocide against the Yazidi people. The report requested a formal investigation into the crimes of the Islamic State (ISIS) to be conducted by the international community to prosecute ISIL for the crime of genocide against Yazidis. Because Iraq is not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), there is a limitation to the assistance the ICC can provide. One option would be that the ICC could be granted limited jurisdiction over the region.\n\nYazda provides assistance and support to the Yazidi activist, Nadia Murad, a Yazidi human rights activist, Nobel Peace Prize nominee and since September 2016 the first Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking of the United Nations. She was kidnapped and held by the Islamic State in August 2014. On December 16, 2015, Murad testified about her experience before the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIn September 2016, Attorney Amal Clooney spoke before the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to discuss the decision she made in June 2016 to represent Yazidi activist Nadia Murad as a client in legal action against ISIL commanders.\n\nYazda is run by teams of volunteers in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, and Iraq. A large portion of the volunteers emigrated after working as translators during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and in other conflicts that involved the U.S. military. Chicago graduate student, Matthew Barber, was Executive Director for a period of one year. Murad Ismael, co-founder of Yazda, is the current Executive Director.\n\nYazda supports survivors of the Yazidi genocide through numerous aid and relief programs. Yazda has a Medical Center in Iraq and supports thousands of people in need of primary medical care and first aid services. Yazda also has a mobile clinic in Sinjar to support the Yazidis in the remote areas and villages around Sinjar. Yazda conducts missions to provide humanitarian aids and relief services of clean water, clothing, and food to as many displaced people as possible. \n\nThe genocide documentation project started on the October 17, 2014. Yazda worked with the Voices of Rwanda, an organization that has been documenting the Rwanda's genocide, to train and support Yazda's documentation team. The team works on recording Yazidi survivors and eyewitness testimonies of the genocidal campaign. The team locates and investigates the mass graves of Yazidis.\n\nIn 2016, Yazda and Human Rights Watch issued an official report regarding the discovered mass graves. \n\nRegarding this matter, Yazda had urged the international community to formally investigate the mass graves before evidence was lost at those sites because of the fact that Sinjar is still a war zone and the sites of genocide are unprotected. The team also investigates the general devastation of Yazidi community and damage of Yazidis properties following ISIL's attack, and has worked in support of assisting Western media to document the story.\n\nYazda began a psycho-social program in its center in Dohuk, Iraq, for the Yazidi women and girls who managed to escape or are rescued from ISIL. The women and girls suffer from severe physical and mental abuse and require post-trauma support. Yazda helps them recover from the trauma and reintegrate into society via response programs to help the women with methods that include individual therapy and often require long-term treatment.\n\nISIL's genocidal campaign against the Yazidis resulted in the abduction and enslavement of thousands Yazidis, the majority of which were women and girls. Yazda volunteers and the office of Yazidi affairs in Kurdistan have collected the names of approximately 5,000 abducted Yazidis after the genocidal campaign. These abductees were subjected to systematic sexual abuse and rape, and those who still held hostage face the same daily abuses even to the present day. By the beginning of 2016, over 2,000 abducted Yazidi women and girls returned to freedom, either by escaping or by being rescued. Many cases of rescue or escape involve women and girls being reunited with destitute families in the rough conditions of Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps or squalid conditions of other locations where displaced families have taken refuge. Some escapees have lost all relatives to ISIL's massacres and did not have immediate families to return to. Through its case management program, Yazda has collected the information of more than 800 women and girls that have escaped ISIL individually. \n\nIn addition to psycho-social therapy, Yazda provides survivors with shelter, food, clothing, fuel, and other basic necessities. Yazda aims is to create an environment that is conducive to the healing of trauma survivors. Yazda provides medical and psychological treatment to help them recover from the damage they have experienced. Yazda struggles to provide adequate psycho-social resources and medical services to the survivors.\n\nYazda opened a medical clinic in the Esseyan camp to provide the displaced Yazidis with basic medical care. Yazda has managed to support the people in need with primary care services with the support of the Health Directorate of Dohuk. Through an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government's Department of Health, Yazda has the responsibility of providing all medical services to the population of the Essyan IDP camp. The population of the camp exceeds 14,600 people. Yazda maintains a physical health center, and has a staff of 17-member team of nurses, pharmacists, physician’s assistants, and lab assistants, in addition to several doctors. Yazda’s sources of funding are the donations from private donors and organizations.\n\nYazda had established a mobile clinic to serve the displaced Yazidis who still live on the Sinjar mountain area. According to Yazda, Yazda's mobile clinic plays a significant role in covering the needs of the people in remote areas of Sinjar and surrounding villages with a population of around 30,000 people. The German charitable organization, Zentralrat der Yeziden in Deutschland, provided an ambulance for the mission and sent medication and medical supplies.\n\nYazda works to educate and provide outreach on proper food sanitation procedures to reduce instances of foodborne illness, provides first aid education from within populations at internally displaced person (IDP) camp and provide basic instructions on emergency response for instances where trained medical professional assistance is not available.\n\nYazda provides food, water, clothes, and other necessities for the orphans of escaped women, and other people in need in IDP camps. The focus is on assisting the displaced Yazidi, which is estimated to be more than 90% of Iraq's original Yazidi population.\n\nTîrêja Rojê is Yazda’s project for the preservation of the Yazidi religious and cultural tradition. The project involves sharing historical traditions and cultural knowledge by older generations to younger generations. It also provides psychological therapy to help the displaced Yazidis recover from genocide trauma.\n\nQalam Zerin is a project run the Yazidi poet, Murad Allo, that provides Yazidi university students mentorship and support in the form of weekly meetings on topics that include languages classes, public speaking, writing, and maintaining physical health. The project focuses on rehabilitating Yazidi youth through activities that include oral lectures, paintings, poetry, writing classes, and various cultural activities to treat collective trauma for the Yazidi society through the youth.\n\nYazda provides assistance to children visiting the Yazda Women's Center in Duhok, with planned outreach for displaced children who need sponsorship and adoption services, direct aid, and trauma, medical, and education support.\n\n\n"}
