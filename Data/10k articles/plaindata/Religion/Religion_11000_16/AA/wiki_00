Born to a noble Gallo-Roman family at Vannes, Brittany, St. Albinus was a monk and from 504 C.E. Abbot of Tintillac (which no longer stands; its location has not been satisfactorily identified). His reputation spread during the twenty-five years in which he served as abbot. In 529, St. Albinus was elected, against his wishes, Bishop of Angers.\n\nHe campaigned against incestuous weddings, such as those that occurred between members of the nobility. He participated in the Third Council of Orléans (538) after King Childebert granted permission for this council to take place. Albinus sought advice from St. Caesarius of Arles after seeing laxity in other bishops.\n\nTradition states that he helped all in distress, using diocesan funds to free hostages from pirates. Another tradition states that he clashed with King Childebert, who had imprisoned a woman called Etherie, from Douille near Angers. Unable to secure her release Albinus visited her in prison, and the soldier who tried to resist him fell dead at his feet. This so impressed the king that he allowed St. Albinus to bail her out.\n\nAnother legend relates that St. Albinus once prayed far into the night for some men imprisoned in the Tower of Angers. Suddenly a great stone collapsed from the wall, allowing their escape.\n\nSt. Albinus died in 550 and was buried in the church of Saint-Pierre at Angers. In 556, a church was dedicated to him and his body was buried in its crypt. Near this church an abbey arose, called \"Saint-Aubin\".\n\nSt. Gregory of Tours remarks on the cult of St. Albinus, which later became diffused in Germany, England, and Poland, making St. Albinus a popular saint during the Middle Ages. St. Venantius Fortunatus, a near contemporary, wrote a life of this saint.\n\nChurches were dedicated to him right across the continent as far as Poland, and he was sometimes seen as the patron saint for protection from pirate attack. This may have been based on the tradition that he bought back parishioners who had been taken captive by pirates sailing up the Loire river. Later the tradition was reinforced by a miracle recorded in the 10th century, when the walled town of Guérande, near the mouth of the Loire, prayed to St. Albinus for help and found their attackers miraculously defeated.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Nicholas Belfort notably wrote describing miracles performed at the tomb of St. Aubin after the year 1000 AD. Belfort was a Regular Canon in the monastery of St John the Baptist by the city of Soissons.\n\nThus, his fame increased and many coastal villages chose Aubin as their patron saint. Presumably this is the reason why St. Aubin in Jersey bears his name, preserving the name of an ancient chapel that has long since disappeared. St. Aubin is venerated there in the Anglican church of St Aubin on the Hill. (See Saint-Aubin for other places named for him.)\n\nSt. Albinus' feast day is celebrated on March 1.\n\nTHE LIFE OF ST.

{"id": "11114068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11114068", "title": "Benedicaria", "text": "Benedicaria\n\nBenedicaria, which means \"\"Way of Blessing\",\" is a relatively new term for a number of loosely related family-based folk traditions found throughout Italy, most notably in southern Italy and Sicily. Though referred to by some as \"Folk Magic\" or even as \"Witchcraft,\" the various Benedicaria Traditions are concerned almost exclusively with healing, cleansing, spirituality, and religious devotion. \n\nBenedicaria is also known as Benedicazione (Blessing) in the Cattolichese dialect, Benedica (blessed) in Catanian, and Fa Lu Santuccio (\"lit.\" \"do a little holy thing\") in Campania.\n\nUnlike practitioners of Stregheria and some practitioners of Stregoneria, practitioners of Benedicaria consider themselves to be devout Catholics, and the practices of Benedicaria are inextricably linked with Italian popular devotions found in Traditional Catholicism.\n\nAmongst Italian communities, there is generally no word for \"Benedicaria,\" and often it is simply called \"the things we do and have always done.\" However, the word for a practitioner is \"Benedetto\" (for a male) or \"Benedetta\" (for a female), both of which mean \"Blessed One.\" In Giuseppe Tornatore's 2000 motion picture \"Malèna\", however, there is a scene where the older ladies of the village are exorcising Renato with Holy Cards and praying Rosaries. The boy's father sees this and says \"Va fanculo cu la benedicaria!\" (\"Go fuck off with the Benedicaria!\")\n\nIn the English language, the word \"Benedicaria\" itself first appeared in writing thanks to Sicilian-American author Vito Quattrocchi, who self-published his book \"Sicilian Benedicaria: Magical Catholicism\". Quattrocchi had already been a published author, with \"The Sicilian Blade\" (1993, Desert Publications) under his belt. However, this move towards self-publication on Quattrocchi's part has proven to be successful, and now the word \"Benedicaria\" is in common use , at least throughout the internet, as a way of identifying these traditions of spiritual practices.\n\nAlong with Quattrocchi, another name associated with Benedicaria is that of Agostino Taumaturgo, a Roman Catholic priest who maintains Quattrocchi's website and whose book, \"The Things We Do: Ways of the Holy Benedetta\" was published in 2007.\n\nDiscussions on the subject of Benedicaria could be found on the forums at the Stregoneria Italiana website (now inactive), whose membership consists of both Catholics and Pagans who work together to debunk the stereotypes prevalent regarding Italian culture and spirituality. The discussion on this site also covers the subjects of Italian Folk Culture(i.e. Stregoneria, Fattura, etc.), Christian Magic, and many other aspects of Italian language, food, history, politics, and culture.\n\nBenedicaria is catch-all term for a number of family-based spiritual traditions with a great deal of flexibility, and as a result, the practices found in Benedicaria may vary from family to family and from individual to individual. Amongst the more commonly known practices are the use of olive oil and/or eggs as a cure for the Malocchio or Evil Eye, the use of candles, the Rosary, herbs, and Novenas in honor of the various Saints. According to the information given at the Italian Benedicaria website, most of the prayers used in Benedicaria are taken directly from Catholic prayerbooks.\n\nThe same sacramentals used in the Catholic Church are used in Benedicaria, whereby the sacramentals are never disrespected. However they are also used, to a small degree in stregoneria, where there is more of a grey area and therefore a practitioner may find themselves walking the fine line between the sacred and the profane or, stepping right into sacrilege.\n\nOne example of the sacramentals being used in Benedicaria is in the so-called \"Exorcism of Saint Anthony\", wherein the practitioner holds a crucifix over the object which he or she wishes to exorcise, and says: \"Behold the Cross of the Lord! Begone, ye hostile powers! The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath triumphed, he who is the rod of David!\" This rite is found, in its entirety, within the pre-Vatican II Roman Catholic \"Rite of Solemn Exorcism\", known as \"Ritus Exorcizandi Obssessos a Daemonio\". \n\nIn fact, nearly all of the Sacramentals used by Benedetti come from the Church in times before the Second Vatican Council, and a number of practitioners care little or nothing for the changes that took place after that Council (which many Benedicaria-practitioners and even ordinary Catholics may have been a somewhat forced imposition of Northern European or Protestant ideologies on the rest of the world).\n\nAnother common practice is the use of eggs as a form of cleansing or to remove the Evil Eye. In this exercise, the egg is washed, dried, and then covered in Holy Water while the practitioner prays over it, saying an Apostles' Creed, an Our Father, and three Hail Marys. The egg is then rolled over the alleged victim's body in a loosely prescribed pattern, paying especial attention to any area which may feel the most pain; the egg is believed to absorb any negative energy. After doing this with the egg for fifteen minutes, the egg is broken by throwing it in the toilet and flushing the remains. \n\nThis is very similar to a practice found in Mexican Curanderismo and Filipino Pagtatawas which has the same objective, and it is also an example of a Catholic Sacramental being combined with a possible pre-Christian practice, with the latter being subordinated to the belief-system of Catholicism.\n\nThere is much discussion on the subject of what exactly is entailed by the terms Benedicaria, Stregoneria, and Stregheria. However, the one thing upon which all parties agree is that these three things are all different from one another. In 2005, a poster on Mystic Wicks asked Raven Grimassi his opinion concerning Benedicaria, and Grimassi responded that he had read Quattrocchi's book, that it seemed authentic in the material it covered, and that it neither has nor claims any relationship with Italian Witchcraft. In response to this, Quattrocchi expressed his thanks that all sides of the debate acknowledge Stregheria and Benedicaria as two entirely separate and unrelated practices.\n\nThe relationship between Stregoneria and Benedicaria is more confounded entirely since in their purest forms the two are completely distinct. However, most practitioners make use of elements from both traditions, and many practitioners were raised with or taught elements of both traditions, so much so that over the course of centuries, it has become impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. In many cases, even the practitioner herself is not certain as to the distinctions.\n\nThis confusion between the two practices became an object of contention between Rue Roselli and Vito Quattrocchi in May 2007, when Quattrocchi posted two videos on YouTube featuring an interview between himself and a sympathetic priest regarding the subject. In these videos, the priest (a mutual friend of both Roselli and Quattrocchi) stressed the fact that Benedicaria is not witchcraft, that it is entirely separate from witchcraft, and that the practitioner of Benedicaria is generally a devout Catholic who makes no pretensions of being a witch. Roselli cited the tendency of Benedetti to blend the two practices, which was not mentioned in the videos. The videos have since been removed from YouTube, but this debate comes to show that the relationship between Benedicaria and Stregoneria is one of synthesis and convolution.\n\n\n"}

The word \"Brahacharanam\" is a corruption of the Sanskrit word Brhatcharanam (). Many Brahacharanam follow the \"Advaita Vedanta\" philosophy propounded by Adi Sankaracharya. However, some Brahacharanam are stauchly Saivite unlike followers of Adi Sankaracharya, or else adhere to \"Sivadvaita\" so to speak. The Brahacharanams, along with the Vadamas, form the major portion of the Kerala Iyer community.\n\nThe Brahacharanams, like the Vadamas, have a distinctive martial tradition which differentiate them from other Iyer communities. Members of the community served as \"Senapatis\" or army commanders under the Chola kings Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I.\n\nThe word \"bruhat\" in Sanskrit means \"great\", \"vast\" or \"significant\" and the word \"charanam\" refers to feet. The name Brahacharanam can be thus literally translated as \"feet of the greats\" referring to the status of a Guru, and the Brahacharanam being those who follow in the footsteps of the Greats.\n\nTheir exact origins are not clear but their presence in the Tamil Kingdoms extends back at least to the reign of Parantaka Chola II, who is said to have \"brahmarayars\" as ministers. Many of the agraharam villages of the Brahacharanam also have very ancient origins.\n\nAccording to some, they made their way into the Tamil country through the Satyamangalam Pass.\n\nThe Brahacharanam are divided into the following subgroups:\n\nA significant number of Brahacharanams have migrated to Kerala, where they are part of the Kerala Iyer community. They have also migrated in large numbers to Puttur in Andhra Pradesh where they form the Puthur Dravida community.\n\nMost Brahacharanam are worshippers of Shiva, and they cover their forehead with sacred ashes. Some used to wear Vibhuti in the Shape of the Sivalinga on their foreheads due their strong adherence to Lord Siva and no other. However, the Sathyamangalam group have some members who wear the vaishnava mark.\n\nWomen also dress like other Iyers. In the ancient times, the cloth worn by the women used to be of little more than a knee's length. Among the Milaganur Brahacharanam, the Adrishya Pondugal ceremony is celebrated in which four women, a widow and a bachelor are invited to a feast. This was done in order to propitate four women who disappeared due to the ill treatment of their mothers in law.\n\nIt has been documented that some Bracharanam who lived in places like Mangudi were such rigid saivaites that they would not even utter Govinda's name and lived a life of stern austerity.\n\nThe traditional function of Brahacharanams is to study and impart Vedic knowledge or officiate as priests in religious functions. However, there is evidence that in ancient times, they might have also served in the army or in civil and administrative services. During the Chola period, members of the community (especially the Pazhamaneri Brahacharanam) even served as army commanders. Senapathi Krishnan Raman was the Commander-in-chief of the Imperial Chola army of Rajendra Chola I. Brahacharanam also consider themselves to be among the first followers of Adi Shankaracharya.\n\nSome notable Brahacharanams are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53428626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53428626", "title": "Entheogenic use of cannabis", "text": "Entheogenic use of cannabis\n\nCannabis has been used in an entheogenic context—a chemical substance used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context—in the Indian subcontinent since the Vedic period dating back to approximately 1500 BCE, but perhaps as far back as 2000 BCE. Cannabis has been used by shamanic and pagan cultures to ponder deeply religious and philosophical subjects related to their tribe or society, to achieve a form of enlightenment, to unravel unknown facts and realms of the human mind and subconscious, and also as an aphrodisiac during rituals or orgies. There are several references in Greek mythology to a powerful drug that eliminated anguish and sorrow. Herodotus wrote about early ceremonial practices by the Scythians, thought to have occurred from the 5th to 2nd century BCE. Itinerant Hindu saints have used it in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Over the last few decades hundreds of archaeological and anthropological items of evidence have come out of Mexican, Mayan and Aztec cultures that suggest cannabis, along with magic mushrooms (psilocybin), peyote (mescaline) and other psychoactive plants were used in cultural shamanic and religious rituals. Mexican-Indian communities occasionally use cannabis in religious ceremonies by leaving bundles of it on church altars to be consumed by the attendees.\n\nThe earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the Indian subcontinent come from the Atharva Veda estimated to have been written sometime around 2000–1400 BCE, which mentions cannabis as one of the \"five sacred plants... which release us from anxiety\" and that a guardian angel resides in its leaves. The Vedas also refer to it as a \"source of happiness,\" \"joy-giver\" and \"liberator,\" and in the \"Raja Valabba\", the gods send hemp to the human race so that they might attain delight, lose fear and have sexual desires. Many households in India own and grow a cannabis plant to be able to offer cannabis to a passing \"sadhu\" (ascetic holy men), and during some evening devotional services it is not uncommon for cannabis to be smoked by everyone present.\nCannabis was often consumed in weddings or festivals honoring Shiva, who is said to have brought it down from the Himalayas. It is still offered to Shiva in temples on Shivaratri day, while devotional meetings called \"bhajans\", although not necessarily associated with Shiva, are occasions for devotees to consume the drug liberally. \"Yogis\" or \"sadhus\" along with other Hindu mystics have been known to smoke a mixture of \"cannabis sativa\" and tobacco in order to enhance meditation. This is particularly common during the festival of Diwali and Kumbha Mela.\nThere are three types of cannabis used in the Indian subcontinent. The first, \"bhang\", a type of cannabis edible, consists of the leaves and plant tops of the marijuana plant. It is usually consumed as an infusion in beverage form, and varies in strength according to how much cannabis is used in the preparation. The second, ganja, consisting of the leaves and the plant tops, is smoked. The third, called \"charas\" or \"hashish\", consists of the resinous buds and/or extracted resin from the leaves of the marijuana plant. Typically, \"bhang\" is the most commonly used form of cannabis in religious festivals.\nIn Tantric Buddhism, which originated in the TIbeto-Himalayan region, cannabis serves as an important part of a traditional ritual (which may or may not also include sexual intercourse). Cannabis is taken to facilitate meditation and also heighten awareness of all aspects of the ceremony, with a large oral dosage being taken in time with the ceremony so that the climax of the \"high\" coincides with the climax of the ceremony.\n\nThe sinologist and historian Joseph Needham concluded \"the hallucinogenic properties of hemp were common knowledge in Chinese medical and Taoist circles for two millennia or more\", and other scholars associated Chinese \"wu\" (shamans) with the entheogenic use of cannabis in Central Asian shamanism.\nThe oldest texts of Traditional Chinese Medicine listed herbal uses for cannabis and noted some psychodynamic effects. The (ca. 100 CE) Chinese pharmacopeia \"Shennong Ben Cao Jing\" (\"Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica\") described the use of \"mafen\" 麻蕡 \"cannabis fruit/seeds\":\nA Taoist priest in the fifth century A.D. wrote in the \"Ming-I Pieh Lu\" that:\nLater pharmacopia repeated this description, for instance the (ca. 1100 CE) \"Zhenglei bencao\" 證類本草 (\"Classified Materia Medica\"):\nThe (ca. 730) dietary therapy book \"Shiliao bencao\" 食療本草 (\"Nutritional Materia Medica\") prescribes daily consumption of cannabis in the following case: \"those who wish to see demons should take it (with certain other drugs) for up to a hundred days.\"\nCannabis has been cultivated in China since Neolithic times, for instance, hemp cords were used to create the characteristic line designs on Yangshao culture pottery). Early Chinese classics have many references to using the plant for clothing, fiber, and food, but none to its psychotropic properties. Some researchers think Chinese associations of cannabis with \"indigenous central Asian shamanistic practices\" can explain this \"peculiar silence\". The botanist Li Hui-lin noted linguistic evidence that the \"stupefying effect of the hemp plant was commonly known from extremely early times\"; the word \"ma\" \"cannabis; hemp\" has connotations of \"numbed; tingling; senseless\" (e.g., \"mamu\" 麻木 \"numb\" and \"mazui\" 麻醉 \"anesthetic; narcotic\"), which \"apparently derived from the properties of the fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes.\" Li suggested shamans in Northeast Asia transmitted the medical and spiritual uses of cannabis to the ancient Chinese \"wu\" \"shaman; spirit medium; doctor\".\n\nRobert Clarke and Mark Merlin, the authors of \"Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany\", suggest that:\nBoth early Greek history and modern archeology show that Central Asian peoples were utilizing cannabis 2,500 years ago.\nThe (ca. 440 BCE) Greek \"Histories\" of Herodotus record the early Scythians using cannabis steam baths.\nWhat Herodotus called the \"hemp-seed\" must have been the whole flowering tops of the plant, where the psychoactive resin is produced along with the fruit (\"seeds\").\n\nHerodotus also noted that the Thracians, a people who had intimate contact with the Scythians, introduced the plant to the Dacians where it became popular among a shamanic cult named the \"Kapnobatai\", or \"Those Who Walk in the Clouds.\" The shamans of the cult, also called \"Kapnobatai\", were known to use hemp smoke to induce visions and trances.\n\nBurial tombs of the Phrygians and Scythians frequently contained \"cannabis sativa\" seeds.\n\nSeveral of the Tarim mummies excavated near Turpan in Xinjiang province of Northwestern China were buried with sacks of cannabis next to their heads. Based on additional grave goods, archaeologists concluded these individuals were shamans: \"The marijuana must have been buried with the dead shamans who dreamed of continuing the profession in another world.\" A team of scientists analyzed one shamanistic tomb that contained a leather basket with well-preserved cannabis (789 grams of leaves, shoots, and fruits; AMS dated 2475 ± 30 years BP) and a wooden bowl with cannabis traces. Lacking any \"suitable evidence that the ancient, indigenous people utilized \"Cannabis\" for food, oil, or fiber\", they concluded \"the deceased was more concerned with the intoxicant and/or medicinal value of the \"Cannabis\" remains.\" The Chinese archaeologist Hongen Jiang and his colleagues excavated a circa 2,400-2,800 BP tomb in northwest China’s Turpan Basin and found the remains of an approximately 35-year-old man with Caucasian features who had been buried with thirteen 1-meter cannabis plants, placed diagonally across his chest. Jiang said this is the first archeological discovery of complete cannabis plants, as well as the first incidence of their use as a burial shroud.\n\nCannabis may be associated with Central Asian burial rituals in around 5th Century B.C., as archaeological excavations in 1947 of a series of burial mounds at Pazyryk in the Altai Mountains of Siberia revealed 1.2 meter-high wooden frame tents in each of the mounds. Each frame surrounded a bronze vessel filled with the remains of hemp seeds and stones, and were presumably left smoking in the grave. In one of the mounds, a leather pouch containing hemp seeds, and scattered hemp, coriander, and melilotus seeds were also recovered.\n\nAccording to Alfred Dunhill (1924), Africans have had a long tradition of smoking hemp in gourd pipes, asserting that by 1884 the King of the Baluka tribe of the Congo had established a \"riamba\" or hemp-smoking cult in place of fetish-worship. Enormous gourd pipes were used. Cannabis was used in Africa to restore appetite and relieve pain of hemorrhoids. It was also used as an antiseptic. In a number of countries, it was used to treat tetanus, hydrophobia, delirium tremens, infantile convulsions, neuralgia and other nervous disorders, cholera, menorrhagia, rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and protracted labor during childbirth.\n\nIn Africa, there were a number of cults and sects of hemp worship. Pogge and Wissman, during their explorations of 1881, visited the Bashilenge, living on the northern borders of the Lundu, between Sankrua and Balua. They found large plots of land around the villages used for the cultivation of hemp. Originally there were small clubs of hemp smokers, bound by ties of friendship, but these eventually led to the formation of a religious cult. The Bashilenge called themselves \"Bena Riamba\", \"the sons of hemp\", and their land Lubuku, meaning friendship. They greeted each other with the expression \"moio\", meaning both \"hemp\" and \"life.\"\nEach tribesman was required to participate in the cult of Riamba and show his devotion by smoking as frequently as possible. They attributed universal magical powers to hemp, which was thought to combat all kinds of evil and they took it when they went to war and when they traveled. There were initiation rites for new members which usually took place before a war or long journey. The hemp pipe assumed a symbolic meaning for the Bashilenge somewhat analogous to the significance which the peace pipe had for American Indians. No holiday, no trade agreement, no peace treaty was transacted without it. In the middle Sahara region, the Senusi sect also cultivated hemp on a large scale for use in religious ceremonies.\n\nIn ancient Germanic paganism, cannabis was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya. The harvesting of the plant was connected with an erotic high festival. It was believed that Freya lived as a fertile force in the plant's feminine flowers and by ingesting them one became influenced by this divine force. Linguistics offers further evidence of prehistoric use of cannabis by Germanic peoples: The word \"hemp\" derives from Old English \"hænep\", from Proto-Germanic *\"hanapiz\", from the same Scythian word that \"cannabis\" derives from. The etymology of this word follows Grimm's Law by which Proto-Indo-European initial \"*k-\" becomes \"*h-\" in Germanic. The shift of *k→h indicates it was a loanword into the Germanic parent language at a time depth no later than the separation of Common Germanic from Proto-Indo-European, about 500 BC.\n\nThe Celts may have also used cannabis, as evidence of hashish traces were found in Hallstatt, birthplace of Celtic culture.\nAlso, the Dacians and the Scythians had a tradition where a fire was made in an inclosed space and cannabis seeds were burnt and the resulting smoke ingested.\n\nThere exist reports that cannabis was ritually consumed by a Sufi sect called \"Melamis\", and also in the cult of \"Hassan Sabbah\", or the \"Hashshashin\".\n\nThe Assyrians, Egyptians, and Hebrews, among other Semitic cultures of the Middle East, mostly acquired cannabis from Aryan cultures and have burned it as an incense as early as 1000 BC.\n\nIn Egypt, cannabis pollen was recovered from the tomb of Ramses II, who governed for sixty‐seven years during the 19 dynasty, and several mummies contain trace cannabinoids. \n\nCannabis oil was likely used throughout the Middle East for centuries before and after the birth of Christ. It is mentioned in the original Hebrew Old Testament and in its Aramaic translations as both incense and as intoxicant. Cannabis, as an incense, was used in the temples of Assyria and Babylon because \"its aroma was pleasing to the Gods.\"\n\nIn Exodus 30:23 of the Bible, God directed Moses to make a holy oil composed of “myrrh, sweet cinnamon, kaneh bosm and kassia”. The root \"kan\" has two meanings in many Ancient languages; hemp and reed. In numerous translations of the original Hebrew Bible, \"kaneh bosm\" has been erroneously translated as “calamus” or “aromatic reed,” when the actual translation is closer to hemp. This error appears in translations as early as the third century B.C in Septuagint, the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and also appears in following translations such as Martin Luther’s. \n\n"}

The definition may be extended to include human conscience or providence or providential history. \n\nGeneral revelation is a form of revelation that gives knowledge through experience or records of history, creation, and innate conscience. Christian theologians cite biblical references to support general revelation: , , and .

The former refers to the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through supernatural means, such as scripture or miracles, and the latter refers to direct communication from God to a person.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3001074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3001074", "title": "Jane Barker", "text": "Jane Barker\n\nJane Barker (1652–1732) was a popular English fiction writer, poet, and a staunch Jacobite. She went into self-imposed exile when James II fled England during the Glorious Revolution in 1688. Her novels, \"The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia\", also published as \"Love Intrigues\" (1713), \"Exilius\" or \"The Banish'd Roman\" (1715), \"A Patchwork Screen for the Ladies\" (1723), and \"The Lining of the Patchwork Screen for the Ladies\" (1726) were written after she returned to London in 1704. Prior to and during her exile, she wrote a collection of poems justifying the value of feminine education and female single life, \"Poetical Recreations\" (1688), and a group of political poems, \"A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times\" (1701), which conveyed her anxiety about the political future of England.\n\nAlthough not known for her letter writing, four extant letters are located in the British Library and within the Magdalen Manuscript at the Oxford Magdalen library, written between 1670-88. Jane Barker was one of the first female authors to publish writings both in manuscript and print form, allowing modern scholars to study \"the passage of Barker's poetry from coterie circles to larger, more impersonal communities of readers\" Never married, Jane Barker died quietly in 1732.\n\nJane Barker was born in May 1652, in the village of Blatherwick, Northamptonshire in England to Thomas Barker and Anne Connock. Anne Connock seems to be descended from an unlanded and Roman Catholic branch of the Connock family, which might explain Jane's Papist affiliation. A member of a royalist family, Jane Barker went into exile with James II once William of Orange entered England, threatening an overthrow of the outwardly Catholic James II. When Jane was 10 years old, Thomas Barker leased a property and manor in Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire. This property was bequeathed to both Jane Barker and her mother upon her father's death in 1681 and she relocated to the property upon returning from exile in 1704.\n\nAs a young woman, Jane Barker was taught Latin, anatomy, and herbal medicine by her brother, Edward, who matriculated at St. John's College, Oxford in 1668 and earned his M.A. from Christ Church, Oxford in 1674-5. Proof of Jane Barker's knowledge of medicine can be seen in the advertisement for\"Dr. Barker's Famous Gout Plaister,\" and in her poems about anatomy found in her \"Poetical Recreations\". Indebted to her brother for providing her with the basis of her education, Jane mourned his death in 1675, shortly after he finished his time at Oxford.\n\nBarker was baptized on 17 May 1652 according to the rites of the Church of England; however, she converted to Catholicism during reign of James II (of England), between 1685 and 1688. After James' defeat by the Prince of Orange (William III) in the Glorious Revolution, London became a dangerous place for Catholics, prompting Barker to follow James II to exile in France.\n\nFollowing an ideology of Jacobitism, and a royalist, Jane Barker was one of the 40,000 people who followed James II in exile to France. She was one of the smaller number of individuals who maintained residence at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1689. James II maintained court in Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a castle lent to the Stuarts by Louis XIV from 1689 to 1704.\n\nBarker's Jacobite involvement is further evidenced in her letter to James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, who began organizing a Jacobite invasion from France. Dated 19 March 1718, the letter implicitly informed Ormonde that his supporters in England awaited his invasion. However, the letter was intercepted in that same year by the British Secrete Office, the anti-Jacobite intelligence organization. Since Barker's name and handwriting were unknown to the government authorities, it is suspected that she was used as a ghost-writer for the letter—a technique used to protect plotters whose identities and handwriting were already well known by authorities.\n\n\"Poetical Recreations\" (1688)<br>\n\"A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times\" (1701)<br>\n\"Love Intrigues';' or \"The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia\" (1713)<br>\n\"Exilius\"; or \"The Banish'd Roman\" (1715)<br>\n\"The Christian Pilgrimage\" (1718)<br>\n\"A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies\" (1723)<br>\n\"The Lining of the Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies\" (1726)\n\nOriginally published in 1688, the first part of this two-part compilation comprises Barker's own poems addressed to her friends, and the second part contains poems written by Barker's friends addressed to Barker herself. Described as written by \"several Gentlemen of the Universities, and Others,\" the second part of \"Poetical Recreations\" was written by contributors from Cambridge or Oxford University. Originally printed without the author's permission by Benjamin Crayle, the title page of \"Poetical Recreations\" boasted that poems within were \"Occasionally written by Mrs. Jane Barker\". Benjamin Crayle also contributed twelve poems in Part Two and expressed his admiration for Barker's literary taste. A note in what is now called the Magdalen Manuscript suggests that the publisher did not have Barker's permission to print the collection: it reads \"now corrected by her own hand.\" The marginalia indicates that the initial collection was not yet meant for public consumption. Scholar Kathryn King finds evidence through marginal notations in the Magdalen Manuscript that Barker's works are autobiographical.\n\nWritten at the end of her time at Saint-Germaine-en-Laye, \"A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times\" is highly political and takes a pro-Stuart position. The speaker in the collection, Fidelia, is considered autobiographical. She is characterized as a Stuart loyalist and Catholic convert, depicting Barker's own political and religious affiliations. Upon returning to England, Jane Barker gifted a copy of her \"A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times\" to the son of James II for his birthday. The manuscript holding in the British Library is believed to contain a prototype copy of the collection.\n\nOriginally printed in 1713 and revised and reprinted in 1719, \"Love Intrigues\" was the first installment in what came to be known as the \"Galesia Trilogy\". It has been suggested that Bosvil's character was based heavily on a man whom Barker knew well. King suggests that the original edition of the novel in 1713 was not meant for publication because major revisions were made before it was reprinted, with a new title, in 1719. \"Love Intrigues\" was the first novel that Barker published, though probably without her permission, with Edmund Curll. Curll published some of her later works. It was suspected that Curll probably added the term \"Amours\" to the title for better commercial appeal.\n\nPublished just after the death of Queen Anne in 1714, \"Exilius\" can be read as a pro-Stuart response to the succession crisis that followed Anne's death. There is some suggestion that Curll sped up the release of the work so that he could capitalize on the market potential during the political upheaval. This novel is understood to be a projection of Jacobite feeling through themes including romance, love, and heroism. Written primarily for a female audience, the male characters within the fiction are stock representations while female characters are developed virtuously and follow strict moral tenets. Jonathan Grieder states that formally the work is weak, but because it appeals to women during the early eighteenth century it can inform the reader about feminine interests during the time of its publication.\n\nIn 1718, Barker published her translation of a French Catholic devotional manual, \"The Christian Pilgrimage\", originally written by François Fénelon, the archbishop of Cambrai. Translated as a response to the severe government reprisals on the Catholic community in England in early 1716, this devotional manual reframed a Protestants' understanding of Catholicism in order to discourage any further egregious actions against the Catholic community. Barker's translation of Fénelon's work offered a take on Catholicism that used the vocabulary of the Church of England; she removed extraneous Catholic representation from the original so as not to dissuade Protestant readership.\n\nPublished in 1723, \"A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies\" is based loosely on the \"Lettres Portugaises\", published in 1669. \"The Lining of the Patch-Work Screen\" was written in 1726. Often recognized to be a blending of genre conventions including romance, bourgeois fiction, poems, hymns, odes, recipes, philosophical reflections, among others, the two works create a hybrid genre. Barker uses the metaphor of the patch-work screen to raise questions about politics, sexual politics, economics, and finance in her society. In \"A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies\", Barker includes autobiographical information and also includes revised poems from \"Poetical Recreations\" including \"Anatomy,\" the poem which indicates Barker's proficiency in medicine.\n\nCapitalizing on the education she received from her brother, Barker established herself as an author within mostly male coteries during the second half of the seventeenth century. Barker worked to alleviate the stigma of spinsterhood and make it an acceptable alternative to marriage. A celibate woman, Barker belonged to the tradition of female martial valor and enjoyed her freedom from men in her own personal life. There is evidence that Barker used Katherine Philips' Orinda as a model for her own speaker, Fidelia, without including homosexual undertones that are present within Katherine Philips' writings. Barker established herself as a published female author whose print works were primarily for a female audience. Her dedications, \"to the ladies,\" also suggest that she was writing for an elite female readership, although this dedication may have been included by Edmund Curll for marketing purposes.\n\nJane Barker was the first woman to firmly position herself as an author working with both manuscript and print media. Choosing to publish in both spheres gave both a mainstream readership as well as the more intimate coteries access to her work. Because of her interest in manuscript and print, Barker has one foot in the old world methods of circulating works and one in the modern market-place. Relying upon income from her later publications for money, Barker had more freedom and independence than other female authors of the early modern period. Depicted as an autobiographical author by Kathryn R. King, Jane Barker's works display a strong feminist bent, offering her readership information regarding single womanhood, female education and politics.\n\n\n\n"}

In most religions you can find popular expressions of faith which rely on the worship of external powers such as an idol of some kind that is expected to bestow favor after being given offerings of faith from a believer. Some believers of Pure Land Buddhism accept that through faith and reliance on Amitabha Buddha one will be led to enlightenment, as some Western Christians believe that asking Jesus to cleanse one's sins will lead to the attainment of such a desire. These are examples of tariki, reliance on a power outside of oneself for salvation.\n\nJiriki is experiencing truth for oneself and not merely accepting the testimony of another. An example of jiriki in Buddhism is the practice of meditation. In meditation, one observes the body (most often in the form of following the breath and mind to directly experience the principles of impermanence and dependent arising or \"emptiness\") of all phenomena. Such principles are formally discussed in the Buddhist scriptures, but jiriki implies experiencing them for oneself.\n"}

Additionally, many students perform dances and play music native to their cultures for the entire student body to celebrate in. Kearny High School's student populated is largely represented by Irish-Americans, Peruvian-Americans, Portuguese-Americans, Brazilian-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans, and Dominican-Americans, among many other groups. In 2010, the school celebrated its 13th Annual International Festival, of which featured over 85 different cultural tables.\n\nIn the autumn of 2006, a controversy was generated by the discovery that David Paszkiewicz, a history teacher at Kearny High of 14 years, taught Christian doctrine to his students during an American history class. When confronted by Kearny High School junior Matthew LaClair in a meeting with Paszkiewicz and the administration, Paszkiewicz denied the charge. After this, LaClair produced recorded tapes in which Paszkiewicz was recorded saying that God \"did everything in his power to make sure that you could go to heaven, so much so that he took your sins on his own body, suffered your pains for you, and he's saying, 'Please, accept me, believe.' If you reject that, you belong in hell.\"\n\nThe teacher is said to have also taught that there were dinosaurs aboard Noah's Ark and that there is no scientific basis for evolution or the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.\n\nThe controversy raised questions over the legal right of students to record what teachers tell them during class, with some advocating the practice to ensure teacher accountability, and others arguing that it infringes on the teacher's personal liberty.\n\nLaClair's supporters reported that \"he has been the target of harassment and a death threat from fellow students and 'retaliation' by school officials who have treated him, not the teacher, as the problem. The retaliation, they say, includes the district's policy banning students from recording what is said in class without a teacher's permission and officials' refusal to punish students who have harassed Matthew.\"\n\nDeborah Jacobs, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) said Kearny High School had \"violated the spirit and the letter of freedom of religion and the First Amendment\", and that the ACLU would support the LaClairs if they were to file suit. The People for the American Way Foundation expressed similar support.\n\nOn November 16, 2006, \"The Jersey Journal\" reported that the School District had taken \"corrective action\" against Paszkiewicz, the precise nature of which was not specified. The administrators stated that further action might be warranted, based on Paszkiewicz's continuing conduct.\n\nThis matter is the subject of an hour-long documentary film \"In God We Teach\", which includes statements from a variety of people involved (in particular both the teacher and student) as well as others outside the school.\n\nDuring the 2006-07 school year Celeste Adamski, a 27-year-old English teacher was suspended with pay on suspicion of sexual activity with one or more of her students. In mid-October she pleaded guilty to an allegation concerning her behavior with a male student as part of a plea agreement in which she gave up her teaching certificate and was barred from teaching or holding a public job.\n\nCore members of the school's administration are: \n\n\n"}

The gables are set at a right angle to the main roof ridge, and the \"honden\" is part of a single complex also including a \"haiden\" (worship hall). Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture, Japan is the sole example of the style, although the Soshi-dō of Hokekyō-ji in Chiba prefecture is believed to have been modeled on it.\n\nThe T-shaped shrine is composed of two buildings: the \"haiden\" or prayer hall, in the front, and the \"honden\" or sanctuary, in the back, both under the same roof and joined by a short stairway (see floorplan). Both buildings show the clear influence of Buddhist architecture, as they include features of all major styles, that is Daibutsuyō, Zenshūyō and Wayō.\n\nThe \"honden\", which shows strong \"daibutsuyō\" influences, is extremely large, measuring 14.64 x 17.99 m, or 5 (front) x 8 (depth) x 7 (rear) bays, with bays of a different length according to their position.\n\nThe \"honden's\" interior has a complex structure, being divided in six separate sections joined by six different stairways (see flooplan). At the very center of the \"honden\" are two sanctuaries, the which measures 3 x 2 bays, and the , which measures 3 x 1 bays. The two sanctuaries are surrounded on all sides by two corridors called the and the . Between the \"chūjin\" and the \"gejin\" lies a 5 x 1 bay space called , also called . The closer one gets to the center, the higher the floor and the ceiling. The ceiling's structure itself changes, as most of the \"chūjin\" and the entire \"gejin\" have no ceiling, and the roof is therefore exposed, whereas other sections have ceilings of different types. The \"nainaijin\" for example lies below the gables. The whole area is decorated with vermillion and black lacquer.\n\nThe \"honden\" is connected in the front to the \"haiden\" by a 1 x 1 bay passage and a short stairway.

Other Buddhist teachers and scholars offer differing interpretations of the origins of Chöd, and not all of them agree that Chöd has Bön or shamanistic roots.\n\nIconographically, Machig Labdrön is often depicted with the attributes of a dakini, a representation of enlightened female energy. She holds a drum (Skt. damaru) in her right hand and a bell (Skt. \"ghaṇṭa\") () in her left. Her right leg is often lifted and the standing left leg is bent in motion. Machig is white in color with three eyes and wears the Six Bone Ornaments of the charnel grounds, which is traditional for a practicing yogini. Dakinis wear five bone ornaments; they are themselves the wisdom pāramitā attribute.\n\nApart from the name \"Machig Labdrön\" used here, the following spellings and transliterations are also found, all referring to the same woman:\n\n\nOne of Machig Labdrön's teachers, Sönam Lama, gave her the tantric name of \"Dorje Wangchuma\" (), which means \"Diamond Independent Goddess.\"\n\nIn the \"Life of Yeshe Tsogyel\", Padmasambhava predicted that Yeshe Tsogyal would be reborn as Machig Labdrön, and her consort, Atsara Sale, would become Topabhadra, Machig’s husband. Her assistant and Padmasambhava's secondary consort, Tashi Khyidren, would be reborn as Machig’s only daughter, and so on. All of the important figures in Tsogyel's life were to be reborn in the life of Machig Lapdron, including Padmasambhava himself, who would become Phadampa Sangye.\n\nTibetan Buddhists believe Machig was the Mind Stream emanation (tulku) of Yeshe Tsogyal, as well as \"an emanation of the 'Great Mother of Wisdom,' \"Yum Chenmo,\"(prajnaparamita) and of \"Arya Tara\", who transmitted to her teachings and initiations.\" Buddhists believe this pattern of reincarnations and emanations continued into the life just before her birth as Machig Labdrön an that in the lifetime before, she was the Indian yogi, Mönlam Drub. After his death, the body of the twenty-year-old Mönlam Drub is said to have remained \"alive\" in the cave of Potari in South India. According to tradition, it was Mönlam Drub's mindstream which entered the womb of \"Bum Cham\" \"Great Noble Woman\", who lived in the area of Labchi Eli Gangwar in Tibet, which caused the birth of Machig. According to one version of Machig Labdron's biography, Machig Labdron's mother experienced auspicious dreams of dakinis shortly after conception, dreams which contained the vase and the conch of the Ashtamangala:\n\nAs a child and young woman, Machig made a living as a liturgy reader. She was fortunate to be literate and patrons would hire her to read the \"Prajnaparamita Sutra\" or 'The Perfection of Wisdom', a Mahayana sutra, in their homes as a form of blessing and to gain spiritual merit. Machig was known to be a very fast reader and so was in much demand as this meant that she could complete the entire text quickly and her patrons would have to pay for fewer meals for her while she read.\n\nThe namtar entitled \"Secret Biography of Machig Labdron\" relates the struggles that Machig Labdron underwent in order to avoid traditional marriage and eventually left home to practice Buddhism as her life's calling. After leaving the monastic order in Yuchong, she married Indian Pandita Topa Draya (), also a Buddhist practitioner, who supported Machig in her practices. Together, they had two sons and one daughter (or three sons and two daughters by some accounts). Her second son, Tonyon Samdru (thod-smyon bsam-grub), became one of her main successors and a propagator of Machig Labdron's teachings. He became a monk at the age of 15 under the tutorship of Dampa Sangye.\n\nSome say that Machig received instructions from Dampa Sangye as her guru and the reincarnation of Padmasambhava which led to profound realizations. However, for several years Machig's main practice was one of tantric union with her spiritual consort and husband, Topabhadra, an emanation of Gautama Buddha, with whom she raised a family, living on the \"red and white essence,\" according to a prediction given to Machig by Arya Tara.\n\nEven though Machig spent some time living with monastics, she was not a celibate nun; she partnered and had both daughters and sons who became lineage holders. One of her sons even started out as a thief. Machig was eventually able to bring him to the Dharma and became his teacher: \"You may think that Gods are the one's who give you benefits, and Demons cause damage; but it may be the other way round. Those who cause pain teach you to be patient, and those who give you presents may keep you from practising the Dharma. So it depends on their effect on you if they are Gods or Demons,\" she said.\n\nDuring Machig Labdrön's lifetime, the Buddhist teachings that came from India were considered authentic and it was believed there were none that originated in Tibet. As one of Machig's biographies states:\nAs a result, there was so much controversy over Machig Labdrön's teachings that a delegation of Brahmins was sent from India to Tibet to assess Machig's qualifications and teachings. After her students gathered with her at Zangri Khangmar (Machig's home in Tibet from the age of 39 until her death at the age of 99), Machig taught and debated with the pandits. In addition, a delegation was sent to South India to find the śarīra (relics) of Mönlam Drub as Machig instructed, thus adding further validity to her status as a teacher and lineage holder. As a result, of these and other events, it was determined that Machig's teachings were indeed authentic and established that the Chöd teachings were the first Buddhist teachings to emerge in Tibet. One source says, \"Word of the widespread practice of Mahāmudra Chö in Tibet and Nepal was first viewed in India with great scepticism. A delegation of ācāryas was sent from Bodh Gayā to Tibet to test Machig Labrön and her teaching resulted in the acceptance of Mahāmudrā Chö as a valid and authentic Mahāyāna tradition. Thereafter its practice spread even to India.\"\n\nAlong with her sons, prominent among Machig Labdron's disciples were four main women disciples who were called Machig Labdrön's \"Gyen\" \"Ornaments\". Many of Machig Labdrön's teachings were given in direct response to the questions of her students.\n\nMachig Labdrön has incarnated and emanated both in Tibet and in the West. In Tibet, it is said that Machig Labdrön took incarnation as Jomo Menmo (1248–1283). According to the information given by the website of Ogyen Trinley Dorje, one of the two claimants to the seat of the Karmapa, Jomo Menmo was born as a \"karmic emanation\" of Yeshe Tsogyal.\nThe first Samding Dorje Phagmo, Chökyi Drönma (1422–1455), a female tulku lineage of Vajravārāhī, was understood to be an incarnation of Machig Labdrön.\n\nIn more recent history, in Tibet, the great yogini Shukseb Jetsun Choying Zangmo (1852–1953)—also called Ani Lochen, Lochen Chönyi Zangmo, and Shukseb Jetsun Rinpoche—was a recognized incarnation of Machig. Shuksheb Jetsun reinvigorated the Shuksep gompa () of the Kagyü thirty miles from Lhasa on the slopes of Mount Gangri Thökar.\n\nKhandro Sonam Peldron of Bhutan (11 century)\n\nKhandro Sonam Peldron of Wang Dharlung, Bhutan is said to be the main reincarnation of Machik Labdron.\n\nKhandro Sonam is the wife of Phajo Drugom Zhipo of Tibet, who were crucial in the establishment of the Drukpa Lineage of Kagyü in Bhutan. Phajo Drugom Zhigpo was sent to Bhutan by Tsangpa Gyarey Yeshey Dorji of Druk Ralung, Tibet to establish the Drukpa Lineage in Bhutan. Phajo and Khandro had four sons and a daughter together . The bridge where Phajo and Khandro met in Thimphu still exist today known as Lungtenzampa. Khandro Sonam Peldron is known to have achieved the supreme enlightenment called Zha lue Phochen and is known to have flown to the heavenly Dali I abode from near Tango monastery in Thimphu.\n\nLama Tsultrim Allione (1947- ), an American Buddhist teacher, was recently recognized as an emanation of Machig Labdrön at Zangri Khangmar, Tibet, the place where Machig Labdrön lived from ages 37 to 99, and where she died. She was recognized by the resident Lama, Karma Nyitön Kunkhyab Chökyi Dorje. Lama Karma Nyitön Kunkhyab Chökyi Dorje offered Lama Tsultrim a self-arisen golden crystal kīla or ceremonial dagger, the only remaining \"tsa tsa\" (icon) made from the ashes of Machig's body (a mixture of clay and ash imprinted with an image of Machig dancing), texts of Machig's teachings, a hat with symbolic meaning designed by Machig, and various other treasures.\n\nMachig Labdrön's Chöd, also known as Mahamudra Chöd, has been widespread in Tibet since Machig's lifetime. It is also called \"The Beggars' Offering\" or \"The Cutting-Off-Ritual.\" Chöd is a visionary Buddhist practice of cutting attachment to one’s corporeal form (in terms of the dualistic proclivity to relate to one's corporeal form as a reference-point that proves one's existence). This means that a practitioner offers the mandala of their own body in a ganachakra rite. The practitioner works entirely with their own mind, visualizing the offering, and—by practicing in lonely and dreaded places, like cemeteries—works to overcome all fear. This is also why Chöd was often used to overcome sickness in order to heal oneself and others. In some lineages of the Chöd practice, chodpas and chodmas (practitioners of Chöd) use a ritual bell, a specialized drum called a Chöd damaru, and a human thigh-bone trumpet (often obtained from the charnel ground of sky burials).\n\nOne of the distinct features of Machig Labdrön's Chöd is the focus on what are sometimes called either demons ('dre) or \"devils\" (\"bdud\"). It is clear from Machig Labdrön's writings and teachings that the entities being dealt with in Chöd practices are formulations of the human mind, rather than supernatural beings. One of Machig Labdrön's unique contributions to Chöd is her understanding of demons.\n\nAs Machik Labdrön explained in answer to the questions of one of her students, Gangpa Muksang, \n\nIn another teaching, Machik Labdrön said:\nAccording to Anila Rinchen at Kagyu Ling in Burgundy, France, the Tibetan term for \"demon\" could be translated as \"neurosis\".\n\nThere are many pilgrimage sites in Tibet associated with Machik Labdrön. Among these are the Tselha Namsum meditation caves near Gyamda in Tibet.\n\n\n\n"}

This word is unknown outside this verse appearing in none of the contemporary literature. It might be linked to the Greek term for babbling, or it might also be derived from the Hebrew \"batel\", vain. It is often assumed to be a related to the word \"polugein\", and thus a reference to a large quantity of words.\n\nThis verse moves away from condemning the hypocrites to condemning the Gentiles. Matthew never makes clear who these Gentiles are, though pagan prayers to Baal and other gods are mentioned in the Old Testament. In Luke's version of this verse, found at , it is not the Gentiles who are condemned but \"the rest of men.\"\n\nFrance notes that in this era Gentile prayer was portrayed as repeated incantations that had to be perfectly recited, but where the spirit and understanding of the prayer was secondary. Fowler states that the Jews believed the pagans needed to incessantly repeat their prayers, because their false gods would not answer them. The followers of the true God had no need to repeat their prayers as God would hear them the first time. Schweizer presents an alternate view. He does not feel \"battalogeo\" is a reference to repetition, but to nonsense. He argues that the Jews of that era felt that the pagans had forgotten the true name of God, and that their prayers were thus filled with long lists of meaningless words in an attempt to ensure the true name of God would at some point be mentioned.\n\nThis verse is not generally seen as a condemnation of repetitive prayer. Jesus himself repeats prayers, such as at , and in two verses he gives a prayer to be repeated. Rather this verse is read as a condemnation of rote prayer without understanding of why one is praying. Protestants such as Martin Luther have used this verse to attack Catholic prayer practices such as the use of rosaries.\n"}

He took the name Matthew when he entered the Dominican Order. His later success as a preacher was inarguable, attributable to the significant time he spent in spiritual exercises and meditation between preaching.\n\nOne of the major events in Carrieri's life was his capture by a Turkish corsair, while on a voyage from Genoa to Pisa. When asked to explain their purpose for being on board the ship, Carrieri spoke up so forcefully and convincingly, that the captain set him and the two friars accompanying him free. The friar then saw that the pirates were still keeping a woman and her daughter captive, planning to sell them into slavery in Algeria. He proposed to the captain that they keep him in their place. So shocked was the pirate captain by Carrieri's willingness to sacrifice himself, that he freed all five captives.\n\nCarrieri was a very close associate of a noted Dominican tertiary, the Blessed Stephana de Quinzanis, in her youth. He was responsible for her catechesis, and predicted that she would be his \"spiritual heiress.\" The meaning of this statement was illuminated when Stephana also began to experience pains similar to Carrieri's, which, according to those concerned, were the result of his devotion to the Passion of Christ.\n\nCarrieri's hagiography states that on 5 October 1470 he asked his superior for permission to die, and upon receiving this, he died.\n\nIn 1482, Pope Sixtus IV authorized the solemn transfer of Matthew's relics and allowed formal liturgical celebration of Blessed Matthew Carrieri's \"cultus\".\n"}

{"id": "42823730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42823730", "title": "Minor exorcism in Christianity", "text": "Minor exorcism in Christianity\n\nThe expression minor exorcism can be used in a technical sense or a general sense. The general sense indicates any exorcism which is not a solemn exorcism of a person believed to be possessed, including various forms of deliverance ministry. This article deals only with the technical sense which specifically refers to certain prayers used with persons preparing to become baptised members of the Christian Church. These prayers request God's assistance so that the person to be baptised will be kept safe from the power of Satan or protected in a more general way from temptation.\n\nAs early as the 3rd century of Western Christianity, there is evidence of the existence of four minor orders of clergy in the Latin Church, one of which was entitled 'exorcist'. Pope Cornelius (251–253) noted that among the clergy in Rome there were fifty-two such exorcists, among other ministries listed, and the institution of these orders, and the organization of their functions, seems to have been the work of Cornelius's predecessor, Pope Fabian (236–250).\n\nText previously attributed to a fourth Council of Carthage in 398, now identified as a collection called \"Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua\", prescribes in its seventh canon the rite of ordination of such an exorcist: the bishop is to give him the book containing the formulae of exorcism, saying, \"Receive, and commit to memory, and possess the power of imposing hands on energumens, whether baptized or catechumens\"; and the same rite was still in use in the early 20th century, except that instead of the ancient Book of Exorcisms, the Roman Pontifical, or Roman Missal, was placed into the hands of the ordinand. The same canons required that those preparing to be baptised (known as catechumens) were to undergo a daily imposition of hands by these exorcists.\n\nThe 4th century Mystagogical Catechesis of Cyril of Jerusalem gives a detailed description of baptismal exorcism, from which it appears that anointing with exorcised oil formed a part of this exorcism in the East. Anointing with oil as part of baptismal exorcism is also mentioned in the Apostolic Tradition and the Arabic Canons of Hippolytus – early 20th Century scholarship attributed both of these documents to Hippolytus of Rome, but the origin of both sources is now disputed.\n\nAuthors such as Eusebius (3rd century) and Augustine (4th century) provide further details of these minor exorcisms, prayers and ceremonies performed over adults preparing for baptism. Eusebius mentions the imposition of hands and prayer. Among the Latins, and especially at Rome, breathing accompanied with a form of exorcism and placing in the mouth a little exorcised salt, was employed in addition to the signing with the cross and the imposition of hands. Mostly those in the minor order of exorcist performed the ceremony of exorcism, then a priest signed the catechumens with the cross and laid hands upon them. The final ceremony took place on Holy Saturday, when the priest himself performed the ceremony of exorcism.\n\nAn \"exsufflatio\", or out-breathing of the demon by the candidate, which was sometimes part of the ceremony, symbolized the renunciation of the Devil, while the \"insufflatio\", or in-breathing of the Holy Spirit, by ministers and assistants, symbolised the infusion of sanctifying grace by the sacrament. Augustine noted that rites of exorcism by exsufflation were also performed for the baptism of infants.\n\nAfter the English Reformation, the Anglican baptismal rite in the 1549 \"Book of Common Prayer\", which was based on the Sarum Rite, \"took place at the church door and included singing with the cross on forehead and breast and an exorcism.\" Similarly, the Lutheran Church, in its 1526 \"Baptismal Booklet\" contained a minor exorcism before the sign of the cross.\n\nMost of these ancient ceremonies were retained in the rites still practiced by the Catholic Church in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nToday, in some provinces of the Anglican Communion, the \"Anglican liturgy does not involve an explicit exorcism or rejection of evil, but does including a signing with the cross and the wish that baptism delivers one from \"the powers of darkness.\" Others, such as the Anglican Church of Tanzania, however, provide for anointing and consignation that accompanies \"the exorcism that follows the examination of the candidates\".\n\nIn 1972, the minor orders were reformed; men preparing to be ordained as Catholic priests or deacons would no longer receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of lector and acolyte were retained, but redesignated as \"ministries\". It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a \"ministry of exorcist\" if it seemed useful in that nation. Since then, Pope Benedict XVI mandated that each diocese in the world should have at least one active exorcist, and encouraged training of priests by the International Association of Exorcists in Rome.\n\nAs part of the wider reforms of the Second Vatican Council, all Catholic liturgical books were updated, including the rites for the baptism of adults and of children. The revised rites retained prayers designated \"minor exorcisms\", for use during or before the ceremony of baptism itself. These would be performed as a routine part of the normal preparation for Christian baptism.\n\nIn 1969, an English translation was released of the Rite of Baptism for Children (later amended 1984). Baptism could now be celebrated by a priest or deacon and included a formula of minor exorcism. This was located in the rite immediately following prayers for the child and a Litany of the Saints, and was immediately followed by an anointing with the oil of catechumens.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council also called for adults seeking baptism to be part of a formal process of preparation, or catechumenate, as was the case in the early church. A Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults was therefore prepared after the Council, and an interim English edition published in 1974. A revised and expanded version for the USA was published in 1988. The rite includes a selection of eleven texts for minor exorcisms, which may be performed on one or more occasions during the months when a person enrolled as a catechumen is preparing for baptism. Anointing with the oil of catechumens may be repeated on several occasions. The notes also indicate that the minor exorcisms may be carried out by a lay catechist deputed for this purpose by the bishop, though the use of the oil of catechumens is reserved to deacons and priests.\n\nIn addition to these exorcisms, the Rite for Adults includes three ceremonies called scrutinies, to be celebrated as integral parts of the Sunday Eucharist on the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sundays of Lent. Each scrutiny contain a prayer of exorcism reserved to the deacon or priest. There is also a simplified set of prayers provided for use with children mature enough to be personally catechised. The only minor exorcism in the children's rite is part of a one-off scrutiny which is offered in two forms. Both texts use the image of entering the light of Christ, turning respectively from \"darkness\" and from \"whatever could make them bad\".\n\nThe USA ritual book also contains additional prayers to be used with already-baptised Christians preparing to be received into full communion with the Catholic Church, including a one-off scrutiny which may be celebrated on the Second Sunday of Lent. Although it notes that a careful distinction must be made between the exorcisms of catechumens and this penitential rite for baptised adults, one possible prayer over the candidates prays that the candidates may \"be freed of ... obstacles and falsehoods\" while the other prays that they may \"resist all that is deceitful and harmful\" and that Jesus would \"heal the wounds of their sins\".\n\nIn the Lutheran Church, through its Rite of Exorcism in the Baptismal Liturgy, \"the Church has kept an opportunity to teach how serious this falleness' is, and can, through bold proclamations against the devil, teach what a blessing and joy it is to receive the Holy Spirit with the Water and Word of Holy Baptism. Rather than inviting the devil into one by ignoring his presence in all the unbaptized, the Church proclaims boldly his overthrow (James 4:7), and reminds herself, and all her members, who our enemies truly are: the devil, the world, and, yes, even our own sinful flesh. And, the Good News that one dies with Christ, and rises to new life in Him with the Water and the Word, brings us comfort in our battles with our defeated enemies (Romans 6:4; 16:20).\"\n\nThe baptismal liturgy, used in the United Methodist Church, contains a minor exorcism, when the candidate for baptism is asked to reject the 'spiritual forces of wickedness and evil powers of this world'.\n\n"}

{"id": "52413830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52413830", "title": "Mormonism and slavery", "text": "Mormonism and slavery\n\nThe Latter Day Saint movement has had varying and conflicting teachings on slavery. Early converts were initially from the Northern United States and opposed slavery, believing they were supported by Mormon scripture. After the church base moved to the slave state of Missouri and gained Southern converts, church leaders began justifying slavery. New scriptures were revealed teaching against interfering with the slaves of others. A few slave owners joined the church, and took their slaves with them to Nauvoo, Illinois, although Illinois was a free state.\n\nAfter Joseph Smith's death, the church split. The largest contingent followed Brigham Young, who supported slavery but opposed abuse, and became The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A smaller contingent followed Joseph Smith III, who opposed slavery, and became the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). Young led his followers to Utah, where he led the efforts to legalize slavery in the Utah Territory. Brigham Young taught that slavery was ordained of God and taught that the Republican Party's efforts to abolish slavery went against the decrees of God and would eventually fail. He also encouraged members to participate in the Indian slave trade.\n\nMormon scripture simultaneously denounces both slavery and abolitionism in general, teaching that it was not right for men to be in bondage to each other, but that one should not interfere with the slaves of others. While in Missouri, Joseph Smith defended slavery, arguing that the Old Testament taught that blacks were cursed with servitude, a belief that was common in America at the time. While promoting the legality of slavery, the church consistently taught against the abuse of slaves and advocated for laws that provided protection. Critics said the church's definition of abuse of slaves was vague and difficult to enforce.\n\nBoth Joseph Smith and Brigham Young referred to the Curse of Ham to justify slavery. According to the Bible, after Cain killed Abel, God cursed him and put a mark on him,() although the Bible does not state the nature of the mark. In another biblical account, Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, Canaan to be \"servants of servants\".() While nothing explicitly supports enslaving black Africans, one interpretation that was popular in the United States during the Atlantic slave trade was that the mark of Cain was black skin, and it was passed on through Canaan's descendants, who they believed were black Africans. They argued that because Canaan was cursed to be servants of servants, then they were justified in enslaving Canaan's descendants. By the 1800s, this interpretation was widely accepted in America, including among Mormons. An assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote in a letter that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain, and that the Canaanites were black Africans and covered by both curses.\n\nIn June 1830, Joseph Smith began translating the Bible. Parts of it were canonized as the Book of Moses and accepted as official LDS scripture in 1880. It states that \"the seed of Cain were black\" (). This is the only place in LDS scripture that defines the mark of Cain as being black. The Book of Moses also discusses a group of people called the Canaanites, who were also black (). These Canaanites lives before the flood, and hence before the Biblical Canaan. Later, in 1835, Smith produced a work called the Book of Abraham. It relates the story of Pharaoh, a descendant of Ham, who was also a Canaanite by birth. Pharaoh could not have the priesthood because he was \"of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood,\"() and that all Egyptians descended from him (). The Book of Abraham also says the curse came from Noah (). This book was also later canonized as Mormon scripture.\n\nIn 1836, Smith taught that the Curse of Ham came from God, and that it demanded the legalization of slavery. He warned those who tried to interfere with slavery that God could do his own work. While Smith never reversed his opinion on the Curse of Ham, he did start expressing more anti-slavery positions. In 1844, Smith wrote his views as a candidate for president of the United States. The anti-slavery plank of his platform called for a gradual end to slavery by the year 1850. His plan called for the government to buy the freedom of slaves using money from the sale of public lands.\n\nAfter the succession crisis, Brigham Young consistently argued slavery was a \"divine institution,\" even after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued during the Civil War by President Abraham Lincoln. In the year following the Emancipation Proclamation, Young gave several discourses on slavery and characterized himself as neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man. He based his position on the scriptural curses. He also used these curses to justify banning blacks from the priesthood and from holding public office. After Young, leaders did not use the curse of Cain to justify slavery, but this doctrine continued to be taught by President John Taylor and Bruce R. McConkie. While the LDS Church today does not support slavery and disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, it still teaches that Canaan and his descendants were denied the priesthood because of the Curse of Ham and the Curse of Cain.\n\nMost modern scholars believe \"Canaanites\" to refer to people of Semitic origin, not black African. Most Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions also reject the teaching that Canaanites were black Africans.\n\nWhile Mormon scripture taught against slavery, it also taught the importance of upholding the law. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young stated that the Mormons were not abolitionists.\n\nIn the Book of Mormon, slavery was against the law.( & ) The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that \"it is not right that any man should be in bondage to another\" (D&C ), but it is unclear whether it applied to black servitude, since it was never used either for or against black slavery in early discourses on slavery. The official position which was more often cited was the belief that one shouldn't interfere with slaves against the will of their masters, since it would cause unrest.(D&C ) This explanation avoided taking a direct stance on slavery, and instead focused on following current laws. In general, Mormon teachings encouraged obeying, honoring and sustaining the laws of the land.()\n\nIn 1836, Smith wrote piece in the \"Messenger and Advocate\" which supported slavery and affirmed that it was God's will. He said that the Northerners had no right to tell the Southerners whether they could have slaves. He said that if slavery were evil, southern \"men of piety\" would have objected. He expressed concern that freed slaves would overrun the United States and violate chastity and virtue. He pointed to biblical stories of slavery, arguing that the prophets who owned slaves were inspired of God, and knew more than abolitionists. He said that blacks were under the curse of Ham to be servants, and warned those who sought to free blacks were going against the dictates of God. Warren Parrish and Oliver Cowdery made similar arguments. During this time the Mormons were based in the slave state of Missouri.\n\nAfter the move to the free state of Illinois, Smith began expressing more abolitionist ideals. He argued that blacks should be given employment opportunities equal to whites. He believed that given equal chances as whites, blacks would become like whites. In his personal journal, he wrote that the slaves owned by Mormons should be brought \"into a free country and set ... free— Educate them and give them equal rights.\" During Smith's 1844 campaign for president of the United States, he had advocated for the immediate abolition of slavery through compensation from money earned by the sale of public lands.\n\nSmith was killed in 1844, the year of his presidential bid, resulting in a schism among his followers. After the schism, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (later known as the Community of Christ), one of the resulting sects, embraced abolitionist ideals. Its leader following the schism, Joseph Smith III, was friends with Abraham Lincoln and supported the Republican charge to end slavery.\n\nUnder Brigham Young, the LDS Church continued to teach that slavery was ordained of God. After he helped institute slavery in the Utah Territory, Young taught \"inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery\". He argued that blacks needed to serve masters because they were not capable of ruling themselves, When blacks were treated right, Young contended that they were much better off as slaves than if they were free. Because of these benefits, Young argued that slavery brought the \"true liberty\" which God had designed. He taught that because slavery was decreed of God, man was not able to remove it. He criticized the Northerners for their attempts to free the slaves contrary to the will of God and accused them of worshipping blacks. He opposed the American Civil War, calling it useless and saying that the \"for the cause of human improvement is not in the least advanced by the dreadful war which now convulses our unhappy country.\" After President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, Young prophesied that the attempts to free the slave would eventually fail.\n\nSlave owners complained that the Mormons were interfering with slaves, but the LDS Church denied such claims. In 1835, the Church issued an official statement that, because the United States government allowed slavery, the Church would not \"interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men.\" This was later adopted as scripture.(D&C ) This policy was changed in 1836, when Smith wrote that slaves should not be taught the gospel at all until after their masters were converted.\n\nChurch leaders taught that slaves should not be mistreated. In March 1842, Smith began studying some abolitionist literature, and stated, \"it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice, cruelty, and oppression of the rulers of the people. When will these things cease to be, and the Constitution and the laws again bear rule?\" \n\nUnder Brigham Young, the Church also opposed mistreatment of slaves. Young urged moderation, not to treat Africans as beasts of the field, nor to elevate them to equality with the whites, which was against God's will. He criticized the Southerners for their abuse of slaves, and taught that mistreating slaves should be against the law: \"If the Government of the United States, in Congress assembled, had the right to pass an anti-polygamy bill, they had also the right to pass a law that slaves should not be abused as they have been; they had also a right to make a law that negroes should be used like human beings, and not worse than dumb brutes. For their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.\" Later, as Utah sovereignty became a larger political issue, Young changed his stance on the role of the federal government in preventing abuse, arguing \"if we treated our slaves in an oppressive manner, it is none of their business and they ought not to meddle with it.\"\n\nInitially, Church leaders avoided the topic of slavery. Most of the early converts of the church came from the northern United States and tended to be anti-slavery. These attitudes came into conflict with Southerners after they moved to Missouri. In the summer of 1833 W. W. Phelps published an article in the church's newspaper, seeming to invite free black people into the state to become Mormons, and reflecting \"in connection with the wonderful events of this age, much is doing towards abolishing slavery, and colonizing the blacks, in Africa.\" Outrage followed Phelps' comments, and he was forced to reverse his position. He said he was \"misunderstood\" and that free blacks would not be admitted into the Church. His reversal did not end the controversy. Missouri citizens accused Mormons of trying to interfere with their slaves. The Church denied such claims and began to teach against interfering with slaves and more pro-slavery rhetoric. Some slaves owners joined the church during this period. However, this did not end the controversy, and the church was forcibly expelled from Missouri.\n\nBy 1836, the church already had some slave owners and slaves as members. The rules established by the church for governing assemblies in the Kirtland Temple included attendees who were \"bond or free, black or white.\" When abolitionists tried to solicit support from the Mormons, they had little success. Even though Illinois prohibited slavery, members who owned slaves took them along on the migration to Nauvoo. Nauvoo was reported to have 22 black members, including free and slave, between 1839–1843. The state of Illinois did not pass laws to free existing slaves in the region for some time.\n\nOne slave-owning family in Nauvoo was the Flake family. They owned a slave named Green Flake. While building the Nauvoo Temple, families were asked to donate one day in ten to work on the temple. The Flake family used Green's slave labor to fulfill their tithing requirement.\n\nAfter Smith's death in 1844, the church went through a succession crisis, and split into multiple groups. The main body of the church, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young who was significantly more pro-slavery than Smith. Young led the Mormons to Utah and formed a theocratic government, under which slavery was legalized and the Indian slave trade was supported. Young promoted slavery, teaching that blacks had been cursed to be \"servants of servants\" and that Indians needed slavery as part of a process of overcoming a curse placed on their Lamanite ancestors.\n\nWhen church leaders asked for men from the members of Mississippi to help with the westward emigration, they sent four slaves with John Brown who was given the task to \"take charge of them.\" Two of the slaves died, but Green Flake later joined the company, making it a total of three slaves arriving in Utah. More slaves arrived as property of members in later companies. By 1850, 100 blacks had arrived, the majority of whom were slaves. Some slaves escaped during the trek west, including one large contingent that escaped the Redd family during the night in Kansas, but six of the slaves were not able to escape and continued with the family to Utah Territory. When William Dennis stopped in Tabor, Iowa, members of the Underground Railroad helped five of his slaves escape, and despite a manhunt, they were able to reach freedom in Canada.\n\nMormons arrived in Utah in the middle of the Mexican–American War; they ignored the Mexican ban on slavery. Instead, they recognized slavery as custom and consistent with the Mormon view on blacks.\n\nAfter the Compromise of 1850, Congress granted the Utah Territory the right to decide whether it would allow slavery based on popular sovereignty. Many prominent members of the church were slave owners, including Abraham O. Smoot and Charles C. Rich.\n\nThe territory did not pass any laws defining the legality of slavery, and the LDS Church tried to remain neutral. In 1851, apostle Orson Hyde said that because many church members were coming from the South with slaves, that the church's position on the matter needed to be defined. He went on to say that there was no law in Utah prohibiting or authorizing slavery and that the decisions on the topic were to remain between slaves and their masters. He also clarified that individuals' choices on the matter were not in any way a reflection of the church as a whole or its doctrine.\n\nOnce in Utah, Mormons continued to buy and sell slaves as property. Church members used their slaves to perform labor required for tithing, and sometimes donated them to the church as property. Both Young and Heber C. Kimball used the slave labor that had been donated in tithing before granting freedom to the people.\n\nIn 1851, a company of 437 Mormons under direction of Amasa M. Lyman and Charles C. Rich of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles settled at what is now San Bernardino, California. This first company took 26 slaves, and more slaves were brought over as San Bernardino continued to grow. Since California was a free state, the slaves should have been freed when they entered. However, slavery was openly tolerated in San Bernardino. Many slaves wanted to be free, but were still under the control of their masters and ignorant of the laws and their rights. Judge Benjamin Hayes freed 14 slaves who had belonged to Robert Smith. Other slaves were freed by their masters.\n\nMormons also were confronted in Utah with the practice of the Indian slave trade among regional tribes; it was very prevalent in the area. Tribes often took captives from enemies in raids or warfare, and used them as slaves or sold them. As the Mormons began expanding into Indian territory, they often had conflicts with the local residents. After expanding into Utah Valley, Young issued the extermination order against the Timpanogos, resulting in the Battle at Fort Utah. The Mormons took many Timpanogo women and children into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery. After expanding into Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves.\nAt the encouragement of Mormon leaders, their pioneers started participating in the Indian slave trade. Chief Walkara, one of the main slave traders in the region, was baptized in the church. In 1851, Apostle George A. Smith gave Chief Peteetneet and Walkara talking papers that certified \"it is my desire that they should be treated as friends, and as they wish to Trade horses, Buckskins and Piede children, we hope them success and prosperity and good bargains.\"\n\nAs in other regions in the Southwest, the Mormons justified enslaving Indians in order to teach them Christianity and achieve their salvation. Mormon theology teaches that Indians are descendants in part from the Lamanites, an ancient group of people described in the Book of Mormon that had fallen into apostasy and had been cursed. When Young visited the members in Parowan, he encouraged them to \"buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could\". He argued that by doing so, they could educate them and teach them the Gospel, and in a few generations the Lamanites would become \"white and delightsome\", as prophesied in Nephi.\n\nThe Mormons strongly opposed the New Mexican slave trade. Young sought to put an end to the Mexican slave trade. Many of Walkara's band were upset by the interruption with the Mexican slave trade. In one graphic incident, Ute Indian Chief Arrapine, a brother of Walkara, insisted that because the Mormons had stopped the Mexicans from buying certain children, the Mormons were obligated to purchase them. In his book, \"Forty Years Among the Indians\", Daniel Jones wrote, \"[s]everal of us were present when he took one of these children by the heels and dashed its brains out on the hard ground, after which he threw the body towards us, telling us we had no hearts, or we would have bought it and saved its life.\"\n\nOne of the Mexican slave traders, Don Pedro Leon Lujan, was charged with trading with the Indians without a license, including Indian slaves. His property was seized and his slaves distributed to Mormon families in Manti. He sued the government, charging that he received unequal treatment because he wasn't Mormon. The courts sided against him, but noted that Indian slavery had never been officially legalized in Utah.\n\nOn January 5, 1852, Young, who was also Territorial Governor of Utah, addressed the joint session of the Utah Territorial Legislature. He discussed the ongoing trial of Don Pedro Leon Lujan and the importance of explicitly indicating the true policy for slavery in Utah. He explained that although he didn't think people should be treated as property, he felt because Indians were so low and degraded, that transferring them to \"the more favored portions of the human race\", would be a benefit and relief. He said this was superior to drudgery of Mexican slavery, because the Mexicans were \"scarcely superior\" to the Indians. He argued that it is proper for persons thus purchased to owe a debt to the man or woman who saved them, and that it was \"necessary that some law should provide for the suitable regulations under which all such indebtedness should be defrayed\". He argued that this type of service was necessary and honorable to improve the condition of Indians.\n\nHe also supported African slavery and said that \"Inasmuch as we believe in the Bible, inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery.\" He argued that the blacks had the Curse of Ham placed on them which made them servants of servants and that he was not authorized to remove it. He also argued that blacks needed to serve masters because they are not capable of ruling themselves, and that when treated right, blacks were much better off as slaves than if they were free. However, he urged moderation, not to treat Africans as beasts of the field, nor to elevate them to equality with the whites, which he believed was against the will of God. He said that this was the principle of true liberty according to the designs of God. On January 27, Orson Pratt objected to Young's remarks, saying it was not man's duty to enforce Cain's curse, and that slavery had not been authorized by God. Young responded that the Lord had revealed these instructions to him. After this, the Utah legislature passed an Act in Relation to Service, which officially legalized slavery in Utah Territory, and a month later passed an Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners, which specifically dealt with Indian slavery.\n\nThe acts had a few special provisions unique to slavery in Utah, reflecting Mormon beliefs. Masters were required by law to correct and punish their slaves, which particularly worried Republicans in Congress. Black slaves brought into the Territory had to come \"of their own free will and choice\"; and they could not be sold or taken from the Territory against their will. Indian slaves just had to be in possession of a white person, which Republicans in Congress complained was too broad. Indian slavery was limited to twenty years, while black slavery was limited to not be longer \"than will satisfy the debt due his [master].\" Several unique provisions were included which terminated the owner's contract in the event that the master neglected to feed, clothe, shelter, or otherwise abused the slave, or attempted to take them from the Territory against their will. Black slaves, but not Indian slaves, were freed if the master had sexual intercourse with them. Some schooling was also required for slaves, with blacks requiring less schooling than Indians. Despite the unique provisions in Utah, many black slaves received the same treatment as in the South. According to former slave Alexander Bankhead, the slaves were \"far from being happy\" and longed for their freedom.\nMormons continued taking Indian children from their families long after the slave traders left and even began to actively solicit children from Paiute parents. They also began selling Indian slaves to each other. By 1853, each of the hundred households in Parowan had one of more Paiute children. Indian slaves were used for both domestic and manual labor. In 1857, Representative Justin Smith Morrill estimated that there were 400 Indian slaves in Utah. Richard Kitchen has identified at least 400 Indian slaves taken into Mormon homes, but estimates even more went unrecorded because of the high mortality rate of Indian slaves. Many of them tried to escape.\n\nBrigham Young opposed slaves who wanted to escape their masters. This was enforced by Utah laws. When Dan, a slave, tried to escape his master, William Camp, the courts upheld that Dan was Camp's property and could not escape. Dan was later sold to Thomas Williams for $800 and then to William Hooper.\n\nThe Mormon position of slavery was often criticized and condemned by anti-slavery groups. In 1856, the key plank of the Republican Party's platform was \"to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery\". While considering appropriations for Utah Territory, Representative Justin Smith Morrill criticized the LDS Church for its laws on slavery. He said that under the Mormon patriarchy, slavery took a new shape. He criticized the use of the term servants instead of slaves and the requirement for Mormon masters to \"correct and punish\" their \"servants\". He expressed concern that Mormons might be trying to increase the number of slaves in the state. Horace Greeley also criticized the Mormon position on slavery and general apathy towards the welfare of black people.\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out, Utah sided with the North and many Mormon slave owners returned to Southern States because they were worried that they would lose their slaves. On June 19, 1862 Congress prohibited slavery in all US territories, and on January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The slaves of the Mormons were incredibly joyful when the news reached that they were free, and many left Utah for other states, particularly California.\n\nAfter the slaves were freed, Young gave several discourses on slavery. He characterized himself as neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man. He criticized both the South for their abuse of slaves and the North for worshiping of blacks. He opposed the American Civil War, calling it useless and that the \"cause of human improvement is not in the least advanced\" by trying to free the slaves. He predicted the Emancipation Proclamation would fail. \n\nLeaders of the church have had varying opinions on slavery, and many Mormon historians have discussed the issue.\n\nHarris and Bringhurst noted that early Mormons wanted to stay neutral or aloof of slavery as a political issue, probably because of the strong Mormon presence in Missouri, which was then a slave state. In 1833, Joseph Smith stated that \"it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another,\" but most historians agree that this statement referred to debt and other types of economic bondage. In 1835, Joseph Smith wrote that missionaries should not baptize slaves against the will of their masters. According to Harris and Bringhurst, Joseph Smith made these statements to distance the church from abolitionism, and not to align with pro-slavery positions, but it came across as supporting slavery. Church headquarters were in Ohio, where abolitionism and anti-abolitionism were polarized many citizens. After members of the church were expelled from Missouri to Illinois, Smith changed to an antislavery position, which he held until his death in 1844. More new converts were from free states and a handful of black people joined the church, which may have contributed to Smith's change in position.\n\nJohn G. Turner writes that Brigham Young's stance on slavery was contradictory. In 1851 he opposed abolitionism, seeing it as politically radical, yet he did not want to \"lay a foundation\" for slavery. In an 1852 speech, Young was against slavery, but also against equal rights for blacks. Two weeks after the speech, Young pushed to have slavery formally recognized in the Utah territory, stating that he was for slavery, and said that a belief in slavery naturally followed from believing in God's priesthood and decrees. Young mimicked proslavery apologetics when he argued that slaves were better off than European workers and that slavery was mutually beneficial to slave and master. Young feared that abolishing slavery would result in blacks ruling over whites. At the end of 1852, Young commented that he was glad the black population was small. Young was generous with the black servants and slaves in his life, but that did not change their lack of rights. According to Turner, Young's position on slavery is unsurprising given the racial context of the time, as discrimination was common in white American Protestant groups. Turner does note that Young's theological justification for racial discrimination set a discriminatory precedent that his successors believed they ought to perpetuate.\n\nAccording to W. Paul Reeve, Brigham Young was the driving force behind the 1852 legislation to solidify slavery in the Utah territory, and that the common fear of \"interracial mixing\" motivated Young. Reeve also states that Mormons were surprised by the Native American slave trade from the Utes. The slave traders would insist that the Mormons buy slaves, sometimes killing a child to motivate their purchase. The 1852 law tried to change slavery into indentured servitude, requiring Mormons with Native American children to register them with their local judge and provide some education for them; the law did not work well in practice. Reeve explains that while Joseph Smith saw a potential for black equality, Young believed that blacks were inferior to whites by divine design.\n\nJoseph Smith III, son of Joseph Smith, founded the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1860, now known as the Community of Christ. Smith was a vocal advocate of abolishing the slave trade, and followed Owen Lovejoy, an anti-slavery congressman from Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln. He joined the Republican party and advocated for their antislavery politics. He rejected the fugitive slave law, and openly stated that he would assist slaves trying to escape. While he was a strong opponent of slavery, he still viewed whites as superior to blacks, and held that they must not \"sacrifice the dignity, honor and prestige that may be rightfully attached to the ruling races.\"\n\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) broke from the LDS Church in the early 20th century. Although it emerged well after slavery was made illegal in the United States, there have been several accusations of slavery. On April 20, 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor assessed fines totaling $1.96 million against a group of FLDS Church members, including Lyle Jeffs, a brother of the church's controversial leader, Warren Jeffs, for alleged child slave labor violations during the church's 2012 pecan harvest at an orchard near Hurricane, Utah. The church has been suspected of trafficking underage women across state lines, as well as across the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders, for the purpose of sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual slavery. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: \"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\" According to the \"Vancouver Sun,\" it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute may not be able to be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change.\n\n"}
{"id": "774824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774824", "title": "Mot (god)", "text": "Mot (god)\n\nMot ( \"mōwet\", \"māweṯ\", \"mawt\") was the ancient Canaanite god of death and the Underworld. He was worshipped by the people of Ugarit, by the Phoenicians, and also by the Hebrews of the Old Testament. The main source of information about his role in Canaanite mythology comes from the texts discovered at Ugarit, but he is also mentioned in the surviving fragments of Philo of Byblos's Greek translation of the writings of the Phoenician Sanchuniathon and also in various books of the Old Testament.\n\nIn Ugaritic myth, Mot (spelled \"mt\") is a personification of death. The word is cognate with forms meaning 'death' in other Semitic and Afro-Asiatic languages: with Arabic موت \"mawt\"; with Hebrew מות (\"mot\" or \"mavet\"; ancient Hebrew \"muth\" or \"maveth\"/\"maweth\"); with Maltese \"mewt\"; with Syriac \"mautā\"; with Ge'ez \"mot\"; with Canaanite, Egyptian, Berber, Aramaic, Nabataean, and Palmyrene מות (\"mwt\"); with Jewish Aramaic, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, and Samaritan מותא (\"mwt’\"); with Mandaean \"muta\"; with Akkadian \"mūtu\"; with Hausa \"mutuwa\"; and with Angas \"mut\".\n\nThe main source of the story of Mot 'Death' is Ugaritic. He is a son of 'El, and according to instructions given by the god Hadad (Ba'al) to his messengers, lives in a city named \"hmry\" ('Mirey'), a pit is his throne, and Filth is the land of her heritage. But Ba'al warns them:\n\n<poem>that you not come near to divine Death,\nlest he made you like a lamb in his mouth,\n(and) you both be carried away like a kid in the breach of his windpipe.</poem>\n\nHadad seems to be urging that Mot come to his feast and submit himself to Hadad.\n\nDeath sends back a message that his appetite is that of lions in the wilderness, like the longing of dolphins in the sea and he threatens to devour Ba'al himself. In a subsequent passage Death seemingly makes good his threat, or at least is deceived into believing he has slain Ba'al. Numerous gaps in the text make this portion of the tale obscure. The sun stops shining as its goddess Shapash joins Ba'al's sister 'Anat in burying him. 'Anat then comes upon Mot, seizing him, splitting him with a blade, winnowing him in a sieve, burning him in a fire, grinding him under a millstone, and throwing what remains in the end over a field for birds to devour.\n\nEl, Baal's father, dreams that Baal is alive, and sends Shapash to bring him back to life because the land had become dry.\n\nAfter seven years, Death returns, seeking vengeance and demanding one of Ba'al's brothers to feed upon. A gap in the text is followed by Mot complaining that Ba'al has given Mot his own brothers to eat, the sons of his mother to consume. A single combat between the two breaks out until the sun goddess Shapash upbraids Mot, informing him that his own father El will turn against him and overturn his throne if he continues. Mot concedes and the conflict ends.\n\nThe Jewish tradition of Passover may have began as a ritual connected with the myth of Mot killing Baal. Passover is held at the end of the rainy season, which could symbolize the death of Baal, as he was the god of rain. In the myth, Mot eats Baal like a lamb. During Passover, the priests eat lamb. However, the bones of the lamb are not broken, possibly signifying that Baal will return in the fall. During the festival, the priests prepare the body of the lamb in a similar fashion as Anat kills Mot. The festival may have started with the belief that by participating in the death of Baal, they would insure that rains would not come during the spring, as rain in the spring could ruin the crops.\n\nA Phoenician account survives in a paraphrase of the Greek author Philo of Byblos by Eusebius, who writes of a Phoenician historian named Sanchuniathon. In this account Death is a son of 'El and counted as a god, as the text says in speaking of 'El/Cronus:\n\n... and not long afterwards he consecrated after his death another of his sons, called Muth, whom he had by Rhea; this (Muth) the Phoenicians esteem the same as Thanatos ['Death'] and Pluto.\n\nBut earlier in a philosophical creation myth Sanchuniathon has referred to great wind which merged with its parents and that connection was called Eros 'Desire':\n\nFrom its connection Mot was produced, which some say is mud, and others a putrescence of watery compound; and out of this came every germ of creation, and the generation of the universe. So there were certain animals which had no sensation, and out of them grew intelligent animals, and were called \"Zophasemin\", that is \"observers of heaven\"; and they were formed like the shape of an egg. Also Mot burst forth into light, and sun, and moon, and stars, and the great constellations.\n\nThe language here is confusing, a bad summary and possibly corrupt, and the form \"Mot\" here is not the same as \"Muth\" which appears later. But it may be that the full and coherent account would have made clear that muddy and putrescent Death is the source of life.\n\nIn Hebrew scriptures, Death (\"\"Maweth\"/\"Mavet(h)\"\") is sometimes personified as a devil or angel of death (e.g., ; ). In both the Book of Hosea and the Book of Jeremiah, Maweth/Mot is mentioned as a deity to whom Yahweh can turn over Judah as punishment for worshiping other gods.\n\n\n"}

While associated with the political left in his early career, he is now a conservative popular historian.\n\nJohnson was educated at the Jesuit independent school Stonyhurst College, and at Magdalen College, Oxford. He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a journalist writing for and later editing the \"New Statesman\" magazine. A prolific writer, Johnson has written over 40 books and contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers. His sons include the journalist Daniel Johnson, founder of \"Standpoint\", and the businessman Luke Johnson, former chairman of Channel 4.\n\nJohnson was born in Manchester. His father, William Aloysius Johnson, was an artist and Principal of the Art School in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. At Stonyhurst, Johnson received an education grounded in the Jesuit method, which he preferred over the more secularized curriculum of Oxford. Whilst at Oxford, Johnson was tutored by the historian A. J. P. Taylor and was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society.\n\nAfter graduating with a second-class honours degree, Johnson performed his national service in the Army, joining the King's Royal Rifle Corps and then the Royal Army Educational Corps, where he was commissioned as a Captain (acting) based mainly in Gibraltar. Here he saw the \"grim misery and cruelty of the Franco regime\". Johnson's military record helped the Paris periodical \"Realités\" hire him, where he was assistant editor from 1952 to 1955.\n\nJohnson adopted a left-wing political outlook during this period as he witnessed, in May 1952, the police response to a riot in Paris, the \"ferocity [of which] I would not have believed had I not seen it with my own eyes.\" (Communists were rioting over the visit of American general, Matthew Ridgeway, who commanded the US Eighth Army during the Korean War; he had just been appointed Supreme Commander in Europe, and the Communists perceived him as anti-Communist.). Then he served as the \"New Statesman\"s Paris correspondent. For a time, he was a convinced Bevanite and an associate of Aneurin Bevan himself. Moving back to London in 1955, Johnson joined the \"Statesman\"s staff.\n\nSome of Johnson's writing already showed signs of iconoclasm. His first book, about the Suez War, appeared in 1957. An anonymous commentator in \"The Spectator\" wrote that \"one of his [Johnson's] remarks about Mr Gaitskell is quite as damaging as anything he has to say about Sir Anthony Eden\", but the Labour Party's opposition to the Suez intervention led Johnson to assert \"the old militant spirit of the party was back\". The following year, he attacked Ian Fleming's James Bond novel \"Dr No\" and in 1964 he warned of \"The Menace of Beatlism\" in an article contemporarily described as being \"rather exaggerated\" by Henry Fairlie in \"The Spectator\".\n\nHe was successively lead writer, deputy editor and editor of the \"New Statesman\" magazine from 1965 to 1970. He was found suspect for his attendances at the soirées of Lady Antonia Fraser, then married to a Conservative MP. There was some resistance to his appointment as \"New Statesman\" editor, not least from the writer Leonard Woolf, who objected to a Catholic filling the position, and Johnson was placed on six months' probation.\n\n\"Statesmen And Nations\" (1971), the anthology of his \"Statesman\" articles, contains numerous reviews of biographies of Conservative politicians and an openness to continental Europe; in one article Johnson took a positive view of events of May 1968 in Paris, an article which at the time of first publication led Colin Welch in \"The Spectator\" to accuse Johnson of possessing \"a taste for violence\". According to this book, Johnson filed 54 overseas reports during his \"Statesman\" years.\n\nIn the 1970s, Johnson became increasingly conservative in his outlook and has largely remained so. In his \"Enemies of Society\" (1977), following a series of articles in the British press, he opposed the trade union movement, perceiving it as violent and intolerant, terming trade unionists \"fascists\". As Britain’s economy faltered, Johnson began to advocate the future British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s message of less government and less taxation. He was eventually won over to the Right and became one of Thatcher's closest advisers: \"In the 1970s Britain was on its knees. The Left had no answers. I became disgusted by the over-powerful trade unions which were destroying Britain,\" he recalled in 2004.\n\nAfter Thatcher's victory in the general election of 1979 Johnson advised on changes to legislation concerning trade unions and was also one of Thatcher's speechwriters. Johnson was quoted in 2004:\n\"I was instantly drawn to her,\" he recalls. \"I'd known Margaret at Oxford. She was not a party person. She was an individual who made up her own mind. People would say that she was much influenced by Karl Popper or Frederick Hayek. The result was that Thatcher followed three guiding principles: truthfulness, honesty and never borrowing money.\"\n\nFrom 1981 to 2009, Johnson wrote a column for \"The Spectator\"; initially focusing on media developments, it subsequently acquired the title \"And Another Thing\". In his journalism, Johnson generally deals with issues and events which he sees as indicative of a general social decline, whether in art, education, religious observance or personal conduct. He has continued to contribute to the magazine, less frequently than before. During the same period he contributed a column to the \"Daily Mail\" until 2001. In a \"Daily Telegraph\" interview in November 2003, he criticised the \"Mail\" for having a pernicious impact: \"I came to the conclusion that that kind of journalism is bad for the country, bad for society, bad for the newspaper\".\n\nJohnson is a regular contributor to \"The Daily Telegraph,\" mainly as a book reviewer, and in the United States to \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Commentary\" and the \"National Review\". He also writes for \"Forbes\" magazine. For a time in the early 1980s he wrote for \"The Sun\" after Rupert Murdoch urged him to \"raise its tone a bit\".\n\nJohnson is a critic of modernity because of what he sees as its moral relativism, and finds objectionable those who use Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to justify their atheism or use it to promote biotechnological experimentation. As a result, Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker have been a target of Johnson's criticism. As a conservative Catholic, Johnson regards liberation theology as a heresy and defends clerical celibacy, but departs from others in seeing many good reasons for ordination of women as priests.\n\nAdmired by conservatives in the United States and elsewhere, he is strongly anticommunist. Johnson has defended Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, finding his cover-up considerably less heinous than Bill Clinton's perjury and Oliver North's involvement in the Iran-Contra Affair. In his \"Spectator\" column, Johnson defended his friend Jonathan Aitken, has expressed admiration for General Augusto Pinochet and (qualified) admiration for General Franco.\n\nJohnson was active in the campaign, led by Norman Lamont, to prevent Pinochet's extradition to Spain after Pinochet's arrest in London. \"There have been countless attempts to link him to human rights atrocities, but nobody has provided a single scrap of evidence,\" Johnson was reported as saying in 1999. In \"Heroes\" (2008), Johnson returned to his longstanding claim that criticism of Pinochet's regime on human rights grounds came from \"the Soviet Union, whose propaganda machine successfully demonised [Pinochet] among the chattering classes all over the world. It was the last triumph of the KGB before it vanished into history's dustbin\".\n\nHe has described France as \"a republic run by bureaucratic and party elites, whose errors are dealt with by strikes, street riots and blockades\" rather than a democracy.\n\nHe served on the Royal Commission on the Press (1974–77) and was a member of the Cable Authority (regulator) from 1984 to 1990.\n\nPaul Johnson has been married to the psychotherapist and former Labour Party parliamentary candidate Marigold Hunt, daughter of Dr. Thomas Hunt, physician to Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, since 1958. They have three sons and a daughter: the journalist Daniel Johnson, a freelance writer, editor of \"Standpoint\" magazine, and previously associate editor of \"The Daily Telegraph,\" who is married to the writer and birth educator Sarah Johnson née Thompson; Luke Johnson, businessman and former chairman of Channel 4 Television; Sophie Johnson, who has worked in television drama; and Cosmo Johnson. Paul and Marigold Johnson have ten grandchildren. Marigold Johnson's sister, Sarah, an art historian, married the journalist, former diplomat and politician George Walden; their daughter, novelist Celia Walden, is the wife of television presenter and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan.\n\nIn 1998 it was revealed Johnson had an affair lasting eleven years with the writer Gloria Stewart. Stewart went public with the affair to the newspapers after what she saw as Johnson’s hypocrisy over his views on morality, religion and family values.\n\nJohnson is a friend of British playwright Tom Stoppard, who dedicated his 1978 play \"Night and Day\" to him.\n\nJohnson is a watercolourist, painting mainly landscapes, who has exhibited regularly.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson was honoured with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President George W. Bush. On the BBC programme \"Desert Island Discs\" in January 2012, Johnson professed himself unimpressed by Nelson Mandela.\n\nJohnson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to literature.\n\nJohnson's books are listed by subject or type. The country of publication is the UK, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22088297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22088297", "title": "Pseudo-Kufic", "text": "Pseudo-Kufic\n\nPseudo-Kufic, or Kufesque, also sometimes Pseudo-Arabic, is a style of decoration used during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, consisting of imitations of the Arabic Kufic script, or sometimes Arabic cursive script, made in a non-Arabic context: \"Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration\". Pseudo-Kufic appears especially often in Renaissance art in depictions of people from the Holy Land, particularly the Virgin Mary. It is an example of Islamic influences on Western art.\n\nSome of the first imitations of the Kufic script go back to the 8th century when the English King Offa (r. 757–796) produced gold coins imitating Islamic dinars. These coins were copies of an Abbasid dinar struck in 774 by Caliph Al-Mansur, with \"Offa Rex\" centred on the reverse. It is clear that the moneyer had no understanding of Arabic as the Arabic text contains many errors. The coin may have been produced in order to trade with Islamic Spain; or it may be part of the annual payment of 365 mancuses that Offa promised to Rome.\n\nIn Medieval southern Italy (in merchant cities such as Amalfi and Salerno) from the mid-10th century, imitations of Arabic coins, called tarì, were widespread but only used illegible pseudo-Kufic script.\n\nExamples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script and Islamic-inspired colourful diamond-shaped designs such as a 13th French Limoges enamel ciborium at the British Museum. The band in pseudo-Kufic script \"was a recurrent ornamental feature in Limoges and had long been adopted in Aquitaine\".\n\n \nNumerous instances of pseudo-Kufic are known from European art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic inscriptions were often used as decorative bands in the architecture of Byzantine Greece from the mid 11th century to mid-12th century, and in decorative bands around religious scenes in French and German wall paintings from the mid-12th to mid-13th century, as well as in contemporary manuscript illuminations. Pseudo-Kufic would also be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious halos or frames. Many are visible in the paintings of Giotto (c. 1267 – 1337).\n\nFrom 1300 to 1600, according to Rosamond Mack, the Italian imitations of Arabic script tend to rely on cursive Arabic rather than Kufic, and therefore should better be designated by the more generalist term of \"Pseudo-Arabic\". The habit of representing gilt halos decorated with pseudo-Kufic script seems to have disappeared in 1350, but was revived around 1420 with the work of painters such as Gentile da Fabriano, who was probably responding to artistic influence in Florence, or Masaccio, who was influenced by Gentile, although his own script was \"jagged and clumsy\", as well as Giovanni Toscani or Fra Angelico, in a more Gothic style.\n\nFrom around 1450, northern Italian artists also started to incorporate pseudo-Islamic decorative devices in their paintings. Francesco Squarcione started the trend in 1455, and he was soon followed by his main pupil, Andrea Mantegna. In the 1456–1459 San Zeno Altarpiece, Mantegna combines pseudo-Islamic script in halos and garment hems (), to depiction of Mamluk book-bindings in the hand of San Zeno (), and even to a Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary ().\n\nThe exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic or pseudo-Arabic in Medieval or early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13-14th century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during Jesus's time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them: \"In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of Old Testament heroes like David\". Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.\n\nPseudo-Hebrew is also sometimes seen, as in the mosaic at the back of the abse in Marco Marziale's \"Circumcision\", which does not use actual Hebrew characters. It was especially common in German works.\n\nFinally pseudo-Arabic elements became rare after the second decade of the 16th century. According to Rosamond Mack: \"The Eastern scripts, garments, and halos disappeared when the Italians viewed the Early Christian era in an antique Roman context.\"\n\n\n"}

Total 142 Baithaks are considered sacred; 84 of Vallabhacharya, 28 of his son Viththalanath Gusainji and 30 of his seven grandsons.\n\nVallabhacharya Mahaprabhu was the founder of Pushtimarg who lived in 15th century. From the young age, he travelled and visited pilgrimage sites across India. He recited and gave discourses on sacred scriptures like Vedas, Ramayana and Bhagavata at these sites. The locations for recitation were usually banks of the rivers or lakes and quite groves in outskirt of towns. He recited original texts from scriptures as well as gave commentaries on them. Later these commentaries were compiled in \"Anubhashya\" and \"Subodhini\".\n\nThese are 84 sites where Vallabhacharya gave discourses which are known as Baithaks.

The secularism principle was removed from the constitution in 1977 by Ziaur Rahman, replaced with a statement of \"absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah\", and Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court restored secularism as one of the basic tenets of the constitution but Islam remained the state religion. Over 90% of Bangladeshis are Muslims, the rest being Hindus 8%, Buddhists 1%, Christians 0.9%, and others 0.1%. People in Bangladesh observe various secular festivals at different times throughout the year. The ethos of secularism in South Asia is in many ways different from that of Western versions that assert complete separation of church and state. Rather, it is the freedom of individuals to practice the faith he or she desires without being subject to any form of state or communal discrimination.\n\nSecularism is one of the four fundamental principles that had been induced into the original Constitution of Bangladesh in 1972. The secularism principle was removed from the constitution in 1977 by the 5th amendment of the constitution by Ziaur Rahman and also declared Islam as the state religion in 1988 by Muhammad Ershad. In 2010, Bangladesh Supreme Court declared the 5th amendment illegal and restored secularism as one of the basic tenets of the Constitution\n\nAt present The Constitution of Bangladesh declares Secularism as one of the four fundamental principle of the state policy in Article-8 of Part-II and also declares Islam as the state religion in Article-2A of Part-I. In Article 12 of Part -II of the constitution which was restored by the 15th amendment states –\n\n\"The principle of secularism shall be realised by the elimination of -\"\n\nThe removal of secularism from the constitution has been described by the country's largely secular establishment as a betrayal of Bengali nationalism and also opposed to mainstream Bengali culture and society, both of which are seen as remarkably pluralist and progressive. However, the Bangladesh Army with its close ideological association of centre-right and conservative political parties led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, have stated that the term Bangladeshi nationalism refers to the country as an Islamic nation given that 89% of the population is Muslim.\n\nIn 2008, the newly elected Awami League government announced that it would re-introduce the original Four State Principles into the Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh. Although recognised by the United Nations as a \"moderate Muslim democracy\", Bangladesh's foreign minister Dipu Moni stated that the country is, in her words, \"a secular, not moderate Muslim, country\".\n\nDespite the country ceasing to be a secular state constitutionally once, secularism came back in 2010 and has been practised in the region of Bengal since ancient times. Ancient and medieval rulers, especially the Pala Empire and Nawabs of Bengal practised secularism in making decisions of the court. Hindus and Muslims would have prominent leaders from each community assisting the rulers. When the British East India Company came in the 18th century, it instituted separate laws for Hindus, Muslims and Christians. In doing so they laid the foundation for a civil code which remains largely unchanged to date.\n\nHowever, the British had perpetuated division amongst Bengali communities on the basis of divide and rule. Bengali Hindus were seen as affluent, educated and were accepted in civil services. On the other hand, Bengali Muslims, especially those in East Bengal were highly discriminated. Most East Bengali Muslims were peasants and were persecuted by Hindu zamindars supported by the British Raj. This had led to several religious movements across East Bengal such as the Faraizi movement aimed at resisting the British and the Hindu zamindars class.\nIn 1905, Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah, the Nawab of Dhaka, proposed the partition of Bengal on communal lines to establish a separate province for the suppressed majority of the region who live in East Bengal and were mostly Muslim. The British accepted the partition and a new province by the name of Eastern Bengal and Assam was created. However the partition was annulled in 1911 due to resistance from the Swadeshi movement in West Bengal that demanded the unification of Bengal.\nIn 1947, Bengal would again be partitioned on communal lines with East Bengal (present day Bangladesh) joining Pakistan and West Bengal being part of India though Hindu majority district of Khulna was awarded to Pakistan and Muslim majority districts of Malda and Murshidabad were awarded to West Bengal. Ethnic cleansing of Hindus forced many Hindus to migrate to India notably on the backdrop of 1950 East Pakistan riots and 1964 East Pakistan riots. After the establishment of Pakistan, Bengalis faced immense discrimination and economic suffering. The Bengali nationalist movement quickly geared momentum with the increasing cultural and linguistic nationalism that were inherently secular. The Bangladesh Liberation War would see Bengalis, irrespective of religion join the fight for their freedom.\n\nAfter achieving victory, Bangladesh's constitution, drafted in 1972, stated Four State Principles as the character of the new state. They would be Nationalism, Democracy, Secularism and Socialism. In 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's founding father was assassinated by junior officers in the military and martial law was declared. Mostaq Ahmed would eventually be removed by counter coups in the volatile situation and army chief and liberation war hero Lt. Gen Ziaur Rahman (known as Zia) would take over as president.\n\nAfter Zia assumed the presidency, he allied himself with his one-time enemies during the liberation war, including anti-liberation leaders such as Shah Azizur Rahman, Sabur Khan and Kazi Abdul Kader. The decision to ally with anti-liberation leaders was seen as necessary political strategy to counter the Awami League of the assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Although Zia was popular for bringing stability after the volatility after 1975, he began using religion as a major factor in politics. He formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party that professed the more Islamic \"Bangladeshi nationalism\" to replace the secular Bengali nationalism. The Bangladesh parliament in 1977 amended the constitution by changing the Four State Principles. The amendment caused the term \"secularism\" in the Permeable to be replaced with \"Absolutue trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions\", and removed references to freedom of religion.\nFinally in 1988, the country's second military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad declared Islam as the state religion in Bangladesh. This would be the final blow to constitutional secularism in the country. Supporters of the BNP and the military would engage in various anti minority activities particularly against the Hindu and tribal communities of the country, most notably the anti-Hindu pogroms of 1988, 1990, 1992 and 2013 which caused widespread damage and devastation across the country. \nHowever, after the return to democracy in 1991, there have been growing calls by the country's \"pro liberation forces\", the largely secular civil society and freedom fighters, as well as from the young generation to re introduce secularism back into the constitution. In 2009, the Awami League government announced that it would amend the constitution and reintroduce the original Four State Principles.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment of the constitution was declared illegal by the High Court of Bangladesh in 2005, the government restored a constitution \"in the spirit of the constitution of 1972\" which also included secularism as one of the state principles. Nevertheless, the opening words 'bismillah-ar-rahman-ar rahim' (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful), that were added in 1997, remained in the constitution. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh upheld the 2005 High Court ruling that the Fifth Amendment to the constitution was illegal. The prime minister Sheik Hasina stated that she favours allowing religion-based political parties.\n\nAfter the Eighth Amendment of the constitution on 7 June 1988, 15 personalities had filed a public interest litigation challenging the provision of state religion. On 1 August 2015, a Supreme Court lawyer named Samendra Nath Goswami filed another petition with the High Court challenging the legality of the constitutional provision of Islam as the state religion despite revival of \"secularism\" as a fundamental state policy under a 2011 amendment to the Constitution. On 28 March 2016, the high court rejected the petition and retained Islam as the state religion.\n\n"}
{"id": "287066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287066", "title": "Stupa", "text": "Stupa\n\nA stupa (Sanskrit: \"heap\") is a mound-like or hemispherical structure containing relics (such as \"śarīra\" – typically the remains of Buddhist monks or nuns) that is used as a place of meditation. A related architectural term is a chaitya, which is a prayer hall or temple containing a stupa.\n\nIn Buddhism, circumambulation or \"pradakhshina\" has been an important ritual and devotional practice since the earliest times, and stupas always have a pradakhshina path around them.\n\nStupas may have originated as pre-Buddhist tumuli in which śramaṇas were buried in a seated position called chaitya. \n\nSome authors have suggested that stupas were derived from a wider cultural tradition from the Mediterranean to the Indus valley, and can be related to the conical mounds on circular bases from the 8th century BCE that can be found in Phrygia (tomb of Midas, 8th c. BCE), Lydia (such as the tomb of Alyattes, 6th c. BCE), or in Phoenicia (tombs of Amrit, 5th c. BCE).\n\nReligious buildings in the form of the Buddhist stupa, a dome shaped monument, started to be used in India as commemorative monuments associated with storing sacred relics of the Buddha. After the parinirvana of the Buddha, his remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight mounds with two further mounds encasing the urn and the embers. The relics of the Buddha were spread between eight stupas, in Rajagriha, Vaishali, Kapilavastu, Allakappa, Ramagrama, Pava, Kushinagar, and Vethapida. The Piprahwa stupa also seems to have been one of the first to be built.\n\nGuard rails —consisting of posts, crossbars, and a coping— became a feature of safety surrounding a stupa. The Buddha had left instructions about how to pay hommage to the stupas: \"And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart, will reap benefits for a long time\". This practice would lead to the decoration of the stupas with stone sculptures of flower garlands in the Classical period.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, Emperor Ashoka (rule: 273—232 BCE) recovered the relics of the Buddha from the earlier stupas (except from the Ramagrama stupa), and erected 84.000 stupas to distribute the relics across India. In effect, many stupas are thought to date originally from the time of Ashoka, such as Sanchi or Kesariya, where he also erected pillars with his inscriptions, and possibly Bharhut, Amaravati or Dharmarajika in Gandhara. Ashoka also established the Pillars of Ashoka throughout his realm, generally next to Buddhist stupas.\n\nThe first known appearance of the word \"Stupa\" is from by Ashoka on the Nigali Sagar pillar (spelled in Pali in the Brahmi script as 𑀣𑀼𑀩𑁂 \"Thube\" ).\n\nStupas were soon to be richly decorated with sculptural reliefs, following the first attempts at Sanchi Stupa No.2 (125 BCE). Full-fledged sculptural decorations and scenes of the life of the Buddha would soon follow at Bharhut (115 BCE), Bodh Gaya (60 BCE), Mathura (125-60 BCE), again at Sanchi for the elevation of the toranas (1st century BCE/CE) and then Amaravati (1st-2nd century CE). The decorative embellishment of stupas also had a considerable development in the northwest in the area of Gandhara, with decorated stupas such as the Butkara Stupa (\"monumentalized\" with Hellenistic decorative elements from the 2nd century BCE) or the Loriyan Tangai stupas (2nd century CE). \n\nThe stupa underwent major evolutions in the area of Gandhara. Since Buddhism spread to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan through Gandhara, the stylistic evolution of the Gandharan stupa was very influential in the later development of the stupa (and related artistic or architectural forms) in these areas. The Gandhara stupa followed several steps, generally moving towards more and more elevation and addition of decorative element, leading eventually to the development of the pagoda tower. The main stupa type are, in choronological order:\n\n1) The Dharmarajika Stupa with a near-Indian design of a semi-hemispheric stupa almost directly on the ground surface, probably dated to the 3rd century BCE. Similar stupas are the Butkara stupa, the Manikyala stupa or the Chakpat stupa.<br>\n2) The Saidu Sharif Stupa, pillared and quincunxial, with a flight of stairs to a dome elevated on a square platform. Many Gandhara minutiures represent this spectacular type (1st century CE).<br>\n3) The Loriyan Tangai Stupa, with a elongated shape and many narrative reliefs, in many way the Classical Gandharan stupa (2nd century CE).<br>\n4) The near-pyramidal Jaulian stupa (2nd century CE).<br>\n5) The cruciform type, as in the Bhamala Stupa, with flights of stairs in the four cardinal directions (4th century CE).<br>\n6) The towering design of the second Kanishka stupa (4-5th century CE).\n\nIt is thought that the temple in the shape of a truncated pyramid may have derived from the design of the stepped stupas which developed in Gandhara. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is one such example, formed of a succession of steps with niches containing Buddha images, alternating with Greco-Roman pillars. The structure is crowned by the shape of an hemispherical stupa topped by finials, forming a logical elongation of the stepped Gandharan stupas such as those seen in Jaulian.\n\nAlthough the current structure of the Mahabdhodi Temple dates to the Gupta period (5th century CE), the \"Plaque of Mahabhodi Temple\", discovered in Kumrahar and dated to 150-200 CE based on its dated Kharoshthi inscriptions and combined finds of Huvishka coins, suggests that the pyramidal structure already existed in the 2nd century CE. This is confirmed by archaeological excavations in Bodh Gaya.\n\nThis truncated pyramid design also marked the evolution from the aniconic stupa dedicated to the cult of relics, to the iconic temple with multiple images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. This design was very influential in the development of later Hindu temples.\n\nStupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it became prominent as a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. The Indian gateway arches, the \"torana\", reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism. Some scholars hold that \"torii\" derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of Sanchi (3rd century BCE – 11th century CE). In Tibet, the stupa became the chörten. and the pagoda in East Asia. The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or Southeast Asia while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be secular in purpose.\n\nStupas were built in Sri Lanka soon after Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the Thuparamaya. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the Jetavanaramaya in Anuradhapura, being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\nThe Asian words for pagoda (\"tā\"in Chinese, \"t'ap\" in Korean, \"tháp\" in Vietnamese, \"tō\" in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the Pali word for stupa, thupa, the Sanskrit pronunciation being \"stupa\". In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second Kanishka stupa (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in Turkestan and the Chinese pagodas such as Songyue Pagoda (523 CE).\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE. In India, Sanchi, Sarnath, Amaravati and Bharhut are among the oldest known stupas. The tallest is the Jetavanaramaya Stupa located in the ancient city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka with a height of 400 ft The Swat Valley hosts a well-preserved stupa at Shingardar near Ghalegay; another stupa is located near Barikot and Dharmarajika-Taxila in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, the ancient city of Anuradhapura includes some of the tallest, most ancient and best preserved stupas in the world, such as Ruwanwelisaya.\n\nThe most elaborate stupa is the 8th century Borobudur monument in Java, Indonesia. The upper rounded terrace with rows of bell-shaped stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing Arūpajhāna, the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of Gautama Buddha. Borobudur's unique and significant architecture has been acknowledged by UNESCO as the largest Buddhist monument in the world. It is also the world’s largest Buddhist temple. as well as one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.\n\nA Jain stupa was excavated at Mathura in the 19th century.\n\nThe Shwedagon in Yangon, Myanmar is one of the largest and most holy stupas.\n\nThe Benalmádena Stupa is the largest stupa in Europe. It is high and was inaugurated on 5 October 2003, the final project of Buddhist master Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche. Rinpoche built his first stupa at Karma Guen near Malaga in 1994, a symbol of peace and prosperity for Spain. Rinpoche went on to build 16 more stupas in Europe before his death in 2003. \n\nA stupa was built on the ground of the Kalachakra Kalapa Centre in southwest Styria, Austria, between 2000 and 2002.\n\nA stupa based on the bell shaped stupas at Boropodur, Central Java, is located at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery near Hemel Hempstead in the United Kingdom. \n\nBuilt for a variety of reasons, Buddhist stupas are classified based on form and function into five types:\n\n\"The shape of the stupa represents the Buddha, crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion throne. His crown is the top of the spire; his head is the square at the spire's base; his body is the vase shape; his legs are the four steps of the lower terrace; and the base is his throne.\"\n\nAlthough not described in any Tibetan text on stupa symbolism, the stupa may represent the five purified elements:\n\n\nTo build a stupa, Dharma transmission and ceremonies known to a Buddhist teacher are necessary. The type of stupa to be constructed in a certain area is decided together with the teacher assisting in the construction. Sometimes the type is chosen directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.\n\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called \"tsatsa\"s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas. One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the Kalachakra stupa in southern Spain contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.\n\nJewellery and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price. It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.\n\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa. It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.\n\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive karmic imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled. On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach enlightenment, the goal of Buddhism.\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing. Such an action is said to create massive negative karmic imprints, leading to serious future problems. It is said this action leaves the mind in a state of paranoia after death has occurred, leading to totally unfortunate rebirths.\n\nStupas in Tibet and Bhutan are usually called chorten in English, reflecting the term in the Tibetan language. There are eight different kinds of stupas in Tibetan Buddhism, each referring to major events in the Buddha's life.\n\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of Gautama Buddha. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\" (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the brahmavihāras: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.\n\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of Mara\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old Buddha's attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.\n\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near Sarnath. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the Four Noble Truths, the Six Pāramitās, the Noble Eightfold Path and the Twelve Nidānas.\n\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the Tuṣita Heaven where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in Sankassa in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.\n\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the Tirthikas\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered \"maras\" and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the Lichavi kingdom to commemorate the event.\n\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the sangha. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of Magadha, where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.\n\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.\n\nThis stupa refers to the death of the Buddha when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the Kalachakra stupa. Its symbolism is not connected to events in the Buddha's life, but instead to the symbolism of the Kalachakra Tantra, created to protect against negative energies.\n\nSwat District is a small place with a large number of ancient stupas. The largest stupa of the Indian subcontinent is in Shingardar.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1606407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1606407", "title": "Sugawara no Michizane", "text": "Sugawara no Michizane\n\n, also known as or , was a scholar, poet, and politician of the Heian Period of Japan. He is regarded as an excellent poet, particularly in Kanshi poetry, and is today revered in Shinto as the god of learning, .\n\nHe was born into a family of scholars, who bore the hereditary title of which predated the Ritsuryō System and its ranking of members of the Court. His grandfather, Sugawara no Kiyotomo, served the court, teaching history in the national school for future bureaucrats and even attained the third rank. His father, Sugawara no Koreyoshi, began a private school in his mansion and taught students who prepared for the entrance examination to the national school or who had ambitions to be officers of the court, including his own son Michizane.\n\nMichizane passed the entrance examination, and entered Daigaku, as the national academy was called at the time. After graduation he began his career in the court as a scholar as a relatively prestigious senior sixth rank upper in 870. His rank coincided with his role initially as a minor official in the Court bureaucracy under the Ministry of Civil Affairs. By 874 Michizane had reached the fifth rank (his father the fourth rank), and served briefly under the Ministry of War before being transferred to a more desirable role in the Ministry of Popular Affairs. His training and skill with Classical Chinese language and literature afforded him many opportunities to draft edicts and correspondences for officials in the Court in addition to his menial duties. Records show at this time he composed three petitions for Fujiwara no Yoshifusa as well as the Emperor. Michizane also took part in receiving delegations from the Kingdom of Parhae, where Michizane's skill with Chinese again proved useful in diplomatic exchanges and poetry exchange. In 877, he was assigned to the Ministry of the Ceremonial, which allowed him to manage educational and intellectual matters more than before.\n\nIn addition to his offices at the court he ran the school his father founded, the . In 877, he was also promoted to professor of literature at the academy, Later, he was also appointed the highest professorial office at Daigaku. This office was considered to be the highest honor a historian could achieve.\n\nIn 886, Sugawara was appointed to be governor of Sanuki Province. Modern research shows that many bureaucrats in the Court, if they lacked sufficient clout, were assigned at least one term in a remote province, and Michizane was no exception. During his four-year tenure in the province, Michizane's informal poetry increased, and up to 26% of his poetry still extant was composed in this narrow time. Among his duties, based on limited records, was to tour the province, recommend outstanding individuals to the Court, and to punish as needed. In 887, Michizane had to petition the Buddhas and the Shinto kami to help relieve a drought at the time. Records of the time imply that Michizane's time as governor had met with only middling success.\n\nWhile serving as governor, a political conflict arose between Emperor Uda and Fujiwara no Mototsune called the in 888 over Mototsune's unclear role in the Court after Emperor Uda's ascension. Michizane, defending the court scholars sent a letter of censure to Mototsune, and gained the favor of Emperor Uda. With his term as governor completed in 890, Michizane returned to the Court in Kyoto. In Emperor Uda's struggles to restore power to the Imperial Family, away from the Fujiwara, a number of officials from non-Fujiwara families were promoted to key positions, including Imperial offshoots in the Minamoto family and Sugawara no Michizane. In a rapid series of promotions beginning in 891, Michizane rose to the senior third rank in 897. According to one document signed by Michizane in 894, he already held the following posts in the Court:\n\n\nHe was appointed ambassador to China in the 890s, but instead came out in support of abolition of the imperial embassies to China in 894, theoretically in consideration for the decline of the Tang Dynasty. A potential ulterior motive may have lain in Michizane's almost complete ignorance of spoken Chinese; most literate Japanese at the time only read Chinese, and knew little to nothing about the spoken language. Michizane, as the nominated ambassador to China, would have been presented with a potential loss of face had he been forced to depend on an interpreter.\n\nWithin the abdication of Emperor Uda, Michizane's position became increasingly vulnerable. In 901, through the political maneuverings of his rival, Fujiwara no Tokihira, Michizane was demoted from his aristocratic rank of junior second to a minor official post at Dazaifu, in Kyūshū's Chikuzen Province, and died in exile. After Michizane's death, plague and drought spread and sons of Emperor Daigo died in succession. The Imperial Palace's Great Audience Hall (\"shishinden\") was struck repeatedly by lightning, and the city experienced weeks of rainstorms and floods. Attributing this to the angry spirit of the exiled Sugawara, the imperial court built a Shinto shrine called Kitano Tenman-gū in Kyoto, and dedicated it to him. They posthumously restored his title and office, and struck from the record any mention of his exile. Even this was not enough, and 70 years later Sugawara was deified as Tenjin-sama, or \"kami\" of scholarship. Today many Shinto shrines in Japan are dedicated to him.\n\nEmperor Uda stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China. The emperor's decision-making was informed by what he understood as persuasive counsel from Sugawara Michizane.\n\nMichizane had an exceptional talent in poetry both for \"kanshi\" (poetry in Chinese) and \"waka\" (poetry in Japanese).\n\nHis primary interest was \"kanshi\", because in those days the immersion in the Chinese culture was regarded as a proof of refinement and scholarship. Since his excellence in \"kanshi\" was well known throughout the Court, Emperor Daigo suggested him to compile his Chinese poems, and therefore he published and dedicated it to the emperor in 900. After his exile he continued to work on \"kanshi\" and compiled them into the . The work contained 46 \"kanshi\", was completed sometime before his death in 903. He sent it to right before his death.\n\nOne of his poems was included as #24 in Fujiwara no Teika's \"Ogura Hyakunin Isshu\":\n\nThe poem was originally #420 in the \"Kokin Wakashū\".\nAnother of his famous waka is a poem written in 901 just before he left Kyoto for Daizaifu by demotion. He felt deep sorrow that he would never see his precious plum tree in his residence in Kyoto again, so he talked endearingly to it:\nA romantic legend says the plum tree was so fond of its master that it finally flew to Dazaifu, and that tree became known as at Dazaifu Tenman-gū (a shrine dedicated to its master). A more realistic legend says Michizane or his friend transplanted its seedling to Dazaifu.\n\nMichizane is traditionally credited with the \"Shinsen Man'yōshū\", but the attribution has been challenged.\n\n\nThe lineage of the Sugawara clan was divided into six families by the 18th century. Aside from these noble families, there are several (often self-proclaimed) branches in the samurai caste, including Maeda and Yagyū.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12276403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12276403", "title": "Tamil mythology", "text": "Tamil mythology\n\nTamil mythology means the stories and sacred narratives belonging to the Tamil people. This body of mythology is a mix of elements from the Tamil culture, Dravidian culture and Indus Valley cultures along with the Hindu religious aspects.\n\nThe Tamil literature in parallel with the Sanskrit literature formed a major source of information on Hindu culture. The ancient Tamil epics forms the source of various historical figures in Hindu scripture like Agastya, Iravan, Patanjali etc. Ancient Tamil literature is the source of Tamil deities like Murugan and Kotravai, Tamil literature forms the source of history of Nataraja, Meenakshi, Tirupati, Rameswaram.\n\nMurugan (), also known as Kartikeya, is the Hindu god of war and victory, worshiped primarily in areas with Tamil influences, especially South India, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore and Reunion Island. His six most important shrines in India are the Arupadaiveedu temples, located in Tamil Nadu. In Sri Lanka, Hindus as well as Buddhists revere the sacred historical Nallur Kandaswamy temple in Jaffna and Katirkāmam Temple (also in Sinhala \"Katharagama Devalaya\") situated deep south. Ethnic Tamils in Malaysia also pray to Lord Murugan at the Batu Caves temple and Thaipusam is celebrated with grandeur.\n\nIn a complicated story, he is said to have been born from Agni and Svāha, after the latter impersonated the six of the seven wives of the Saptarishi (Seven Sages). The actual wives then become the Pleiades. Karthikeya is said to have been born to destroy the Asura Mahisha. (In later mythology, Mahisha became the adversary of Durga.) Indra attacks Karthikeya as he sees the latter as a threat, until Shiva intervenes and makes Karthikeya the commander-in-chief of the army of the Devas. He is also married to Devasena, Indra's daughter. The origin of this marriage lies probably in the punning of 'Deva-sena-pati'. It can mean either lord of Devasena or Lord of the army (sena) of Devas.\nImage:YaudheyaCoin.jpg| A coin, around 200 BCE, of the Yaudheyas with depiction of Karttikeya\nImage:KarttikeyaWithSpearAndCockYaudheyas.jpg|Karttikeya with Vel and Seval (rooster), coin of the Yaudheyas 200 BCE\n(),() (also called Sastavu, or Sasta) is a Hindu deity worshiped in a number of shrines across India. Ayyappan is believed to be an incarnation of Dharma Sasta, who is the offspring of Shiva and Vishnu (as Mohini, is the only female avatar of the God Vishnu) and is generally depicted in a yogic posture, wearing a jewel around his neck, hence named Manikandan. Ayyappan may bear a historical relationship to the tutelary deity Aiyanar in Tamil Nadu.\nThe asura princess Mahishi was burning up with anger at the trick the gods had pulled on her brother, the asura king Mahishasura. As Mahishasura was blessed with invulnerability to all men, the gods had sent goddess Durga, to fight and kill him. Thus, Mahishi began performing a fearsome set of austerities, and pleased the creator god Brahma. She asked for the boon of invulnerability, but Brahma said it was not possible so Mahishi planned and asked invulnerability to all men except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu (Both are male & no possibility to give birth to any one). He granted her the boon of ruling the universe and being invulnerable except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu. Since such a person did not exist, she thought she was safe and began conquering and plundering the world.\n\nThe gods implored Shiva and Vishnu to save them from this catastrophe. Vishnu found a possible solution to the problem. When Vishnu had taken on the Kurma Avatar, he also had to manifest himself as Mohini, the enchantress, to save the nectar of immortality (ambrosia or amrit) from the demons who were not willing to share it with the gods. If he became Mohini again, then the female Mohini and the male Shiva could have the divine child who would combine their powers and beat Mahishi.\n\nSome versions give a slightly more detailed version of the union of Shiva with Vishnu. One version tells that the asura Bhasmasura had so pleased Lord Shiva with his austerities that Shiva gave him a boon of anything he wished. So Bhasmasura asked for the ability to burn to ashes anything which he placed his hand over. No sooner had Shiva granted this, than Bhasmasura ran after the god, threatening to turn him to ashes.\n\nShiva called to Lord Vishnu for help. He hide himself in a peepal tree as Bhasmasura ran here and there searching for the god. Vishnu became aware of the events, and decided that he would take the female form Mohini, \"the Enchanting\", and try to trump the asura's powers. When Bhasmasura saw Vishnu in this form, he was bewitched by her beauty. He earnestly tried to court her. So Vishnu instructed Bhasmasura to hold his hand over his head, and vow fidelity. With this act, Bhasmasura was reduced to ashes.\n\nVishnu found Shiva and explained the whole affair to him. Shiva asked if he too could see Vishnu in this female form. When Vishnu appeared thus, Shiva was overcome with passion, and united with her. The two gods thus became \"Harihara Murthi\", that is a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu as one god.\n\nFrom this union, Lord Sree Dharma Sastha was born. He combined in himself the powers of Vishnu and Shiva. Lord Ayyappan is an incarnation of Lord Sree Dharma Sastha and Lord Ayyappan is a visible embodiment of their essential identity. Sri Ayyappa belongs to Pandya Royal Community. He was the head of a clan. It is believed Sri Ayyappa merged to sri dharma sastha. Lord Vishnu gifted the new-born deity with a little bejeweled bell necklace, so this god is called Manikandan. He is also Known as Dharma Shasthavu, Kerala Puthran.\n\nPerumal () also Thirumal () is the Hindu deity most popular amongst Tamils of Tamil Nadu state in India and in the Tamil diaspora. Perumal is another name of Vishnu.\n\nTamil Sangam literature (200BCE to 500CE) mentions mAyOn, or the dark one, as the supreme deity who creates, sustains and destroys the universe. Paripadal 3 describes the glory of Thirumal in the most superlative terms.\n\nParipadal(3)by kaduvan iLaveyinanAr:\n\n\"thIyinuL theRal nI poovinuL naaRRa nI kallinuL maNiyu nI sollinuL vaaymai aRaththinuL anbu nI maRaththinuL mainthu nI\nvEthaththu maRai nI boothaththu madhalu nI vencudar oLiyu nI thingaLuL aLiyu nI anaiththu nI anaiththinut poruLu nI\"\n\nThe last line states that Thirumal is the supreme deity who is the inner controller (Antaryamin) of the entire universe. This is one of the Lord's glories, which is first mentioned in Vedas and later propounded by Alwars in Prabhandams and Sri Vaishnavaite Acharyas in various commentaries.\n\nThirumal (Vishnu) is the only deity who has enjoyed the status of Paramporul during the Sangam age. The reference to \"Mukkol Bhagavars\" in Sangam literature clearly indicates that only Vaishnavaite saints holding Tridanda existed during the sangam age and Thirumal was glorified as the supreme deity whose divine lotus feet can burn all our evils and grant Moksha (Maru Piraparukkum Maasil Sevadi). During the post-Sangam period, his worship was further glorified by the alwars and great Vaishnavite acharyas.\n\nThe story of Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (\"vanam\" meaning forest and \"thillai\" trees - botanical name \"Exocoeria agallocha\", a species of mangrove trees - which currently grows in the Pichavaram wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or 'rishis' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and \"mantras\" or magical words. Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of Bhikshatana, a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as Mohini. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance and the beauty of The handsome mendicant and His consort. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (\"nāgas\") by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around His waist and then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy).\n\nThe rishis gathered all their spiritual strength and invoked a powerful demon Muyalakan - a symbol of complete arrogance and ignorance. Lord Shiva wore a gentle smile, stepped on the demon's back, immobilized him and performed the \"Ánanda Tandava\" (the dance of eternal bliss) and disclosed his true form. The sages surrender, realizing that Lord Shiva is the truth and He is beyond magic and rituals.\n\nOnce Indra killed a demon, even though the demon did not harm anyone. This act brought a curse upon Indra that forced him to continue wandering until he was walking around looking for a way where no one would tell him which way to go will redeem him from his sin. After much wandering, Indra was freed from his suffering through the power of a Shivalingam in a forest, and so he built a small temple at that site.\n\nIt so happened that at that time in South India there was a Pandyan king called Malayadhwaja Pandiyan ruling a small city by the name \"Manavur\", which was quite near to this Shivalinga. He was the son of \"Kulashekara\" Pandyan. He came to know about the Shivalinga and decided to build a huge temple for Shiva in the forest \"Kadambavanam\" (\"vanam\" means forest). He also developed the region into a fine princely state called Madurai.\n\nThe king was childless and sought an heir for the kingdom. Shiva granted him his prayers through an \"Ayonija\" child (one born not from the womb). This child was three years old and actually the incarnation of goddess Parvati the consort of Shiva. She was born with fish-shaped eyes. It was said that the extra breast would disappear when she met her future husband. She was named \"Mīnachchi\", (meaning \"fish eyed\") from the words \"mīna\" (meaning fish) and \"akṣi\" (meaning eyes). Mīnakshi also means \"the one who has eyes like that of a fish\". Fishes are said to feed their younger ones with their eyes, similarly goddess looks after her devotees. Just by her sight our miseries disappear.\n\nShe grew up to be a Shiva-Shakti personification. After the death of the king, she ruled the kingdom with skillful administration.\n\nIn one of her expeditions she went to the Himalayas and there, on seeing Shiva, her extra breast disappeared. Many of the gods and goddesses came to witness their marriage.\n\nAt the wedding celebrations the gods refused to have the served food unless Shiva performed a majestic dance for everybody gathered at the place. At this there was the dance of Chidambaram, the \"cosmic dance\" in front of his wife Minakshi. It epitomised and merged all life force and beauty into one whole. In the end Minakshi was merged with the shivalingam and became the representation of life and beauty.\n\nThere is another legend that talks about why the North Tower (called as \"Mottai Gopuram\") does not have that many sculptures. Bhootaganas were supposed to finish the construction of the temple towers during the night. Legend says that bhootaganas completed all three towers but while in the middle of building the north tower sunrise happened halting the completion of the north tower.\nA Tamil poem shows the goddess Meenakshi as a girl washing crockery and pots (which consist of all the worlds). This is a daily task, because her husband Shiva repeatedly messes up the universe, which Minakshi must once more sort out and clean.\n\nIn thirty words, Minakshi becomes a global icon for all who deal with 'impossible' children (or husbands). Themes and activities of early childhood run through the poems. God in the little child is worshipped and protected amidst the toys in the kitchen and back yard\n\nKannagi or (Kannaki), a legendary Tamil woman, is the central character of the South Indian epic \"Silapathikaram\" (100-300 CE). The story relates how Kannagi took revenge on the early Pandyan King of Madurai, for a mistaken death penalty imposed on her husband Kovalan, by cursing the city with disaster.\nKodungallur Bhagavathy Temple was built to commemorate the martyrdom of Kannagi. It is said that sixth avatar of Vishnu, Sage Parasurama built this temple for the prosperity of the people. According to the old chronicles, this Bhagavathi temple was created in the heart of the town many centuries ago to serve a special purpose.\nLegend says that, after the creation of Kerala by Parasurama, he was harassed by a demon called Daruka. To kill this evil demon, Parasurama prayed to Lord Shiva for help. As advised by Shiva, Parasurama constructed the shrine and installed the Shakti Devi as Bhagavathi. The deity in the temple, it is believed, is Parashakthi herself. According to legends, it was Bhadrakali who killed the evil demon Daruka.\nShe is worshiped as goddess Pattini in Sri Lanka by the Sinhalese Buddhists, Kannaki Amman by the Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus' (See Hinduism in Sri Lanka) and as Kodungallur Bhagavathy and Attukal Bhagavathy in the South Indian state of Kerala.\n\nKannagi is also viewed as a brave woman who could demand justice directly from the King and even dared to call him \"unenlightened king\" (\"Thera Manna\", Vazhakkurai Kathai, Silappathikaram).\n\nSiddhars (Tamil: சித்தர்) are saints in India, mostly of the Saivaite denomination in Tamil Nadu, who professed and practised an unorthodox type of Sadhana, or spiritual practice, to attain liberation. Yogic powers called Siddhis are acquired by constant practice of certain yogic disciplines. Those who acquire these Siddhis are called Siddhas. These sidhars can be compared to Mystics of the western civilization.\nSiddhars are people who are believed to control and transcend the barriers of time and space by meditation (Yoga), after the use of substances called Rasayanas that transform the body to make it potentially deathless, and a particular breathing-practice, a type of Pranayama. Through their practices they are believed to have reached stages of insight which enabled them to tune into the powers hidden in various material substances and practices, useful for suffering and ignorant mankind. Typically Siddhars were saints, doctors, alchemists and mysticists all at once. They wrote their findings, in the form of poems in Tamil language, on palm leaves which are collected and stored in what are known today as Palm leaf manuscript, today still owned by private families in Tamil Nadu and handed down through the generations, as well as public institutions such as Universities all over the world (India, Germany, Great Britain, U.S.).\n\nIn this way Siddhars developed, among other branches of a vast knowledge-system, what is now known as Siddha medicine, practised mainly in Tamil Nadu as Traditional native medicine. A rustic form of healing that is similar to Siddha medicine has since been practised by experienced elderly in the villages of Tamil Nadu. (This has been misunderstood as \"Paatti Vaitthiyam, Naattu marunthu\" and \"Mooligai marutthuvam\". While paati vaitthiyam or naatu marunthu is traditional Tamil medicine and mooligai marutthuvam is ayurvedic medicine.) They are also founders of Varmam - a martial art for self-defence and medical treatment at the same time. Varmam are specific points located in the human body which when pressed in different ways can give various results, such as disabling an attacker in self-defence, or balancing a physical condition as an easy first-aid medical treatment.\n\nTamil Siddhars were the first to develop pulse-reading (\"naadi paarththal\" in Tamil) to identify the origin of diseases. This method was later copied and used in ayurvedha.\n\nSiddhars have also written many religious poems. It is believed that most of them have lived for ages, in a mystic mountain called Sathuragiri, near Thanipparai village in Tamil Nadu.\n\nOne of the best-known Siddhars was Agasthyar or Agasthya, who is believed to be the founding father of Siddha culture.\n\nAbithana Chintamani states Siddhars are either of the 9 or 18 persons enlisted, but sage Agastyar states that there are many who precede these and follow 9 or 18 persons. Many of the great Siddhars are regarded to have powers magical and spiritual.\n\nThe 9 listed as Abithana Chintamani states is as follows:\n\n\nThere are totally 18 siddhars in the Tamil siddha tradition.see Siddhar\n\nThe siddhars are believed to have had powers both major and other ‘minor’ powers. They are explained in detail in various yogic as well as religious texts. They also have the power converting their mass to energy and thereby travel in space in light speed to different universe.\n\nThese eight are the Great Siddhis (Ashtama siddhis), or Great Perfections.\n\nKumari Kandam30,000 B.C. to 16,000 B.C (Tamil:குமரிக்கண்டம், \"Kumarikkaṇṭam\") is the name of a supposed sunken landmass referred to in existing ancient Tamil literature. It is said to have been located in the Indian Ocean, to the south of present-day Kanyakumari district at the southern tip of India.\n\nThere are scattered references in Sangam literature, such as Kalittokai 104, to how the sea took the land of the Pandiyan kings, upon which they conquered new lands to replace those they had lost. There are also references to the rivers Pahruli and Kumari, that are said to have flowed in a now-submerged land. The Silappadhikaram, one of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature written in first few centuries CE, states that the \"cruel sea\" took the Pandiyan land that lay between the rivers Pahruli and the mountainous banks of the Kumari, to replace which the Pandiyan king conquered lands belonging to the Chola and Chera kings (Maturaikkandam, verses 17-22). Adiyarkkunallar, a 12th-century commentator on the epic, explains this reference by saying that there was once a land to the south of the present-day Kanyakumari, which stretched for 700 \"kavatam\" from the Pahruli river in the north to the Kumari river in the south. As the modern equivalent of a kavatam is unknown, estimates of the size of the lost land vary from to in length, to others suggesting a total \"area\" of 6-7,000 square miles, or smaller still an area of just a few villages.\n\nThis land was divided into 49 nadu, or territories, which he names as seven coconut territories (\"elutenga natu\"), seven Madurai territories (\"elumaturai natu\"), seven old sandy territories (\"elumunpalai natu\"), seven new sandy territories (\"elupinpalai natu\"), seven mountain territories (\"elukunra natu\"), seven eastern coastal territories (\"elukunakarai natu\") and seven dwarf-palm territories (\"elukurumpanai natu\"). All these lands, he says, together with the many-mountained land that began with KumariKollam, with forests and habitations, were submerged by the sea. Two of these Nadus or territories were supposedly parts of present-day Kollam and Kanyakumari districts.\n\nNone of these texts name the land \"Kumari Kandam\" or \"Kumarinadu\", as is common today. The only similar pre-modern reference is to a \"Kumari Kandam\" (written குமரிகண்டம், rather than குமரிக்கண்டம் as the land is called in modern Tamil), which is named in the medieval Tamil text \"Kantapuranam\" either as being one of the nine continents, or one of the nine divisions of India and the only region not to be inhabited by barbarians. 19th and 20th century Tamil revivalist movements, however, came to apply the name to the territories described in Adiyarkkunallar's commentary to the Silappadhikaram. They also associated this territory with the references in the Tamil Sangams, and said that the fabled cities of southern Madurai (Ten Madurai) and Kapatapuram where the first two Sangams were said to be held were located on Kumari Kandam. These sangams may have overlapped in parallel to the third historic sangam; the second century BCE Tissamaharama Tamil Brahmi inscription detailing the \"thiraLi muRi\" (written agreement of the assembly) was excavated a few miles from the coast of the historic Tenavaram temple, Matara, Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tamil nationalists came to identify Kumari Kandam with Lemuria, a \"lost continent\" posited in the 19th century to account for discontinuities in biogeography. In these accounts, Kumari Kandam became the \"cradle of civilization\", the origin of human languages in general and the Tamil language in particular. These ideas gained notability in Tamil academic literature over the first decades of the 20th century, and were popularized by the Tanittamil Iyakkam, notably by self-taught Dravidologist Devaneya Pavanar, who held that all languages on earth were merely corrupted Tamil dialects.\n\nR. Mathivanan, then Chief Editor of the Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project of the Government of Tamil Nadu, in 1991 claimed to have deciphered the still undeciphered Indus script as Tamil, following the methodology recommended by his teacher Devaneya Pavanar, presenting the following timeline (cited after Mahadevan 2002):\n\n\nSumathi Ramaswamy's book, \"The Lost Land of Lemuria: Fabulous Geographies, Catastrophic Histories\" (2004) is a theoretically sophisticated study of the Lemuria legends that widens the discussion beyond previous treatments, looking at Lemuria narratives from nineteenth-century Victorian-era science to Euro-American occultism, colonial, and post colonial India. Ramaswamy discusses particularly how cultures process the experience of loss.\n\n"}

The text is preserved in the Royal Irish Academy as MS 679 (23/G/4), with a few early modern copies. It is prophecy made in the Early Middle Ages. \n\nThe text consists of 205 \"debide\" stanzas, two of which are corrupt (128, 168). It is divided into two parts. The reputed author of part one (stanzas 1-96) is an Irish abbot named Berchán, from whom the poem's name originates. Part one consists of a history of Berchán's own monastery, a recount of Viking attacks, and descriptions of the reigns of nineteen Irish kings. \n\nPart two (stanzas 97-206) is presented as an anonymous prophecy given around the death of Saint Patrick in the 5th century, prophesying the life of Columba and King Áedán mac Gabráin, and 24 Scottish kings, from Cináed mac Ailpín (d. 858) to Domnall Bán (d. 1097). The poem is very indirect in its identification of Scottish kings, and uses a large number of obscure poetic images and similes. Unlike the Irish kings in part one, there are no accompanying glosses naming the kings. However, the Scottish kings spoken of can be identified, and the evidence made useful. The poem is one of the most important sources for Scottish history in the period it covers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20526461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20526461", "title": "Ācāra", "text": "Ācāra\n\nĀcāra () is a concept used in the context of Classical Hindu law that refers to the customary laws or community norms of a particular social group. These community norms are delineated and put into practice by people who have earned the respect of those within each individual group, such as a community leader or elder. Although in Dharmaśāstra the ideal person who defines the ācāra of a particular place is dictated as one who knows the Vedas or is “learned”, in actual practice this role is often deferred to group leaders along with Vedic scholars. Ācāra is theologically important in Hindu law because it is considered, along with the Vedas (Śruti), and Smriti (traditional texts such as the Dharmaśāstra literature), to be one of the sources of dharma. Particular regional ācāra is believed to be canonized in Dharmaśāstra texts; however scholars differ on the source for the actual accounts found within these texts.\n\nCustomary law within the context of Hindu law is defined as akin to the community norm of a particular region. This form of law encompasses laws that are actually applied to daily life, as opposed to theological laws canonized in texts which are accessible for only a small proportion of the population. In this sense, customary law represents the actual practice of law in classical Hinduism, while laws found in the Vedas, , and śruti literature represent the theoretical practice. \n\nĀcāra, however, is a particularly narrow scope of customary law. What separates it as a category is that these laws are put into practice by people who hold a particular power over that set group. The power is determined by a theological connection to the divine through a full understanding of Vedic literature. These people are also known in dharma literature as the sadācāra. Although dharmasastra identifies the sadācāra as the ideal person for creating laws because they are so fluent with Vedic knowledge that the laws they choose to enforce are in line with the Vedas, in reality, the power to develop laws shifted over time from Vedic scholars to community leaders whose actions gained the respect of their fellow community members and were distinguished as \"good people\" even if they lacked direct knowledge of the Vedas. \n\nEventually, even the laws penned by those not versed in the Vedas were connected back to Vedic literature. According to Mitramiśra, even the customs of Śudra are the dharma for Śudra. This means that each particular group has a different individual dharma they must fulfill. Therefore, as long as the practices of a leader are considered in line with the customs of the community, they are still considered to be pursuing their dharma and therefore are still connected to the Vedas.\n\nAccording to the Mimamsa scholar Kumārila, \"when good people act according to certain rules and no motive or goal is apparent in the realm of the observable, then this is to be understood as dharma.\" The \"good people\" of this definition represent the sadācāra. The \"sad\" of sadācāra is translated as good which causes sadācāra to translate as the \"standards of the good (people)\". Sadācāra within dharmasastra literature are people who orientate their actions toward the Veda and therefore their actions and decisions (ācāra) can be used as law. According to literature, sadācāra are the source of correct living, dharma, and therefore Hindu law, when laws set forth in the Vedas and Traditional texts do not address a particular issue. Several ancient commentators (including Kumārila) go so far as to put forth the claim that practices considered legitimate and recorded in the smṛtis but not found in the Vedas are actually located in a \"lost Veda\" available to the composers of the Dharma texts but now no longer extant.\n\nMany texts within the Hindu Law tradition refer to ācāra as the third source of dharma. Although knowledge about dharma received from the Vedas remains the primary source, the Vedas rarely mention dharma in a practical application for daily living. Because of this, there exist two other sources for dharma which provide more personally applicable directions for the follower’s lives. If an answer to a question is not found within the Vedas themselves, the question is then posed to each level of sources until an answer is given.\nIn descending rank in hierarchy, the sources of dharma are:\n\nThe power of ācāra within this hierarchy comes from its ability to connect with the Vedas. This connection comes either through the sadācāra, or leader, who establishes the ācāra because of his knowledge of the Vedas, or through citing an additional text as a source that is itself connected with the Vedas.\n\nThere are a number of telling references to \"ācāra\" in Dharmaśāstra texts which reveal the real importance custom had for the settling of legal disputes. Nārada, for example, states that when something stated in a text on dharma conflicts with custom, custom wins out over the text. Asahāya, in his commentary to this statement, confirms that the texts should never overturn \"lokācāra\", or the \"customs of the people.\" \"Yājñavalkya\" 1.156 agrees that what is considered anathema by the people, even if proscribed by the smṛtis, is not to be enforced. \"Manu\" 8.41 likewise states that a judge must study the specific laws practiced by castes (\"jātidharma\"), particular regions (\"janapadharma\"), and families (\"kuladharma\") before making any legal pronouncements relating to them.\n\nEven in rules concerning legal procedure itself, the importance of custom is evidenced. \"Nārada\" 1.115 states that the validity of documents, i.e. whether they must be witnessed, written in one's own handwriting, etc., should be determined based on local conventions.\n\nWith regard to individual groups' own self-governance, \"Nārada\" 10.2-3 requires that the king allow heretical monastic groups (like Jains and Buddhists), guilds, local councils, and other corporate groups to exercise their own laws and customs. According to \"Yājñavalkya\" 1.342-343, the king must preserve the customs and conventions of all newly conquered lands as well.\n\nVarious scholars hold differing ideas about the origin of the recorded ācāra found in Dharmaśāstra literature such as the . Some, such as scholar Richard Lariviere, hold that traditional texts are \"records of actual customs and practices found in classical India\". These were factual records \"recorded whether the compilers of agreed with them or not\". Although each of the customs recorded within were drawn from various times and localities, the importance of recording and compiling them was to integrate the local practices into the larger brahminical sector by connecting them to the Vedas.\n\nA different origin for the textual accounts of ācāra stated by scholar Donald R. Davis Jr., claims the ācāra of the time was not directly recorded verbatim, but instead influenced the scholars who crafted literature. However, even without the direct approval or recording done by classically defined sadācāra, or Vedic scholars, the community norms of a particular location dictated by their own leaders, who may not be Vedic scholars, remained meaningful. This demonstrates a view in which a particular practice doesn't have to be directly tied to the Veda in order for it to be honored as ācāra.\n\nVarious difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force of śruti, , and ācāra in Hindu law and numerous rules have been laid down in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them. \"Ācāra (customs and usage) are transcendental law, and so are the practices declared in the Veda and the ; therefore a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always make effort to follow it.\" The meaning of ācāra itself has changed over time in Hindu law. In the earliest days, ācāra that was to be followed was that observed or declared by learned Brahmins who were highly moral and selfless. Gradually, however, usage that had no visible secular purpose came to be looked upon as binding. Eventually, even customary norms of Śudras became enforceable by the king. In this manner, ācāra became the actual source of Hindu law in more contemporary times. Commentaries on the śāstras indicate an attempt to reconcile the text law with the actual usages of the people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164751", "title": "Ītzpāpālōtl", "text": "Ītzpāpālōtl\n\nIn Aztec religion, Ītzpāpālōtl (\"Obsidian Butterfly\") was a striking skeletal warrior goddess who ruled over the paradise world of Tamoanchan, the paradise of victims of infant mortality and the place identified as where humans were created. She is the mother of Mixcoatl and is particularly associated with the moth \"Rothschildia orizaba\" from the family Saturniidae. Some of her associations are birds and fire. However, she primarily appears in the form of the Obsidian Butterfly.\nItzpapalotl's name can either mean \"obsidian butterfly\" or \"clawed butterfly\"; the latter meaning seems most likely. It's quite possible that clawed butterfly refers to the bat and in some instances Itzpapalotl is depicted with bat wings. However, she can also appear with clear butterfly or eagle attributes. Her wings are obsidian or tecpatl (flint) knife tipped. (In the \"Manuscript of 1558\", Itzpapalotl is described as having \"blossomed into the white flint, and they took the white and wrapped it in a bundle.\") She could appear in the form of a beautiful, seductive woman or terrible goddess with a skeletal head and butterfly wings supplied with stone blades. Although the identity remains inconclusive, the Zapotec deity named Goddess 2J by Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Bernal may be a Classic Zapotec form of Itzpapalotl. In many instances Goddess 2J, whose image is found on ceramic urns, is identified with bats. \"In folklore, bats are sometimes called \"black butterflies\"\". Itzpapalotl is sometimes represented as a goddess with flowing hair holding a trophy leg. The femur is thought by some scholars to have significance as a war trophy or a sacred object in Pre-Hispanic art.\n\nItzpapalotl is the patron of the day and associated with the stars Cozcuauhtli and Trecena 1 House in the Aztec calendar. The Trecena 1 House is one of the five western trecena dates dedicated to the cihuateteo, or women who had died in childbirth. Not only was Itzpapalotl considered one of the cihuateteo herself, but she was also one of the tzitzimime, star demons that threatened to devour people during solar eclipses.\n\nOne of the prominent aspects of the ritual surrounding Itzpapalotl relates to the creation story of the Aztec tribe, the Chichimec. The ritual is illustrated in the sixteenth century document known as the Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2.  An illustration from this document shows Chichimec warriors emerging out of a seven-chambered cave behind Itzpapalotl. The deity is shown brandishing a severed leg, thought to be a symbol of battle. Beginning in the 1990s, archeologists exploring the  Barranca Del Aguila region, southwest of Mexico City, have discovered caves carved to simulate the seven chambered cave, known as Chicomoztoc, from the ritual creation narrative. \n\nAccording to the \"Manuscript of 1558\", section VII, Itzpapalotl was one of two divine 2-headed doe-deers (the other one being Chimalman) who temporarily transformed themselves into women in order to seduce men. Itzpapalotl approached the two \"cloud serpents named Xiuhnel and Mimich \", who transformed themselves into men (so as to disguise themselves when all the others of the Centzonmimixcoa had been slain in the ambush?). To Xiuhnel, Itzpapalotl said \"\"Drink, Xiuhnel.\" Xiuhnel drank the blood and then immediately lay down with her. Suddenly she ... devoured him, tore open his breast. ... Then Mimich ... ran and ... descended into a thorny barrel cactus, fell into it, and the woman fell down after him.\" In the myth-history narrative of the Annales de Cuauhtitlan, the cloud deity victims take the form of deer, the hearts of whom are eaten by Itzpapalotl. The theme of the heart devouring goddess appears in other global mythologies.\n\nOrizaba the Moth Fairy, a villain in \"Elena of Avalor\", was inspired by Itzpapalotl. \n\nBeyond pop culture, the name of the goddess has been used to name formations, the Itzpapalotl Tessera, on the planet Venus which are being studied for our knowledge of the geological history of our planet. \n\nAdditionally, the goddess is one of the Pre-Columbian motifs found in California Chicano Literature.\n\n\nR.W.
