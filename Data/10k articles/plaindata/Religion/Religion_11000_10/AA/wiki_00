Crowley modeled these instructions on his own experiences in the year 1905. The Vision and the Voice describes two additional methods of entering the Abyss. The first of these \"concerns things of which it (was) unlawful to speak openly under penalty of the most dreadful punishment,\" namely receptive homosexual intercourse under the desert sun that went against Crowley's social habits of conduct or his conscious self-image. The second involves ceremonial magic and focuses more on the theory behind the Abyss.\n\nIn the Qabalistic system of Crowley, the Abyss contains the 11th (hidden) sephira, Da'ath, which separates the lower sephiroth from the supernals. This account derives from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's view of Genesis, in which Da'ath represents the fall of man from a unified consciousness into a duality between ego and divine nature. The Abyss is guarded by the demon Choronzon, who manifests during the third, ceremonial method of crossing this gulf. He represents those parts of one's consciousness and unconsciousness -- \"a momentary unity capable of sensation and of expression,\" in Crowley's terms -- that are unwilling or unable to enter the Divine. According to Grant Morrison in the Richard Metzger \"Book of Lies\", at least, Choronzon \nis Existential Self at the last gasp...Beyond Choronzon we are no longer our Self. The \"personality\" on the brink of the Abyss will do anything, say anything and find any excuse to avoid taking this disintegrating step into \"non-being.\"\n\n\"Crossing the Abyss\" is regarded as a perilous operation, and the most important work of the magician's career. Success confers graduation into the degree of Magister Templi, or \"Master of the Temple.\"\n\nCrowley specifically wrote his 1913 volume, \"The Book of Lies\", for what he called the \"Babes of the Abyss\" (writing at the start of the book, \"It is an official publication for Babes of the Abyss\").\n\n"}

Jesus Christ and Mother Mary for the same reason are also called Tekse Apus.\nAccording to one science-fiction novel, the natives know of extraterrestrials that claim to come from the planet Apu. Apparently they wish to keep this a secret, but the Apunians wish humanity to know all about them what this implies.

Considered sacred, it was not to be touched, tread on, or even looked at after completion. Occasionally when falling into a state of decay, Bidentals would be repaired or reconstructed.\n\nPlaces being struck by lightning were regarded as a terrifying example of godly wrath, and not to be taken lightly. Had any person committed sacrilege, they were punished severely with frenzy. Primarily it was believed that these shows of divine power were displayed specifically by Jupiter, King of the gods.\n\n"}

It is believed to have been written in the 18th century by an anonymous French officer who served in Napoleon's army. The text takes the form of a narrative centering on the French officer during the Egyptian expedition led by Napoleon (referred to here as the \"genius\") when his unit is suddenly attacked by Arab soldiers (Bedouins). The French officer manages to escape the attack, but is the only survivor. An old Turkish man appears suddenly from the pyramids and takes the French officer into a secret apartment within one of the pyramids.

The book also teaches the reader how to master the extraordinary powers from these magical properties. Perhaps the most interesting magical property claimed in the book is the power to produce the Black Pullet, otherwise known as the Hen that lays Golden Eggs. The grimoire claims that the person who understands and attains the power to instruct the Black Pullet will gain unlimited wealth. The notion of such a lucrative possession has been reflected throughout history in fables, fairy tales and folklore.\n\nThis text has often been associated to two other texts, known as the \"Red Dragon\" (or \"The Grand Grimoire\") and the \"Black Screech Owl\".

At the age of eight, he was baptized by a Salesian missionary priest, Domingo Milanesio. Namuncurá's early years were spent by the Río Negro river, and it was here that he, according to legend, miraculously survived a fall into the river.\n\nHis father Manuel, Chief of the Mapuches, promoted to honorary colonel in the Argentine army, decided that his son study in Buenos Aires, in order to prepare himself \"to be useful to his people.\" Thanks to the friendship of Manuel with General Luís María Campos, Minister of War and the Navy of Argentina, the boy came to study in the National Workshops of the Navy as a carpenter's apprentice. There he would remain for three months. Being the only native Indian in the school Ceferino found himself mistreated by the other students and he soon fell ill. He wrote to his father that he was not happy in that place and Manuel then asked former Argentine president Luis Sáenz Peña's advice. He recommended to Colonel Manuel Namuncurá that he send the boy to the Salesians of Don Bosco.\n\nOn September 20, 1897, Ceferino went to study with the Salesians at the Colegio Pío IX, a technical academy in Almagro, Buenos Aires.\n\nWhen he finished his studies, Manuel his father wanted him back home, to serve as interpreter and secretary, but Ceferino was already enthusiastic about becoming a Salesian priest.\n\nAlthough his health was already generally frail, Ceferino began studying for the priesthood. In 1904, he departed for Italy accompanying Mgr. Giovanni Cagliero, a former disciple of Don Bosco who was to become an Archbishop. Pope Pius X received them in September, after which Namuncurá moved to Turin and later to the Salesian College \"Villa Sora\" in Frascati, to continue his education. He became increasingly ill during the Italian winter and was taken to Rome, where he finally succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis on May 11, 1905, at the \"Fate bene fratelli\" hospital.\n\nIn 1924 his remains were returned to Argentina and placed in the chapel at Fortín Mercedes, in the southern part of Buenos Aires Province. In 1945, a request for his beatification was forwarded to the Holy See. Between May 13 and July 10, 1947, the Church officially started the process for Canonization of Ceferino Namuncurá, with 21 then-living witnesses deposing evidence in favour of his virtues. \n\nAt his birthplace of Chimpay a small chapel was erected, where believers from Río Negro Province and beyond began to pray for his intercession. \n\nOn June 22, 1972, Pope Paul VI promulgated the Decree of Heroism of His Virtues and Ceferino was thus proclaimed \"venerable\", becoming the first Catholic Argentine to receive that title and the first South American aborigine.\n\nThe devotion to Ceferino Namuncurá, the saintly young Mapuche, known popularly as \"The Lily of Patagonia\" (\"El lirio de la Patagonia\") became very extensive in Buenos Aires and throughout Argentina. In particular the indigenous people recognise him as one of their own. The affection of the people of Argentina for this selfless young man is quite touchingly sincere and images and representations of his face are myriad. In 1991 his relics were translated from the small sanctuary chapel to the roomier Sanctuary of Mary, Help of Christians, at the same town of Fortín Mercedes.\n\nIn 2000 a committee of Vatican pathologists declared that the healing of the uterine cancer of a young mother, Valeria Herrera from Córdoba, Argentina, could not be explained medically, with which it was left to Church authorities to decree that it was a miracle due to the intercession of Ceferino Namuncurá. This opened the way for the beatification of Ceferino.\n\nPope Benedict XVI finally decreed his beatification on 6 July 2007. The ceremony of beatification was held in Chimpay, Argentina, on November 11, 2007. It was one of the few beatification ceremonies held outside the Vatican and in the blessed's own land; it was the first beatification of a South American aborigine. Blessed Ceferino was beatified by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, a Salesian of Don Bosco and Vatican Secretary of State. The ceremony was attended by more than ten thousand people with the active participation of Mapuche delegations.\n\nCeferino's liturgical calendar memorial as a Catholic \"beatus\" was established on August 26.\n\nCeferino Namuncurá's first legacy is to his own nation and people: Argentina and the Mapuche people. There are many books and videos on the life of the young holy man, most of them in Spanish. The meaning of Ceferino is also important to the Mapuche and all South American ancestral peoples. Manuel Gálvez, the prominent Argentine novelist and biographer, wrote a biography of Ceferino Namuncurá in 1947: \"El Santito de la Toldería. La vida perfecta de Ceferino Namuncurá\".\n\nCeferino Namuncura Park, along the Negro River, in Chimpay is named in his honor.\n\n\"Zephyrin: The Musicale\" is a musical play in honor of Blessed Ceferino Namuncurá. It was shown on March 14, 15 and 16, 2008 at SM Cinema One in Cebu, Philippines. It was written by Jude Thaddeus Gitamondoc and directed by Daisy Brilliantes Ba-ad with the help of Don Bosco Technology Center Productions.The musical was a Salesian Production made in honor of the beatification of Ceferino. The musical featured amateur actors, mostly coming from high school and elementary school. The story begin when Ceferino is only a child and ends after his death. \n\n\n"}

Townes\n\nCharles Hard Townes (July 28, 1915 – January 27, 2015) was an American physicist and inventor of the maser. Townes worked on the theory and application of the maser, for which he obtained the fundamental patent, and other work in quantum electronics associated with both maser and laser devices. He shared the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov. Townes was an adviser to the United States Government, meeting every US President from Harry Truman (1945) to Bill Clinton (1999).\n\nHe directed the US government Science and Technology Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program. After becoming a professor of the University of California at Berkeley in 1967, he began an astrophysical program that produced several important discoveries, for example, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nTownes was religious and believed that science and religion are converging to provide a greater understanding of the nature and purpose of the universe.\n\nTownes was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the son of Henry Keith Townes (1876–1958), an attorney, and Ellen Sumter Townes (née Hard; 1881–1980). He earned his B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Modern Languages at Furman University, where he graduated in 1935. Townes completed work for the Master of Arts degree in physics at Duke University during 1937, and then began graduate school at the California Institute of Technology, from which he received a Ph.D. degree in 1939. During World War II, he worked on radar bombing systems at Bell Labs.\n\nIn 1950, Townes was appointed Professor at Columbia University. He served as Executive Director of the Columbia Radiation Laboratory from 1950 to 1952. He was Chairman of the Physics Department from 1952 to 1955.\n\nIn 1951, Townes conceived a new way to create intense, precise beams of coherent radiation, for which he invented the acronym \"maser\" (for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). When the same principle was applied to higher frequencies, the term \"laser\" was used (the word \"light\" substituting for the word \"microwave\").\n\nDuring 1953, Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at Columbia University. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 gigahertz.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1961, he was on leave of absence from Columbia University to serve as Vice President and Director of Research of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit organization, which advised the U.S. government and was operated by eleven universities. Between 1961 and 1967, Townes served as both Provost and Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, during 1967, he was appointed as a Professor of Physics at the University of California at Berkeley, where he remained for almost 50 years; his status was as professor emeritus by the time of his death during 2015. Between 1966 and 1970, he was chairman of the NASA Science Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program.\n\nFor his creation of the maser, Townes along with Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov received the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics. Townes also developed the use of masers and lasers for astronomy, was part of a team that first discovered complex molecules in space, and determined the mass of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nDuring 2002–2003, Townes served as a Karl Schwarzschild Lecturer in Germany and the Birla Lecturer and Schroedinger Lecturer in India.\n\nThis information is drawn from the authoritative oral history on Charles Townes done by the Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley and underwritten by the Sloan Foundation. Refer to other aspects of his life too.\n\nWhen Townes failed to be promoted to President of MIT during 1967, he accepted an offer from Clark Kerr to join the University of California at Berkeley and begin an astrophysical program. Townes soon began searching for molecules in space. At the time most astronomers thought that molecules could not exist in space because ultraviolet rays would destroy them. Townes eventually discovered ammonia and water in dust clouds, which shielded them from damaging rays, by essentially doing microwave spectroscopy on the sky. This created the topic of molecular/millimeter astronomy, which continues to find many complex molecules, some the precursors to life.\n\nThe center of the Milky Way had long puzzled astronomers, and thick dust obscures the view of it in visible light. During the mid to late 1970s, Townes together with Eric Wollman, John Lacy, Thomas Geballe and Fred Baas studied Sagittarius A, the H II region at the galactic center, at infrared wavelengths. They observed ionized neon gas swirling around the center at such velocities that the mass at the very center must be approximately equal to that of 3 million suns. Such a large mass in such a small space implied that the central object (the radio source Sagittarius A*) contains a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A* was one of the first black holes detected; its mass has been more accurately determined to be 4.3 million solar masses.\n\nTownes' last major technological creation was the Infrared Spatial Interferometer with Walt Fitelson, Ed Wishnow and others. The project combined three mobile infrared detectors aligned by lasers that study the same star. If each telescope is 10 meters from the other, it creates an impression of a 30-meter lens. Observations of Betelgeuse, a red giant in the shoulder of the constellation Orion, found that it is increasing and decreasing in size at the rate of 1% per year, 15% over 15 years. ISI produces extremely high angular and spatial resolution. The technology is also playing an important role in the search for extraterrestrial life in collaborations with Dan Werthimer of SETI.\n\nTownes married Frances H. Brown, an activist for the homeless, during 1941. They lived in Berkeley, California and had four daughters, Linda Rosenwein, Ellen Anderson, Carla Kessler, and Holly Townes.\n\nA religious man and a member of the United Church of Christ, Townes believed that \"science and religion [are] quite parallel, much more similar than most people think and that in the long run, they must converge\". He wrote in a statement after winning the Templeton Prize during 2005: \"Science tries to understand what our universe is like and how it works, including us humans. Religion is aimed at understanding the purpose and meaning of our universe, including our own lives. If the universe has a purpose or meaning, this must be reflected in its structure and functioning, and hence in science.\"\n\nTownes died at the age of 99 in Oakland, California, on January 27, 2015. \"He was one of the most important experimental physicists of the last century,\" Reinhard Genzel, a professor of physics at Berkeley, said of Townes. \"His strength was his curiosity and his unshakable optimism, based on his deep Christian spirituality.\"\n\nTownes' opinions concerning science and religion were expounded in his essays \"The Convergence of Science and Religion\", \"Logic and Uncertainties in Science and Religion\", and his book \"Making Waves\". Townes felt that the beauty of nature is \"obviously God-made\" and that God created the universe for humans to emerge and flourish. He prayed every day and ultimately felt that religion is more important than science because it addresses the most important long-range question: the meaning and purpose of our lives. Townes' belief in the convergence of science and religion is based on claimed similarities:\n\nTownes work was published widely in books and peer-reviewed journal articles, including:\n\nTownes was widely recognized for his scientific work and leadership.\n\n \n"}

His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism, but by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy agnosticism, he had become a believing but non-practicing Roman Catholic.\nFrom that time, Catholicism strongly influenced his works.\n\nPéguy was born to poverty in Orléans. His mother Cécile, widowed when he was an infant, mended chairs for a living. His father Désiré Péguy was a cabinet maker, who died in 1874 as a result of combat wounds. Péguy studied at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, winning a scholarship at the École normale supérieure (Paris), where he attended notably the lectures of Henri Bergson and Romain Rolland, whom he befriended. He formally left without graduating, in 1897, though he continued attending some lectures in 1898. Influenced by Lucien Herr, librarian of the \"École Normale Supérieure\", he became an ardent Dreyfusard.\n\nIn 1897, Péguy married Charlotte-Françoise Baudoin; they had one daughter and three sons, one of whom was born after Péguy's death. Around 1910 he fell deeply in love with Blanche Raphael, a young Jewish friend; however, he was faithful to his wife.\n\nFrom his earliest years, he was influenced by socialism. He joined the Socialist Party in 1895. From 1900 until his death in 1914, he was the main contributor to and the editor of the literary magazine \"Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine\", which at first supported the Socialist Party director Jean Jaurès. However, Péguy ultimately ended this support after he began viewing Jaurès as a traitor to the nation and to socialism. In the \"Cahiers\", Péguy published not only his own essays and poetry, but also works by important contemporary authors such as Romain Rolland.\n\nHis free-verse poem, \"Portico of the Mystery of the Second Virtue\", has gone through more than 60 editions in France. It was a favorite book of Charles de Gaulle.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out, Péguy became a lieutenant in the 19th company of the French 276th Infantry Regiment. He died in battle, shot in the forehead, near Villeroy, Seine-et-Marne on the day before the beginning of the Battle of the Marne. There is a memorial to Péguy near the field where he was killed.\n\nBenito Mussolini referred to Péguy as a \"source\" for Fascism; Péguy would likely have been horrified by this appropriation. During the Second World War both supporters and opponents of Vichy France cited Péguy. Edmond Michelet was the first of many members of the French Resistance to quote Péguy; de Gaulle, familiar with Péguy's writing, quoted him a 1942 speech. Those who opposed Vichy's anti-Semitism laws often cited him. By contrast, Robert Brasillach praised Péguy as a \"French National Socialist\", and Péguy's sons Pierre and Marcel wrote that their father was an inspiration for Vichy's National Revolution ideology and \"above all, a racist\".\n\nThe English novelist Graham Greene alluded to Péguy in \"Brighton Rock\", while \"The Heart of the Matter\" has as its epigraph a quotation from Péguy. In \"The Lawless Roads\" Greene refers to Péguy \"challenging God in the cause of the damned\".\n\nThe Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, in the course of describing the history of art as an ongoing, sometimes more and sometimes less successful approximation of God's creativeness, noted that Peguy's Eve was a \"theological redemption of the project of Proust\", meaning that where Proust was gifted with memory and charity, the Eve of Peguy – not necessarily Peguy himself – was gifted with memory, charity, and direct knowledge of the redemption of God. \n\nGeoffrey Hill published a poem in 1983 as a homage to Péguy, entitled \"The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Péguy\".\n\n\"The sinner is at the very heart of Christianity. Nobody is so competent as the sinner in matters of Christianity. Nobody, except the saint.\" This is the epigraph to Graham Greene's novel \"The Heart of the Matter\" (1951).\n\n\"It will never be known what acts of cowardice have been committed for fear of not looking sufficiently progressive.\" (\"Notre Patrie\", 1905)\n\n\"Tyranny is always better organised than freedom\".\n\n\"Kantian ethics has clean hands but, in a manner of speaking, actually no hands.\"\n\n\"How maddening, says God, it will be when there are no longer any Frenchmen.\"\n\n\"There will be things that I do that no one will be left to understand.\" (\"Le Mystère des saints Innocents\")\n\n\"It is impossible to write ancient history because we do not have enough sources, and impossible to write modern history because we have too many\".

Christian corporatism has been supported by the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants, Christian democrats, and others. Economic application of Christian corporatism has promoted consultations between employers and workers and has sponsored Christian trade unionism.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church sponsored the creation of various institutions including brotherhoods, monasteries, religious orders, and military associations, especially during the Crusades to sponsor connection between these groups.\n\nIn 1881, Pope Leo XIII commissioned theologians and social thinkers to study corporatism and provide a definition for it. In 1884 in Freiburg, the commission declared that corporatism was a \"system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Freiburg meeting, corporatism grew in popularity and the \"corporatist internationale\" was formed in 1890 followed by the publishing of \"Rerum novarum\" (1891) by the Roman Catholic Church that for the first time declared the Church's blessing to trade unions and called for organized labour to be recognized by politicians. Many corporatist unions in Europe were backed by the Roman Catholic Church to challenge the rise of anarchist, Marxist and other radical unions, with the corporatist unions being fairly conservative in comparison to their radical rivals.\n\nOn the fortieth anniversary of the publishing of \"Rerum novarum\", Pope Pius XI in \"Quadragesimo anno\" (1931) advocated Christian corporatism as an alternative to capitalist individualism and socialist totalitarianism whereby people would be organized into workers' guilds or vocational groups that would cooperate under the supervision of a neutral state.\n\nIn response to the rise in popularity of Roman Catholic corporatism in the 1890s, Protestant corporatism arose, especially in Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. However, Protestant corporatism has been far less successful in being supported by governments than its Roman Catholic counterpart.\n\n"}

These either were not prophecies (the verses make no claim of predicting anything) or the verses do not explicitly refer to the Messiah.\n\nReferences to \"most holy\", \"anointed\" (\"Messiah\") and \"prince\" have been interpreted as speaking of Jesus, and the phrase \"anointed shall be cut off\" as pointing to his crucifixion, the \"people of the prince who is to come\" being taken to refer to the Romans who destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 AD.\n\nIn the Gospel of Mark, Jesus refers to the \"abomination of desolation\" (, \"NASB\") and the Gospel of Matthew adds a direct reference to this as being from the Book of Daniel, \"Therefore when you see the which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet…\" (, \"NASB\").\n\nThe general scholarly view is that the author of Daniel is writing a contemporaneous account of the Maccabean Revolt c. 167 BCE and the \"cutting off of an anointed one\" (9:26)— refers to the murder of the high priest Onias III; the \"abomination that causes desolation\" refers to Antiochus IV erecting a statue of Zeus in the Temple, the final straw breaking the uneasy coexistence of the traditionalist Jews and the more Hellenized Jews.\n\n is one of the earliest prophecies which speaks of a prophet who would be raised up from among the Jewish nation.\n\nIn , Peter claimed that Jesus was the fulfillment of this promise.\n\nEzekiel 37:24 refers a person coming from the House of David as the servant of God, unique Shepherd of Israel, which will rule over the House of Judah (v. 16) and over the Tribe of Joseph (v. 17) so that he will \"make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand\" (v. 19), in a unique nation of Israel. \n\nVerses from to 15 to 24 can't be referred to King David, since the united monarchy of Israel was divided in two reigns \"after\" the death of his son Solomon (999-931 BCE), son of David. Furthermore, Ezekiel (622-570) wrote in the seventh century BCE, four century after this subject of the biblical narration, nevertheless adopting a prophecy that is by its nature usually referred to future happenings. Therefore, as the \"stick of Judah\" stands for the House of Judah, and the \"stick of Joseph\" stands for his tribe (verse 19), the expression \"David my servant shall be king over them\" (verse 24) may be read as a prophecy about a person of the House of David, which would have ruled over one nation in one land, gathered upon the mountains of Israel on evey side of the earth.\n\nThe narration continues as follows: \nThe \"dwelling place\" (Hebrew \"mishkan\") recalls the wilderness tabernacle. The Sanctuary (Hebrew \"miqdash\") points rather to the Temple, in particular the renewed Temple, which will occupy Ezekiel's attention in the last ch.s of 40-48.\n\nChristianity believes that Ezekiel's Temple is more glorious than the Tabernacle of Moses (Exodus 25-40) and the Temple of Solomon (1 Kings 5-8), pointing forward to several beliefs:\n\nJudaism holds that the Messiah has not yet arrived namely because of the belief that the Messianic Age has not started yet. Jews believe that the Messiah will completely change life on earth and that pain and suffering will be conquered, thus initiating the Kingdom of God and the Messianic Age on earth. Christian belief varies, with one segment holding that the Kingdom of God is not worldly at all, while another believe that the Kingdom is both spiritual and will be of this world in a Messianic Age where Jesus will rule on the throne of David. Most Jews hold that the Kingdom of God will be on earth and the Messiah will occupy the throne of David. Christians (in particular Evangelicals) who believe that it is both/and claim that it is spiritual and within right now, and physical and outward at the return of the Messiah.\n\nWhile Christians have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.\n\nThe Second Temple was to be filled with the glory of God and its glory would be superior to Solomon's temple despite the missing artifacts and the absence of sacred fire (God initially lighting up the altar Himself).\n\nFor some Christians, this prophecy is believed to be fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth being present and teaching in Herod's renovated Temple and peace being granted by God for mankind in that place through the tearing of the veil of the Holy of Holies upon Christ's death. Furthermore, it is asserted that if Haggai's prophecy is to be held as true, it must have been accomplished before 70 AD since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple at that time.\n\nOn the other hand, many scholars, including evangelical Christians, understand the prophecy as being in reference to the physical splendor of the Temple (as implied by the context) and/or apply it to the yet future Third Temple.\n\nIn its original context, this text from Hosea referred to the deliverance of the people of Israel from bondage in Egypt. The Gospel of Matthew applies it to the return from Egypt of Jesus and his family as a messianic prophecy. \"An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ‘Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him.’ And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, ‘Out of Egypt have I called my son’\" (Matthew 2: 13-15). Conservative scholars argue that this passage fits into the context of Hosea 11.\n\nIn Isaiah 7:14 the prophet Isaiah, addressing king Ahaz of Judah, promises the king that God will destroy his enemies; as a sign that his oracle is a true one, Isaiah predicts that a \"young woman\" or \"virgin\" (\"almah\") will shortly give birth to a child whose name will be Immanuel, \"God is with us\", and that the threat from the enemy kings will be ended before the child grows up. The almah has been identified as either the mother of Hezekiah or a daughter of Isaiah, although there are problems with both candidates.\n\nThe gospel of Matthew presents Jesus's ministry as largely the fulfilment of prophecies from Isaiah. In the time of Jesus, however, the Jews of Palestine no longer spoke Hebrew, and Isaiah had to be translated into Greek and Aramaic, the two commonly used languages. In the original Hebrew of Isaiah 7:14 the word almah meant a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, and the Greek translation rendered almah as \"parthenos\", the Greek word for \"virgin\". Scholars agree that \"almah\" has nothing to do with virginity, but many conservative American Christians still judge the acceptability of new bible translations by the way they deal with Isaiah 7:14. The virgin birth is found only in the gospels of Matthew and Luke; there is no reference to the birth of Jesus in Mark's gospel or the Gospel of John, nor in the epistles of Paul, who says that Jesus was \"born of a woman\" without mentioning that the woman was a virgin.\n\n1 Peter 2:8 interprets the stone as Christ, quoting Isaiah 8:14 along with Psalm 118:22 and Isaiah 28:16 which mention a stone and a cornerstone.\n\nAccording to both Jewish and Christian interpretation, the prophet Isaiah was commanded to inform the people of Israel in a prophecy that Sennacherib's plunder of the Ten Tribes was at hand, and that Nebuchadnezzar's spoil of Jerusalem, in later years, was coming nearer.\n\nAfter this prophetic address to the people of Israel, Isaiah interrupts his prophecy and speaks to God. According to Jewish tradition, the salvation of which he speaks is the miraculous end of Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem (see Isaiah 36 and 37) in the days of the \"Prince of Peace\", King Hezekiah, a child of King Ahaz.\n\nOpposing this idea is Rashi himself who discovers that Hezekiah was already born at the time of the prophecy so this would invalidate him as the child to be born in the future. \nConcerning Isa 7:14 you may find the following quote interesting -\n\"RASHI also came to the conclusion that the Immanuel prophecy could not refer to Hezekiah, because ‘if you count up the years of Hezekiah you will find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father [Ahaz] ascended the throne.’ Hence, Hezekiah was born nine years before the prophecy was given, and yet the prophet says: ‘Behold the virgin shall (future tense) conceive...’ \" (Rachmiel Frydland, What the Rabbis Know About the Messiah- A Study of Genealogy and Prophecy [Cincinnati Ohio; Messianic Publishing Co., 1993] P40)\n\nThe interpretation of by the Gospel author of Matthew has led Christian authors to hint at its messianic applications. \n\nMatthew refers to this, since Jesus began his one to three years of ministry in Galilee:\n\nIn Isaiah, this prophecy describes how Assyrian invaders from the east are increasingly aggressive as they progress westwards toward the sea, the coastline of the levante, while Matthew 4:14-16 has re-interpreted the description as a prophecy stating that Jesus, the new Prince of Peace, would progress (without any hint of becoming more aggressive) toward Galilee. While Matthew loosely plagiarizes a Greek Septuagint interpretation of scripture (Isaiah 8:23-9:1-2), in the Masoretic text it reads totally different and refers to the 'region of the nations'.\n\nSome Christians believe that this verse refers to the birth of Jesus as the Messiah. The verse reads in Christian bible versions:\nIn Jewish translations of the Hebrew Bible the verse reads differently and the verse numbering is different (9:6 in the Christian Old Testament is numbered 9:5 in Hebrew Bible versions):\nBut newer Jewish versions do not translate the verse this way and the changing of the order of the words is problematic in the newer translations . For example:\n\nIsa 9:6 (9:5) For a child is born unto us, a son hath been given unto us, and the government is placed on his shoulders; and his name is called, Wonderful, counsellor of the mighty God, of the everlasting Father, the prince of peace, (Lesser)\n\nIsa 9:6 (9:5) For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele- joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom; (JPS 1917)\n\nThis long name is the throne name of the royal child. Semitic names often consist of sentences that describe God; thus the name Isaiah in Hebrew means \"Yahweh saves\"; Hezekiah, \"Yahweh strengthens\"; in Akkadian, the name of the Babylonian king M'rodakh-Bal'adan (39:1) means \"Marduk has provided an heir.\" These names do not describe that person who holds them but the god whom the parents worship.\n\nThis verse is expressly applied to the Messiah in the Targum, i.e. Aramaic commentary on the Hebrew Bible.\n\nSome commentators view this as an unfulfilled prophecy, arguing that the Jewish people have not all been gathered in Israel. Some Christians refer to the foundation of the State of Israel as fulfillment of this prophecy. Others argue that the fulfillment is that Jesus as Messiah brings all nations to himself (cf. 11:10 \"Nations will seek his counsel / And his abode will be honored.\") citing John 12:32 (\"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.\") and Paul in Romans 15:12 when he quotes Isaiah 11:10, emphasizing the inclusion of the gentiles into the people of God.\n\nSome Christians also believe that Isaiah 2:2 is to be understood in connection with Isaiah 11:10,12.\nSome Christians believe that Jesus the Messiah is the ultimate \"house\" or dwelling place of God, as is told in John 1:14 (\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory\") and 2:19-21 (\"Jesus answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" The Jews then said, \"It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?\" But he was speaking about the temple of his body.\"). Through him the messianic community becomes a temple in 1 Corinthians 3:16 (\"Do you not know that you all are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?\"') and Ephesians 2:20-22 (\"...built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, the Messiah Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.\"). It is through the Messiah's exaltation all nations are drawn to him, as in Luke 24:47 (\"...and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.\").\n\n1 Peter 2:8 interprets the stone mentioned as Christ, quoting Isaiah 28:16 along with Psalm 118:22 and Isaiah 8:14 which mention a stone of stumbling and a cornerstone.\n\nIsaiah 53 is probably the most famous example claimed by Christians to be a messianic prophecy fulfilled by Jesus. It speaks of one known as the \"suffering servant,\" who suffers because of the sins of others. Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy through his death on the cross. The following verse from Isaiah 53:5 is understood by many Christians to speak of Jesus as the Messiah:\n\nModern Jewish scholars, like Rabbi Tovia Singer as well as Rashi (1040–1105) and Origen (184/185 – 253/254 CE), view the 'suffering servant' as a reference to the whole Jewish people, regarded as one individual, and more specifically to the Jewish people deported to Babylon. However, in aggadic midrash on the books of Samuel, a compendium of rabbinic folklore, historical anecdotes and moral exhortations, is messianically interpreted.\n\nOne of the first claims in the New Testament that Isaiah 53 is a prophecy of Jesus comes from the Book of Acts chapter 8 verses 26-36, which describes a scene in which God commands Philip the Apostle to approach an Ethiopian eunuch who is sitting in a chariot, reading aloud to himself from the Book of Isaiah. The eunuch comments that he does not understand what he is reading (Isaiah 53) and Philip explains to him that the passage refers to Jesus: \"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.\"\n\nThe (suffering) \"Servant\", as referring to the Jewish people, suffering from the cruelties of the nations, is a theme in the Servant songs and is mentioned in , , , , and .\n\nMatthew 2:17-18 gives the killing of innocents by Herod as the fulfillment of a prophecy spoken of in Jeremiah:\nIn Jeremiah 31:15, the phrase \"because her children are no more\" refers to the captivity of Rachel's children in Assyria. The subsequent verses describe their return to Israel.\n\nA verse near the end of Micah's prophecy on the Babylonian captivity has been interpreted by Christian apologists as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.\n\nThe verse describes the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife, Ephrathah. (1 Chr. 2:18, 2:50-52, 4:4) Bethlehem Ephrathah is the town and clan from which king David was born, and this passage refers to the future birth of a new Davidic heir.\n\nAlthough the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke give different accounts of the birth of Jesus, both place the birth in Bethlehem. The Gospel of Matthew describes Herod the Great as asking the chief priests and scribes of Jerusalem where the Messiah was to be born. They respond by quoting Micah, \"In Beit-Lechem of Y'hudah,\" they replied, \"because the prophet wrote, 'And you, Beit-Lechem in the land of Y'hudah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Y'hudah; for from you will come a Ruler who will shepherd my people Isra'el.'\" ()\n\nThe idea that Bethlehem was to be the birthplace of the Messiah appears in no Jewish source before the 4th century CE. Jewish tradition appears to have emphasised the idea that the birthplace of the Messiah was not known.\n\nMany modern scholars consider the birth stories as inventions by the Gospel writers, created to glorify Jesus and present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. However, since the birth in Bethlehem is one of the few common elements in the Gospel accounts, some scholars believe that both writers were drawing on an existing Christian tradition.\n\nSome portions of the Psalms are considered prophetic in Judaism, even though they are listed among the Ketuvim (Writings) and not the Nevi'im (Prophets).\n\nThe words Messiah and Christ mean \"anointed one\". In ancient times Jewish leaders were anointed with olive oil when they assumed their position (e.g. David, Saul, Isaac, Jacob). And \"Messiah\" is used as a name for kings in the Hebrew Bible: in David finds King Saul's killer and asks, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\"\n\nIn many Psalms, whose authorship are traditionally ascribed to King David (i.e. \"Messiah\" David), the author writes about his life in third person, referring to himself as \"the/God's/your messiah\" while clearly discussing his military exploits. Thus it can be argued that many of the portions that are asserted to be prophetic Psalms may not be. Psalm 2, spoken of below, can be argued to be about David and not Jesus. says \"I have installed [past tense] my King on Zion, my holy hill [Jerusalem, David's capital that he captured in battle in 1 Samuel].\" says, \"I [David, the author] will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me [David, the person to whom God was speaking], 'You [David] are my Son; today I have become your [adopted] Father.'\" If the passage was speaking about a begotten son then that person would have been born the son of that father; he wouldn't have to become it at some later point after birth. (Throughout the Bible it is common to call saints and angels the sons or children of God.)\n\n\"Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain? 2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his Anointed, saying, 3. 'Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us.' 4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision. 5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 6. 'I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.\" 7. I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, 'You are my son, today I have begotten you. 8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 9. You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel'\" (Psalm 2: 1-9).\n\nThe authors of Acts and the Epistle to the Hebrews interpreted it as relating to Jesus.\n\nVerse 2. \"Anointed\" – in Hebrew \"mashiah\", \"anointed\"; in Greek \"christos\", referring to a ruler anointed by God and not a particular person.\nVerse 7. The LORD is the messiah’s father. In Judaism the phrase \"Son of God\" has very different connotations than in Christianity, not referring to literal descent but to the righteous who have become conscious of God's father of mankind.\n\nChristians cite Herod and Pontius Pilate setting themselves against Jesus as evidence that Psalm 2 refers to him. \nActs 13: 33 interprets Jesus’ rising from the dead as confirmation of verse 7 (\"You are my son, today I have begotten you\").\n\nHebrews 1: 5 employs verse 7 in order to argue that Jesus is superior to the angels, i.e., Jesus is superior as a mediator between God and man. \"For to what angel did God ever say, \"Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee\"?\" However, the phrase \"son of God\" appears in the Hebrew Bible to describe others than the coming Messiah, including David and Jacob.\n\nTexts vary in the exact wording of the phrase beginning Psalm 2:12, with \"kiss his foot\", and \"kiss the Son\" being most common in various languages for centuries, though not in original Hebrew Manuscripts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nThe interpretation of Psalm 16 as a messanic prophecy is common among Christian evangelical hermeneutics.\n\"I bless the Lord who has given me understanding, because even in the night, my heart warns me. I keep the Lord always within my sight; for he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. For this reason my heart is glad and my soul rejoices; moreover, my body also will rest secure, for thou wilt not leave my soul in the abode of the dead, nor permit thy holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life, the fullness of joys in thy presence, and delights at thy right hand forever\" (verses 7-11).\n\nAccording to the preaching of Peter, this prophecy is about the messiah’s triumph over death, i.e., the resurrection of Jesus.\n\n\"God raised Jesus up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken… For thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let thy Holy One see corruption… Thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence.’ Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and we are all witnesses of it\" (Acts 2: 24-32).\n\nAlso of note is what Paul said in the synagogue at Antioch. \"And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke in this way, ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’ Therefore, he also says in another psalm, ‘Thou wilt not let thy Holy One see corruption.’ For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and saw corruption; but he whom God raised up saw no corruption\" (Acts 13: 34-37).\n\nTwo of the Gospels ( and ) quote Jesus as speaking these words from the cross;\n\nThe other two canonical Gospels give different accounts of the words of Jesus. Luke 23:46 quotes Psalm 31:5 (\"Into your hands I commit my spirit\") while John has Jesus say \"It is finished\" (John 19:30). Some scholars see this as evidence that the words of Jesus were not part of a pre-Gospel Passion narrative, but were added later by the Gospel writers.\n\nIn most Hebrew manuscripts, such as the Masoretic, Psalm 22:16 (verse 17 in the Hebrew verse numbering) reads כארי ידי ורגלי (\"like a lion my hands and my feet\"). Many Modern English translations render this as \"they have pierced my hands and my feet\", starting with the Coverdale Bible which translated Luther's \"durchgraben\" (dig through, penetrate) as \"pearsed\", with durchgraben being a variation of the Septuagint's ωρυξαν \"dug\". This translation is highly controversial. It is asserted in Christian apologetics that the Dead Sea Scrolls lend weight to the translation as \"They have pierced my hands and my feet\", by lengthening the yud in the Hebrew word כארי (like a lion) into a vav כארו \"Kaaru\", which is not a word in the Hebrew language but when the aleph is omitted becomes כרו, dig, similar to the Septaguint translation. However this view is contested considering the Nahal Hever scribe's other numerous misspellings, such as one in the very same sentence, where ידיה is written instead of the correct ידי, making the Hebrew word ידי yadai \"hands\" into ידיה yadehah, \"her hands\". Christian apologists argue that this passage refers to Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nRay Pritchard has described Psalm 34:20 as a messianic prophecy. In its account of the crucifixion of Jesus, the Gospel of John interprets it as a prophecy () and presents some of the details as fulfillment.\n\nChristians believe that this verse refers to Jesus' time on the cross in which he was given a sponge soaked in vinegar to drink, as seen in Matthew 27:34, Mark 15:23, and John 19:29.\n\nChristian authors have interpreted Psalm 110 as a messianic passage in light of several New Testament passages. They argue that this refers to Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n\"A psalm of David.\n\n1. The Lord says to my lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.’ \n2. The Lord sends forth from Zion your mighty sceptre: ‘Rule in the midst of your foes! \n3. With you is sovereignty in the splendor of holiness on the day of your birth: before the morning star, like the dew, I have begotten you.’ \n4. The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.’ \n5. The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath. \n6. He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will crush heads over the wide earth. \n7. He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head.\"\n\nVerse 1. God speaks to David. The first instance of \"The LORD (Hebrew: YHWH)\" in this verse is a translation of the Hebrew name of God, Yahweh. The second instance of \"my lord (Hebrew: ADONI)\" is David, from the viewpoint of the Psalmist. The opening phrase of Psalm 110 is literally translated as \"Regarding David, a psalm,\" indicating that the psalm is \"of\" or \"about\" King David, not written by him. The same introduction (τω δαυιδ ψαλμος) is used in the LXX version of Psalm 110 (which is Psalm 109 in the Greek text).\n\nIn the New Testament, the gospel writers leave out the portion \"regarding David, a psalm\" and reinterprets the remaining out of context verse as a messianic prophecy: \"while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, ‘What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?’ They said to him, ‘The son of David.’ He said to them, ‘How is it then that David in the Spirit calls him Lord, saying, \"The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, till I put thy enemies under thy feet\"? If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?’ And no one was able to answer him a word\" (Matthew 22: 41-46). The remaining portion of this verse speaks of how David shall be seated at God's right hand, with his enemies thoroughly defeated. Although Hebrew has no capital letters, the Hebrew translation of that passage reads \"The Lord said to my \"lord\"\" indicating that it is not speaking of God.\n\n\"A royal psalm(see Ps.2 intro). It is quite difficult because v.3 is totally obscure, and the psalm speakers often. In Christian interpretation, it is understood as a reference to Jesus, as a messianic and sometimes eschatological psalm; Radak polemicizes against this view\"\n1. Here God is speaking to the king, called my \"lord\"; Perhaps these are the words spoken by a prophet. The king is very proximate to God, in a position of privilege, imagined as being on His \"right hand\" in the Divine Council. The second-in-command was seated to the right of the king in the ancient Near East. Such images are rare in psalms, but see Ps45:7. If the king trods on the back of his enemies (see Josh. 10:24), they poetically become his \"Footstool\" 2. In contrast to v.1, God is spoken of in the third person. The Zion tradition (see Isa. 2:1-4; 60:1-22) and royal tradition are here connected. While v.1-2 express the great power of the king, they also emphasize it comes from God\" (YHWH).\n\nHebrews 1:5 quotes this verse as, \"I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.\". However, the verse doesn’t end with the phrase quoted in the New Testament, but continues: \"When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.\" Christians see Jesus as taking on the sins of all humanity. Therefore, Jesus \"did wrong\" by accepting the sins of the world. The Old Testament verse is referring to Solomon. Given the reference to Solomon, Christians argue, Solomon is thus seen as prophetically typifying Jesus.\n\nThe Wisdom of Solomon is one of the Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament. The Deuterocanonical books are considered canonical by Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox, but are considered non-canonical by Jews and Protestants.\n\n<poem>Let us lie in wait for the righteous man,\nbecause he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions;\nhe reproaches us for sins against the law,\nand accuses us of sins against our training.\nHe professes to have knowledge of God,\nand calls himself a child of the Lord.\nHe became to us a reproof of our thoughts;\nthe very sight of him is a burden to us,\nbecause his manner of life is unlike that of others,\nand his ways are strange.\nWe are considered by him as something base,\nand he avoids our ways as unclean;\nhe calls the last end of the righteous happy,\nand boasts that God is his father.\nLet us see if his words are true,\nand let us test what will happen at the end of his life;\nfor if the righteous man is God’s son, he will help him,\nand will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.\nLet us test him with insult and torture,\nthat we may find out how gentle he is,\nand make trial of his forbearance.\nLet us condemn him to a shameful death,\nfor, according to what he says, he will be protected.\"–</poem>\n\nChristian authors have interpreted Zechariah 9:9 as a prophecy of an act of messianic self-humiliation.\n\nThe Gospel of John links this verse to the account of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem: \"took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, \"Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel.\" Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written, \"FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY’S COLT.\" \" \n\nThe Synoptic Gospels make clear that Jesus arranged this event, thus consciously fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew describes Jesus' triumphant entry on Palm Sunday as a fulfillment of this verse in Zechariah. Matthew describes the prophecy in terms of a colt and a separate donkey, whereas the original only mentions the colt; the reference in Zechariah is a Jewish parallelism referring only to a single animal, and the gospels of Mark, Luke, and John state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal. Several explanations have been suggested, such as that Matthew misread the original, the existence of the foal is implied, or he wanted to create a deliberate echo of a reference in 2 Samuel 16:1-4, where there are two asses for David's household to ride on.\n\nIn the most ancient Jewish writings Zechariah 9:9 is applied to the Messiah. According to the Talmud, so firm was the belief in the ass on which the Messiah is to ride that \"if anyone saw an ass in his dream, he will see salvation\". The verse is also Messianically quoted in Sanh. 98 a, in Pirqé de R. Eliez. c. 31, and in several of the Midrashim.\n\nZechariah 12:10 is another verse commonly cited by Christian authors as a messianic prophecy fulfilled by Jesus.\n\nIn some of the most ancient Jewish writings, Zechariah 12:10 is applied to the Messiah ben Joseph in the Talmud, and so is verse 12 (\"The land will wail, each family by itself: The family of the House of David by themselves, and their women by themselves; the family of the House of Nathan by themselves, and their women by themselves\"), there being, however, a difference of opinion whether the mourning is caused by the death of the Messiah ben Joseph, or else on account of the evil concupiscence (\"Yetzer hara\").\n\nThe Gospel of John makes reference to this prophecy when referring to the crucifixion of Jesus, as can be seen in the following account: \"So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him; but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, \"NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN.\" And again another Scripture says, \"THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED.\" \" \n\nAmong Christian believers, opinion varies as to which Old Testament passages are messianic prophecies and which are not, and whether the prophecies they claim to have been fulfilled are intended to be prophecies. The authors of these Old Testament \"prophecies\" often appear to be describing events that had already occurred. For example, the New Testament verse states, \"So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'\" This is referring to the Old Testament verse Hosea 11:1. However, that passage reads, \"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.\" Skeptics say that the Hosea passage clearly is talking about a historical event and therefore the passage clearly is not a prophecy.\n\nAccording to modern scholarship, the suffering servant described in Isaiah chapter 53 is actually the Jewish people. According to some, the rabbinic response, e.g., Rashi and Maimonides, is that although the suffering servant passage clearly is prophetic and even if Psalm 22 is prophetic, the Messiah has not come yet, therefore, the passages could not possibly be talking about Jesus. As noted above, there is some controversy about the phrase \"they have pierced my hands and my feet\".\n\nFor modern Bible scholars, either the verses make no claim of predicting future events, or the verses make no claim of speaking about the Messiah.\n\nDifferent explanations are offered for why these types of passages should be considered prophecies, depending on the particular passage.\n\nJewish interpretive techniques often look for a \"hint\" at a deeper meaning; this \"hint\" is known as \"remez\" in Hebrew. Because the New Testament writers were fluent in biblical Hebrew, sometimes they are using a play on Hebrew words in the original Tanakh that is not obvious to Greek scholars and translators or to English-speaking readers. One example is Matthew saying at \"and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: 'He will be called a Nazarene.'\" The words \"Nazareth\" and \"Nazarene\" do not occur in the Old Testament. Juster opines that Matthew is hinting at two Hebrew words: the root \"n-z-r\", meaning \"branch\", and \"Nazarite\".\n\nAnother possible explanation offered is that such a prophecy once existed in the biblical texts but was lost. This theory is supported by the fact that such a verse exists in a copy of Samuel found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\n\n\nJewish analysis\n\nEvangelical Christian analysis\n\nSkeptical and Critical analysis\n"}
{"id": "1751707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1751707", "title": "Christian views on cloning", "text": "Christian views on cloning\n\nIn the debate on the morality of human cloning, Christians take multiple positions. Since Dolly the sheep was successfully cloned on 5 July 1996, and the possibility of cloning humans became a reality, Christian leaders have been pressed to take an ethical stance on its morality. While many Christians tend to disagree with the practice, such as Roman Catholics and a majority of fundamentalist pastors, including Southern Baptists, the views taken by various other Christian denominations are diverse and often conflicting. It is hard to pinpoint any one, definite stance of the Christian religion, since there are so many Christian denominations and so few official statements from each of them concerning the morality of human cloning.\n\nThere are certain Protestant denominations that do not disagree with the acceptability of human cloning. Mary Seller, for example, a member of the Church of England's Board of Social Responsibility and a professor of developmental genetics, states, \"Cloning, like all science, must be used responsibly. Cloning humans is not desirable. But cloning sheep has its uses.\" On the other hand, according to a survey of Christian fundamentalist pastors, responses indicated a \"common account of human cloning as primarily reproductive in nature, proscribed by its violation of God's will and role.\" Many of these pastors acknowledged the reason for this violation being rooted in the religiously motivated view that human cloning is an example of scientists 'playing God.'\" It is not only this that many Christians are concerned about, however; other concerns include whether the dignity of the human person is overlooked, as well as the role of the parents as co-creators. All of these things may contribute to why many fundamentalist Christian pastors see human reproductive cloning as simply \"forbidden territory.\"\n\nSome scientists do argue that the puberty of views comes from the differing understandings of what exactly human cloning is. In Weasel and Jensen's survey on \"Language and Values,\" they found that Christian pastors used a \"consistent emphasis on DNA.\" Scientists describing the same processes used terminology such as, \"insert an isolated nucleus from the donor to produce a dividing and viable embryo\" into an enulceated egg\" One reason why Christian fundamentalist pastors would be more apt to use terminology which includes \"DNA\" more prominently is that DNA is a \"value-laden\" term which carries religious significance. Therefore, not only is DNA often equated, in religious circles, with one's genetic identity, but also with one's singular, \"God-given\" identity.\n\nAnother point of misunderstanding arises in the separation of human reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. While most Christians do not support reproductive cloning, therapeutic cloning is a branch of cloning which has garnered slightly more support from certain denominations. Some Christian traditions, such as the United Church of Christ, believe that cloning can be conducted ethically for this purpose, in order to help treat disease and improve the public health, as they do not see the fertilized ovum as constituting a person. Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, \"Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning. The main reason, she says, is the tradition of emphasizing the individual choice over central dogma.\n\nCatholic support for therapeutic cloning is conditional on the stipulation that it does not involve any kind of infringement upon human embryos. John Paul II states, \"These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.\" Thus, according to the Catholic ethical system, even a good that might come from therapeutic cloning would be morally unacceptable, as it would be the result of an act which, according to Catholics, is itself intrinsically immoral. This, for many Christians, is hard to abide by, for, as one Professor of Christian Ethics states, \"our society is preoccupied with death and the pursuit of health seems to justify anything.\"\n\nThe Church of England put out a statement on the Church's website which reads, \"human reproductive cloning was made unlawful by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Few members of the Church of England would dissent from such a position. However, therapeutic cloning may be thought of as ethical, as it does not result in another human being.\" Thus, while reproductive cloning is again discouraged, therapeutic cloning is more acceptable.\n\nIn a statement given by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, on the other hand, therapeutic cloning was rejected as \"contrary to the Word of God and our 1998 resolution.\". For this particular group, therapeutic cloning is assumed to involve the destruction of human embryos, and is therefore against the Synod's resolution to \"reaffirm and celebrate life,\" and \"protect the sanctity of human life.\"\n\nChristian organizations are challenged to respond to a number of concerns about the issue of the dignity of the human person, especially in relation to scientific study. Much of the debate has to do with the question of at what point the soul enters the body. Catholics believe that the soul enters the body at the moment of conception when the sperm and egg unite. Thus, Catholics and other Christian denominations that share this belief may see embryonic cloning as tantamount to live human experimentation and therefore contrary to God's will.\n\nMost Christians believe that a person has intrinsic dignity based on his being created in the image and likeness of God and in his call to communion with God. This brings the question of the morality of human cloning into a realm beyond that of science, and into that of religion, as this dignity cannot be empirically proven.\n\nMany Christians that do not agree on an exact definition of \"dignity,\" which leads some scientists to ignore this concern, seeing it as a vague excuse that some Christians use to justify cloning bans Or, if a definition is agreed upon, it may be challenged as being too weak, so that, according to Steven Pinker, a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, it is \"hardly up to the heavyweight moral demands assigned to it.\"\n\nThe belief in intrinsic dignity, nonetheless, leads the Christians who hold this belief to also argue that if the soul enters the body at the moment when the sperm and the egg unite, producing cloned zygotes that are unlikely to survive is equivalent to murder. Therefore, if one believes, as Catholics do, that the zygotes have souls and are therefore human, in the words of John Paul II, \"regardless of the objective for which it was done, human embryonic cloning conflicts with the international legal norms that protect human dignity.\" Some Christian conservatives even express concern that cloned embryos would have no soul, since it is, in their view, born outside of God's parameters, as its creation is in a laboratory setting rather than natural conception.\n\nCertain Christians also hold that, in the act of creating a human being, his or her dignity is also upheld by the presence of a loving union between the two partners, so that \"only when love exists should the creation of other persons be envisaged.\" Because of this, \"divine creation and co-creation are similar.\" In the act of scientific cloning, however, the embryo is a result of the artificial union of the sperm and the egg, so that \"the presence of love between the co-creators does not exist.\" Thus, according to this view, the dignity of the person is not upheld. Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, states, \"As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.\"\n\nMuch of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order. Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God. Not only this, but some Christian ethicists argue that human cloning would \"create substantial issues of identity and individuality.\" This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc.\n\nDespite the ethical gray area surrounding the act of cloning itself, most, if not all Christians, still hold that children who may result from the process should be loved and cared for as much as any other child, since they would be considered fully human and therefore reflect the Divine image, as defined by \"Gaudium et spes\", a document of the Second Vatican Council. However, according to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It \"would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process.\"According to Stephen G. Post, a Catholic journalist, \"[removal] of the male impregnators from the procreative dyad would simply drive the nail into the coffin of fatherhood, unless one thinks that biological and social fatherhood are utterly disconnected.\"\n\nRev.

{"id": "700777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700777", "title": "Council of Jerusalem", "text": "Council of Jerusalem\n\nThe Council of Jerusalem or Apostolic Council was held in Jerusalem around AD 50. It is unique among the ancient pre-ecumenical councils in that it is considered by Catholics and Orthodox to be a prototype and forerunner of the later ecumenical councils and a key part of Christian ethics. The council decided that Gentile converts to Christianity were not obligated to keep most of the Law of Moses, including the rules concerning circumcision of males. The Council did, however, retain the prohibitions on eating blood, meat containing blood, and meat of animals not properly slain, and on fornication and idolatry, sometimes referred to as the Apostolic Decree or Jerusalem Quadrilateral.\n\nAccounts of the council are found in Acts of the Apostles chapter 15 (in two different forms, the Alexandrian and Western versions) and also possibly in Paul's letter to the Galatians chapter 2. Some scholars dispute that Galatians 2 is about the Council of Jerusalem (notably because Galatians 2 describes a private meeting) while other scholars dispute the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nThe Council of Jerusalem is generally dated to 48 AD, roughly 15 to 25 years after the crucifixion of Jesus, between 26 and 36 AD. Acts 15 and Galatians 2 both suggest that the meeting was called to debate whether or not male Gentiles who were converting to become followers of Jesus were required to become circumcised; circumcision was considered repulsive during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nAt the time, most followers of Jesus (which historians refer to as Jewish Christians) were Jewish by birth and even converts would have considered the early Christians as a part of Judaism. According to Alister McGrath, the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of the then contemporary Second Temple Judaism with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were circumcised, they could not be God's People. The meeting was called to decide whether circumcision for gentile converts was requisite for community membership since certain individuals were teaching that you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved\".\n\nCircumcision as a mandate was associated with Abraham (see also Abrahamic covenant), but it is cited as \"the custom of Moses\" because Moses is considered the traditional giver of the Law as a whole. The circumcision mandate was made more official and binding in the Mosaic Law Covenant. In the words of Jesus are reported to be that Moses gave the people circumcision.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting, according to Acts, was to resolve a disagreement in Antioch, which had wider implications than just circumcision, since circumcision is the \"everlasting\" sign of the Abrahamic Covenant (). Some of the Pharisees who had become believers insisted that it was \"needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses\" (KJV).\n\nThe primary issue which was addressed related to the requirement of circumcision, as the author of Acts relates, but other important matters arose as well, as the Apostolic Decree indicates. The dispute was between those, such as the followers of the \"Pillars of the Church\", led by James, who believed, following his interpretation of the Great Commission, that the church must observe the Torah, i.e. the rules of traditional Judaism, and Paul the Apostle, who believed there was no such necessity. (See also Supersessionism, New Covenant, Antinomianism, Hellenistic Judaism, Paul the Apostle and Judaism.)\n\nAt the Council, following advice offered by Simon Peter ( and ), Barnabas and Paul gave an account of their ministry among the gentiles (), and the apostle James quoted from the words of the prophet Amos (, quoting ). James added his own words to the quotation: \"Known to God from eternity are all His works\" and then submitted a proposal, which was accepted by the Church and became known as the Apostolic Decree:\n\nThe Western version of Acts (see Acts of the Apostles: Manuscripts) adds the negative form of the Golden Rule (\"and whatever things ye would not have done to yourselves, do not do to another\").\n\nThis determined questions wider than that of circumcision, particularly dietary questions, but also fornication and idolatry and blood, and also the application of Biblical law to non-Jews. It was stated by the Apostles and Elders in the Council: \"the Holy Spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper.\" (Acts 15:27–28) And this Apostolic Decree was considered binding on all the other local Christian congregations in other regions. See also Biblical law directed at non-Jews, Seven Laws of Noah, Biblical law in Christianity, and the Ten Commandments in Christianity.\n\nThe writer of Acts gives an account of a restatement by James and the elders in Jerusalem of the contents of the letter on the occasion of Paul's final Jerusalem visit, immediately prior to Paul's arrest at the temple, recounting: \"When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.\" (Acts 21:17–18, ESV) The elders then proceed to notify Paul of what seems to have been a common concern among Jewish believers, that he was teaching Diaspora Jewish converts to Christianity \"to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.\" They remind the assembly that, \"as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality\". In the view of some scholars, the reminder of James and the elders here is an expression of concern that Paul was not fully teaching the decision of the Jerusalem Council's letter to Gentiles, particularly in regard to non-strangled \"kosher\" meat, which contrasts with Paul's advice to Gentiles in Corinth, to \"eat whatever is sold in the meat markets\" (1 Corinthians 10:25).\n\nThe description of the Apostolic Council in Acts 15, generally considered the same event described in Galatians 2, is considered by some scholars to be contradictory to the Galatians account. The historicity of Luke's account has been challenged, and was rejected completely by some scholars in the mid to late 20th century. However, more recent scholarship inclines towards treating the Jerusalem Council and its rulings as a historical event, though this is sometimes expressed with caution. Bruce Metzger's \"Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament\" includes a summary of current research on the topic as of about 1994:\n\nJames's \"Apostolic Decree\" was that the requirement of circumcision for males was not obligatory for Gentile converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement. However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against Gentile converts eating meat containing blood, or meat of animals not properly slain. It also retained the prohibitions against \"fornication\" and \"idol worship\". The Decree may have been a major act of differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots.\n\nJewish Encyclopedia: New Testament — Spirit of Jewish Proselytism in Christianity states:\n\nJewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah states:\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia article on Judaizers states:\n\nJoseph Fitzmyer disputes the claim that the \"Apostolic Decree\" is based on \"Noahide Law\" () and instead proposes as the basis, see also Leviticus 18. He also argues that the decision was meant as a practical compromise to help Jewish and Gentile Christians to get along, not a theological statement intended to bind Christians for all time.\n\nAccording to the 19th-century Roman Catholic Bishop Karl Josef von Hefele, the Apostolic Decree of the Jerusalem Council \"has been obsolete for centuries in the West\", though it is still recognized and observed by the Greek Orthodox Church. Acts 28 Hyperdispensationalists, such as the 20th century Anglican E. W. Bullinger, would be another example of a group that believes the decree (and everything before Acts 28) no longer applies.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3203777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3203777", "title": "Dal Khalsa (Sikh Army)", "text": "Dal Khalsa (Sikh Army)\n\nDal Khalsa was the name of the Sikh army that operated in the 18th century (1735–1780) in the Punjab region.\n\nThe religion of Sikhism began at the time of the Conquest of Northern India by Babur. His grandson, Akbar, supported religious freedom and after visiting the langar of Guru Amar Das had a favorable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and had a positive relationship with the Sikh gurus until his death in 1605. His successor, Jahangir, saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He arrested Guru Arjan Dev because of Sikh support for Khusrau Mirza and ordered him to be put to death by torture. Guru Arjan Dev's martyrdom led the sixth Guru, Guru Har Gobind ji miri piri de malak, to declare Sikh sovereignty in the creation of the Akal Takht and to establish a fort to defend Amritsar. Jahangir attempted to assert authority over the Sikh by jailing Guru Har Gobind at Gwalior and released him after some time with 52 others rajpoot (hindu)kings on Guru HarGobind's orders .Sikhism did not have any further issues with the Mughal Empire until the death of Jahangir in 1627. His successor, Shah Jahan \"took offense\" at Guru Har Gobind's sovereignty and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs to retreat to the Sivalik Hills. Guru Har Gobind's successor, Guru Har Rai maintained the guruship in the Sivalik Hills by defeating local attempts to seize Sikh land and taking a neutral role in the power struggle between Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh for control of the Timurid dynasty. The ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, moved the Sikh community to Anandpur and traveled extensively to visit and preach in Sikh communities in defiance of Aurangzeb, who attempted to install Ram Rai to the guruship. He aided Kashmiri Brahmins in avoiding conversion to Islam and was arrested and confronted by Aurangzeb. When offered a choice between conversion or death, he chose to die rather than compromise his principles and was executed. Guru Gobind Singh, assumed the guruship in 1675 and to avoid battles with Sivalik Hill Rajas moved the gurship to Paunta. He built a large fort to protect the city and garrisoned an army to protect it. The growing power of the Sikh community alarmed Sivalik Hill Rajas who attempted to attack the city but the Guru's forces routed them at the Battle of Bhangani. He moved on to Anandpur and established the Khalsa, a collective army of baptized Sikhs, on March 30, 1699. The establishment of the Khalsa united the Sikh community against various Mughal-backed claimants to the guruship. In 1701, a combined army composed of the Sivalik Hill Rajas and the Mughal army under Wazir Khan attacked Anandpur and, following a retreat by the Khalsa, were defeated by the Khalsa at the Battle of Muktsar. In 1707, Guru Gobind Singh accepted an invitation by Bahadur Shah I, Aurangzeb's successor to meet in southern India. When he arrived in Nanded in 1708, he was injured by agents of Wazir Khan, the governor of Sirhind. After this incident his wounds were stitched and he began to recover. A few days after, some Sikhs brought a very stiff bow to present to Guru Gobind Singh. As they were discussing whether anybody would ever be able to put a string on the bow, Guru Gobind Singh accepted the challenge. Though the bow was stringed, due to the force he applied on the bow the wounds which were still fresh started bleeding profusely. Guru Gobind Singh then declared that he would be leaving for heavenly abode and asked his Sikhs to prepare for the cremation.\n\nBanda Singh Bahadur was an ascetic who converted to Sikhism after meeting Guru Gobind Singh at Nanded. A short time before his death, Guru Gobind Singh ordered him to reconquer Punjab and gave him a letter that commanded all Sikhs to join him. After two years of gaining supporters, Banda Singh Bahadur initiated an agrarian uprising by breaking up the large estates of Zamindar families and distributing the land to the poor Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim peasants who farmed the land. Banda Singh Bahadur started his rebellion with the defeat of Mughal armies at Samana and Sadhaura and the rebellion culminated in the defeat of Sirhind. During the rebellion, Banda Singh Bahadur made a point of destroying the cities in which Mughals had been cruel to Sikhs, including executing Wazir Khan in revenge for the deaths of Guru Gobind Singh's sons after the Sikh victory at Sirhind. He ruled the territory between the Sutlej river and the Yamuna river, established a capital in the Himalayas at Lohgarh, and struck coinage with the faces of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh. In 1716, his army was defeated by the Mughals after he attempted to defend his fort at Gurdas Nangal. He was captured along with 700 of his men and sent to Delhi where he was tortured and executed after refusing to convert to Islam.\n\nAfter 1716, the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah began a campaign of genocide against Sikhs through his Governor of Lahore, Abdus Samad Khan. His son and, later, successor, Zakariya Khan Bahadur led a standing army dedicated to eliminating Sikhs, executed Sikhs publicly, and offered monetary rewards for the heads of killed Sikhs. The Sikhs \"retaliated by killing government functionaries and plundering Mughal posts, arsenals, and treasuries\" but could not assemble an army. The persecution of the Mughal Empire forced some Sikhs to conform to Hinduism or abandon the outward signs of their faith, but \"the more sincere had to seek a refuge among the recesses of the hills or in the woods to the south of the Sutlej\" The Sikhs went into hiding during this period. From 1718-1738, the Sikhs carried out a guerrilla war against the Mughal Empire in the area around the Sivalik Hills. Historian Josepeh Cunningham writes of the period: \"The Sikhs were scarcely again heard of in history for the period of a generation\".\n\nIn 1733, Zakariya Khan Bahadur attempted to negotiate a peace with the Sikhs by offering them a jagir, the title Nawab to their leader, and unimpeded access to the Harmandir Sahib. After discussion at a Sarbat Khalsa, Kapur Singh was elected leader of the Sikhs and took the title of Nawab. Nawab Kapur Singh combined the various Sikh militias into two groups; the Taruna Dal and the Budda Dal, which would collectively be known as the Dal Khalsa. Sikh militias over 40 years of age would be part of the Budda Dal and Sikh militas under 40 years were part of the Taruna Dal. The Taruna Dal was further divided in five jathas, each with 1300 to 2000 men and a separate drum and banner. The area of operations of each \"Dal\", or army, was Hari ke Pattan, where the Sutlej river and Beas River meet; the Taruna Dal would control the area east of Hari ke Pattan while the Budha Dal would control the area west of it. The purpose of the Budda Dal, the veteran group, was to protect Gurdwaras and train the Taruna Dal, while the Taruna Dal would act as combat troops. However, in 1735, the agreement between Zakariya Khan and Nawab Kapur Singh broke down and the Dal Khalsa retreated to the Sivalik Hills to regroup.\nLater the command of Dal Khalsa was taken by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia who was an able and powerful administrator, even bought India (Red Fort) under Khalsa flag.\nHe made the foundation of Khalsa firm for future generations to lead.\n\nIn 1738, Nader Shah of the Persian Afsharid dynasty invaded Muhammad Shah's Mughal Empire. Nadir Shah defeated the Mughal Empire in the Battle of Karnal and proceeded to sack Delhi. During the panic before and after the Battle of Karnal, important functionaries of the Mughal Empire fled Delhi but were intercepted by small jathas of the Dal Khalsa and relieved of their wealth. Nadir Shah then gave Muhammad Shah back his title of Mughal Emperor but took away his royal treasury, including the Peacock Throne. When Nadir Shah began his retreat, the Sikhs who had been seeking refuge in the Sivalik Hills came down from the mountains and mercilessly plundered the treasure of the Persian Army. Afterwards the Dal Khalsa established a fort at Dallewal near the Ravi river and began levying taxes in the area around Lahore.\nDuring this period, the Muslim historian Nur Mohammed, though full of contempt for Sikhs, was constrained to pay tribute to them of their character, in the following words:\n\n\"In no case they would slay a coward, nor would they put an obstacle in the way of a fugitive. They do not plunder the wealth and ornaments of a woman, be she a well to do lady or a maid servant. There is no adultery among these dogs, nor are they mischievous people given to thieving. Whether a woman is young or old, they call her 'buriya' and asked her to get out of the way. The word 'buriya' in Indian language means 'an old lady'. There is no thief at all among these dogs, nor is there any house breaker born among these miscreants. They do not make friends with adulterers and house breakers, though their behaviors on the whole is not commendable.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "857078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857078", "title": "Golden calf", "text": "Golden calf\n\nAccording to the Bible, the golden calf (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב \" ‘ēggel hazāhāv\") was an idol (a cult image) made by the Israelites during Moses' absence, when he went up to Mount Sinai. In Hebrew, the incident is known as \"ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel\" (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or \"The Sin of the Calf\". It is first mentioned in .\n\nBull worship was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the Exodus narrative the Hebrews had recently come, the Apis Bull was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of religious assimilation and syncretism. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the ancient Near East and in the Aegean, the aurochs, the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the Lunar Bull and as the creature of El.\n\nWhen Moses went up into Biblical Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments (), he left the Israelites for forty days and forty nights. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that Aaron make them \"gods\" to go before them (). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a \"molten calf\" and they declared: \"These \"[be]\" thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\" (Exodus 32:4)\n\nAaron built an altar before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the . So they rose up early the next day and \"offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\" (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared (), and God \"repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people.\"\n\nMoses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two Tablets of Stone, breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ().\n\nThe Bible records that the tribe of Levi did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the 's side, let him come unto me.' And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the , the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ()\n\nThe golden calf is mentioned in .\nThe language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1 Kings are written by Deuteronomistic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus 32:4 where \"gods\" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.\n\nConversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between \"gods\" in Exodus 32 and \"God\" in Nehemiah 9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew \"elohim\" is used. Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish \"elohim\" God (known as the majestic plural) from \"elohim\" gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a) context or (b) adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus 32, the verb is in the 3rd person plural. In Nehemiah 9, the verb connected to \"elohim\" is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000 years apart: Exodus (by Moses) \"circa\" 1500 BCE, and Nehemiah \"circa\" 500 BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.\n\nAccording to , after Jeroboam establishes the northern Kingdom of Israel, he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.\nHis concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern Kingdom of Judah, would lead to a return to King Rehoboam. He makes two golden calves and places them in Bethel and Dan. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the \"cherubim\" built by King Solomon in Jerusalem.\n\nRichard Elliott Friedman says \"at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people.\" Friedman believes that the story was turned into a polemic, exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.\n\nThe declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: \nAfter making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).\n\nIn \"Legends of the Jews\", the Conservative rabbi and scholar Louis Ginzberg wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in their exodus from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by Aaron.\n\nThe devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at passing through the Red Sea, when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt. After seeing Hur son of Miriam who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, Aaron was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.\n\nAlso there would be among the Israelites no priestly caste, and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the tribe of Levi as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.\n\nThe incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the Quran and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to Mount Sinai for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to fast for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (\"Harun\") was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names Samiri raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had. Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt. There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned. The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.\n\nReturning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness (Qur'an 7:167-174). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his soul had suggested it to him. Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness. The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake. Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and resurrected them and they continued on their journey.\n\nIn the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been shirk (), the sin of idolatry or polytheism. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than Allah, or more literally the establishment of \"partners\" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.\n\nDespite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to Michael Coogan, it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a false god. He cites as evidence:\n\nAnother understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne. This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the ark of the covenant or the cherubim upon which Yahweh was enthroned.\n\nThe reason for this complication may be understood as\nThe second explanation relies on the \"sin of Jeroboam,\" who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722 BCE. Jeroboam’s \"sin\" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to Bethel as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to Dan as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1 Kings 12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern Kingdom of Judah, after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom. Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the cherubim of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.\n\nThe documentary hypothesis can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by E (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and J (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, \"the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light,\" and the worship of the calf was depicted as \"polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy\" (see Exodus 32:6). When compiling the narratives, P (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.\n\nAlternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the Ten Commandments by Moses when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the Ark of the Covenant. \"The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments.\" \n\nAs to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus 20) and J (Exodus 34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story. The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus 20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.\n\nArchaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"\n\nA metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the \"gold\" part of \"golden calf\" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish where Mammon, the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some groups represent only a few hundred people; while the largest, the Unitarian Universalist Association, has over 160,000 members and is larger than all the other groups put together.\n\nThe original initiative for its establishment was contained in a resolution of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches (British Unitarians) in 1987. This led to the establishment of the Advocates for the Establishment of an International Organization of Unitarians (AEIOU), which worked towards creating the council. However, the General Assembly resolution provided no funding.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) became particularly interested in the establishment of a council when it had to deal with an increasing number of applications for membership from congregations outside North America. It had already granted membership to congregations in Adelaide, Auckland, the Philippines and Pakistan, and congregations in Sydney, Russia and Spain had applied for membership. Rather than admit congregations from all over the world, the UUA hoped that they would join a world council instead. The UUA thus became willing to provide funding for the council's establishment.\n\nAs a result, the council was finally established at a meeting in Essex, Massachusetts, United States on 23–26 March 1995.\n\nThe Preamble to the Constitution of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists reads:\n\nWe, the member groups of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists, affirming our belief in religious community based on:\n\n\ndeclare our purposes to be:\n\n\n\nPolish Unitarians have reported a need for a period of reorganization, and that at this time they are unable to maintain the level of activity needed to be full Council members, be it moved that membership of these groups be suspended. This action is taken with regret and the ICUU looks forward to welcoming Poland back into membership at the earliest possible date.\n\nChurches and religious associations which have expressed their will to become members of the Council may be admitted as \"Provisional Members\" for a period of time (generally two or four years), until the Council decides that they have shown their organizational stability, affinity with the ICUU principles and commitment to deserve becoming Full Members of the Council. Provisional Members are invited to Council meetings through a delegate but cannot vote.\n\n\nAccording to the Bylaws of the ICUU, Emerging Groups are \"applicants that are deemed to be reasonable prospects for membership, but do not fulfil the conditions of either Provisional membership or Full Membership\".

{"id": "16278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16278", "title": "James Randi", "text": "James Randi\n\nJames Randi (born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge; August 7, 1928) is a Canadian-American retired stage magician and a scientific skeptic who has extensively challenged paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. Randi is the co-founder of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), originally known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). He is also the founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). He began his career as a magician under the stage name The Amazing Randi and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims, which he collectively calls \"woo-woo\". Randi retired from practicing magic at age 60, and from the JREF at 87.\n\nAlthough often referred to as a \"debunker\", Randi has said he dislikes the term's connotations and prefers to describe himself as an \"investigator\". He has written about paranormal phenomena, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", famously exposing fraudulent faith healer Peter Popoff, and was occasionally featured on the television program \"\"\n\nPrior to Randi's retirement, JREF sponsored the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offered a prize of one million dollars US to eligible applicants who could demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties. The paranormal challenge was officially terminated by the JREF in 2015. The foundation continues to make grants to non-profit groups that encourage critical thinking and a fact-based world view.\n\nRandi was born on August 7, 1928 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Marie Alice (née Paradis) and George Randall Zwinge. He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again. Randi often skipped classes and, at 17, dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow. He practised as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition and wrote for Montreal's tabloid press.\n\nIn his twenties, Randi posed as an astrologer and, to establish that they were actually doing simple tricks, he briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid \"Midnight\" under the name \"Zo-ran\" by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column. In his thirties, Randi worked in the UK, Europe, Philippine nightclubs, and all across Japan. He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural. One of his earliest reported experiences is that of seeing an evangelist using a version of the \"one-ahead\" technique to convince churchgoers of his divine powers.\n\nThough defining himself as a conjuror, Randi began a career as a professional stage magician and escapologist in 1946. Initially, he presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of \"The Amazing Randi\". Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on NBC's \"Today\" show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini's record of 93 minutes, though Randi calls attention to the fact that he was very much younger than Houdini when the original record was established, in 1926.\n\nRandi was a frequent guest on the Long John Nebel program on New York radio station WOR, and did character voices for commercials. After Nebel went to WNBC in 1962, Randi was given the time slot, and from 1967 to '68 hosted \"The Amazing Randi Show\". This show often had guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi's then-friend James W. Moseley. Randi says he quit WOR over complaints (disputed by Randi) from the archbishop of NY, that Randi had said on-air that \"Jesus Christ was a religious nut.\"\n\nRandi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As \"The Amazing Randi\" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series \"Wonderama\" from 1959 to 1967. He also auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children's show \"The Magic Clown\" in 1970, which showed briefly in Detroit and in Kenya, but was never picked up. In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine \"Abracadabra\", Randi, defining the community of magicians, stated: \"I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours.\" In the December 2003 issue of \"The Linking Ring\", the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated: \"Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing\" and \"The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk.\"\n\nDuring Alice Cooper's 1973–1974 Billion Dollar Babies tour, Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Alice's executioner. He also built several of the stage props, including the guillotine. Shortly after that, in a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special \"World of Wizards\", Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls.\n\nRandi has been accused of actually using \"psychic powers\" to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: \"Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery.\" The professor shouted back: \"That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.\" A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: \"I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it.\" Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.\n\nRandi is a member of the Society of American Magicians (SAM), the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM), and The Magic Circle in the UK, holding the rank of \"Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star.\"\n\nRandi said the hardest people to fool are not the highly educated, but children, because they are not sophisticated enough to be fooled, as they have not learned the body cues that adults have learned and which magicians take advantage of.\n\nRandi is the author of ten books, among them \"Conjuring\" (1992), a biographical history of noted magicians. The book is subtitled \"Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC!\" The book's cover says that it is by \"James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed\". The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book titled \"Houdini, His Life and Art\". This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.\n\nRandi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled \"The Magic World of the Amazing Randi\", which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. He is currently working on \"A Magician in the Laboratory\", which recounts his application of skepticism to science. He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of his good friend Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.\n\nOther books are \"Flim-Flam!\" (1982), \"The Faith Healers\" (1987), \"James Randi, Psychic Investigator\" (1991), \"Test Your ESP Potential\" (1982) and \"An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural\" (1995).\n\nRandi was a regular contributor to \"Skeptic\" magazine, penning the \"'Twas Brillig ...\" column, and also served on its editorial board. He is also a frequent contributor to \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine, which is published by CSI, of which he is also a Fellow.\n\nRandi gained the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller. He accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book \"The Truth About Uri Geller\" (1982).\n\nBelieving that it was important to get columnists and TV personalities to challenge Geller and others like him, Randi and CSICOP reached out in an attempt to educate them. Randi said that CSICOP had a \"very substantial influence on the printed media ... in those days.\" During this effort, Randi made contact with Johnny Carson and discovered that he was \"very much on our side. He wasn't only a comedian ... he was a great thinker.\" According to Randi, when he was on \"The Tonight Show\", Carson broke his usual protocol of not talking with guests prior to their entrance on stage, but instead would ask what Randi wanted to be emphasized in the interview. \"He wanted to be aware of how he could help me.\"\n\nIn 1973, Geller appeared on \"The Tonight Show\", and this appearance is recounted in the \"Nova\" documentary \"James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics\".\n\nIn the documentary, Randi says that Carson \"had been a magician himself and was skeptical\" of Geller's claimed paranormal powers, so prior to the date of taping, Randi was asked \"to help prevent any trickery\". Per Randi's advice, the show prepared its own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff \"anywhere near them\". When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said \"This scares me\" and \"I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.\" Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying \"I don't feel strong\" and expressing his displeasure at feeling like he was being \"pressed\" to perform by Carson. According to Adam Higginbotham's Nov. 7, 2014 article in the \"New York Times\":\n\nHowever, this appearance on \"The Tonight Show\", which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham,\n\nAccording to Higginbotham, this result caused Randi to realize that much more must be done to stop Geller and those like him. So in 1976, Randi approached Ray Hyman, a psychologist who had observed the tests of Geller's ability at Stanford and thought them slipshod, and suggested they create an organization dedicated to combating pseudoscience. In 1976, together with Martin Gardner, a \"Scientific American\" columnist whose writing had helped hone Hyman's and Randi's skepticism, they formed the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).\n\nUsing donations and sales of their magazine, \"Skeptical Inquirer\", they and secular humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz took seats on the executive board, with Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan joining as founding members. Randi traveled the world on behalf of CSICOP, becoming its public face, and according to Hyman, the face of the skeptical movement.\n\nAndrás G. Pintér, producer and co-host of the European Skeptics Podcast called Randi the grandfather of European skepticism by virtue of Randi \"playing a role in kickstarting several European organizations.\"\n\nGeller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million in 1991 and lost. Geller's suit against CSICOP was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit. The legal costs Randi incurred used almost all of a $272,000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to Randi in 1986 for his work. Randi also dismissed Geller's claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography made famous by the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argues, of trick photography using a simple hand-held optical device. During the period of Geller's legal dispute, CSICOP's leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller's litigation, demanded that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. Randi refused and resigned, though he has maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.\n\nRandi has gone on to write many articles criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal. He has also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his Project Alpha hoax, Randi successfully planted two fake psychics in a privately funded psychic research experiment. The hoax became a scandal and demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level.\n\nRandi has appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on \"That's My Line\", Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick, who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it. Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging. Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick \"confessed everything\".\n\nRandi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship's five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out \"prayer cards\" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.\n\nThe news coverage generated by Randi's exposé on \"The Tonight Show\" led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987. However, the televangelist returned soon after with faith-healing infomercials that reportedly attracted more than $23 million in 2005 from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry's \"Think Again! TV\" documented one of Popoff's more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.\n\nIn February 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's \"60 Minutes\" program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a \"spirit channeler\" named Carlos who was actually artist Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga, whom Randi described as a \"friend\". Randi would tell him what to say through sophisticated radio equipment. According to the \"60 Minutes\" program on the Carlos hoax, \"it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)\", though an analysis by \"The Skeptic\"'s Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, \"it [the hoax] at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical\". The hoax was exposed on \"60 Minutes Australia\"; \"Carlos\" and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.\n\nIn his book \"The Faith Healers\", Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arose from compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi has also been critical of João de Deus (John of God), a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon who has received international attention. Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, \"To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious.\"\nIn 1982, Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen, a Philadelphia doctor, who was able to identify the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the grooves on the record. However, Lintgen did not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.\n\nIn 1988, John Maddox, editor of the prominent science journal \"Nature\", asked Randi to join the supervision and observation of the homeopathy experiments conducted by Jacques Benveniste's team. Once Randi's stricter protocol for the experiment was in place, the positive results could not be reproduced.\nJames Randi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home, who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the actual instrument in use was a one-octave mouth organ concealed under Home's large moustache and that other one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death. According to Randi, author William Lindsay Gresham told Randi \"around 1960\" that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). Eric J. Dingwall, who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, \"It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public.\"\n\nRandi distinguishes between pseudoscience and crackpot science. He regards most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached and conducted, but nonetheless sees it as a legitimate subject that \"should be pursued\", and from which real scientific discoveries may develop. Randi regards crackpot science as \"equally wrong\" as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.\n\nSkeptics and magicians Penn & Teller credit Randi and his career as a skeptic for their own careers. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that \"Flim-Flam!\" was an early influence on him, and said \"If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today.\" He went on to say \"Outside of my family ... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me.\"\n\nAt the NECSS skeptic conference in 2017, Randi was asked by George Hrab what a \"'skeptic coming of age ceremony' would look like\" and Randi talked about what it was like as a child to learn about the speed of light and how that felt like he was looking into the past. Randi stated \"'More kids need to be stunned'\".\n\n\"Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live\" was a two-hour television special aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. Hosted by actor Bill Bixby, the program offered $100,000 (Randi's then $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show's syndicator, LBS Communications, Inc.) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.\n\n\nIn 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, \"Swift\". Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.\n\nBeginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF.\n\nJames Randi began a series of conferences known as \"The Amazing Meeting\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted a large percentage of younger folks.\nRandi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast \"Skepticality\" and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast \"Point of Inquiry\". From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast with a column titled \"Randi Speaks.\" In addition, \"The Amazing Show\" is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.\n\nIn 2014 Part2Filmworks released \"An Honest Liar\", a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner José Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics. The film was featured on the PBS \"Independent Lens\" series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with.\n\nSince 2013, Randi has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nRandi's parents were members of the Anglican Church but rarely attended services. He attended Sunday School at St. Cuthbert's Church in Toronto a few times as a child, but he independently decided to stop going when he was not answered when he asked for proof of the teachings of the Church.\n\nIn his essay \"Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright,\" Randi, who identifies himself as an atheist, has opined that many accounts in religious texts, including the virgin birth, the miracles of Jesus Christ, and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, are not believable. For example, Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being \"impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes\" and questions how Adam and Eve \"could have two sons, one of whom killed the other, and yet managed to populate the Earth without committing incest.\" He writes that, compared to the Bible, \"\"The Wizard of Oz\" is more believable. And much more fun.\"\n\nClarifying his view of atheism, Randi has written \"I've said it before: there are two sorts of atheists. One sort claims that there is no deity, the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that's their preference, and they've read it in a book. That's their right.\"\n\nIn \"An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural\" (1995), he examines various spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji, he writes \"Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret.\" In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nIn a discussion with Kendrick Frazier at CSICon 2016, Randi stated \"I think that a belief in a deity is ... an unprovable claim ... and a rather ridiculous claim. It is an easy way out to explain things to which we have no answer.\" He then summarized his current concern with religious belief as follows:\n\nThe James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offered a prize of US$1,000,000 to anyone able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under scientific testing criteria agreed to by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini, the foundation began in 1996, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal. The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules. No one progressed past the preliminary test, which was set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant. He refused to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, it was ruled that only persons with an established, nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on frivolous claimants.\n\nOn \"Larry King Live\", March 6, 2001, Larry King asked claimed medium Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed. Randi appeared with Browne on \"Larry King Live\" six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge. However, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne's death in November 2013.\n\nDuring a subsequent appearance on \"Larry King Live\" on June 5, 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea, another claimed medium, to undergo testing for the million dollars, but Altea refused to address the question. Instead Altea replied only, \"I agree with what he says, that there are many, many people who claim to be spiritual mediums, they claim to talk to the dead. There are many people, we all know this. There are cheats and charlatans everywhere.\" On January 26, 2007, Altea and Randi again appeared on the show, and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.\n\nIn October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward appeared on \"Headline Prime\", hosted by Glenn Beck. When asked if he would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, \"It's funny. I was on \"Larry King Live\" once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?\" Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.\n\nRandi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008. Randi called the ADE 651 \"a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It's a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars.\" There was no response from McCormick. According to Iraqi investigators, the ADE 651, which was corruptly sold to the Baghdad bomb squad, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians who died as a result of terrorist bombs which were not detected at checkpoints. On April 23, 2013, McCormick was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London; he was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for his part in the ADE 651 scandal, which Randi was the first to expose.\n\nA public log of past participants in the Million Dollar Challenge exists.\nIn 2015, the James Randi paranormal challenge was officially terminated.\n\nRandi has been involved in a variety of legal disputes but says that he has \"never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me.\" However, he says, he has paid out large sums to defend himself in these suits.\n\nRandi met magician Uri Geller in the early 1970s, and found Geller to be \"Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, handsome — everything!\" But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud. According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one third of one percent of what Geller had requested. This ruling was canceled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.\n\nIn May 1991, Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million on a charge of slander, after Randi told the \"International Herald Tribune\" that Geller had \"tricked even reputable scientists\" with stunts that \"are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes\", referring to the old spoon-bending trick. The court dismissed the case and Geller had to settle at a cost to him of $120,000, after Randi produced a cereal box which bore instructions on how to do the spoon-bending trick. Geller's lawyer Don Katz was disbarred mid-way into this action and Geller ended up suing him. After failing to pay before the deadline imposed by the court, Geller was sanctioned an additional $20,000.\n\nGeller sued both Randi and CSICOP. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi's statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone, along with the legal costs. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages, but only to CSICOP. The matter was subsequently settled out of court, and the details of the settlement have been kept confidential. The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases.\n\nIn 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a \"shopping market molester\" in a 1988 speech. However, the jury found that Byrd was not entitled to any monetary damages after hearing testimony that he had sexually molested and later married his sister-in-law. The jury also cleared the other defendant in the case, CSICOP.\n\nLate in 1996, Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto-area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley. Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on Usenet. Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue – Curley's comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true – Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto's largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings. The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51 of \"alcohol toxicity.\"\n\nAllison DuBois, on whose life the television series \"Medium\" was based, threatened Randi with legal action for using a photo of her from her website in his December 17, 2004, commentary without her permission. Randi removed the photo and subsequently used a caricature of DuBois when mentioning her on his site, beginning with his December 23, 2005, commentary.\n\nSniffex, producer of a dowsing bomb detection device, sued Randi and the JREF in 2007 and lost. Sniffex sued Randi for his comments regarding a government test in which the Sniffex device failed. The company was later investigated and charged with fraud.\n\nWhen he hosted his own radio show in the 1960s, Randi lived in a small house in Rumson, New Jersey, that featured a sign on the premises that read: \"Randi — Charlatan\". In a Fort Lauderdale public library in 1986, Randi, who had recently moved to Florida, met Venezuelan artist José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga). They eventually moved in together, and were married in Washington on July 2, 2013, with Randi turning 85 the next month. Today, they live in Plantation, Florida.\n\nIn 1987, Randi became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Randi has said that one reason he became an American citizen was an incident while he was on tour with Alice Cooper where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched the band's lockers during a performance. Nothing illicit or illegal was found, yet the RCMP trashed the room.\n\nIn February 2006, Randi underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. In early February 2006, he was declared to be in stable condition and \"receiving excellent care\" with his recovery proceeding well. The weekly commentary updates to his Web site were made by guests while he was hospitalized. Randi recovered after his surgery and was able to help organize and attend the 2007 Amaz!ng Meeting (T.A.M.) in Las Vegas, Nevada, his annual convention of scientists, magicians, skeptics, atheists and freethinkers.\n\nRandi was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in June 2009. He had a series of small tumors removed from his intestines during laparoscopic surgery. He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7, as well as the fact that he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks. He also said at the conference: \"One day, I'm gonna die. That's all there is to it. Hey, it's too bad, but I've got to make room. I'm using a lot of oxygen and such — I think it's good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I'm a little prejudiced on the matter.\"\n\nRandi underwent his final chemotherapy session on December 31, 2009, later saying that his chemotherapy experience was not as unpleasant as he had imagined it might be. In a video posted April 12, 2010, Randi stated that he has been given a clean bill of health.\n\nIn a March 21, 2010, blog entry, Randi came out as gay, a move he said was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film \"Milk\".\n\nRandi has never smoked, taken narcotics, or become inebriated, saying \"that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can. That means giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I'm willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world.\"\n\nIn a video released on October 16, 2017, Randi revealed that he had recently suffered a minor stroke, and that he was under medical advice not to travel during his recovery, so would be unable to attend CSICon 2017 in Las Vegas later that month.\n\nRandi is a registered Democrat. He wept when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States. He saw it as a large step forward for the United States to elect a black man President and thought electing a woman would be another such step. \n\nOn April 28, 2009, Randi stated on the James Randi Educational Foundation website that he wanted illegal drugs to be legalized so that users could kill themselves.\n\nIn the book \"The Heretics: Adventures with the Enemies of Science\" (2013), author Will Storr brought up Randi's comments on illegal drugs during an interview. In the interview, Randi stated that he thinks \"exactly the same thing about smoking\" and that smokers \"should be allowed to smoke themselves to death and die.\" Randi proceeded to call himself \"a believer in Social Darwinism.\" These comments evoked unrest in parts of the Skeptic community.\n\nOn 1 March 2013, the website DoubtfulNews.com published a news story in which Randi claimed to have been misquoted:\n\nThe statement \"I'm a believer in social Darwinism,\" did not come from me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I'll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.\n\nOn 2 March 2013, Randi posted an elaborative comment on that same news story, maintaining that he would never have called himself a Social Darwinist, since he \"only recently learned in detail what that term really means\" and was \"quite ignorant of the history of the movement organized around that false idea.\" However, Randi accepted \"that the conversation with Mr. Storr went just as described\" and conceded that he \"sometimes speaks on things about which [he knows] very little\":\n\nI'm well aware that I sometimes \"shoot from the hip\" and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I've learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded on a number of topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I'm still learning. Please bear with me, folks.\n\nThe following are Guinness World Records:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListings\n\nMedia\n"}

{"id": "39159007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39159007", "title": "Joseph Pitts (author)", "text": "Joseph Pitts (author)\n\nJoseph Pitts (1663–1735?) was an Englishman who was taken into slavery by Barbary pirates from Algeria in 1678 at the age of fourteen or fifteen. Little is known about Pitts aside from what is revealed in his narrative concerning his time held captive in Northern Africa, during which time he went through three masters ranging widely in their cruelty towards him over the course of more than fifteen years, with whom he travelled to Cairo and Alexandria. Though he escaped between the years 1693 and 1694, it was not until 1704 that Pitts first published his account. Pitts's \"A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive\" includes descriptions of his capture and captivity, including some of the first English descriptions of Islamic rituals. Converting to the religion while a slave, Pitts was the first Englishman to record the proceedings of the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. Pitts also describes the people of seventeenth-century North Africa (whom he calls Turks or Mohammetans) in detail, providing particulars on their manner of eating and dressing, the customs of their religion and marriage, and their economic and slave systems. Though its accuracy is debatable, Pitts’s narrative was the first and most detailed description of the religion of Islam and the manners of Muslims written by a European during the seventeenth century.\n\nIt was during Pitts’s time with his last master that he made his journey to Mecca to complete the hajj. Having converted to Islam under the urgings and tortures of his second master Ibrahim, Pitts departed for the hajj with his third master around 1685. His account described many of the aspects of the Islamic pilgrimage including the hajj caravans, the rites at Mecca, and the customary but not mandatory visit to Medina. Much of Pitts's account of the hajj can be verified as accurate, but there is debate as to the truthfulness of some of his relations.\n\nAs a pilgrim, Pitts participated in the initial rites upon arriving in Mecca. This time is filled with the pilgrims' first tawaf, cleansing and drinking at the Zamzam Well, and completion of the sa 'y or sa 'i. Scholars seem to disagree as to what brought about this tradition, whether a re-enactment of Mohammad's reclaiming of the temple for Islam or that of the seven planets rotating around the sun. Whatever the real reasoning or meaning behind the seven turnings around the Ka ‘ba, it became a part of the Islamic tradition of the hajj and was being performed by pilgrims immediately upon their arrival well before Pitts’s time. After this ritual is the cleansing at the Zamzam Well, something Pitts seems to have left out of his narrative. Peters describes the Islamic legend tracing the origins of this well to a time when Abraham’s wife Hagar was left in the middle of the desert with their son Ishmael who was dying of thirst. Desperately running back and forth in search of water between two low hills called Safa and Marwa, God brought forth water from a spot in the desert for Hagar to give to her child. An example of this interaction with the Zamzam Well shortly after the tawaf can be found in an account by Ali Bey al-Abbasi, a Spaniard who went on the hajj in 1807. In chapter 7 of his narrative, Pitts mentions the drinking of the water but not in connection with these initial rites. Whether this is due to a mistake by Pitts or a genuine difference in the order of the hajj of the 1600s is hard to determine. However, this initial water rite then brings pilgrims to what is called the sa ‘y, a recreation of Hagar’s desperate search for water which they complete by running back and forth between the same hills seven times. Today this is completed within the mosque in Mecca called Masjid al-Haram. During Pitts’s time and up until the 1950s, this was completed out on the street.\n\nThe vigil at Mount Arafat is another important aspect of the hajj which Pitts discusses. In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit “a certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.” Here he witnesses them perform Yawm al-Wukuf or the Day of Standing Together before God. Islamic legend explains that this hill was the place where Adam and Eve met after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden as well as where the Day of Judgment will take place. For pilgrims, it is “a place set aside for spiritual reunion, where pilgrims travel to re-form family ties, seek pardon, and re-collect their spirits.” Though it is the “how, when, and where [pilgrims] receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense,\" Pitts claims that as to \"why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges\" he did not know, adding he gave \"but little heed to these delusions.\" He describes the times that they perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how \"they [beg] earnestly for the remission of their sins and [promise] newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours.\"\n\nPitts was subject to numerous forms of trauma during his enslavement. These included:\n\nDue to these traumatic experiences Pitts developed a form of PTSD. Many scholars of memoir and PTSD have noted that the memoirs of the traumatised often take the form of a \"working out\" of the trauma, an examination of the causes and meanings of the trauma by a slow and steady examination of events to make sense of them. This reflects itself in Pitts's writing in the slow and steady buildup to the chapters that talk about the incidents of severe trauma, such as the beating received from his first and second masters and the emotional complexities of his conversion and later adoption.\n\nPitts does not often mention women in his writings. It appears there are very few opportunities for him to be around women of any sort of status. However, the encounters he does write about give good insight into the Western views of Islamic attitudes about women. Pitts is not a stranger to violence. He is captured, enslaved, tortured, sold, and endures countless hardships throughout his journey. Pitts encounters violence against women several times in his account, most notably when describing the Imperial Turkish camps. He writes that the soldiers are \"apt to drink, and are abominably rude, insomuch that it is very dangerous for any woman to walk in any by-place but more dangerous for boys, for they are extremely given to sodomy…\" (236). In this passage, and in the context surrounding it, Pitts only mentions the danger to women once and focuses more acutely on the sin of sodomy amongst the soldiers. This shows that sexual violence is normalised for Pitts; he is much more concerned about the sin of sodomy than the sin of rape. He focuses intently on the immorality of sodomy but says nothing of the immorality of raping a woman.\n\nIn his discussion of marriage, Pitts describes how the marriage agreement takes place between the groom and the father of the bride. The woman's possible feelings or misgiving about the union are not mentioned at all. Pitts appears to perceive women as having little to no power in their relationships with men (242). He also discusses the idea of divorce and of Muslim men having multiple wives. According to Pitts, divorce is fairly common in the Islamic world and both parties are free to remarry afterwards. Multiple wives are not as common though; Pitts reports that very few men have multiple wives except out in the rural areas (243). These notions of power in relation to females are very much based in English ideas. Women in England gave up their property and dowries to their husbands upon marriage. Divorce was not common nor easy in England, although Pitts never details if a woman is allowed to ask for a divorce. Multiple wives were not as common among the middle and lower class of Muslim society; if Pitts did not rub elbows with the elite he would not have seen this phenomenon.\n\nPitts details a visit to a slave market in Cairo while he is on the hajj with one of his masters. In the market place, Pitts observes the selling of women and men. While men are forced to act out tricks to show off their strength and abilities like a horse show, the women are treated in a different manner. Women would be dressed in fine clothing when being exposed in markets, in hopes of catching a buyer's eye. Pitts says that while the women's faces were veiled, men were allowed to freely view their faces, to feel the inside of their mouths and teeth, and to caress their breasts. If a woman's virginity was questioned, slave traders would sometimes permit a potential buyer to escort the she-slave into a private tent, allowing the customer to discover the answer to the question themselves. He notes that many of the slaves are women and children as the men are kept as rowing slaves aboard ships. He also describes many of the people as \"Muscovites and Russians, and from those parts and some of the emperor of Germany's parts\" (270). These slaves have lighter skin, and they are dressed in fine clothing so they will fetch a higher price at auction. The slaves are examined much like animals; buyers are allowed to checked their teeth, muscles, and stature to get an idea of the overall health of a slave.\n\nPitts served a total of three masters, with varying degrees of treatment. Not very much insight is given of his first master, but we do know that his second master, Ibrahim, treated him very poorly (318). At the beginning of Pitts' capture, he mentions the poor diet that they were fed was equal to the treatment they received. When planning a mutinous revolt, Pitts describes how the rebellion was discovered. A man who was suspected of the idea of the uprising was brought forward in front of his fellow captives. Pitts states: ‘The captain, with a great rope, gave him about an hundred blows on his buttocks, but he would not confess the fact, generously choosing rather to suffer himself than to bring us all under the bastinadoes also’ (228). Ellen Friedman points out that the free Muslim man’s diet was no better than the captives’. Friedman also addresses that captives were treated harshly to make certain that they were kept in line and knew their place. Their self-worth was often undermined and the captives would be humiliated in front of their companions. Robert Davis, in the book \"Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy\", says that ceaseless beatings and humiliation are established at the beginning of the capture to not only frighten new slaves, but to ensure silent obedience as well. Many slaves watched as their companions were reprimanded into bloody unconsciousness.\n\nPitts’ narrative then turns to the forcing of converting to Islam. He states: ‘It hath been affirmed by some that the slaves that are sold in this country are never compelled to turn to the Mohammetan religion.’ While this is deemed true, there are rare cases like Pitts who have been forced into conversion. His second master, Ibrahim, had hung Pitts upside down, revealing the bottoms of his bare feet and dealing out 300 blows with a cudgel. Though Pitts had changed religions, Ibrahim treated him just as maliciously as he had before, beating Pitts until his blood poured onto the ground. This type of treatment was unusual. The Qur'an instructs masters to treat their slaves with firm kindness. Though they might not have shared the same expectations about work and life, master and slaves mutually understood and shared “a bundle of mutual obligations.” Slaves were meant to be kept healthy to work efficiently. If slaves were unproductive in their line of work, then they would be punished.\n\nPitts’ third and last master was more of an ideal master. While Pitts wanted nothing to do with his master from the beginning, he soon became affectionate towards him when he saw that the master intended to give him a letter of freedom (323). Pitts describes his master treating him like a son, seeing as he had no children or relatives to love. Pitts also saw him in a fatherly light and, after given the letter of freedom, continued to stay with him for he was so kind. Freeing a slave was looked at as a great act of piety, and the act could allow the slave master to be forgiven of his sins. Even serious sins such as murder could be forgiven by the freeing of a slave. When Pitts makes the decision to leave, escaping back to his native homeland, he becomes conflicted with the situation of whether or not he should leave his fatherlike master who had made promises of leaving all of his belongings to Pitts after his death (332).\n\nAt the time period in which Pitts's narrative was written, many other writers of slave narratives were claiming, like Pitts, to have been forced or tricked into converting to Islam. However, research suggests that such claims were likely to be false. Research suggests that North Africa was religiously very tolerant at this time and that Christian captives who converted were likely to benefit from lying about having converted because the English Christians—their own families included—would have persecuted them. This research suggests that Pitts might have done the same and that Pitts's alleged experience of having been forcibly converted would have been a special case, if true at all. More research, suggesting that Islam and renegades were often vilified in British culture and media, gives Pitts another reason to have lied about his conversion. Researchers describe the way, in English theatre at this time, renegades were often considered to be on par with Satan-worshipers and atheists, and traitors to their countries. In direct reference to Pitts's writings, some research brings up the way that Pitts admitted to having been tempted to remain a Muslim, as well as admitting to the advantages offered him by doing so.\n\nThere is controversy within the academic community as to the veracity of the abuse that Pitts, and many of his fellow captives, received at the hands of their masters. Many scholars cast doubt on Pitts’s account. Claire Norton posits various reasons why beating a slave as a form of proselytisation would have been illogical. A slave beaten into conversion would be of no economical value as Muslims were socially pressured to free their slaves once they converted. The Barbary Coast was also very egalitarian in its religious diversity, Christian services being held in various places, decreasing the likelihood that a Christian would have no place in Islamic society.\n\nOther scholars, such as Robert Davis, also doubt the validity of many slave narratives while allowing that the use of violence against one slave served “as a warning to all the other slaves who might witness or hear of it to be on their best behavior.” Pitts himself discredits the forced conversion trope, stating that this was a rare occurrence, “though it was my hard fortune to be so unmercifully dealt with.” However, Pitts provides a reason why his masters would have used violent force against him, namely that one of his masters had a sordid past and hoped to unburden his sins by forcing Pitts to convert and then freeing him, a holy rite within Islam.\n\n"}

{"id": "55537472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55537472", "title": "Kingdom of Reman", "text": "Kingdom of Reman\n\nThe Kingdom of Reman or Kingdom of Rahman (; Jawi: كراجأن رمان; ; ) was a landlocked traditional Malay kingdom established in the northern Malay Peninsular. It became one of the seven states of Persekutuan Pattani Besar (The Great Pattani Federation) between 1810 and 1902. Tuan Mansor, a member of the Pattani aristocracy was ascended to the throne of Reman in 1810. Until 1909, the boundary of the state was not only confined to the present-day Raman District, but also covered most of Yala province in Thailand, Hulu Perak and parts of Ulu Kelantan in Malaysia.\n\nThe name of the state may be derived from a Pattani Malay word \"Rama' \", cognate to standard Malay \"Ramai\", meaning \"a large assembly\". It is likely associated to the growing settlement founded in the area by the late 18th century.\n\nThe earliest English-language reference of the state was made in 1818, between an agreement by the Governor of Prince of Wales' Island, John Bannerman to Tuan Long Mansur, the King of Reman in Kroh. While the second English-reference of the kingdom was written in 1824 by John Anderson, a Scottish diplomatic agent that recorded Reman as one of the seven states of Pattani. The territory also referred to as Rahman and Rehman in English and \"Raman\" (รามัน) in Thai. Another colonial entry was made in 1826, where Henry Burney, a British commercial traveller and diplomat for the British East India Company acknowledged that Reman as one of the fourteen polity that pay tribute to the Siamese by the representatives in the superintending states of Nakhon Si Thammarat and Songkhla.\n\nThe state of Reman was founded in Pattani between the older principalities of Pujut, Jalor and Legeh. It emerged as a single polity under Tuan Tok Nik Tok Leh in 1810. Tuan Tok Nik, also known as Tuan Mansor, a Pattani nobleman, was appointed to observe the mining-activities in the area during the reign of Muhammad Raja Bakar, the Sultan of Pattani. Between the late 18th century, he and his followers settled in the Kroh Plateau, an area that already witnessed a mass exodus of people fleeing from the civil unrest in the Pattani plains since 1785.\n\nBy 1808, Tuan Tok Nik desiring to establish more political autonomy and control in the area commenced a campaign to obtain an independence from Pattani suzerainty. The campaign rapidly spiraled into a civil war within the domestic sphere. The Siamese, seizing the opportunity of the unrest began to mobilised its force to attack the Kingdom. Severely weakened by the incursion from both sides, this serves as a fatal blow to the Pattani Sultanate, as the Siamese was proved to be victorious in the area.\n\nThe triumphant Siamese then led a reformation within the borders of Pattani in 1810. Pattani was morphed to become a confederation with 7 semi-autonomous Malay kingdoms. The states consist of Legeh, Nongchick, Pattani, Reman, Saiburi, Yala and Yaring. Each state was with awarded a high-degree internal autonomy and administrative powers granted to the Malay king of the respected territory. A level of local revenue sources was also expected to be returned to the Siamese. Loyalty to the crown was observed and any rebellion against the Siamese will be convicted.\n\nIn the new governance system, Tuan Tok Nik was affirmed as the ruler of Reman. Spanning an area between the upper reach of Sungai Pattani to Sungai Mas in the north and Lenggong down south, Reman was among the largest kingdom in the confederation.\n\nThe Perak-Reman war was an armed conflict due to the territorial dispute between the two states in Kelian Intan and Kroh. Previously an outpost between the border of Perak and Pattani in the early 1780s, the mineral-rich area was captured and developed pursuant to the rise of Reman in 1790, becoming the heartland and integral part of state.\n\nIn 1826, Abdullah Muazzam Shah of Perak sought the assistance of the British East India Company to regain control of the resource-rich territory. Shortly after, the Perakian forces was deployed to the plateau and launch an ambush attack into Reman. The sudden attacks caused the king of Reman, Tuan Mansor to retrieve from Kubu Kapeh to Klian Intan and later to Kuala Kepayang. It took several years for Reman to reconquer Kelian Intan and Kroh.\n\nThe strategic inland location between the east and west coast of the peninsular fuelled the growth of the kingdom during the post-war era. It was followed by a period of relative stability and unprecedented prosperity due to the restoration of mining activities in the region monitored by Toh Nang Patani, a member of the Reman aristocrat family. Despite a few major battles against Perak in the border, it was usually won by Reman militia, commanded by Mengkong Deleha, a renowned Reman fighter.\n\nIn 1882, the hostilities between Reman and Perak formally come to an end when both parties sought to reconcile their respective borders. Under the truce of 1882, both parties, led by the British government, acted on behalf of the state of Perak and Tuan Jagung, the king of Reman as the representative of the Siamese, agreed that the new border shall be located along Bukit Nasha, some 5 kilometres south of Gerik town. \"Bukit Nasha\" \"Nasha hill\" is an abbreviation of \"Nak disahkan satu perjanjian\" (for the ratification under an agreement). \n\nThe agreement was later updated in year 1899, where both parties mutually acknlowledged that the border shall be in Kerunai, an area located north of Gerik. Several boundary markers were erected pursuant to the agreement, with each pillars standing 1 metre high and 1 metre wide. Each stones was set following the borders of Reman and Perak.\n\nThe rise of Independence movement in Reman was largely progressed from the wider Pan-Pattani Malay Nationalism manifested in the region. It was rooted from the loss of the Pattani sovereignty under the Siamese hands in 1810. The latter stage of 19th century to the early 20th century was characterised for a restoration of an ideal sovereign Pattani state, self-governance and a call for a full-autonomy, hoping to protect the native Malay soil and interest without the interference from the Siamese government. \n\nIn 1902, the Siamese, alarmed by the nationalist development in the south began a major military crackdown against the Malay leaders who were suspected to be plotting in the movement. Among the political elites that were arrested by the Siamese forces includes Tuan Lebeh Long Raya, the \"Raja Muda\" (crown prince) of Reman; Abdul Kadir Kamaruddin Syah, the Sultan of Pattani and Tengku Abdul Mutallib, the King of Teluban.\n\nTuan Lebeh was then charged in the Siamese court in Singgora. The trial found the crown prince of Reman to be guilty of treason and he was offered two sentence options: a 25 years imprisonment in Singgora or 20 years in Bangkok. Tuan Lebeh opted for the second sentence. He was then transferred to Bangkok via a Siamese vessel, Chamroen (). The ship sank during the voyage to Bangkok and the prince was believed to be perished in the disaster. Devastated by the news, the king died a few weeks later, without an heir apparent.\n\n1902 also witnessed that the Siamese government stripped the sovereign powers of all Pattani Malay sultans, rulers and aristocrats in wake of the uprising. The final blow was cultivated 4 years later in 1906, when the Siamese officially deliver an ultimatum to abolish all of the Pattani Malay states. All the seven states was then reunited under a single Pattani province (; ) and administered by a Siamese governor. The newly created province was then divided into four territories (; ) Pattani, Yala, Saiburi and Narathiwat, each headed by a high commissioner. Under the new administrative system, Reman was fully absorbed into Yala.\n\n\"..Setul would not be of no great values to us, and although we might do doubt put forward a very good claim to its part of Kedah and secure it by insistence, I am inclined to think it would be more Politics to turn our claim to account by agreeing to renounce Setul if the Siamese Government will in its stead hand over to us the Lang-kawi Islands and that portion of Raman which comprise the watershed of the Perak River. Both these would constitute more velueable posessions to us than Setul. The Lang-kawi Islands furnish magnificent anchourages and such have been coveted by various foreign powers, whilst the lower part of Reman is rich in Tin\"\n— Ralph Paget, British Minister to Thailand, in his letter to Edward Grey, Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs (29 April 1907) \n\nIgnited by colonial ambitions, the British aimed to expand its territories in the far east. By the dawn of 20th century, it has already acquired a collection of Malay polity consist of crown colonies and protectorates in the central-southern Malay peninsular. The British incorporated the areas into the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States between 1826 and 1895 respectively.\n\nIn 1909, alarmed by the growing ties between the rivalling German colonial powers and the Siamese government, especially in the peninsular, the British then sought to enter an agreement with the Siamese. The acquisition of the northern states was essential by the British, as it was strategically located in the mouth of Straits of Malacca and rich with tin, an important commodity to fuel the need of British industrial revolution and trade by the late 19th century. This led to the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 that break the peninsular between the Siamese and British territorial jurisdiction.\nOne of the highly contested areas by the British includes Reman district, which was then already absorbed into Yala territory in 1906. The area was known to be rich in gold-deposit and holds the largest tin reserve in the whole Peninsular. During the discussion between King Chulalongkorn, the King of Siam; Ralph Paget, British diplomat in Siam; Jens Westengard, Siamese Adviser in Foreign Affairs and Prince Damrong, Siamese Ministry of the Interior, it was acknowledged by all parties that the British agreed to relinquish it claims for Satun in exchange for Langkawi and lower Reman area, the British was also additionally required to provide a loan to finance the construction of the south line of Siamese State Railway that cost £4 million pounds (1909).\n\nThe partition mark the birth of Reman into two separate jurisdictions, Reman Hulu (upper Reman) retained under Yala and Reman Hilir (southern Reman) absorbed into Hulu Perak. It was officially divided following the transfer ceremony held on 16 July 1909 in Kroh. The ceremony was attended by: Wan Muhammad Isa, Orang Kaya Menteri; Wan Muhammad Salleh, Orang Kaya-Kaya Seri Adika Raja; E.W. Birch, the British Resident of Perak; A.S. Jelf, MCS, Assistant Secretary to British Resident of Perak; H. Berkeley, District Magistrate; G. Simpson, Police Inspector of Kuala Kangsar; J.D. Kemp, Manager of Rahman Hydrolic Tin Limited, Klian Intan and Keluong Wan Husain, a noble from Betong, Siam.\n\nThe reading of the proclamation was done by Wan Husain as the representative for the Kingdom of Siam, declaring the sovereignty transfer of the territory from Siam to British. It was followed by the flag exchange ceremony that symbolises the end of Siamese rule and beginning of the Perak sovereignty in the lower Reman area.\n\nThroughout its history, Reman was ruled by the descendants of Tuan Tok Nik Tok Leh, the founding father of Reman.\n\nA century rule of Reman has established a mark in the two separate territories (Yala and Hulu Perak) that once form an integral domain of the kingdom. The areas till today are marked by a Pattani-Reman influence, bind together with a common culture, linguistic and heritage as a result from the emigration from the Pattani lowlands during the Reman period.\n\nSeveral monuments can be witnessed as testaments of the former splendor of the Reman Kingdom. This includes Istana Singgah (The Visiting Palace), the palatial residence of the royal family in lower Reman. It is credited as one of the best example of the traditional architecture in the Kingdom. Located in Kampung Selarong, it was built in the late 19th century as a secondary palace away from the administrative centre of the kingdom in Kota Baru (in present-day Yala). The manor was once a fortress of Tuan Lebeh before he was being arrested by the Siamese authorities due to a suspected uprising plot for Pattani independence. The final resting place of Permaisuri Cik Neng, the Queen of Reman is also located nearby the palatial grounds, her death in 1915 was widely believed due to her devastation after the demise of the crown prince. The residence is currently privately owned by the descendants of Reman royal family.\n\nThe waves of migration from the plains of Pattani also bought a strong Pattani based linguistic heritage. The Reman dialect is largely based on Pattani form of Malay, nonetheless it has incorporated various peculiar features that denotes influence from the Thai language, Perakian and Kedahan Malay dialects. It constitute as a dialect continuum between the East and the West Coast Malay language. In Perak, the variant is also known locally as Longat Pattani Batu Kurau.\n\nVarious namesake of areas in Hulu Perak was derived from the Pattani settles to Reman, this includes Kroh (murky), a town that derives its name from the muddy reservoir built by the Reman settes to clean the domesticated elephants owned by the king. The area has been renamed as Pengkalan Hulu in 1985. While Gerik, a major settlement established in Reman during the rule of Tuan Jagong owes its name from \"Gerit\", an onomatopoeia for the sounds made by the Bamboo rat, a native rodent that can be found in abundance in area.\n\nThe Reman heritage is also widely survived in the local literature and folklore. Among the prominent literature that composed during the Reman period was a \"pantun\" crafted by Tuan Tok Nik Tok Leh to Raja Andak, the wife of Dato’ Seri Lela, the commander of the Perakian troops during the Perak-Reman war of 1826. The pantun between Tuan Tok Nik to Raja Andak narrated the forbidden love between the two parties from the two rivalling sides of the war. Another prominent figure of Reman oral literature includes Mengkong Dehela, a local warrior, he is a central figure that largely credited on leading and defending Reman territories. Details of his epic battles are largely recorded in the local lore.\n\nAnother visible legacy of the Reman period includes \"batu tanda\" (boundary marker), built in 1899 under the agreement between Perak and Reman, it signifies the historical border between the two states. The pillars still standing today despite a major border reformation in 1909, a reminder of the bygone era.\n\n"}

Traditionally the cross pattée has been associated with him, but in more recent times the Saint Patrick's Saltire has also been linked to him.\nSome authors have stated however, that Patrick is not entitled to have a cross as a symbol since he was not a martyr, unlike Saints George and Andrew.\n\nSaint Patrick's Saltire is a red saltire on a white field. It is used in the insignia of the Order of Saint Patrick, established in 1783, and after the Acts of Union 1800 it was combined with the Saint George's Cross of England and the Saint Andrew's Cross of Scotland to form the Union Flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. A saltire was intermittently used as a symbol of Ireland from the seventeenth century, but without reference to Saint Patrick.\n\nThe Pepys Library's collection of broadside ballads includes one from c.1690 called \"Teague and Sawney: or The Unfortunate Success of a Dear-Joys Devotion by St. Patrick's Cross. Being Transform'd into the Deel's Whirlegig.\" It describes an Irishman (Teague) and Scot (Sawney), both stereotypically blockheaded, encountering a windmill for the first time and arguing over whether it is Saint Andrew's Cross or Saint Patrick's Cross.\n\nSome of the Order of St Patrick's symbols were borrowed from the pre-existing Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, including the motto \"Quis separabit?\"; however, the \"Saint Patrick's Cross\" used in the Friendly Brothers' badge was not a saltire. A 1783 letter to a Dublin newspaper criticising the Order's use of a saltire, asserted that \"The Cross generally used on St Patrick's day, by Irishmen, is the Cross-Patee\". Whereas Vincent Morley in 1999 characterised the Friendly Brothers' cross as a cross pattée, the Brothers' medallist in 2003 said that the shape varied somewhat, often approximating a Maltese Cross. Varying illustrations of the badge figure in the Brothers' 1763 statute book, a 1786 letter to \"The Gentleman's Magazine\", and a 2008 photograph.\n\nThough both \"pattée\" and \"Patrick\" begin with \"pat-\", the words are unrelated.\n\nHenry Gough in 1893 noted that Ireland was represented by a harp in the flags of the Protectorate, but at Oliver Cromwell's funeral the national banners had crosses, Ireland's being a red cross on a gold field. Gough guesses Edward Bysshe may have co-opted the de Burgh Earl of Ulster arms for the purpose. Gough suggests it gained currency in subsequent decades; it was called Patrick's Cross and shown alongside those of George and Andrew in various documents, including a 1697 drawing of William III, and \"The Irish Compendium\" of 1722. A 1679 pamphlet account of heraldry states that the arms borne in the Crusades by the Irish Nation were \"a red Cross in a yellow Field\". In 1688, Randle Holme explicitly calls this (\"Or a Cross Gules\") \"St. Patrick's Cross\" \"for Ireland\". The County Galway unit of the Irish Volunteers in 1914 adopted a similar banner because \"it was used as the Irish flag in Cromwell's time\". The flag used by the King's Own Regiment in the Kingdom of Ireland, established in 1653, was a red saltire on a \"taffey\" yellow background. The origins of the regimental colours remain a mystery however.\n\nIn 1593–94, Irish Catholics in Habsburg Spain made unrealised plans for a \"military order of Saint Patrick\" to fight in the Nine Years' War, whose knights would wear a cross moline badge.\n\nA 1935 article states that during the Confederation, \"the true St. Patrick's Cross was carried as a square flag: a white cross on a green ground, with a red circle.\"\n\nAncient high crosses called \"Saint Patrick's cross\" existed at places with legendary associations with the saint: the Rock of Cashel, where he baptised Óengus mac Nad Froích, King of Munster. and Station Island, site of Saint Patrick's Purgatory, in Lough Derg, County Donegal. Until the 18th century there was a \"St Patrick's Cross\" in Liverpool, marking the spot where he supposedly preached before starting his mission to Ireland.\nThe arms of Ballina, County Mayo, adopted in 1970, include an image of \"St Patrick's cross\" carved on a rock in Leigue cemetery, said to date from Patrick's visit there in AD 441.\n\nIt was formerly a common custom to wear a cross made of paper or ribbon on St Patrick's Day. Surviving examples of such badges come in a variety of colours and they were worn upright rather than as saltires.\n\nThe second part of Richard Johnson's \"Seven Champions of Christendom\" (1608) concludes its fanciful account of St Patrick with, \"the Irishmen as well in England as in that Country, do as yet in Honour of his Name, keep one day in the Year Festival, wearing upon their Hats each of them a Cross of red Silk, in Token of his many Adventures, under the Christian Cross\". Irish soldiers stationed in Britain in 1628 reportedly wore red crosses on Patrick's Day \"after their country manner\".\n\nThomas Dinely, an English traveller in Ireland in 1681, remarked that \"the Irish of all stations and condicõns were crosses in their hatts, some of pins, some of green ribbon.\" Jonathan Swift, writing to \"Stella\" of Saint Patrick's Day 1713, said \"the Mall was so full of crosses that I thought all the world was Irish\". The crosses were also associated with Irish regiments, who were reported in 1682 to have been seen wearing crosses of red ribbon on St Patrick's Day; and with the English court, who were said to have worn crosses in honour of St Patrick on the saint's day in 1726. In the 1740s, the badges pinned were multicoloured interlaced fabric. In the 1820s, they were only worn by children, with simple multicoloured daisy patterns. In the 1890s, they were almost extinct, and a simple green Greek cross inscribed in a circle of paper (similar to the Ballina crest pictured). \"The Irish Times\" in 1935 reported they were still sold in poorer parts of Dublin, but fewer than those of previous years \"some in velvet or embroidered silk or poplin, with the gold paper cross entwined with shamrocks and ribbons\".\n\nOn the St. Patrick halfpenny, Patrick is depicted holding a crozier headed with a patriarchal cross.\n"}

{"id": "4669944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4669944", "title": "Lunar mansion", "text": "Lunar mansion\n\nA lunar mansion is a segment of the ecliptic (often called a station or house) through which the Moon passes in its orbit around Earth, often used by ancient cultures as part of their calendar system. In general, though not always, the zodiac is divided into 27 or 28 segments relative to the fixed stars – one for each day of the lunar month. (A sidereal month lasts about 27.3 days.) The Moon's position is charted with respect to those fixed segments. Since the Moon's position at given stage will vary according to Earth's position in its own orbit, the lunar mansions are an effective system for keeping track of the passage of seasons.\n\nVarious cultures have used sets of lunar mansions astrologically; for example, the Jyotisha astrological Nakshatras of Hindu culture, the Arabic manzils (\"manazil al-qamar\"), the 28 mansions of Chinese astronomy, and the 36 decans of Egyptian astronomy. Western astrology does not use mansions, but each zodiac sign covers 2 or 3 mansions. The Chinese system groups mansions into four groups related to the seasons.\n\nThe concept of the lunar mansions are considered to be Babylonian in origin. In his \"A History of Western Astrology\", Jim Tester explains that they appear in Hellenistic astrology in the 2nd-century list of fixed stars in the \"Katarchai\" by Maximus (the poet and astrologer, not to be confounded with Maximus of Tyre), the Arabic lists by Alchandri and Haly Abenragel, and a similar Coptic list with Greek names.\n\nTester believes that though they were known in Vedic India, all lists \"seem to betray\" transmission through Greek sources. Though pointing out that the Babylonians had well established lunar groupings by the 6th century BC, he also notes that the 28-mansion \"scheme was derived via Egyptian magic by the linking of the lists of lucky and unlucky days of the lunar month with the hemerologies and with the zodiac.\"\n\nThe 28 Lunar Mansions (Chinese: , \"Èrshí-Bā Xiù\") are the Chinese and East Asian form of the lunar mansions. They can be considered as the equivalent to the Western zodiac, although the 28 Mansions reflect the movement of the Moon through a sidereal month rather than the Sun in a solar year. In their final form, they embodied the astral forms of the Four Symbols: two real and two legendary animals important in traditional Chinese culture such as \"fengshui\".\n\nThe Nakshatras or Nákṣatras ( \"stars\") are the Indian form of the lunar mansions. They usually number 27 but sometimes 28 and their names are related to the most prominent constellations in each sector. They start from a point on the ecliptic precisely opposite the star Spica (Sanskrit: \"Chitrā\") and develop eastwards. In classical Hindu mythology, the creation of the nakshatras is attributed to Daksha. They were wives of Chandra, the moon god. The nakshatras of traditional bhartiya astronomy are based on a list of 28 asterisms found in the \"Atharvaveda\" (AVŚ 19.7) and also in the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\". The first astronomical text that lists them is the \"Vedanga Jyotisha\". The mansions are important parts of Indian astrology.\n\nIn the traditional Arabic astrological system, which was derived from the Indian \"nakshatra\" system, the moon was seen to move through 28 distinct \"manazil\" (singular: \"manzil\" = house) during the normal solar year, each \"manzil\" lasting, therefore, for about 13 days. One or more \"manazil\" were then grouped into a \"nawaa\" (plural \"anwaa\") which were tied to a given weather pattern. In other words, the yearly pattern was divided in the following manner: A year was divided into \"anwaa\", each of which was made up of one more \"manazil\", which were associated with a dominant star or constellation. These stars and constellations were sometimes, but not always, connected in some way to constellations in the Zodiac. Moreover, as the \"anwaa' repeat on a regular, solar cycle, they can be correlated to fixed points on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe following table is a breakdown of the \"anwaa\" and their position on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe dates above are approximate; notice that there are 2 days missing from a solar year in the table above.\n\nAlso, the following letters has no alphabetical value in numerology of the Abjad system known as \"\"Ilm ul-ʾAdad\".\" \n\nNotes of the table above in accordance to strict traditional Arab Islamic astronomy and theology:\n\n1) the Arabic alphabet resonates the alphabetical value in numerology of the Abjad system known as \"\"Ilm\" ul-\"ʾAdad\".\"\n\n2) the ‘Amal (Islamic view of angels - equivalent to rank of the \"Watcher\" or \"Guardian Angel\") is the Angel that rules the corresponding Arabic alphabet (rhythm of the alphabet in numerology of the Abjad system), manazilu ʾl-Qamar (lunar mansion) and constellation (i.e. zodiac sign).

{"id": "225886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225886", "title": "Maitreya", "text": "Maitreya\n\nMaitreya (Sanskrit), Metteyya (Pali), is regarded as a future Buddha of this world in Buddhist eschatology. In some Buddhist literature, such as the \"Amitabha Sutra\" and the \"Lotus Sutra\", he is referred to as Ajita.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, Maitreya is a bodhisattva who will appear on Earth in the future, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor to the present Buddha, Gautama Buddha (also known as Śākyamuni Buddha). The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya refers to a time in the future when the dharma will have been forgotten by most on the terrestrial world.\n\nMaitreya has also been adopted for his millenarian role by many non-Buddhist religions in the past, such as the White Lotus, as well as by modern new religious movements, such as Yiguandao.\n\nThe name \"Maitreya\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"maitrī\" \"loving-kindness\", which is in turn derived from the noun \"mitra\" \"friend\". The Pali form \"Metteyya\" is mentioned in the \"Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta\" (Digha Nikaya 26) of the Pāli Canon, and also in chapter 28 of the Buddhavamsa. Most of the Buddha's sermons are presented as having been presented in answer to a question, or in some other appropriate context, but this sutta has a beginning and ending in which the Buddha is talking to monks about something totally different. This leads scholar Richard Gombrich to conclude that either the whole sutta is apocryphal or that it has at least been tampered with.\n\nIn the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya was the most popular figure to be represented along with Gautama Buddha (often called \"Śākyamuni\" \"sage of the Shakya\"). In 4th to 6th-century China, \"Buddhist artisans used the names Shakyamuni and Maitreya interchangeably... indicating both that the distinction between the two had not yet been drawn and that their respective iconographies had not yet been firmly set\". An example is the stone sculpture found in the Qingzhou cache dedicated to Maitreya in 529 CE as recorded in the inscription (currently in the Qingzhou Museum, Shandong). The religious belief of Maitreya apparently developed around the same time as that of Amitābha, as early as the 3rd century CE.\n\nOne mention of the prophecy of Maitreya is in the \"\". It implies that he is a teacher of meditative trance sādhanā and states that gods, men and other beings:\nMaitreya is typically pictured seated, with either both feet on the ground or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, waiting for his time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a bhikṣu or Indian royalty. As a bodhisattva, he would usually be standing and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small stupa in his headdress that represents the stupa with relics of Gautama Buddha to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession and can be holding a dharmachakra resting on a lotus. A khata is always tied around his waist as a girdle.\n\nIn the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, Maitreya is represented as a northern Indian nobleman, holding a kumbha in his left hand. Sometimes this is a \"wisdom urn\" (Tibetan: \"Bumpa\"). He is flanked by his two acolytes, the brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu.\n\nThe \"\" was an extensive Buddhist play in pre-Islamic Central\nAsia. The \"Maitreyavyakarana\" (in Sataka form) in Central Asia and the \"Anagatavamsa\" of South India also mention him.\n\nMaitreya currently resides in the \"\" Heaven (Pāli: \"Tusita\"), said to be reachable through meditation. Gautama Buddha also lived here before he was born into the world as all bodhisattvas live in the Heaven before they descend to the human realm to become Buddhas. Although all bodhisattvas are destined to become Buddhas, the concept of a bodhisattva differs greatly in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. In Theravada Buddhism, a bodhisattva is one who is striving for full enlightenment (Arahantship in Pali), whereas in Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva is one who has already reached a very advanced state of grace or enlightenment but holds back from entering nirvana so that he may help others.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, Buddhas preside over pure lands, such as Amitābha over Sukhavati. Once Maitreya becomes a buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati pure land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the city of Varanasi (also known as Benares) in Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, Buddhas are born as unenlightened humans, and are not rulers of any paradise or pure land. Maitreya's arising would be no different from the arising of Gautama Buddha, as he achieved full enlightenment as a human being and died, entering parinibbana.\n\nIn Mahayana schools, Maitreya is traditionally said to have revealed the Five Treatises of Maitreya through Asanga. These texts are the basis of the Yogacara tradition and constitute the majority of the third turning within the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, each kalpa has 1,000 Buddhas. The previous kalpa was the \"vyuhakalpa\" (Glorious aeon), and the present kalpa is called the \"bhadrakalpa\" (Auspicious aeon). The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity (\"Saptatathāgata\") are seven Buddhas which bridge the vyuhakalpa and the bhadrakalpa:\n\nMaitreya will be the fifth and future Buddha of the bhadrakalpa, and his arrival will occur after the teachings of Gautama Buddha are no longer practiced.\n\nThe coming of Maitreya will be characterized by a number of physical events. The oceans are predicted to decrease in size, allowing Maitreya to traverse them freely. Maitreya will then reintroduce true dharma to the world.\n\nHis arrival will signify the end of the middle time, the time between the fourth Buddha, Gautama Buddha, and the fifth Buddha, Maitreya, which is viewed as a low point of human existence. According to the \"Cakkavatti Sutta: The Wheel-turning Emperor\", Digha Nikaya 26 of the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon, Maitreya Buddha will be born in a time when humans will live to an age of eighty thousand years, in the city of Ketumatī (present Varanasi), whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the palace where once dwelt King Mahāpanadā, but later he will give the palace away and will himself become a follower of Maitreya Buddha.\n\nThe scriptures say that Maitreya will attain \"bodhi\" in seven days (which is the minimum period), by virtue of his many lives of preparation for buddhahood similar to those reported in the Jataka tales.\n\nAt this time a notable teaching he will start giving is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds (killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views) and the ten virtuous deeds (the abandonment of: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views).\n\nThe Arya Maitreya Mandala, founded by Anagarika Govinda is based on the idea of the future coming of Maitreya.\n\nPali sources say that beings in Maitreya's time will be much bigger than during the time of Sakyamuni. In one prophecy his disciples are contemptuous of Mahakasyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Buddhas robe barely covers two fingers making them wonder how tiny Buddha was. Mahākāśyapa is said to be small enough in comparison to cremate in the palm of Maitreya's hand.\n\nAccording to the Lotus Sutra in Nichiren Buddhism, all people possess the potential to reveal an innate Buddha nature during their own lifetimes, a concept which may appear to contradict the concept of Buddha as savior or messiah.\n\nAlthough Maitreya is a significant figure in the Lotus Sutra, the explanation of Nichiren is that Maitreya is a metaphor of stewardship and aid for the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, as written in the Lotus Sutra:\n\nThe following list is just a small selection of those people who claimed or claim to be the incarnation of Maitreya. Many have either used the Maitreya incarnation claim to form a new Buddhist sect or have used the name of Maitreya to form a new religious movement or cult.\n\n\n\nAlthough a \"new Buddha\" was mentioned, these rebellions are not considered \"Maitreyan\" by modern scholars. However, they would be a later influence on the rebel religious leaders that made such claims. Therefore, it is important to mention these rebellions in this context.\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests that the Ming dynasty was named after the White Lotus figures of the \"Big and Little Bright Kings\".\n\n\n\nAlbeit not in the name of Maitreya, both rebellions were perpetrated solely or in part by the White Lotus Society, a rebellious Maitreya sect.\n\nSome have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from Mithra, the ancient Indo-Iranian deity. The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names, while a secondary comparison is that both were expected to come in the future.\n\nPaul Williams claims that some Zoroastrian ideas like Saoshyant influenced the beliefs about Maitreya, such as \"expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation\". Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya.\n\nIt is also possible that Maitreya Buddha originated with the Hindu Kalki, and that its similarities with the Iranian Mithra have to do with their common Indo-Iranian origin.\n\nIn theosophy, the theosophical Maitreya has multiple aspects signifying not just the future Buddha, but similar concepts from other religious or spiritual traditions.\n\nIn early 20th century, leading theosophists became convinced that an appearance of the Maitreya as a so-called \"World Teacher\" was imminent. A South Indian boy, Jiddu Krishnamurti, was thought to be destined as the \"vehicle\" of the soon-to-manifest Maitreya; however the manifestation did not happen as predicted, and did not fulfil theosophists' expectations.\n\nSince the growth of the theosophical movement in the 19th century, and influenced by theosophy's articulations on the Maitreya, non-Buddhist religious and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted the concept in their doctrines. Share International, which equates Maitreya with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that he is already present in the world, but is preparing to make an open declaration of his presence in the near future. They claim that he is here to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1930s, the Ascended Master Teachings placed Maitreya in the \"Office of World Teacher\" until 1956, when he was described as moving on to the \"Office of Planetary Buddha\" and \"Cosmic Christ\" in their concept of a Spiritual Hierarchy.\n\nIn 1911, Rudolf Steiner claimed \"Roughly three thousand years after our time the world will experience the Maitreya Buddha incarnation, which will be the last incarnation of Jeshu ben Pandira. This Bodhisattva, who will come as Maitreya Buddha, will also come in a physical body in our century in his reincarnation in the flesh — but not as Buddha — and he will make it his task to give humanity all the true concepts about the Christ Event.\" Steiner is careful to distinguish Jeshu ben Pandira as somebody entirely distinct from Jesus of Nazareth, as the Maitreya is entirely distinct from the Christ being. The Maitreya does work in support of the Christ being, as does Guatama, the current Buddha. \n\nThe Ahmadiyyas believe the 19th-century Mirza Ghulam Ahmad fulfilled expectations regarding the Maitreya Buddha.\n\nBahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfillment of the prophecy of appearance of Maitreya. Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52808837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52808837", "title": "Maya dedication rituals", "text": "Maya dedication rituals\n\nThe Classic Maya used dedication rituals to sanctify their living spaces and family members by associating their physical world with supernatural concepts through religious practice. The existence of such rituals is inferred from the frequent occurrence of so-called 'dedication' or 'votive' cache deposits in an archaeological context.\n\nCaches can be found in the Maya common places and public buildings, which contained objects made or found by commoners. More specifically, these caches were usually found in fields or family altars, and contained less valuable materials such as ceramic vessels, copal, food, and drink. These dedication cache materials relate more closely to household tasks, such as preparing food or working a field. The content and placement of these caches suggests a request for aid in acquiring daily necessities, such as food, as they dedicated their work places and homes to deities in exchange for a better harvest or other living needs. These contents also relate closely to the common mesoamerican idea that the people have an obligation to nourish the life-providing Earth as it does them.\n\nThe location of a cache in relation to others can also play a significant role in dedication rituals. At the Classic Maya site in Tonina, three caches covered by a circular stone mark the north, south, and center of a ballcourt alley. The north and south caches contained eight obsidian blades, likely used in bloodletting, whereas the center cache contained nine. The number nine represents death and the underworld, dedicating the ballcourt to those concepts and deity, as well as emphasizing the directions of the Earth. Including this example, caches mark the center of nine ballcourts across Belize, Chiapas, and Central Mexico. Ballcourts were commissioned by the elite, and hosted ritual activities for the elite and commoners, associating them with power and wealth. These caches then dedicated the ballcourts, including their power and rituals, to Classic Maya deities.\n\nDedication rituals through burial were most common in the Maya highlands, in which they were used to commemorate dead ancestors, make an offering to their deities, and give life or nourishment to the community or structure the ritual serves.\n\nIn Maya cultures, elites were buried as cremations in urns. Dedicated to their power, large ritual structures such as temples were built above these burials. The Maya Tikal Triple Ballcourt held two young female burials placed facing each other inside benches located under a central structure. Dedicatory burials are unique in that they utilize ancestors to worship ancestors, as well as provide an offering that had also once provided offerings to their deities, signifying both power and life-giving.\n\nBodily sacrifice was commonplace in dedication rituals, whether in bloodletting or sacrificing a war victim, one of the many sacrificial rituals employed in Mesoamerica and perhaps during war the chief's daughter just for good luck . Sacrifice specifically represents a returning of life to the Earth and deities, who were seen as life-providers for the Mesoamerican people. The importance of sacrifice in Classic Maya culture can be seen in Structure O-13 at Piedras Negras where vessels of obsidian blades, stingray spines, and other bloodletting utensils lined the pathway along the structure. These materials increased in count along the pathway, leading to a main room in which sacrifice rituals took place. These materials and their context clearly dedicate Structure O-13 to deity worship through sacrificial offerings.\n\nSacred writings were also used as dedicatory devices in ritual structures. The art of writing was controlled by the elite in Mesoamerica, and the skill passed down linearly. An example of this can be seen in Classic Maya Chichen Itza, in which elite women created architectural texts dedicating structures to their female ancestors and patron deities. These gender-specific deities were given significant attention through the dedication of structures in their possession. Structure 23 in Yaxchilan embodies this concept with sacred writings, often including an initial glyph, verb, noun, prepositional phrase, and most importantly, the name of a possessor of the structure. This is so significant in dedication ritual because writing the name of a possessor to which the structure is dedicated gives permanence to that ownership. The quality of permanence held in writing dedication rituals gives power and importance to the relationship it creates.\n\nAs the complement and counterpart of dedication ritual, termination ritual serves to destroy the link between a structure and the deity to which it was dedicated. In Temple XIV of Cerros, Belize, jade artifacts were found scattered and smashed on the floor of the temple, which had presumably once served in dedication caches for the same temple. Destroying these creations ceases their representation of the cosmos and religious ideas and ends the relationship between those ideas and the structure.\n\n"}

{"id": "573212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573212", "title": "Paul Twitchell", "text": "Paul Twitchell\n\nPaul Twitchell (born Jacob Paul Twitchell) (died September 17, 1971) was an American spiritual lecturer and writer, pulp fiction author, and founder of the religion known as Eckankar. He was accepted by the Eckankar members as the \"Mahanta\", the Living ECK Master from October 22, 1965 until his death. He created and directed the development of Eckankar as a new spiritual teaching. He stated in his writings that his spiritual name is Peddar Zaskq.\n\nPaul Twitchell obscured many details of his life. His year of birth is disputed, with 1908, 1910, 1912, 1920 and 1922 being suggested. It is given as 1908 in the Library of Congress Name Authority File. He was born in Paducah, Kentucky to Effie Dorothy and Jacob Noah Twitchell.\n\nTwitchell attended high school in Paducah. He then attended Murray State College, a teacher's college, for two years, before going to Western Kentucky State Teachers College until 1934. He failed to graduate from either of those colleges.\n\nTwitchell's first full-time paid job was as a painter, which he began in late 1936 via his father Jacob who worked as an Office Administrator at Marine Ways. His first marriage was to Camille Ballowe, from Paducah, in Providence, Rhode Island on August 12, 1942. He served in the United States Naval Reserve during World War II, from February 1942 until August 1945 when as Lieutenant Jg. he was honorably discharged. Twitchell became a correspondent for \"Our Navy\" magazine after the war for a short time. He later went on to become a freelance journalist.\n\nTwitchell investigated a number of diverse spiritual movements and became an avid reader of spiritual, philosophical, religious and occult books at the Library. In 1950, he joined Premananda Giri's Self-Realization Church of Absolute Monism, an offshoot of Paramahamsa Yogananda's Self-Realization Fellowship. He lived on the grounds of the church, and edited its periodical, \"The Mystic Cross\". He was asked to leave the church in July 1955, due to personal misconduct. A few months later he formally separated from his wife, who stayed on at the fellowship for a time. Their divorce was finalized in 1960.\n\nTwitchell was initiated by Kirpal Singh into Ruhani Satsang, a form of Surat Shabd Yoga or Sant Mat, in October 1955 in Washington DC. He immediately became a devoted student of Singh, acknowledged experiences during Initiation and later on wrote to his master of his appearing in Twitchell's apartment and dictating discourses to him which he would type up and mail to Singh in New Delhi, India. By 1966 reports to Singh that Twitchell was teaching a program very similar to Ruhani Satsang caused a serious disagreement between them which was never repaired. Weeks before Twitchell died he sent a letter to Singh denying he ever saw him as a 'master', denied that he ever received any initiation from Singh because Singh had no power to give initiation, and claiming that Twitchell's spiritual achievements were gained years before they met. Twitchell also suggested that he never spiritually benefited from his connection with Singh.\n\nHowever, in December 1963 Twitchell reportedly asked Singh to allow him to dedicate a book, \"The Tiger's Fang\", in Singh's name. Twitchell wanted Singh's help to get it published and sent the manuscript for Singh's approval. Twitchell never received a positive response from Singh and following their disagreement in 1966 he asked for its return. He published it himself in 1967.\n\nTwitchell's first known connection with L. Ron Hubbard (also a US Naval Reserve Officer during WW2 and pulp fiction author) was around 1950 during the Dianetics period. He again became involved in the Church of Scientology from about 1956 to 1959, becoming a member of the Church's staff and one of the first Scientologists to achieve the status of clear it was claimed. Twitchell taught classes, audited others, wrote articles for the magazines, and other activities for Scientology. He made many long term friendships during this time with the exception of Hubbard himself who later, circa 1968, listed Twitchell and Eckankar on their Suppressive Persons/Groups list.\n\nMoving to Seattle WA in late 1960 after the death of his sister Kaydee (Katharine) in 1959, he met Gail Ann Atkinson in 1962. She was working part-time at the Library, where they met, while doing an under-graduate degree. Twitchell later introduced her to the Ruhani Satsang teachings, as well as others, and Gail was also formally initiated by Singh in early December 1963 in San Francisco, during his second tour of the USA. At the same time Twitchell relocated to San Francisco permanently. They married soon after on January 16, 1964, when Twitchell began more seriously writing and compiling materials about his new teaching, Eckankar. The first draft manuscript for \"The Far Country\" was written during this year. Twitchell also began having articles about Eckankar published in various newspapers and magazines.\n\nIn late 1964, they moved south to San Diego, where Twitchell gave his first lectures on Eckankar and what was then termed the \"bilocation\" technique, which he would later call Soul Travel. Gail quit her studies to work full-time so that Twitchell could dedicate himself to establishing Eckankar as a new business venture. In spring 1965, he began a long-term series of regular lectures and workshops on Eckankar at the California Parapsychology Foundation in San Diego and also started selling monthly \"Discourses\" to interested students. By late 1965 the Twitchells had together founded the Eckankar Corporation as well as Illuminated Way Press, registering both as companies in California.\n\nSome people believe it was Twitchell's second wife who suggested that he adapt some of his spiritual education into a new religion. Twitchell said her encouragement was a spark for him to do something more with his writings. Critics state that at first Twitchell claimed his teachings were new but that he eventually referred to them as an ancient science that pre-dated all other major religious belief systems. Others say this interpretation is based on comments Twitchell made before he officially started Eckankar, when he was promoting what he called his Cliff-Hanger philosophy, which was an outsider's view on modern society. Those were indeed his own views and ideas. However, once he launched Eckankar in October 1965, he always referred to it as being an ancient teaching. In his book \"Eckankar: The Key to Secret Worlds\", Twitchell lays out wide-ranging examples of the teaching down through history, while also explaining his own personal experiences with his teacher, ECK master Rebazar Tarzs. The actual existence of \"Rebazar Tarzs,\" like that of other Theosophical and ECK masters, remains disputed, since he is not an historical figure, is not physically accessible, and has made no public appearance.\n\nAfter founding Eckankar, Twitchell wrote and published a series of books and personal study discourses, as well as giving talks around the world, writing thousands of letters to students, and continuing to write articles for magazines. He wrote a series of articles shortly after starting Eckankar that some critics have raised concerns about. In a series that Twitchell referred to as \"The Man Who Talks To God\", he poked fun at gurus, including himself. He says that he wrote the series in exchange for getting a booklet printed on Eckankar, during a time when he couldn't afford it himself. In that column he gave out spiritual advice, claiming to communicate with God about the problems of those who wrote to him. He included prophecy, predicting that the Vietnam War would end in 1968 and that Lyndon Johnson would be elected President of the United States for a second time. Many of his answers were concluded with the words \"I HAVE SPOKEN!\"\n\nTwitchell died of a heart attack on September 17, 1971 in Cincinnati while attending an Eckankar seminar. Despite having formulated the Eckankar doctrine of named succession, he had not in fact designated anyone as his successor and his sudden death created difficulties for the movement's leadership group. It fell upon his widow to make the final decision, and she selected Darwin Gross, who was himself succeeded later by Harold Klemp.\n\nIn 1984, Harold Klemp, the spiritual leader of Eckankar—which keeps an archive of Twitchell's writings—commented on Twitchell as a writer: \"He was an avid letter-writer, and he always kept a carbon copy... At one time Paul made his living by writing for pulp magazines. He also wrote public-relations copy for the Navy... He sincerely cared about spiritual unfoldment and growth. He went through volumes of books on consciousness, a subject which was not in vogue in those days... he thrived on the study of different philosophies.\" \n\nKlemp also describes Twitchell as a master compiler: \"The high teachings of ECK had been scattered to the four corners of the world. The different masters each had parts and pieces of it, but they attached little requirements... You must be a vegetarian, or you have to meditate so many hours a day... Paul gathered up the whole teaching and tool the best. Though it may be strange to say, in this sense I see him as a master compiler. He gathered the golden teachings that were scatted around the world and made them readily available to us.\" \n\nIn \"Paulji, A Memoir\", Patti Simpson reveals how Twitchell put her in charge of a monthly communication to students called the \"Mystic World\". It often contained many mistakes: stories that were supposed to continue on a certain page but didn't, stories stopping in mid-sentence, or the wrong names under pictures. Twitchell told her, \"You have no idea... how much help it will be to me if you can learn how to take care of this publication for me. I have so many books to get out, and I need to spend time on them.\" \n\nTwitchell told biographer Brad Steiger that he expected \"The Tiger's Fang\" to be controversial, having announced that it \"would shake the foundation of the teachings of orthodox religions, philosophies, and metaphysical concepts.\"\n\nIn a 2006 article published in the 5 volume \"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America\", David C. Lane, a former follower of Sant Mat, stated that some of Twitchell's Eckankar books contained passages from other authors' books without proper citation. In particular, Lane claims Twitchell's 1966 book \"The Far Country\" plagiarizes over 400 paragraphs from the books \"With a Great Master in India\" and \"The Path of the Masters\" by Julian Johnson without any acknowledgement. Three other books of Twitchell's, including \"The Tiger's Fang\", \"Letters to Gail\", and \"Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad\", contain \"almost verbatim\" extracts from Johnson's 1939 book \"The Path of the Masters\" according to Lane. Lane notes that Twitchell wrote in at least two publications that he considered a book edited by Johnson—\"Sar Bachan\"—to be his \"Bible\".\n\nHarold Klemp has responded to the plagiarism allegations by stating that Twitchell's role was that of \"master compiler\", saying \"He gathered the golden teachings that were scattered around the world and made them readily available to us.\"\nIn 2007, a member of Eckankar's clergy and Eckankar apologist since 1983, Doug Marman, published \"The Whole Truth\", a biography of Paul Twitchell that disputes claims Lane made in \"The Making of a Spiritual Movement\". \nLane has published commentary on Marman's book, reaffirming his view that Twitchell plagiarized several authors.\n\nLane has also alleged that Twitchell lied about his past and tried to cover up his earlier associations. Marman has responded by presenting documentation related to Twitchell's career and personal information.\n\n\n\n"}

The Tibetan term is a contraction: \"Mani\" itself is a contraction of Sanskrit \"cintamani\"; \"chos\" is Tibetan for \"Dharma\"; and \"khor\" or \"khorlo\" means \"chakrano\".\n\nThe earliest recorded prayer wheels were written of by a Chinese pilgrim around 400 C.E. in Ladakh. The concept of the prayer wheel is a physical manifestation of the phrase \"turning the wheel of Dharma,\" which describes the way in which the Buddha taught. Prayer Wheels originated from ‘The School of Shakyamuni sutra, volume 3 – pagoda and temple’ which states that, “those who set up the place for worship, use the knowledge to propagate the dharma to common people, should there be any man or woman who are illiterate and unable to read the sutra, they should then set up the prayer wheel to facilitate those illiterate to chant the sutra, and the effect is the same as reading the sutra”\n\nAccording to the Tibetan tradition, the prayer wheel lineage traces back to the famous Indian master, Arya Nagarjuna. Tibetan texts also say that the practice was taught by the Indian Buddhist masters Tilopa and Naropa as well as the Tibetan masters Marpa and Milarepa.\n\nAccording to the lineage texts on prayer wheels, prayer wheels are used to accumulate wisdom and merit (good karma) and to purify negativities (bad karma). In Buddhism, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have created a variety of skillful means (upaya) to help bring practitioners ever closer to realizing enlightenment. The idea of spinning mantras relates to numerous Tantric practices whereby the Tantric practitioner visualizes mantras revolving around the nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown. Therefore, prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing one's capacity for these types of Tantric visualizations. The spiritual method for those practicing with a prayer wheel is very specific (with slight variations according to different Buddhist sects). The practitioner most often spins the wheel clockwise, as the direction in which the mantras are written is that of the movement of the sun across the sky. On rare occasions, advanced Tantric practitioners such as Senge Dongma, the Lion-Faced Dakini, spin prayer wheels counterclockwise to manifest a more wrathful protective energy. As the practitioner turns the wheel, it is best to focus the mind and repeat the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra. Not only does this increase the merit earned by the wheel's use, but it is a mind-stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion. Intoning the mani mantra with mindfulness and the \"Bodhicitta\" motivation dramatically enhances the effects of the prayer wheel. However, it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits, and it is stated in the lineage text that even insects that cross a prayer wheel's shadow will get some benefit. Each revolution is as meritorious as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll, and this means that the more Om Mani Padme Hum mantras that are inside a prayer wheel, the more powerful it is. It is best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically. While turning smoothly, one keeps in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and \"bodhichitta\" (the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings).\nThe benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel are vast. Not only does it help wisdom, compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner, it also enhances siddhis (spiritual powers such as clairvoyance, precognition, reading others thoughts, etc.). The practitioner can repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the wheel, stabilizing a calm, meditative mind. At the end of a practice session, there is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that one may have gathered during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings. Then Om Ah Hum 3 times. This is customary with Tibetans upon completing any Buddhist practice, including the practice of the prayer wheel.\n\nThubten Zopa Rinpoche has commented that installing a prayer wheel has the capacity to completely transform a place, which becomes \"...peaceful, pleasant, and conducive to the mind.\"\nSimply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations.\n\nThe \"mani wheel\", or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, generally sheet-metal body (often beautifully embossed) mounted on a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of \"Turbinella\" (conch) shell. The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a metal weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist. The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case. The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras (Tib. \"mani\") rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan \"‘khor-lo\" than is “wheel” since it is thought that the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit. The Tibetan name of this device is mani-chos-'khor (མ་ནི་ཆོས་འཁོར་).\n\nThis type of prayer wheel is simply a prayer wheel that is turned by flowing water. The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into.\n\nThis wheel is turned by the heat of a candle or electric light. The light emitted from the prayer wheel then purifies the negative karmas of the living beings it touches.\n\nThis type of wheel is turned by wind. The wind that touches the prayer wheel helps alleviate the negative karma of those it touches.\n\nMany monasteries around Tibet have large, fixed, metal wheels set side by side in a row. Passersby can turn the entire row of wheels simply by sliding their hands over each one.\nSome prayer wheels are powered by electric motors. \"Thardo Khorlo,\" as these electric wheels are sometimes known, contain one thousand copies of the mantra of Chenrezig and many copies of other mantras. The Thardo Khorlo can be accompanied by lights and music if one so chooses\n\nElectricity can certainly be considered similar to the above sources of energy for PW (water, fire, wind). The merit generated by the PW is due to the power of the Dharma Texts and Mantras; not necessarily the \"power\" which rotates them. These PW turn all day, all night, all thru the year. The Lamas and practitioners who build, maintain and pay for the electricity rightly help to generate and dedicate the merit.\n\nIn another point of view, Lama Zopa Rinpoche has said, \"The merit of turning an electric prayer wheel goes to the electric company. This is why I prefer practitioners to use their own 'right energy' to turn a prayer wheel\".\n\n\n\n"}

More recently, the ephemeris includes some asteroids and the ‘centaur’ planet known as 2060 Chiron. \"Raphael’s Ephemeris\", the oldest of its kind, is published annually in a portable booklet and in large multi-year volumes.\n\nThe ephemeris is a table of the calculated positions of astronomical objects and various other data, usually for a specific time of the day, either noon or midnight. A uniform time measurement is needed to establish accuracy, and ephemerides will use variously Greenwich Mean Time, Universal Time or Ephemeris Time. Historically, the ephemeris was used for astrology and dates back to ancient Babylon. However, ephemerides became highly useful to navigators and astronomers, and were officially recognised by governments from about the early modern period. The first national astronomical ephemeris, \"Connaissance de Temps\", was published in France in 1679. In 1767 came the \"Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris\", which is issued annually by the British Royal Observatory at Greenwich.\nThere are different types of ephemerides, and a distinction needs to be made between those used for astronomy and those for astrology. In the former case, values based on right ascension and declination are obtained. Right ascension is longitude, measured eastwards, on the celestial equator – the earth’s equator projected into space to encircle the solar system. Declination is the other co-ordinate, measured north to south, on this hypothetical, great sphere.\n\nThe astrological ephemeris was developed for the purposes of setting up a birth chart, or horoscope, and converts positions of planets given in right ascension/declination into \"zodiacal longitude\". This is a planet’s position along the ecliptic –the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun, or the sun’s apparent path around a fixed, stationary earth. An astrological birth chart is geocentric, or earth-centred, calculated as if the earth was at a fixed point, with the zodiac ‘revolving’ around it.\n\nThe starting point for this is always the first point of spring (the vernal equinox) or 0º0' Aries, ending at 29º59' Pisces. This is the tropical zodiac, a ‘belt’ of sky extending about 8–9 degrees either side of the ecliptic. However, it should not be confused with the sidereal zodiac, which is the background of fixed stars, or constellations.\n\n\"Raphael’s Ephemeris\" was first issued as part of an almanac entitled \"The Prophetic Messenger\" in the early nineteenth century. ‘Raphael’, the name given to one of three archangels in the Old Testament, was in fact one Robert Cross Smith (1795–1832), a former carpenter who had developed an interest in astrology. Smith first used the pseudonym in 1824 when he edited a periodical called \"The Straggling Astrologer\", later re-published as \"The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century\". He also referred to himself as the ‘Royal Merlin’. \"The Straggling Astrologer\" was a relative failure, but by 1827 Smith had assumed editorship of \"The Prophetic Messenger\", which was read widely by astrologers of the day, and contributed to a renaissance of interest in astrology in the nineteenth century.\n\n\"Raphael’s Ephemeris\" was issued as a separate publication after Smith’s death, whilst others adopted and continued with the name ‘Raphael’. The second Raphael was John Palmer (1807–1837), a former student of Smith’s, who edited \"Raphael's Sanctuary of the Astral Art\" in 1834; the third was a Mr. Medhurst, the editor of the \"Prophetic Messenger\" between c. 1837–1847. Smith is sometimes confused with ‘Edwin Raphael’, who in fact was the pseudonym for the succeeding Raphael, (number four) a certain Mr. Wakeley (d. 1852). Number five was a Mr. Sparkes (1820–1875), editor of the \"Prophetic Messenger\" from 1852 to 1872, who even briefly edited \"Raphael’s Ephemeris\"’ main rival at the time, \"Zadkiel’s Almanac\". (‘Zadkiel’ was the pseudonym of Richard James Morrison, an astrologer/inventor whose almanac dates back to 1831.) Robert Thomas Cross (1850–1923) became the next Raphael, obtaining the copyright to the publication at some time in the 1870s.\n\nRobert Cross Smith was also responsible for popularising the system of astrological house division known as the Placidean, after the Italian monk Placidus de Titus (d. 1668). Placidus house tables, for locations in northern latitudes, are still listed in \"Raphael's Ephemeris\", nowadays issued by W. Foulsham, a British publisher founded in 1819. (They first published \"Raphael's\" in 1836.) The latest ephemerides have been calculated using data obtained from the astronomical ephemerides produced by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\n‘The Seven Faces of Raphael’, by Kim Farnell \nA Manual of Astrology, or The Book of the Stars, by Raphael (Robert Cross Smith) 1828. \nThe Familiar Astrologer, by Raphael (Robert Cross Smith) 1832. \nThe Guide to Astrology: containing a complete system of genethliacal astrology, by Raphael, 1905. \n"}
{"id": "14777706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14777706", "title": "Reasons to Believe", "text": "Reasons to Believe\n\nReasons to Believe (RTB) is a progressive creationist group that promotes day-age forms of old Earth creationism. It was founded in 1986 by Hugh Ross, a Canadian-born astrophysicist and creationist Christian apologist. The scientific community and skeptics dispute many of the claims RTB makes.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, the mission of RTB is to demonstrate that \"sound reason and scientific research—including the very latest discoveries—consistently support, rather than erode, confidence in the truth of the Bible and faith in the personal, transcendent God revealed in both Scripture and nature.\"\n\nReasons to Believe has 26 books published by Christian book publisher Baker Publishing. They have also written 1564 articles on the topic. RTB has held events all over the world. They have also produced many DVDs, TV shows, audio CDs, MP3s, podcasts, streaming media events and teleconferences. Their \"Science News Flash\" reviews news headlines of scientific discoveries. RTB educational programs include both credit and non credit classes.\n\nRTB claims to have a scientific model predicting an increase in astronomical evidence that Earth resides at the ideal location in the cosmos for both harboring advanced civilization and technology and making the universe observable. Nontheistic models predict that astronomical discoveries will show that Earth is unremarkable for both habitability and observation.\n\nThe RTB model also predicts that as scientists continue to research the causes and effects of plate tectonics, their findings will reveal evidence for the fine-tuning required for long-lasting, stable plate-tectonic activity on a planet with a thin atmosphere.\n\nThe RTB model predicts that future anthropological and genetic research will increasingly confirm that humans are biologically distinct rather than descended from a hominid species. It predicts stronger evidence for humanity's genetic, anatomical, and behavioral uniqueness. It places the earliest hominids at 6.5 million years ago and the first humans at around fifty thousand years ago.\n\nRTB also predicts that the flood of Noah was a local event. There is some evidence for a large flood in modern day Iraq around 2900 BCE.\n\nScientific models help researchers organize information into a conceptual structure to understand and interpret data, ask good questions, and identify anomalies. Famous scientific models include Einstein’s theory of relativity and the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. RTB's testable creation model fails to meet the modern qualifications for a scientific theory or model and just looks at known things and claims them as predictions.\n\nIn a review of an updated edition of \"Who Was Adam: A Creation Model Approach to the Origin of Humanity\" (2015) by Ross and Fazale Rana, research psychologist Brian Bolton argues against the scientific status of the RTB model. Bolton sees violations of scientific logic in the form of immunity to falsification, the assumption of supernatural causation, a lack of independent evaluations of evidence, circular reasoning, and the false equivalence of biblical creationism (faith-based) and human evolution (evidence-based) as scientific explanations.\n\nThe RTB claim that all current humans are descended from a specially created couple that lived about 50,000 years ago and that there is no common ancestor between humans and other primates is disputed in a scholarly essay by evangelical geneticist Dennis Venema. There is strong genetic and fossil evidence suggesting a common ape-man ancestor as well. There is also a reasoned argument against intelligent design in general.\n\nhttp://reasons.org/\n"}
{"id": "14123744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14123744", "title": "Religion in Belarus", "text": "Religion in Belarus\n\nReligion in Belarus has been traditionally Orthodox Christianity although there is also a sizeable Catholic minority. The legacy of the state atheism of the Soviet era is evident in the fact that a large part of the Belarusians are not religious. Moreover, other non-traditional and new religions have sprung up in the country after the end of the Soviet Union. According to the most recent data published in 2011 by the Ministry of the Interior, 48.3% of the Belarusians are Orthodox Christians, 41.1% are irreligious (atheists and agnostics), 7.1% are Catholics, and 3.5% are members of other religions.\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, Europe was generally divided into two large areas: the western area with dominance of Catholicism, and eastern with Orthodox and Byzantine influences. The border between them was roughly marked by the Bug River. This placed the area now known as Belarus in a unique position where these two influences mixed and interfered.\n\nBefore the 14th century, the Orthodox church was dominant in Belarus. The Union of Krewo in 1385 broke this monopoly and made Catholicism the religion of the ruling class. Jogaila, then ruler of Lithuania, part of which was Belarus, ordered the whole population of Lithuania to convert to Catholicism. 1.5 years after the Union of Krewo, the Wilno episcopate was created which received a lot of land from the Lithuanian dukes. By the mid-16th century Catholicism became strong in Lithuania and bordering with it north-west parts of Belarus, but the Orthodox church was still dominant in Belarus.\n\nIn the 16th century a crisis began in Christianity: the Protestant Reformation began in Catholicism and a period of heresy began in an Orthodox area. From the mid-16th century Protestant ideas began spreading in Lithuania, which included Belarus. The first Protestant Church in Belarus was created in Brest by Mikołaj \"the Black\" Radziwiłł. Protestantism did not survive due to the Counter-Reformation in Poland.\n\nThe revival of religion in Belarus in the post-communist era brought about a revival of the old historical conflict between Orthodoxy and Catholicism. This religious complexity was compounded by the two denominations' links to institutions outside the republic. The Belarusian Orthodox Church was headed by an ethnic Russian, Metropolitan Filaret, who headed an exarchate of the Moscow Patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Catholic archdiocese of Belarus was headed by an ethnic Pole, Cardinal Kazimir Sviontak, who had close ties to the church in Poland. However, despite these ties, Archbishop Sviontak, who had been a prisoner in the Soviet camps and a pastor in Pinsk for many years, prohibited the display of Polish national symbols in Catholic churches in Belarus.\n\nFledgling Belarusian religious movements are having difficulties asserting themselves within these two major religious institutions because of the historical practice of preaching in Russian in the Orthodox churches and in Polish in the Catholic churches. Attempts to introduce the Belarusian language into religious life, including the liturgy, also have not met wide success because of the cultural predominance of Russians and Poles in their respective churches, as well as the low usage of the Belarusian language in everyday life.\n\nTo a certain extent, the 1991 declaration of Belarus's independence and the 1990 law making Belarusian an official language of the republic have generated a new attitude toward the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Some religiously uncommitted young people have turned to the Uniate Church (Greek Catholic) in reaction to the resistance of the Orthodox and Catholic hierarchies to accepting the Belarusian language as a medium of communication with their flock. Overall, however, national activists have had little success in trying to generate new interest in the Greek Catholic Church.\n\nThe Greek Catholic Church, a branch of which existed in Belarus from 1596 to 1839 and had some three-quarters of the Belarusian population as members when it was abolished, is reputed to have used Belarusian in its liturgy and pastoral work. When the church was reestablished in Belarus in the early 1990s, its adherents advertised it as a \"national\" church. The modest growth of the Greek Catholic Church was accompanied by heated public debates of both a theological and a political character. Because the original allegiance of the Greek Catholic Church was clearly to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the reestablished church is viewed by some in the Orthodox Church in Belarus with suspicion, as being a vehicle of both Warsaw and the Vatican and an encouragement of distance from Moscow.\n\nBefore 1917 Belarus had 2,466 religious communities, including: 1,650 Orthodox, 127 Catholic, 657 Jewish, 32 Protestant, and several Muslim communities. Under the communists, the activities of these communities were severely restricted. Many religious communities were destroyed and their leaders exiled or executed; the remaining communities were sometimes co-opted by the government for its own ends, as in the effort to instill patriotism during World War II.\n\nIn 1993 one Belarusian publication reported the numbers of religious communities as follows: 787 Orthodox, 305 Catholic, 170 Pentecostal, 141 Baptist, 26 Old Believer, 17 Seventh-Day Adventist, 9 Apostolic Christian, 8 Greek Catholic, 8 New Apostolic, 8 Muslim, 7 Jewish, and 15 other religious groups.\n\nA 2015 Pew Research Center survey based on a sample of 1000 people found that 94% of them declared to be Christians, 3% to be irreligious—a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who described their religion as \"nothing in particular\", while 3% belonged to other faiths. The Christians were divided between 73% who declared to be Eastern Orthodox, 12% Catholics, and 9% other Christians.\n\nAlthough the Russian Orthodox Church was devastated during World War II and continued to decline until the early 1980s because of government policies, it underwent a small revival with the onset of perestroika and the celebration in 1988 of the 1,000- year anniversary of Christianity in Russia. In 1990 Belarus was designated an exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, creating the Belarusian Orthodox Church. In the early 1990s, 60 percent of the population identified themselves as Orthodox. The church had one seminary, three convents, and one monastery.\n\nSoviet policies toward the Catholic Church were strongly influenced by the Catholics' recognition of an outside authority, the pope, as head of the church, as well as by the close historical ties of the church in Belarus with Poland. In 1989 the five official Catholic dioceses, which had existed since World War II and had been without a bishop, were reorganized into five dioceses (covering 455 parishes) and the archdiocese of Minsk and Mahilyow. In the early 1990s, figures for the Catholic population in Belarus ranged from 8 percent to 20 percent; one estimate identified 25 percent of the Catholics as ethnic Poles. The church had one seminary in Belarus.\n\nAt the beginning of 2005, the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church had 20 parishes, of which 13 had obtained state recognition. As of 2003, there have been two Belarusian Greek Catholic parishes in each of the following cities - Minsk, Polatsk and Vitsebsk; and only one in Brest, Hrodna, Mahiliou, Maladziechna and Lida. The faithful permanently attached to these came to about 3,000, while some 4,000 others lived outside the pastoral range of the parishes. Today there are 16 priests, and 9 seminarians. There is a small Studite monastery at Polatsk. The parishes are organized into two deaneries, each headed by an archpriest. The Abbot of the Polatsk monastery serves as the dean of the eastern deanery. There is no eparch (bishop) for the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church. Archimandrite Sergius Gajek, MIC, is the Apostolic Visitator for the Greek-Catholic Church in Belarus. Worship is in the Belarusian language.\n\nBefore World War II, the number of Protestants in Belarus was quite low in comparison with other Christians, but they have shown growth since then. In 1917, there were 32 Protestant communities. In 1990, there were more than 350 Protestant communities in the country.\n\nThe first Jewish communities appeared in Belarus at the end of the 14th century and continued to increase until the genocide of World War II. Mainly urban residents, the country's nearly 1.3 million Jews in 1914 accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the population in cities and towns. The Soviet census of 1989 counted some 142,000 Jews, or 1.1 percent of the population, many of whom have since emigrated. Although boundaries of Belarus changed from 1914 to 1922, a significant portion of the decrease was the result of the war. In late 1992, there were nearly seventy Jewish organizations active in Belarus, half of which were country-wide.\n\nMuslims in Belarus are represented by small communities of ethnic Tatars. All of them are followers of Sunni Islam. Some of these Tatars are descendants of emigrants and prisoners of war who settled in Belarus, from the Volga Region, after the 11th century. In 1997 there were 23 Muslim communities, including 19 of those in the Western regions of Belarus.\n\nPaganism in Belarus is mostly represented by Rodnovery, the Slavic neopaganism. Uladzimir Sacevič is a Rodnover leader.\n\n"}
{"id": "12705711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12705711", "title": "Religion in Malaysia", "text": "Religion in Malaysia\n\nMalaysia is a multicultural and multiconfessional country, whose official religion is Islam. As of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices Islam; 19.8 percent Buddhism; 9.2 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; and 3.4 percent traditional Chinese religions. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including Animism, Folk religion, Sikhism, Baha'i Faith and other belief systems. Numbers of self-described atheists in Malaysia are few; the state has come under criticism from human rights organisations for the government's discrimination against atheists, with some cabinet members saying that \"the freedom of religion is not the freedom from religion\".\n\nIslam in Malaysia is represented by the Shafi'i version of Sunni theology and the practice of any other form of the religion (such as Shia Islam) is heavily restricted by the government. The Federal Constitution as the Supreme Law makes Islam as the \"religion of the Federation\". Malaysian Chinese practice various faiths: Mahayana Buddhism and Chinese traditional religions (including Taoism). Hinduism is practised by the majority of Malaysian Indians. Christianity has established itself in some communities, especially in East Malaysia. It is not tied to any specific ethnic group.\n\nRelations between different religious groups are generally quite tolerant. Eids, Christmas, Lunar New Year, and Deepavali have been declared national holidays. Various groups have been set up to try to promote religious understanding among the different groups, with religious harmony seen as a priority by Malaysian politicians.\n\nAll the world's major religions have substantial representation in Malaysia. The Population and Housing Censuses figures shows approximately these proportions of the population following these religions:\n\nAll the Malaysian Malay people are Muslim by law. Most Malaysian Chinese follow Mahayana Buddhism or Chinese traditional religions (including Taoism, Confucianism, ancestor-worship or newer sects). Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 83.6% of Malaysia's ethnic Chinese identify as Buddhist, with significant numbers of adherents following Taoism (3.4%) and Christianity (11.1%). Actually, the percentage of practitioners of the Chinese folk religions may be higher, as many practise both Buddhism and folk religions.\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion of the non-Malay Bumiputra community (46.5%) with an additional 40.4% identifying as Muslims. Many indigenous tribes of East Malaysia have converted to Christianity, although Christianity has made fewer inroads into Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia is a multi-religious society, the Malaysian constitution does not guarantee freedom of religion, Islam is the official religion of the federation, as well as the legally enforced faith of all ethnic Malays. No ethnic Malay is allowed to leave Islam, while non-Malay Muslims seeking to apostacise require permission from a sharia court, which is never granted. Religious beliefs follow ethnic lines. Holidays have been declared for holy days in numerous religions, although only Islam has more than one national holiday. Whether a religion obtains approval of the government is determined by the Registrar of Societies, part of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Only upon approval do they qualify for government benefits. However, unrecognised groups such as the Falun Gong can practise by registering themselves under the Companies Act, although this means that technical violations of the act can result in a fine.\n\nThe government believes the constitution provides a strong enough guarantee of religious freedom and should not be changed. Some restrictions are made on Malay texts from non Islamic religions in Peninsula Malaysia, however there are much less restrictions in East Malaysia. The Hijab are mandatory for non-Muslims in certain situations. The MyKad identity card states whether the holder is a Muslim or not.\n\nAs Islam is the state religion, the government provides financial support to Islamic establishments and forced the Sunni form of Islam. State governments imposes a few Islamic law on Muslims, and the government will offer grants to private Muslim schools that allow a government-approved curriculum and supervision. The government also indirectly funds non-Islamic communities, although to a much smaller degree. The government interferes with the religious practices of non-Muslim communities. Public schools offer an Islamic religious instruction course which is compulsory for Muslim students, and non-Muslim students take a morals and ethics course.\n\nThe government prohibits any publications that it feels will incite racial or religious disharmony, and has asked that religious matters not be discussed in public due to their sensitivity. It claims nobody has been arrested under the Internal Security Act for religious reasons. The government may demolish unregistered religious places of worship, and nongovernmental organisations have complained about the demolition of unregistered Hindu temples. These were often constructed on privately owned plantations prior to independence in 1957. After independence plantations became government property. In 2006 the state of Negeri Sembilan announced the demolition of a Hindu temple, although the temple sought injunction and took it to court. State governments control mosques, appoint imams, and provide guidance for sermon content. The conflict between the federal and state governments over religious authority led to a slow pace of reform and development of laws relating to Islam. Other religious groups, such as the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST), have supported political rallies.\n\nBoth Barisan Nasional (BN) and the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) party have attempted to deliver political messages using mosques in the states they govern. All civil servants must attend government-approved religion classes. BN has banned opposition-affiliated imams from mosques, enforced restrictions on sermons, replaced opposition sympathetic mosque leaders and governing committees, and closed down unauthorised mosques affiliated with the opposition. The state government of Selangor in August 2005 withheld visas from foreign imams to try to increase the number of local imams. PAS, which controls the state of Kelantan restricts imams affiliated with BN from their mosques. It is thought that support for a moderate Islam led to the 2004 election victory of BN over PAS in the state of Terengganu. Both parties became more Islamic in the 1980s and 1990s to try to obtain more of the Malay vote. Political problems are often portrayed as religious issues.\n\nDespite the recognition of Islam as the state religion in the constitution, when created it was explicitly noted that the status was merely a symbolic one. It was not seen as something to be used as a basis of law, except by some Malay nationalists. Currently a dispute exists between those who promote a secular interpretation of the federal constitution and those who believe Shariah courts and Islamic law should have supremacy. The movement towards a more Islamic society, known as dakwah, is often viewed as an effort to resist western influences. Secular values are often favoured by the Malay elite, who welcome the shared goals of industrial development. It is however opposed by Muslims who see it as an invasion of western culture and worldview.. Support for a more Islamic society often comes from the more rural population of Malays.\n\nAs modernisation has increased, it has brought along with it an increase in secularism. In urban areas, the switch to more western dress such as miniskirts and jeans is of concern to religious authorities. Nightclubs and bars thrive in the cities. However, in the time since independence other areas have become more islamicised. At the time of independence women wore tight-fitting outfits, but now wear headscarves. Muslim prayers are played through the speaker systems of government buildings, and some feel Malaysia is becoming a more Islamic than secular state, with critics complaining that Islam is gaining greater influence in governance. The issue of how the Malay identity should be developed has increasingly come under debate. While the ruling government believes that attaining economic power will empower the Malay population, PAS sees that as an erosion of Islamic values. However, PAS is often seen as to not be able to relate Islamic beliefs to modern society, especially in multicultural Malaysia. \n\nHistorically Malaysia was considered secular, with the first prime minister stating \"this country is not an Islamic state as it is generally understood. In September 2001 debate was caused by then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's announcement that Malaysia was already an Islamic State. In 2007 Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi first called Malaysia an Islamic state. Earlier that month he had made another statement, saying Malaysia was neither a theocratic or secular state. A similar statement was made by Prime Minister on 12 March 2009, where he stated Malaysia was a \"negara Islam\". The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), a political group representing Malaysian Chinese, expressed reservations over this announcement. The MCA's position is that Malaysia is a fully secular state, and that the law transcends religion. The Prime Minister has asserted the continuing debate about secularism has been caused by opposition parties to advance their own political interests.\n\nWhen PAS was defeated in Terengganu, enforcement of female dress codes was reduced. The state PAS government in Kelantan bans traditional Malay dance theatres, banned advertisements depicting women who are not fully clothed, and enforced the wearing of headscarves, although they allowed gender segregated cinemas and concerts. Some government-controlled bodies pressure non-Muslims to also wear headscarves, and all students of the International Islamic University of Malaysia and female officers in the Royal Malaysian Police are required to wear headscarves in public ceremonies.\n\nFreedom of religion, despite being guaranteed in the constitution, faces many restrictions in Malaysia. Legally, a Malay in Malaysia must be a Muslim. Non-Malays are more free to shift between religions. Attempts by Muslims to convert to other religions are punished by state governments, with punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment. The federal government does not intervene in legal disputes over conversion, leaving it to the courts. The secular courts of Malaysia have ruled they do not have the authority to decide these cases, referring them to the Syariah courts. These Islamic courts have unanimously ruled that all ethnic Malays must remain Muslims. Even non-Malays who have converted to Islam are not allowed to leave Islam, and children born to Muslim parents are considered to be Muslims. A non-Muslim who wishes to marry a Muslim must first convert to Islam.\n\nMany Muslims who have attempted to convert have received death threats. Those who have converted lead a secret double life. The civil court claims that conversions are under the jurisdiction of the Syariah courts, but converts contend that as they are no longer Muslim the Syariah courts hold no power over them. Authorities only allow Sunni Islam to be practised, arresting those who stray from those beliefs. Converts taken to be rehabilitated by Islamic authorities are forced to dress and act as Muslims. In at least one case a professed Hindu, who was listed as a Muslim because her parents were even though she was raised by her grandmother as a Hindu, was forced to eat beef. Only one person is known to have had their conversion from Islam accepted, an 89-year-old woman who converted to Buddhism in 1936 and had her decision accepted after her death in 2006.\n\nThe debate over laws about conversion has been strong in academic and political circles, with the many non-Muslims against the law conflicting with the Muslim group who strongly support the law, causing the government a dilemma. It is illegal to disseminate any non-Islamic religious material to Muslims. The PAS party wishes that the death penalty be enacted for Muslims who attempt to convert, as part of their ultimate desire to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state.\n\nIn recent years, there have been some issues over non-Muslims eating during Muslim fasting month, religious terminology used by non-Muslims, and non-Muslim religious sites affected by intolerant Muslim authorities.\n\nThe separate religious communities have a generally tolerant relationship. Festivals are held for all major religions, which are participated in by people from that religion and others in a Malaysian practise known as 'Open House'. Malaysia has a reputation for being a successful multicultural country, with the only two serious occurrences of racial violence in modern history occurring in 1946 and 1969. Other countries have examined Malaysia as an example for handling Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nHowever, some politicians allege that there is a creeping Islamisation of Malaysian society, and due to the links between race and religion it is thought the economic status of different races causes many religious problems. The predominance of Islam and its slow spread into everyday life in Malaysia has caused worry for non-Muslim groups. The Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in 2004 appeared at a Christian gathering to read from the Bible and called for religious unity despite differences. This was done at a time when Malaysia was head of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nIn February 2005 the Malaysian Bar Council organised the discussion of an interfaith commission, although several Islamic groups refused to participate claiming the commission would \"weaken Islam\". Several Muslim groups boycotted and condemned an interfaith council, claiming Islam should only be discussed by Muslims. The government states the commission was not necessary, but encourages and promotes interfaith dialogue. Some non-Muslim interfaith organistaions do exist, such as the MCCBCHS, the Malaysian Council of Churches, and the Christian Federation of Malaysia.\n\nIn 2006 a memorandum was presented to the prime minister by non-Muslim cabinet members asking for a review of constitutional provisions affecting the rights of non-Muslims. After protests by Muslim leaders in the governing coalition, this was withdrawn. It is forbidden for non-Muslims to try to convert Muslims, although Muslims are allowed to convert others. Malay politicians have asked the Chinese and Indian communities not to question Malay rights, for fear of igniting ethnic violence, with harmony between the races and religions being seen as a necessity.\n\nIslam is the predominant religion of the country and is recognised as the state's official religion. It is practised by about 60 per cent of Malaysians. Many Muslim holy days are national holidays, including the end of Ramadan, the end of the Hajj, and the birthday of Mohammad. Islam is thought to have been brought to Malaysia around the 12th century by Indian traders. In the early 15th century the Malacca Sultanate, commonly considered the first independent state in the peninsula, was founded. Led by a Muslim prince the influence of Malacca led to the spread of Islam throughout the Malay population.\n\nAlthough most people in Malaya were Muslim by the 15th century, the tolerant form of Islam brought by the Sufi meant that many traditional practices were incorporated into Islamic traditions. Islam is generally practised liberally, although in the last 20 years strict adherence to Islamic practice has increased. The official code of Islam in Malaysia is Sunni, and the practice of any other form of Islam is heavily restricted. The government opposes what it calls \"Deviant\" teachings, forcing those who are deemed to follow these teachings to undergo \"rehabilitation\". In June 2006, 56 deviant teachings had been identified by the certain state religious authorities, including Shi'a, transcendental meditation, and Baha'i teachings. However, Department of Islamic Development Malaysia later clarified that Baha'i Faith was erroneously declared a deviant offshoot of Islam by one of the state religious authorities as the 14th Muzakarah (Conference) of the Fatwa Committee of the National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs Malaysia held on 22–23 October 1985 decided that the Baha'i doctrine is not part of Islam and the religion is recognised by the Registration Department and national census as an independent religion.\n\nIn June 2005 religious authorities reported that there were 22 \"deviant\" religious groups with around 2,820 followers in Malaysia. No statistics are given on rehabilitations, and the government actively monitors Shi'a groups. Restrictions have been imposed on Imams coming from overseas.\n\nThe Malaysian government promotes a moderate version of Sunni Islam called \"Islam Hadhari\". \"Islam Hadhari\" was introduced by former Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. It is meant to encourage a balanced approach to life, and encourages inclusivity, tolerance, and looking outwards. The qualities it values are knowledge, hard work, honesty, good administration, and efficiency. The Islamic party PAS desires a stricter interpretation of Islam and the promotion of Islamic law. Due to Islam being the state religion, many mosques and other religious services are supported by the government. Control of the mosques is usually done on a state rather than a federal level. The charitable Zakāt tax is collected by the government, and the government supports those wishing to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. In 1985 Kassim Ahmed wrote a book called \"\" which promoted Quranism, but it was subsequently banned by the Malaysian government.\nPer Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia one must be Muslim to be considered Malay. In practice, Muslims cannot convert to another religion due to the Shari'a courts denying conversion claims, and if a Malay did convert they would lose their status as bumiputera. People of non-Muslim origins are required to convert to Islam if they marry a Muslim person. Public schools are required to offer Islamic religious instruction, although alternative ethics classes are provided for non-Muslims. Many women wear the tudong, which covers the head but leaves the face exposed, although there is no law requiring this. Islamic police monitor the Muslim population. Regulation of sexual activities among the Muslim population is strict, with laws prohibiting unmarried couples from occupying a secluded area or a confined space, to prevent suspicion of acts considered islamically immoral.\n\nMuslims are obliged to follow the decisions of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected to follow the Shafi`i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia. These courts apply Sharia law. The jurisdiction of Shariah courts is limited only to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are under the jurisdiction of the Shariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts (including the Federal Court) do not hear matters related to Islamic practices. Cases concerning a Muslim and a non-Muslim are usually handled by the civil courts, although in cases such as child custody or property settlement the non-Muslim has no say.\n\nMany Malaysian Chinese practice various faiths, including Mahayana and other sects of Buddhism, the Chinese folk religions, Confucianism and Daoism. Although Buddhism was influential prior to the arrival of Islam, the majority of the current Chinese population arrived during British rule of Malaya. Chinese New Year is celebrated as a national holiday. For many Chinese, religion is an essential part of their cultural life.\n\nIt is rare for any Malaysian Chinese to be an absolute follower of a particular belief. Many nominally claim membership in a certain belief, yet respect beliefs from multiple religions into their lives. The Chinese traditional religion has become a strong influence in life, and new sects have arisen trying to integrate different religious teachings. Beliefs in Malaysia have also often adopted influence from local animism.\n\nAround 19% of the current population classify themselves as Buddhist. Each religious building is autonomous, and most Malaysian Chinese follow the Mahayana branch, while Thai and Sinhalese minorities in Malaysia follow the Therevada branch. A Malaysian Buddhist Council has been created to promote the study and practice of Buddhism and promote solidarity among Malaysian Buddhists. Vesak day is a national holiday, and joint celebrations take place in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor by both branches of Buddhism.\n\nChinese temples mostly enshrine gods from the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. Malaysia has over 150 Daoist temples served by 12000 priests, with the Daoist communities sharing links with those in Taiwan and Mainland China. Although the religion is not as organised as others, a Malaysia Daoist Association was formed in 1995 and a Daoist Organisation League was formed in 1997.\nA Chinese population known as the Hui people practised Islam yet retained Chinese culture and have unique traditions. Communities existed in Singapore, Pangkor Island, and Sitiawan before the Second World War. The last established community, in Penang, was dispersed when they were evicted from their homes due to development projects.\n\nIn 2013, a video of a group of Buddhist practitioners from Singapore conducting religious ceremonies in a surau had become viral on Facebook. Malaysian police have arrested a resort owner after he allowed 13 Buddhists to use a Muslim prayer room(surau) for their meditation at Kota Tinggi, Johor. The incident has been a frown upon Muslims in Malaysia. It has also become a hot topic in the social media. Following up at 28 August 2013, the controversial prayer room was demolished by the resort management within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice after much protests by the residents of Kota Tinggi. At the time, Syed Ahmad Salim, the resort owner explained that he had allowed the group of Buddhists to use the surau for a meditation session as he was unaware that it was an offence.\nThe majority of the Tamils who make up 9% of Malaysia's population practice Hinduism. Hinduism was influential prior to Islam, but current adherents are mostly descended from migrant communities from Tamil Nadu who came to Malaya to work on British rubber plantations. A small community of migrants from North India also exists.\n\nUrban temples are often dedicated to a single deity, while rural temples are often home to many different deities. Most were brought with immigrants. Most temples follow the Saivite tradition from Southern India, for the worship of Siva. The Hindu holiday of Thaipusam and Deepavali is a national holiday. Practice of the Hindu religion is strongly linked with the cultural identity of Malaysian Indians. Those who convert to another religion may be ostracised by their family and the Indian community.\n\nThere is growing anger in the Hindu community over what they believe is a government-backed drive to demolish Hindu temples under the guise that they are illegal structures. The Hindu Rights Action Force, a coalition of 50 Hindu-based NGOs, has accused the government of an unofficial policy of \"temple cleansing\", with much of the demolition focused around the capital city, Kuala Lumpur. An Indian minister in the cabinet even threatened to boycott Deepavali in response to these demolitions.\n\nAbout 10% of the population of Malaysia are Christians, mostly non-Malay Bumiputera, also including some Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian minorities. The most common denominations are Anglican, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. Most Christians are found in East Malaysia, where Good Friday is a public holiday in the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Christmas is a national holiday, although Easter is not.\n\nTraders with links to Christianity from the Middle East arrived in what is now Malaysia in the 7th century. Catholicism was brought by the Portuguese in the 15th century, followed by Protestantism with the Dutch in 1641. As Portuguese influence declined Protestantism began to eclipse Catholicism. Christianity spread further through missionaries who arrived during British rule in the 19th century and introduced Christianity to East Malaysia. Initial conversions focused mainly on the Straits Settlements. When missionaries began to spread through the peninsula, they were discouraged from converting Malays, focusing on Chinese and Indian immigrants.\n\nChristianity has become restricted as Malaysia has become more Islamic. Restrictions have been placed on the construction of new churches, although existing ones are allowed to operate. Christians are not allowed to attempt the conversion of Muslims and their literature must have a note saying it is for non-Muslims only. Similarly, the film \"The Passion of the Christ\" was restricted only to Christian viewers. In April 2005 two Christians were arrested for distributing Christian material in front of a mosque, although charges were later dropped. The restrictions of the dissemination of Malay-language Christian material is much less strict in East Malaysia than in the west. Good Friday is also an official holiday in East Malaysia, although not a national one.\n\nThe use of the Malay word \"Allah\" for God has caused a dispute in Malaysia, with Malay language Bibles banned due to the use of this word. It was argued that as the Bibles could be used to spread religions other than Islam, they were against the constitution. Other ministers opposed this discrimination. In 2005 Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz tried to enforce this, although some of his ministers argued the national language could be used for any purpose. The Bible in the indigenous Iban language was allowed, as that language has no alternate word besides \"Allah\" for God.\n\nA small Sikh community exists in Malaysia, brought by the British to form police units. They follow Sikhism, and open their places of worship to all races ages and genders. No Sikh holiday has been declared a national holiday, although there are 120,000 in the country. Sikhs have, like Christians, come under pressure not to use the word \"Allah\" for God in their religious texts.\n\nA small Jewish community existed on the island of Penang. Jews first came into contact with the Malay peninsula during the 11th century when Jewish traders traded with the Kedah Sultanate and Langkasuka. Many Jews in Malaysia came from Persia. After the communist revolution in China, more Jews fled to Southeast Asia. However, the Jewish community declined, with many emigrating to countries such as Australia. Due to not having enough members to hold some Jewish rituals, the only synagogue in Penang, established in 1932, was shut down in 1976. The last burial in Penang's Jewish cemetery took pace in 1978. By the 1990s the community had disappeared, and it is now thought that there are only two Jews who hold Malaysian passports.\n\nA small Bahá'í group exists in Malaysia, with members from Chinese, Eurasian, Indian, Indigenous communities. It was introduced to Malaya by an Iranian couple in 1950, with the first National Spiritual Assembly being elected in 1964. A community of around 2500 Jains lives in Malaysia, with the state of Ipoh hosting the only Jain temple in Southeast Asia. Most are Gujaratis, who are thought to have arrived in Malacca in the 15th or 16th century.\n\nTraditional beliefs are still practised by the Orang Asal people. Loosely classified as animism, the beliefs are not recognised by the state as a religion. Animistic beliefs are passed down through oral tradition due to the lack of a writing system in indigenous groups, who call their beliefs \"agama adat\" (traditional or customary religions). The different religions are rather varied, with different names and concepts for their supreme god and other supernatural deities. Most of the beliefs are heavily influenced by the environment, with physical features such as mountains, trees, valleys, and rivers being sacred. A close relationship with nature is nurtured, and the relationship of humans and nature is a strong part of the religion, with everyday activities such as hunting and gathering having spiritual significance.\n"}
{"id": "5527885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5527885", "title": "Religion in Taiwan", "text": "Religion in Taiwan\n\nReligion in Taiwan is characterised by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices, predominantly those pertaining to Chinese culture. Freedom of religion is inscribed in the constitution of the Republic of China. According to the census of 2005, 35% of the population adhered to Buddhism, 33% to Taoism (including local religion), 3.9% to Christianity, 18.7% identified themselves as not religious, and approximately 10% were adherents of folk religious movements of salvation (among them 3.5% adhered to Yiguandao).\n\nMany statistical analyses try to distinguish between Buddhism and Taoism in Taiwan, which, along with Confucianism, are rather aspects within broader \"Chinese religion\". It is hard to make such distinction because various Taoist deities are worshipped alongside deities which originated in Buddhism, for instance Guanyin, in many temples across the country.\n\nPrior to the 17th century the island of Taiwan was inhabited by the Taiwanese aborigines of Austronesian stock, and there were small settlements of Chinese and Japanese maritime traders and pirates. Taiwanese aborigines traditionally practised an animistic ethnic religion. When the island fell under Dutch rule in 1624, Protestantism was spread to the Taiwanese aborigines. Two years later, with the transition to Spanish rule, the Catholic Church was introduced into the island.\n\nWhen the Han Chinese began to settle the island and form the Taiwanese Chinese ethnic group, exchanges between the indigenous religion of the Austronesian aborigines and the Chinese folk religion occurred. For instance, Ali-zu, the Siraya god of fertility, has been incorporated into the Han pantheon in some places of Taiwan.\n\nA large influx of Han Chinese began in the 1660s with the transition of imperial power from the Ming dynasty to the Manchurian Qing dynasty. Many Ming loyalists fled to the south, including Zheng Chenggong alias Koxinga, a military leader who fought against the Manchu dynasty. He sailed to Taiwan in 1661 with thousands of troops, and in a brief military endeavour he drove out the Dutch and established the Kingdom of Tungning, the first Chinese state on the island. Chinese settlers, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong, began to migrate to the island. The policy of migration to Taiwan was restrictive until 1788, even after the island came under the political control of the Qing in 1683.\n\nChinese migrants brought with them local cults from the mainland, which served to integrate communities around the worship of locality and community gods. As the settlers were mostly males, came from different areas, and at first not many people shared the same surnames and belonged to the same kins, ancestral shrines of kinship gods did not develop until the 1790s, when sufficient generations of families had established on the island.\n\nThe first settlers in Koxinga and Qing periods brought with them images or incense ashes from mainland temples, installed them in homes or temporary thatched huts, and later in proper temples, as economic circumstances permitted to build them. Prominent temples became the foci of religious, political and social life, often eclipsing Qing officials and state-sponsored temples in their influence.\n\nThere is little evidence that the doctrinal and initiatory religions of Buddhism and Taoism were active during this period. Taiwan, as a frontier land, was not attractive for Buddhist and Taoist religious leaders.\n\nDuring the mid-Qing dynasty, sects of popular Buddhism which the Japanese authorities would have later lumped together with the religions of fasting (\"zhāijiāo\") because of their vegetarian precepts, began to send missionaries from the mainland to Taiwan. They were more successful in attracting converts than either pure Buddhism or Taoism. Japanese researches of the early colonial period identified \"zhaijiao\" sects as a line of the Linji school of Chan Buddhism, although contemporary scholars know that they were centered on a female creator deity, Wusheng Laomu, and identify them as branches of Luoism disguising as a form of Buddhism free of ordained clergy. \"Zhaijiao\" sects identify the \"sangha\" as the community of believers, not as a separate clergy.\n\nApart from \"zhaijiao\" Buddhist sects, other folk religious sects, that were mistakenly classified as Buddhist by the Japanese government, were active in Taiwan. The most prominent were the three religions of fasting: the Jinchuang, the Longhua, and Xiantiandao traditions (the latter was introduced to Taiwan in the mid-19th century).\n\nIn 1895, the Manchu government ceded Taiwan to Japan as part of the terms of surrender following the First Sino-Japanese War. During the fifty-one years of Japanese rule, governors enacted regulations to control the activities of \"native religions\". During a first period from 1895 to 1915, the Japanese adopted a \"laissez-faire\" policy towards native religions. During a second phase from 1915 to 1937, the government tried to vigorously regulate local religions. A third period, coinciding with the outbreak of hostilities between Japan and mainland China, saw the Japanese government start a that included a .\n\nBuddhism, as a shared herita, received better treatment than Chinese folk religion and Taoism. Some Taiwanese Buddhist groups cooperated with the Japanese government, and Japanese Buddhist sects sent missionaries to Taiwan and even worked with \"zhaijiao\" Buddhist groups. However, given the profound differences between Chinese and Japanese Buddhist traditions (among others, Japanese priests marry, eat meat and drink wine, all of which Chinese monks abstain from), the \"Japanisation\" of Chinese Buddhism was resisted by Taiwanese Buddhist communities.\n\nIn 1915, Japanese religious policies in Taiwan changed after the \"Xilai Hermitage incident\". The hermitage was a \"zhaijiao\" Buddhist hall where the follower Yu Qingfang (余清芳) started an anti-Japanese uprising, in which many other folk religious and Taoist sects took part. The Japanese government discovered the plot and Yu Qingfang was executed in a speedy trial together with ninety-four other followers.\n\nAfter the incident, the Japanese government became suspicious of what it called Taiwan's . The government began to investigate, register and regulate local temples, and it created islandwide Buddhist religious associations—into which even \"zhaijiao\" Buddhist groups were enrolled—whose charters recommended loyalty to the government.\n\nIn 1937, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tokyo ordered the rapid acculturation of the peoples of Japan's colonies. This included an effort to disaccustom people from Chinese traditional religions and convert them into the nexus of State Shinto. Many Shinto shrines were established in Taiwan. Chinese family altars were replaced with \"kamidana\" and \"butsudan\", and a Japanese calendar of religious festivals was introduced.\n\nThe subsequent \"temples' restructuration movement\" caused much consternation among the Chinese population and had far-reaching effects. Its inception can be traced back to the \"Conference for Improving Popular Customs\" held in 1936, that far from promoting a razing of temples discussed measures for a reform and standardisation of Taoist and folk temple practices.\n\nThe outbreak of open war between China and Japan in 1937 led to a proscription of practices and even stronger measures, as Japanese officials saw the religious culture centered around folk temples as the major obstacle to Japanisation. Consequently, some local officials began to close and to demolish temples, burning their images, confiscating their cash and real estates, a measure that they called \"sending the gods to Heaven\". In 1940, when a new governor-general took office, the \"temples' restructuration movement\" was halted.\n\nThe Japanese persecution of Chinese folk religion led to an increase in skepticism and loss of faith among the Chinese. As a result of this loss of faith in gods, Japanese police reported a general decline in public morals. The policies also resulted in the disappearance of the small Muslim community, until Islam was reintroduced by the Kuomintang with their retreat from mainland China to Taiwan after the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n\nAnother effect of the Japanese colonisation on religious life in Taiwan was due to the modernisation of infrastructures. Before the 20th century the travel infrastructure of Taiwan was not very developed, and it was difficult for people to move from a part of the island to another. The Japanese quickly constructed a network of railroads connecting all regions of the island. In the field of religion, this promoted the rise in importance of some Buddhist, Taoist or folk temples as island-wide pilgrimage sites. During this time, some gods lost their local and sub-ethnic nature and became \"pan-Taiwanese\".\n\nIn 1945, after the Second World War, the administration of Taiwan was handed over to the Republic of China through General Order No. 1. The People's Republic of China was established four years later in mainland China under the Communist Party of China.\n\nThe rapid economic growth of Taiwan since the 1970s and 1980s (\"Taiwan Miracle\") accompanied by a quick renewal of Chinese folk religion, challenging Max Weber's theories on secularisation and disenchantment, has led many scholars to investigate how folk religious culture—with its emphasis on values like loyalty, its social network of temples and gods' societies—may have contributed to the island's economic development. During the same period, folk religions developed ties with environmental causes. Chinese salvationist religions (such as earlier Xiantiandao) become increasingly popular in Taiwan after 1945, although some of them were illegal until the 1980s.\n\nAfter the 1950s, and especially since the 1970s, there was a significant growth of Buddhism. Chinese Buddhism developed into distinctively new forms with the foundation of movements like the Tzu Chi, the Fo Guang Shan and the Dharma Drum Mountain, which follow the philosophy of Humanistic Buddhism elaborated in China in the early 20th century. Tibetan Buddhism too was spread to the island. Since the 2000s there was an increasing cooperation between religious groups in Taiwan and mainland China.\n\nChinese traditional, popular or folk religion, or simply Chinese religion, also called Shenism, defines the collection of grassroots ethnic religious and spiritual experiences, disciplines, beliefs and practices of the Han Chinese. Another name of this complex of religions is Chinese Universism, coined by Jan Jakob Maria de Groot, and referring to Chinese religion's intrinsic metaphysical perspective.\n\nIt consists in the worship of the \"shen\" (神 \"gods\", \"spirits\", \"awarenesses\", \"consciousnesses\", \"archetypes\"; literally \"expressions\", the energies that generate things and make them thrive) which can be nature deities, city deities or tutelary deities of other human agglomerations, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, ancestors and progenitors, deities of the kinship. Holy narratives regarding some of these gods are part of Chinese mythology.\n\nChinese folk religion in Taiwan is framed by the ritual ministry exerted by the Zhengyi Taoist clergy (\"sanju daoshi\"), independent orders of \"fashi\" (non-Taoist ritual masters), and \"tongji\" media. The Chinese folk religion of Taiwan has characteristic features, such as Wang Ye worship. Even though Falun Gong is banned in China, people in Taiwan are free to practise it.\n\nAs of 2005, more than 10% of the population of Taiwan adhered to a variety of folk religious organisations of salvation. The largest of them is Yiguandao (with 3.5% of the population), followed by Tiandiism (whose two churches, the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue and the Lord of Universe Church, counted together comprise 2.2% of the island's population), Miledadao (an offshoot of Yiguandao accounting for 1.1%), Zailiism (0.8%) and Xuanyuanism (0.7%), and other minor movements including Precosmic Salvationism and Daiyiism. The three largest ones—Yiguandao, Tiandiism and Miledadao—and some others derive from the Xiantiandao tradition, making this the religious tradition of more than 7% of Taiwan's population. Other salvationisms with an important presence in Taiwan, though not documented in the 2005 official statistics, are Confucian Shenism (also called Luanism) and the recent Weixinism.\n\nTaoism in Taiwan is almost entirely entwined with folk religion, as it is mostly of the Zhengyi school in which priests function as ritual ministers of local communities' cults. Taiwanese Taoism lacks a contemplative, ascetic and monastic tradition such as northern China's Quanzhen Taoism. The Celestial Masters, leaders of the Zhengyi school, have their seat on the island. Nowadays the office is split into at least three lines competing to head the Taoist community.\n\nPoliticians of all parties appear at Taoist temples during campaigns, using them for political gatherings. Despite this and the contention among sects for leadership, there is no unitary structure of authority overseeing all Taoists in Taiwan. According to the 2005 census, there were 7.6 million Taoists in Taiwan (33% of the population) in that year. As of 2015, there were 9,485 registered Taoist temples in Taiwan, comprising 78.35% of all registered temples.\n\nConfucianism is present in Taiwan in the form of many associations and temples and shrines for the worship of Confucius and sages. In 2005, 0.7% of the population of Taiwan adhered to Xuanyuanism, which is a Confucian-based religion worshipping Huangdi as the symbol of God.\n\nBuddhism was introduced into Taiwan in the mid-Qing dynasty (18th century) through the \"zhaijiao\" popular sects. Several forms of Buddhism thrived in Taiwan ever since. During the Japanese occupation, Japanese schools of Buddhism (such as Shingon Buddhism, Jōdo Shinshū, Nichiren Shū) gained influence over many Taiwanese Buddhist temples as part of the Japanese policy of cultural assimilation.\n\nAlthough many Buddhist communities affiliated themselves with Japanese sects for protection, they largely retained Chinese Buddhist practices. For instance the Japanisation of Chinese Buddhism, the introduction of clerical marriage and the practice of eating meat and drinking wine, was not as successful as in the Buddhist tradition of Japanese-occupied Korea.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II and the establishment of the Republic of China on the island, many monks from mainland China moved to Taiwan, including Yin Shun (印順). They gave significant contribution to the development of Chinese Buddhism on the island.\n\nThe Buddhist Association of the Republic of China remained the dominant Buddhist organisation until the end of restrictions of religious activities in the 1980s. Today there are several large Humanistic Buddhist and Buddhist modernist organisations in Taiwan, including the Dharma Drum Mountain (\"Făgŭshān\" ) founded by Sheng Yen (), Buddha's Light International (\"Fógŭangshān\" ) founded by Hsing Yun (), and the Tzu Chi Foundation (\"Cíjì jījīnhùi\" ) founded by Cheng Yen ().\n\nThe \"zhaijiao\" Buddhist groups maintain an influence in society. In recent decades, also non-Chinese forms of Buddhism, such as Tibetan Buddhism and Soka Gakkai Nichiren Buddhism, have expanded in Taiwan. Adherence to Buddhism has grown significantly in Taiwan since the 1980s. From 800.000 in 1983, the number of Buddhists expanded to 4.9 million in 1995 and subsequently to 8 million (35% of the population) in 2005.\n\nThe history of the Bahá'í Faith () in Taiwan began after the religion entered areas of China and nearby Japan. The first Bahá'ís arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and the first of these to have become a Bahá'í was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung) in 1945 while visiting the United States. By May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was established in Tainan in 1956. The National Spiritual Assembly was first established in 1967 when there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Around 2005, the Bahá'ís showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies.\n\nChristianity in Taiwan constituted 3.9% of the population according to the census of 2005. Christians on the island included approximately 600,000 Protestants, 300,000 Catholics and a small number of Mormons.\n\nDespite its minority status, many of the early political leaders of the Republic of China were Christians. For instance, George Leslie Mackay was a Presbyterian and Nitobe Inazō was a Methodist later converted to Quakerism. Several Republic of China presidents have been Christians, including Sun Yat-sen who was a Congregationalist, Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo who were Methodists, Lee Teng-hui who is a Presbyterian.\n\nIndeed, Christianity in Taiwan has been on the decline since the 1970s, after a strong growth from 1950 to the 1960s.\n\nThough Islam originated in the Arabian Peninsula, it had spread eastward to China as early as the 7th century AD. Muslim merchants married local Chinese women, creating a new Chinese ethnic group called the Hui people. Islam first reached Taiwan in the 17th century when Muslim families from the southern China's coastal province of Fujian accompanied Koxinga on his invasion to oust the Dutch from Taiwan. Islam did not spread and their descendants became assimilated into the local Taiwanese society adopting the local customs and religions.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled mainland China with the Kuomintang to Taiwan. Since the 1980s, thousands of Muslims from Myanmar and Thailand, who are descendants of nationalist soldiers who fled Yunnan as a result of the communist takeover, have migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life. In more recent years, there has been a rise in Indonesian workers to Taiwan. According to the census of 2005, there were 58,000 Muslims in Taiwan in that year.\n\nThere has been a Jewish community in Taiwan since the 1950s. Since 2011, there has been a Chabad in Taipei.\nHinduism is a minor faith in Taiwan, compromising mainly of adherents from Bali and India.. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness maintains a presence in Taiwan.\n\nThe table shows official statistics on religion issued by the Department of Civil Affairs, Ministry of the Interior (\"MOI\"), in 2005.

The Vulgate translation of the Bible uses \"sancta sanctorum\" for the Holy of Holies. Hence the derivative usage to denote the Sancta Sanctorum chapel in the complex of St. John Lateran, Rome.\n\nIn Hinduism, a temple's innermost part where the cult image \"(Murti)\" of the deity is kept forms the \"Garbha griha\", also referred to as a sanctum sanctorum.\n\nThe Latin word \"sanctum\" is the neuter form of the adjective \"holy\", and \"sanctorum\" its genitive plural. Thus the term \"sanctum sanctorum\" literally means \"the holy [place/thing] of the holy [places/things]\", replicating in Latin the Hebrew construction for the superlative, with the intended meaning \"the most holy [place/thing]\".\n\nThe Latin word \"sanctum\" may be used in English, following Latin, for \"a holy place\", or a sanctuary, as in the novel \"Jane Eyre\" (1848) which refers to \"the sanctum of school room\".\n\nRomance languages tend to use the form \"sancta sanctorum\", treating it as masculine and singular. E.g., the Spanish dictionary of the Real Academia Española admits \"sanctasanctórum\" (without the space and with an accent) as a derivative Spanish noun denoting both the Holy of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem, any secluded and mysterious place, and something that a person holds in the highest esteem.\n\nThe term is still often used by Indian writers for the garbhagriha or inner shrine chamber in Hindu temple architecture, after being introduced by British writers in the 19th century.\n\nSome regional branches of the Catholic Church, e. g. Germans, are wont to refer to the Blessed Sacrament, when adored in the tabernacle or in exposition or procession (e.g. on Corpus Christi), as the Holy of Holies. By custom, It is adored with genuflection; with a double genuflection, that is a short moment of kneeling on both knees, if in exposition; in the procession this ritual may be nonrigoristically alleviated, but at least a simple genuflection is appropriate when It is elevated by the priest for blessing or immediately after transsubstantiation. Personnel in uniform — which in Germany includes student corporations — give the military salute when passing by or in the moment of elevation.\n\nThe \"garbhagriha\" in Hindu temple architecture (a shrine inside a temple complex where the main deity is installed in a separate building by itself inside the complex) has also been compared to a \"sanctum sanctorum\" in texts on Hindu temple architecture, though the Sanskrit term actually means \"enclosed house\" or \"the deep interior of the house\". However, some Indian English authors seem to have translated the Sanskrit term literally as \"womb house\". \n"}

The classification and nature of various doctrinal, philosophical or cultural facets of the schools of Buddhism is vague and has been interpreted in many different ways, often due to the sheer number (perhaps thousands) of different sects, subsects, movements, etc. that have made up or currently make up the whole of Buddhist traditions. The sectarian and conceptual divisions of Buddhist thought are part of the modern framework of Buddhist studies, as well as comparative religion in Asia.\n\nFrom a largely English-language standpoint, and to some extent in most of Western academia, Buddhism is separated into two groups at its foundation: Theravāda, literally \"the Teaching of the Elders\" or \"the Ancient Teaching,\" and Mahāyāna, literally the \"Great Vehicle.\" The most common classification among scholars is threefold, with Mahāyāna itself split between the traditional Mahāyāna teachings, and the Vajrayāna teachings which emphasize esotericism.\n\nThe \"Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion\" distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into \"Movements\", \"Nikāyas\" and \"Doctrinal schools\":\n\n\nThe terminology for the major divisions of Buddhism can be confusing, as Buddhism is variously divided by scholars and practitioners according to geographic, historical, and philosophical criteria, with different terms often being used in different contexts. The following terms may be encountered in descriptions of the major Buddhist divisions:\n\n\n\n\nSthaviravāda split into 11 sects:\n\nMahāsāṃghika split into 9 sects:\n\nThe following later schools used the \"vinaya\" of the Dharmaguptaka:\n\n\nThe following involve philosophical influence:\n\n\nThe different schools in Theravāda often emphasize different aspects (or parts) of the Pāli canon and the later commentaries, or differ in the focus on and recommended way of practice.

{"id": "58255345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58255345", "title": "Seymour Rosofsky", "text": "Seymour Rosofsky\n\nSeymour Rosofsky (b. 1924 – d. 1981) was an American artist, who has been described as one of the key figures in twentieth-century Chicago art. He emerged in the late 1940s at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (BFA, 1949; MFA, 1951), one of several G.I. Bill veterans, including Leon Golub, Cosmo Campoli and H. C. Westermann, who would join Don Baum, Dominick Di Meo, June Leaf, and Nancy Spero to form the influential movement later dubbed the “Monster Roster” by critic Franz Schulze, which was a precursor to the more well-known Chicago Imagists. Like others in the group, Rosofsky was drawn to the unsettling, macabre side of Surrealism, initially creating gestural, expressionist renderings of grotesque, existentially angst-ridden figures in isolated or uncomfortable situations, that gave way in the 1960s to more fantastical, observational paintings that examined power, politics and domestic relationships in an unflinching way. \nRosofsky was recognized for his deftness as a painter, his interest in drawing as a process and medium, and as a caricaturist. His work was exhibited in numerous Art Institute of Chicago “Chicago and Vicinity” shows, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago survey \"Art in Chicago: 1945–1995,\" the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a retrospective at the Krannert Art Museum (1984). He was also featured in the Franz Schulze’s book \"Fantastic Images\" (1972) and \"Monster Roster: Existential Art in Postwar Chicago\" (2016). His work can be found in the public collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, among others.\n\nRosofsky was born to Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants on the West Side of Chicago in 1924. He painted from an young age and took weekend classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) as a young teen. After he enrolled there, his studies were interrupted by military service in the Army during World War II from 1943–6; he completed his BFA in 1949 and an MFA in 1951, while also taking humanities courses at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. At SAIC, Rosofsky studied oil painting with the Russian–born artist Boris Anisfeld, a former student of Marc Chagall, whose disciplined, academic teaching instilled in him an appreciation for art history and classical painting skills. He exhibited in the seminal, student-driven Momentum Exhibitions of 1948-1950, organized in protest over the exclusion of students from the Art Institute's prestigious \"Chicago and Vicinity\" shows. He was also featured, along with Campoli, Golub, and Theodore Halkin in the Art Institute’s \"Veteran's Exhibition\" of 1948. In 1958, he received a Fulbright Fellowship to go to Rome; in 1962, a Guggenheim Foundation grant took him and his family to Paris. \n\nRosofsky was part of the loose group of artists dubbed the “Monster Roster,” which attracted a degree of international attention in the 1950s as a “Chicago School” He was part of a 1956 show at Beloit College curated by Allan Frumkin that brought the group into focus, and the later shows, “The New Chicago Decade: 1950–1960” (Lake Forest College, 1959) and “Haut artistes de Chicago” (Paris, 1962). Throughout his career, Rosofsky was associated with Chicago’s more international galleries, such as Richard Feigen, Richard Gray, and B. C. Holland. Rosofsky’s work has continued to be shown since his death in museums, galleries and public spaces. In 2011, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel chose Rosofsky’s striking but grim \"Unemployment Agency\" (1957–8) from the Art Institute’s collection to hang on the wall behind his desk at City Hall.\nRosofsky taught at Chicago Loop College (later Harold Washington College) from 1964 until his death from a heart attack in 1981. He has been cited by many artists, including Phyllis Bramson and William Conger, as an influence.\n\nRosofsky wrestled with his experiences through intensely personal, penetrating, often brutal, imagery created in a staunchly figurative, gestural style that critics likened to June Leaf’s, and described as a mix of expressionism and “surrealist hysteria.” Unlike most of the Monster Roster artists, however, his work was more grounded in realism, due to his studies with Boris Anisfeld. Critic Franz Schulze applauded his “rich color, carefully interwoven tonalities and assured drawing.” The Chicago Tribune’s Alan Artner called his sense of composition masterly, his palette subtle, and his way with the figure strong, but noted a tendency to overload his works that sometimes made them difficult to understand.\n\nRosofsky was drawn to doleful and withering themes, such as the individual’s loss of power in modern life, fraught male-female relationships, the abuse of power and the absurdity of war, often borne out in battered, distorted, sometimes grotesquely comic figures in haunting, fantastical interiors and cityscapes. A lifelong Chicagoan, Rosofsky is considered the post-war artist for whom Chicago—the lake, people, buildings, and abrasive character—was most integral, his bizarre figures and settings often bearing a specificity to the city’s locales and conditions. Critic Alan Artner described him as a “poet of exhaustion” depicting an urban carnival of malaise, “disappointment and dejection, of things passing away without proper eulogy, of winter and fading light.”\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Rosofsky often focused on nightmarish modern narratives that featured faceless men, often in hospitals, wheelchairs, and other uncomfortable, vulnerable situations or empty spaces, which he depicted in agitated lines that some critics liken to Alberto Giacometti’s graphic work and Francis Bacon’s tortured interiors (e.g., \"Patient in a Dentist Chair\", 1961). \"Unemployment Agency\" (1957) features several rows of identical men in hats, sitting in severe, tall-backed chairs, facing rows of boxes that recede into a foreboding, bureaucratic infinity. he depicts a funhouse mirror-laden carnival scene in similar fashion in \"Tilt-a-Whirl\" (1957).\n\nTime spent in Paris on a fellowship led to a greater surrealist turn in Rosofsky’s work, realized in a fantastical, frightening vocabulary of clowns, menacing faces, and bizarre scenarios urgency and a more intense color palette. He often employed these figures in works examining power (e.g., his sardonic depiction of Chicago politics, \"Daley Machine\", 1968) and social issues (\"Homage to Spain, Thalidomide Children and Others\", 1965) that in their focus on generalized dehumanization shared more with New York artist George Tooker, than with Rosofsky’s former classmate, Leon Golub’s more political work. By the 1970s, Rosofsky turned to caustic depictions of fraught male-female relationships and roles that portrayed cardboard cutouts or stage puppet-like men and women, enacting disturbing scenes in theatrical domestic scenes, such as \"The Couple\" (1973) or \"The Love Fountain\" (1967). Rosofsky’s last works were lighter and more detached, and included “commedia dell’ arte” drawings commissioned for the 1982 Venice Biennale’s Carnevale del Teatro.\n\nRosofsky's work belongs to numerous public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, National Gallery of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Smart Museum of Art, and Block Museum of Art. Rosofsky was recognized with Fulbright (1958) and Guggenheim Foundation fellowships (1962).\n"}

The party's leader is Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nIn January 2013 Fiji's military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties. Among the new provisions was a requirement that all political parties be named in English rather than Fijian. Rather than changing its name, the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) Party wound itself up, reforming as the Social Democratic Liberal Party in order to retain the SDL acronym. However, a subsequent amendment to the Political Parties Decree banned the use of the acronyms of former parties, forcing the party to switch to \"SODELPA\".\n\nThe party was provisionally led by Dr Tupeni Baba, but in March 2013 it unanimously selected former SDL Cabinet Minister Ro Teimumu Kepa as its first permanent leader.\n\nThe party applied for registration on 26 February 2013, and was registered on 3 May 2013.\n\nThe party contested the 2014 elections, naming a list of 45 candidates in June.

{"id": "1779614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1779614", "title": "Society of Saint Pius V", "text": "Society of Saint Pius V\n\nThe Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV; ), is a Traditionalist Catholic society of priests, formed in 1983 and based in Oyster Bay Cove, New York. The priests of SSPV broke away from the Society of St. Pius X over liturgical issues, and hold that many in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church no longer adhere to the Catholic faith but instead profess a new, modernist, Conciliar religion. SSPV priests regard the questions of the legitimacy of the present hierarchy and the possibility that the Holy See is unoccupied (sedevacantism) to be unresolved. The SSPV is led by its founder, Bishop Clarence Kelly.\n\nThe SSPV developed out of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), the traditionalist organization founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. In 1983, Lefebvre expelled four priests (Fr. Clarence Kelly, Fr. Daniel Dolan, Fr. Anthony Cekada, and Fr. Eugene Berry) of the SSPX's Northeast USA District from the society, partly because they were opposed to his instructions that Mass be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal issued by John XXIII. Other issues occasioning the split were Lefebvre's order that Society priests must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals and the acceptance of new members into the group who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of Pope Paul VI.\n\n\"The Nine\" (the four expelled priests plus five who voluntarily left the SSPX) balked at Lefebvre's imposition of the 1962 missal which they believed included departures from the liturgical traditions of the Church (for example, adding the name of St. Joseph to the Canon of the Mass). A more basic reason was the belief amongst the Nine that the men who had reigned as pope since the death of Pope Pius XII (d. 1958) had not been legitimate popes (Canon 1325, no. 2, 1917), although Fr. Cekada later stated that \"...[t]he 'pope question' was not raised at the time, and was not at issue\". They held that these Popes had officially taught and/or accepted heretical doctrines and therefore had lost or never occupied the See of Rome (Canon 188, no. 4, 1917). Like the Society of St. Pius X, they believed that there had been novel interpretations of the traditional teachings of the Church on issues such as religious liberty. One of the Nine, Fr. Dolan, admitted that while a member of the SSPX, he had concluded that the See of Peter was vacant.\n\n\"The Nine\" set up a new priestly society under the leadership of Fr. Clarence Kelly, their former District Superior. The eight priests were Frs. Thomas Zapp, Donald Sanborn, Anthony Cekada, Daniel Dolan, William Jenkins, Eugene Berry, Joseph Collins, and Martin Skierka. Additional priests joined shortly thereafter.\n\nWithin a few years, about half of the original nine SSPV priests separated from Fr. Kelly. Most of them formed an openly sedevacantist group, \"Catholic Restoration\", under the leadership of Frs. Dolan and Sanborn. Both were later consecrated as bishops in the episcopal lineage of the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc Pierre Martin. The other priests founded independent ministries.\n\nFr. Cekada states that this resulted from the SSPV's intrinsic distrust of a centralized authority as existed in the SSPX, which makes the latter vulnerable to being \"subverted with one stroke of a pen\" to the Vatican. Rather than independent congregations being a weakness and something to be lamented, Cekada considers all such groups and priests taken together preferable to the SSPX, which has continued to hold negotiations with Rome and uses the 1962 Missal.\n\nOn 19 October 1993, 86-year-old Bishop Alfredo Méndez-Gonzalez, who had served as Bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico until his retirement in 1974, consecrated Fr. Kelly as a bishop at a ceremony in Carlsbad, California. Bishop Méndez had already publicly ordained two seminarians of the SSPV to the priesthood in 1990. Kelly's consecration was announced a few days after Bishop Méndez's death in 1995. The Roman Catholic Church considers Kelly's consecration illicit, i.e. not in conformity with canon law.\n\nOn Wednesday, 28 February 2007, Bishop Kelly consecrated Fr. Joseph Santay, CSPV, to the episcopacy at Oyster Bay Cove, New York.\n\nThe SSPV currently has five permanent priories, and its priests serve a network of chapels, churches, and temporary worship locations in 12 states of the U.S. (as of 2013). The SSPV operates only in North America. The SSPV is not considered to have canonical status within the Catholic Church. SSPV opened Immaculate Heart Seminary, located on sixty-one acres of property in the Catskill Mountains of New York, in the fall of 1996. The Founder and Spiritual Father of the Congregation of St. Pius V is the Most Reverend Clarence Kelly. The first priest member of the Congregation, Father Joseph Santay, was ordained in 2001, and consecrated a Bishop in 2007.\n\nThe \"Daughters of Mary, Mother of Our Savior\" are a congregation of Sisters founded by then-Fr. Kelly in 1984. Their congregation's motherhouse and novitiate are located in Round Top, New York, in the Catskill Mountains area. The Sisters have two additional houses in the United States (Melville, NY and White Bear Lake, MN) where they run schools, and they are also involved in other types of charity work, such as visiting nursing homes. The current Mother General is Mother Mary Bosco.\n\nThe \"Congregation of St. Pius V\" (CSPV) is a Society of Common Life for priests and coadjutor brothers, founded by Bishop Kelly. CSPV was formed to provide a canonical structure for the incardination of priests and the affiliation of religious. The Congregation operates Immaculate Heart Seminary in Round Top, New York for its candidates, under the direction of Bishop Joseph Santay, CSPV. The seminary's graduates are ordained by Bishops Kelly and/or Santay. As of 2018, the CSPV had 10 priest members including Bp. Santay and two Brothers.\n\n"}

{"id": "32059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32059", "title": "Unitarian Universalism", "text": "Unitarian Universalism\n\nUnitarian Universalism (UU) is a liberal religion characterized by a \"free and responsible search for truth and meaning\". Unitarian Universalists assert no creed, but instead are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth. As such, their congregations include many atheists, agnostics, and theists within their membership. The roots of Unitarian Universalism lie in liberal Christianity, specifically Unitarianism and universalism. Unitarian Universalists state that from these traditions comes a deep regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love. Congregations and members seek inspiration and derive insight from all major world religions.\n\nThe beliefs of individual Unitarian Universalists range widely, including atheism, agnosticism, pantheism, deism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, neopaganism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Humanism, and many more.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was formed in 1961 through the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association, established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America, established in 1793. The UUA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and serves churches mostly in the United States. A group of thirty Philippine congregations is represented as a sole member within the UUA. The Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) became an independent body in 2002. The UUA and CUC are, in turn, two of the seventeen members of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists.\n\nHowever, some Unitarian Universalist churches today have statements of faith that profess a Protestant Christian identity.\n\nUnitarian Universalism was formed from the consolidation in 1961 of two historically separate Christian denominations, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association, both based in the United States; the new organization formed in this merger was the Unitarian Universalist Association. At the time of the North American consolidation, Unitarians and Universalists had expanded beyond their roots in liberal Christian theology. Today they draw from a variety of religious traditions. Individuals may or may not self-identify as Christians or subscribe to Christian beliefs. Unitarian Universalist congregations and fellowships tend to retain some Christian traditions, such as Sunday worship with a sermon and the singing of hymns. The extent to which the elements of any particular faith tradition are incorporated into personal spiritual practice is a matter of individual choice for congregants, in keeping with a creedless, non-dogmatic approach to spirituality and faith development.\n\nNew England Unitarians evolved from the Pilgrim Fathers' Congregational Christianity, which was originally based on a literal reading of the Holy Bible. Liberalizing Unitarians rejected the Trinitarian belief in the tri-personal godhead: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit. Instead, they asserted a unitary notion of God. In addition, they rejected the doctrine of original sin, moving away from the Calvinism of the Congregationalists.\n\nNew England Universalists rejected the Puritan forefathers' emphasis on the select few, the Elect, who were supposed to be saved from eternal damnation by a just God. Instead Universalists asserted that all people will eventually be reconciled with God . Universalists rejected the hellfire and damnation of the evangelical preachers, who tried to revive the fundamentalist Christianity of the early Pilgrim fathers.\n\nUniversalists claim a long history, beginning with Origen and Gregory of Nyssa, though some modern scholars question whether either of these church fathers taught the defining doctrine of Universalism (universal salvation).\n\nThis core doctrine asserts that through Christ every single human soul shall be saved, leading to the \"restitution of all things\" (apocatastasis). In 1793, Universalism emerged as a particular denomination of Christianity in the United States, eventually called the Universalist Church of America. Early American advocates of Universal Salvation such as Elhanan Winchester, Hosea Ballou and John Murray taught that all souls would achieve salvation, sometimes after a period resembling purgatory. Christian universalism denies the doctrine of everlasting damnation, and proclaims belief in an entirely loving God who will ultimately redeem all human beings.\n\nHistorically, various forms of Nontrinitarianism have appeared within Christianity. The term may refer to any belief about the nature of Jesus Christ that affirms God as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the Trinity, as affirmed by the mainstream Christianity: a consensus of Christian bishops at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the Protestant Reformation. A Spanish physician, Michael Servetus, studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books \"On the Errors of the Trinity\" and \"Christianismi Restitutio\" caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553.\n\nThe term Unitarian entered the English language via Henry Hedworth, who applied it to the teachings of Laelio Sozzini and the Polish Socinians. Unitarian churches were formally established in Transylvania and Poland (by the Socinians) in the second half of the 16th Century. There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see Edict of Torda) under the jurisdiction of John Sigismund, king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the pre-existence of Christ as well as, in many cases, predestination and original sin as put forward by Augustine of Hippo, and the substitutionary atonement of Christ developed by Anselm of Canterbury and John Calvin. There were several different forms of Christology in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became psilanthropism: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish Socinians, Samuel Clarke (1675–1729) revised the \"Book of Common Prayer\", removing the Trinitarian Nicene Creed and references to Jesus as God. Theophilus Lindsey also revised the \"Book of Common Prayer\" to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the Blasphemy Act 1697 that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity\". The Act of Toleration (1689) gave relief to English Dissenters, but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the Church of England. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the Essex House as a \"Dissenting place of worship\" with the assistance of barrister John Lee. On the Sunday following the registration—April 17, 1774—the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel. In attendance were Lee, Joseph Priestley and the agent of the Massachusetts Colony, Benjamin Franklin. Priestley also founded a reform congregation, but, after his home was burned down in the Priestley Riots, fled with his wife to America, where he became a leading figure in the founding of the church on American soil.\n\nOnce laity and clergy relaxed their vehement opposition to the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, which finally allowed for protections of dissenting religions, the British and Foreign Unitarian Association was founded in 1825. It has its headquarters in Essex Hall, successor to Lindsey's Essex House. Two that have been significant in national life are the Cross Street Chapel in Manchester and, Newington Green Unitarian Church in north London. Unitarian congregations in Britain today meet under the auspices of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. There are 170 communities of Unitarians across Britain.\n\nIn the United States, the Unitarian movement began primarily in the Congregational parish churches of New England, which were part of the state church of Massachusetts. These churches, whose buildings may still be seen today in many New England town squares, trace their roots to the division of the Puritan colonies into parishes for the administration of their religious needs. In the late 18th century, conflict grew within some of these churches between Unitarian and Trinitarian factions. In 1805, Unitarians gained key faculty positions at Harvard. In 1819 William Ellery Channing preached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore, outlining the Unitarian position. The American Unitarian Association was founded as a separate denomination in 1825.\nBy coincidence and unknown to both parties, the AUA was formed on the same day—May 26, 1825—as the British and Foreign Unitarian Association\nIn the 19th century, under the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson (who had been a Unitarian minister) and other transcendentalists, Unitarianism began its long journey from liberal Protestantism to its present more pluralist form.\n\nAfter the schism in the Congregational Churches resulting in the foundation of the American Unitarian Association, some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization (later the United Church of Christ), while others voted to become Unitarian. Some of the latter eventually became part of the UUA during a consolidation of the Unitarian and Universalist churches. Universalist churches in contrast followed a different path, having begun as independent congregations beyond the bounds of the established Puritan churches entirely. Today, the UUA and the United Church of Christ cooperate jointly on social justice initiatives such as the Sexuality Education Advocacy Training project.\n\nIn 1961, the American Unitarian Association (AUA) was consolidated with the Universalist Church of America (UCA), thus forming the Unitarian Universalist Association. In the same year, the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) formed. The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was also given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York.\n\nIn 1998, the Canadian Unitarian Council and Unitarian Universalist Association dissolved their financial accord, although they continue to cooperate. The CUC had come into being at Meadville in 1961. However the continual decline of denominational churches and almost complete failure of the Universalist movement in Canada, had caused the creation of the Council to prompt a plan to merge with the UUA. Opposition to Liberal religious freedom relaxed, so that by 2002 it was agreed to increase autonomy and funding. The amalgamation proved troublesome for the Canadians, in a small minority, and largely ignored with only 45 congregations and 5,200 members, the Americans were insensitive to cultural differences.\n\nUnitarian Universalists practice a non-creedal religion. Consequently, their individual beliefs are diverse, and their attitude toward each other's beliefs and traditions is one of tolerance and acceptance. Rather than a focus on doctrine or belief, Unitarian Universalists find primary significance in their shared agreement, or covenant: member congregations agree to \"affirm and promote\" the Seven Principles. Rather than honoring a narrow religious tradition, Unitarian Universalists embrace a \"living tradition\" drawn from a multitude of sources, including the Six Sources.\n\nAdopted in 1960, the Principles, Purposes and Sources can be found in the Bylaws of the Unitarian Universalist Association. The Principles are expressed,\n\nUnitarian Universalists place emphasis on spiritual growth and development. The official statement of Unitarian Universalist principles describes the \"sources\" upon which current practice is based:\n\nUnitarian Universalist principles and purposes have been modified over time to manifest a broader acceptance of beliefs and traditions among the membership. The seventh Principle (adopted in 1985), \"Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part\", and a sixth Source (adopted in 1995), \"Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature\" were added to explicitly include members with neopagan, Native American, and pantheist spiritualities.\n\nBoth Unitarianism and Universalism were originally Christian denominations; they still reference Jewish and Christian texts. Today, the Unitarian Universalist approach to the Christian Bible, Hebrew Scriptures, and other sacred works is presented by the UUA:\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish Seder, Yom Kippur and Passover dinners, \"iftaar\" meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/Winter Solstice services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a Hindu temple, a Reform or Orthodox synagogue, and a Catholic church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo\"). Whether a congregation is a 'fellowship' or a 'church' sometimes hinges on whether it is led by one (or more) minister(s): those without ministers being fellowships, those with ministers being churches. Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"First Unitarian Church\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. Unity Temple). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as \"fellowship\" and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey), reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\nIn 2004, \"UU World\" magazine asked for contributions of \"elevator speeches\" explaining Unitarian Universalism. These are short speeches that could be made in the course of an elevator ride to those who knew nothing of the religion. Here are examples of the speeches submitted:\n\nAs in theology, Unitarian Universalist worship and ritual are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a Protestant church, but they vary widely among congregations.\n\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the flaming chalice, often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the Disciples of Christ also use a chalice as their denomination symbol). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the Second World War. It was created by Austrian artist Hans Deutsch, inspired by \"the kind of chalice which the Greeks and Romans put on their altars. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech Jan Hus, which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an off-center cross within a circle (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a dove.\n\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition. Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker. Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, \"Singing the Journey\" contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older \"Singing the Living Tradition\" which contains readings as well. Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources—traditional hymn tunes with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to light a candle or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of meditation or prayer, led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of baptism, communion, or confirmation, at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often federated churches or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship or similar covenant groups. \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (though it should be noted that such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons). Annual celebrations of Water Communion and Flower Communion may replace or supplement Christian-style communion (though many pluralist and Christian-oriented congregations may celebrate or otherwise make provisions for communion on Christian holy days). Confirmation may be replaced by a \"Coming of Age\" program, in which teenagers explore their individual religious identity, often developing their own credo. After they have completed exploring their spiritual beliefs, they write a speech about it which they then personally deliver to the congregation.\n\nIn the 19th century, Unitarians and Universalists were active in abolitionism, the women's movement, the temperance movement, and other social reform movements. The \nsecond women's rights convention was held at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York. Additionally, four Presidents of the United States were Unitarians: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, and William Howard Taft.\n\nHistorically, Unitarian Universalists have often been active in political causes, notably the civil rights movement, the LGBT rights movement, the social justice movement, and the feminist movement.\n\nSusan B. Anthony, a Unitarian and Quaker, was extremely influential in the women's suffrage movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end racism in the United States. John Haynes Holmes, a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York—Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. James J. Reeb, a minister at All Souls Church, Unitarian, in Washington, D.C. and a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was clubbed in Selma, Alabama on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, Viola Liuzzo, a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights are best known for Bloody Sunday, which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001–2009, William G. Sinkford, is African-American, making Unitarian Universalism one of the first traditionally white denominations to be headed by a member of a racial minority.\n\nWhile political liberals make up a clear majority of Unitarian Universalists, the movement aspires to diversity, and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views. Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"Welcoming Congregation\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\" Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church, in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published \"An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality\" to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the District of Columbia in All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)\n\nUnitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on polyamory. At the 2015 UUA General Assembly, the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\"; the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and sustainability. These are often termed \"seventh principle\" activities because of the seventh principle quoted above.\n\nThe lack of formal creed has been a cause for criticism among some who argue that Unitarian Universalism is thus without religious content. In May 2004, Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn ruled that Unitarian Universalism was not a \"religion\" because it \"does not have one system of belief\", and stripped the Red River Unitarian Universalist Church in Denison, Texas, of its tax-exempt status. However, within weeks, Strayhorn reversed her decision.\n\nThere are separate movements and organizations who hold to classical Unitarian or Christian universalist Christian theology and neither belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association nor consider themselves Unitarian Universalists. The American Unitarian Conference and the Christian Universalist Association are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original American Unitarian Association or Universalist Church of America, and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The Unity Church is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.\n\nDuring the presidency of the William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement has roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford has suggested that Unitarian Universalists have abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He has suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others have reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford has denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's Beacon Press written by former UUA President John Buehrens. The book is titled \"Understanding the Bible: An Introduction for Skeptics, Seekers, and Religious Liberals\" and is meant as a kind of handbook to be read alongside the Bible. It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import. Also an important work by Buehrens, along with Forrest Church, is \"A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism\", in which the authors explore the many sources of the living tradition of their chosen faith.\n\nThe \"borrowing\" of religious rituals from other faith traditions by Unitarian Universalists was discussed at the Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in 2001 during a seminar titled \"Cultural Appropriation: Reckless Borrowing or Appropriate Cultural Sharing\" by the Religious Education Dept, UUA. Of particular discussion was the borrowing rituals and practices that are sacred to specific tribes or using spiritual practices without real context. Danielle Di Bona said:\n\n\nAs of December, 2015 the UUA had 1,018 Unitarian Universalist member congregations in the United States and 1,043 Unitarian Universalist member congregations when including two congregations in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 19 in Canada, six in other countries, plus 28 multi-denominational member congregations: 17 in MA, four in IL, three in NH, two in VT, and one each in ME and D.C. Seven of the ten US states with the most congregations are also among the most populous states; the state with the most congregations and members is Massachusetts; Vermont is No. 1 relative to its total population. A map using 2010 U.S. Census data showing the relative number of congregations per 1 million people is posted here. And as of September 2014 there are 46 Unitarian Universalist congregations and emerging groups in Canada affiliated with the CUC. In 2015, there were 156,620 adult congregational members and 47,623 children enrolled in religious education programs.\n\nIn 1956, Sam Wells wrote that \"Unitarians and Universalists are considering merger which would have total U.S. membership of 160,000 (500,000 in world)\". In 1965 Conkin wrote that \"In 1961, at the time of the merger, membership [in the United States] was 104,821 in 651 congregations, and the joint membership soared to its historically highest level in the mid-1960s (an estimated 250,000) before falling sharply back in the 1970s [...]\". According to the 2008 \"Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches\", the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations claimed 214,738 members in 2002.\n\nEstimates from the 1990s put world membership between 120,000 and 600,000.\n\nIn the United States, the American Religious Identification Survey reported 629,000 members describing themselves as Unitarian Universalist in 2001, an increase from 502,000 reported in a similar survey in 1990. The highest concentrations are in New England and around Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, conducted in 2007 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life and featuring a sample size of over 35,000, puts the proportion of American adults identifying as Unitarian Universalist at 0.3%.\n\nThe 2001 Canadian census done by Statistics Canada put Canadian Unitarians at 17,480, and the September 1, 2007 membership statistics from the CUC show they had at that time 5,150 official members. In 2015, the CUC reported 3,804 members.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20557247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557247", "title": "Yazidis", "text": "Yazidis\n\nThe Yazidis, Yezidis ( ) or sometimes Ezidis (Kurmanji: Êzîdî, ), are a mostly Kurmanji speaking religious minority, indigenous to a region of northern Mesopotamia (known natively as Ezidkhan) who are strictly endogamous. Some of them identify themselves as ethnic Kurds and some of them as a distinct ethno-religious group. However in Iraq and Armenia they are recognized as a distinct ethnic group. \n\nMany Yazidis consider Yazidism both an ethnic and a religious identity. Their religion, \"Yazidism\", is monotheistic and combines aspects of several monotheistic religions: Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province, part of the disputed territories of northern Iraq. \n\nAdditional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. According to the UNCHR reports, it is disputed, even within the community, as well as among Kurds, whether Yazidis are ethnically Kurds or form a distinct ethnic group.\n\nThe Yazidis are monotheists, believing in God as creator of the world, which he has placed under the care of seven holy beings or angels, the chief of whom is Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel. The Peacock Angel, as world-ruler, causes both good and bad to befall individuals, and this ambivalent character is reflected in myths of his own temporary fall from God's favour, before his remorseful tears extinguished the fires of his hellish prison and he was reconciled with God.\n\nThis belief has been linked by some people to Sufi mystical reflections on Iblis, who also refused to prostrate to Adam, despite God's express command to do so. Because of this similarity to the Sufi tradition of Iblis, some followers of other monotheistic religions of the region identify the Peacock Angel with their own unredeemed evil spirit Satan, which has incited centuries of persecution of the Yazidis as \"devil worshippers\". Persecution of Yazidis has continued in their home communities within the borders of modern Iraq, under fundamentalist Sunni Muslim revolutionaries.\n\nBeginning in August 2014, the Yazidis were targeted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in its campaign to rid Iraq and its neighbouring countries of non-Islamic influences.\n\nHistorically, the Yazidis lived primarily in communities located in present-day Iraq, Turkey, and Syria and also had significant numbers in Armenia, Georgia, and Iran. However, events since the end of the 20th century have resulted in considerable demographic shift in these areas as well as mass emigration. As a result, population estimates are unclear in many regions, and estimates of the size of the total population vary.\n\nThe majority of the Yazidi population lives in Iraq, where they make up an important minority community. Estimates of the size of these communities vary significantly, between 70,000 and 500,000. They are particularly concentrated in northern Iraq in the Nineveh Province. The two biggest communities are in Shekhan, northeast of Mosul and in Sinjar, at the Syrian border west of Mosul. In Shekhan is the shrine of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir at Lalish. In the early 1900s most of the settled population of the Western Desert were Yazidi. During the 20th century, the Shekhan community struggled for dominance with the more conservative Sinjar community. The demographic profile has probably changed considerably since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003 and the fall of Saddam Hussein's government.\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Yazidis were under the Arabisation process of Saddam Hussein between 1970 and 2003. In 2009, some Yazidis who had previously lived under the Arabisation process of Saddam Hussein complained about the political tactics of the Kurdistan Regional Government that were intended to make Yazidis identify themselves as Kurds. A report from Human Rights Watch (HRW), in 2009, declares that to incorporate disputed territories in northern Iraq—particularly the Nineveh province—into the Kurdish region, the KDP authorities had used KRG's political and economical resources to make Yazidis identify themselves as Kurds. The HRW report also criticises heavy-handed tactics.\"\n\nWhile geographically located in Kurdish regions, Yazidi do not self-identify as Kurdish. There has been a dispute as to whether Yazidi are Kurdish. Additionally, the Soviet Union considered the Yazidis to be Kurds, as does Sharaf Khan Bidlisi's \"Sheref-nameh\" of 1597, which cites seven of the Kurdish tribes as being at least partly Yazidi, and Kurdish tribal confederations as containing substantial Yazidi sections. Modern Yazidi communities disagree with this classification.\n\nAccording to the UNCHR reports, it is disputed, even among the community itself as well as among Kurds, whether Yazidis are ethnically Kurds or form a distinct ethnic group.\n\nThe Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish).\n\nYazidis in Syria live primarily in two communities, one in the Al-Jazira area and the other in the Kurd-Dagh. Population numbers for the Syrian Yazidi community are unclear. In 1963, the community was estimated at about 10,000, according to the national census, but numbers for 1987 were unavailable. There may be between about 12,000 and 15,000 Yazidis in Syria today, though more than half of the community may have emigrated from Syria since the 1980s. Estimates are further complicated by the arrival of as many as 50,000 Yazidi refugees from Iraq during the Iraq War.\n\nThe Yazidi population in Georgia has been dwindling since the 1990s, mostly due to economic migration to Russia and the West. According to a census carried out in 1989, there were over 30,000 Yazidis in Georgia; according to the 2002 census, however, only around 18,000 Yazidis remained in Georgia. However, by other estimates, the community fell from around 30,000 people to fewer than 5,000 during the 1990s. Today they number as little 6,000 by some estimates, including recent refugees from Sinjar in Iraq, who fled to Georgia following persecution by ISIL. On 16 June 2015, Yazidis celebrated the opening of a temple and a cultural centre named after Sultan Ezid in Varketili, a suburb of Tbilisi. This is the third such temple in the world after those in Iraqi Kurdistan and Armenia.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there are 35,272 Yazidis in Armenia, making them Armenia's largest ethnic minority group. Ten years earlier, in the 2001 census, 40,620 Yazidis were registered in Armenia. They form majority in Armavir province of Armenia. Media have estimated the number of Yazidis in Armenia to be between 30,000 and 50,000. Most of them are the descendants of refugees who fled to Armenia in order to escape the persecution that they had previously suffered during Ottoman rule, including a wave of persecution which occurred during the Armenian Genocide, when many Armenians found refuge in Yazidi villages.\n\nThere is a Yazidi temple called Ziarat in the village of Aknalich in the region of Armavir. Construction on a new Yazidi temple in Aknalich, called \"Quba Mere Diwan,\" is underway. The temple is slated to become the largest Yazidi temple in the world and is privately funded by Mirza Sloian, a Yazidi businessman based in Moscow who is originally from the Armavir region.\n\nThe Kurdish Yazidi community of Turkey declined precipitously during the 20th century. By 1982, the community had decreased to about 30,000, and in 2009 there were fewer than 500. Most of them have immigrated to Europe, particularly Germany; those who remain reside primarily in their former heartland of Tur Abdin.\n\nThis mass emigration has resulted in the establishment of large Yazidi diaspora communities abroad. The most significant of these is in Germany, which now has a Yazidi community of more than 100,000 living primarily in Hannover, Bielefeld, Celle, Bremen, Bad Oeynhausen, Pforzheim and Oldenburg. Most are from Turkey and, more recently, Iraq and live in the western states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. Since 2008, Sweden has seen sizeable growth in its Yazidi emigrant community, which had grown to around 4,000 by 2010, and a smaller community exists in the Netherlands. Other Yazidi diaspora groups live in Belgium, Denmark, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia; these have a total population of probably less than 5,000.\n\nFeleknas Uca, a Yazidi Member of the European Parliament for Germany's Party of Democratic Socialism, was the world's only Yazidi parliamentarian until the Iraqi legislature was elected in 2005. European Yazidis have contributed to the academic community, such as Khalil Rashow in Germany and Jalile Jalil in Austria.\n\nIn May 2012, four members of a Yazidi family living in Detmold, Germany were convicted for having murdered their sister in a so-called \"honour killing\" and sentenced to terms ranging from four-and-a-half years to life in prison. The victim was 18-year-old Arzu Özmen (also spelled Ozmen outside Germany), who fell in love with a German journeyman baker and ran away from her family, violating the exogamy taboo. In November 2011, her siblings abducted her, and brother Osman killed her with two shots in the head.\n\nThe Yazidi people speak Kurmanji Kurdish and adhere to the religion Yazidism. Their cultural practices are observed in Kurdish, which is also the language of almost all the orally transmitted religious traditions of the Yazidis. Although the Yazidis speak mostly in Kurdish, their exact origin is a matter of dispute among scholars, even among the community itself as well as among Kurds, whether they are ethnically Kurds or form a distinct ethnic group. In Armenia, the Yazidis are recognized as a distinct ethnic group.\n\nThe Yazidis' own name for themselves is \"Êzidî\" or \"Êzîdî\" or, in some areas, \"Dasinî\" (the latter, strictly speaking, is a tribal name). Western scholars derive the name from the Umayyad Caliph Yazīd ibn Muʿāwiya (Yazid I), who is revered by Yazidis as Sultan Ezi. Earlier scholars and many Yazidis derive it from Old Iranian \"yazata\", Middle Persian \"yazad\" 'divine being'.\n\nOne of the important figures of Yazidism is 'Adī ibn Musafir, who is said to be of Umayyad descent. Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir settled in the valley of Laliş (some northeast of Mosul) in the Yazidi mountains in the early 12th century and founded the 'Adawiyya Sufi order. He died in 1162, and his tomb at Laliş is a focal point of Yazidi pilgrimage and the principal Yazidi holy site. Yazidism has many influences: Sufi influence and imagery can be seen in the religious vocabulary, especially in the terminology of the Yazidis' esoteric literature, but much of the theology is non-Islamic. Its cosmogony apparently has many points in common with those of ancient Iranian religions blended with elements of pre-Islamic ancient Mesopotamian religious traditions and Zoroastrianism. It is also believed that Yazidism is a branch of Yazdânism, the pre-Islamic, native religion of the Kurds. \n\nEarly writers attempted to describe Yazidi origins, broadly speaking, in terms of Islam, or Persian, or sometimes even \"pagan\" religions; however, research published since the 1990s has shown such an approach to be simplistic.\n\nAnother theory of Yazidi origins is given by the Persian scholar Al-Shahrastani. According to Al-Shahrastani, the Yezidis are the followers of Yezîd bn Unaisa, who kept friendship with the first Muhakkamah before the Azariḳa. The first Muhakkamah is an appellative applied to the Muslim schismatics called Al-Ḫawarij. Accordingly, it might be inferred that the Yezidis were originally a Ḫarijite sub-sect. Yezid bn Unaisa moreover, is said to have been in sympathy with the Ibadis, a sect founded by 'Abd-Allah Ibn Ibaḍ.\"\n\nModern-day Assyrians and Yazidis from Northern Iraq have a stronger genetic continuity with the original Mesopotamian people. The northern Iraqi Syriac and Yazidi populations were found in the middle of a genetic continuum between the Near East and Southeastern Europe.\n\nYazidis are monotheists, believing in one God, who created the world and entrusted it into the care of a \"Heptad\" of seven Holy Beings, often known as Angels or \"heft sirr\" (the Seven Mysteries). The names of these beings or angels are Azaz'il, Gabra'il (Jabra'il), Mikha'il, Rafa'il (Israfil), Dadra'il, Azrafil and Shamkil (Shemna'il) Preeminent among these is Tawûsê Melek (frequently known as \"Melek Taus\" in English publications), the Peacock Angel (identified with one of these Angels). Tawûsê Melek is often identified by Christians and Muslims with Satan. According to claims in \"Encyclopedia of the Orient\",\nYazidis, however, believe Tawûsê Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a fallen angel.\n\nThe Yazidis believe in a divine triad, like the Alawites. The original god of the Yazidis is considered to be remote and inactive in relation to his creation. His first emanation is Tawûsê Melek, who functions as the ruler of the world. The second hypostasis of this trinity is Sheikh Adî. The third is Sultan Ezid. These are the three hypostases of the one God. The identity of these three is sometimes blurred, with Sheikh Adî considered to be a manifestation of Tawûsê Melek and vice versa. The same also applies to Sultan Ezid. Besides the triad, the second peculiar feature of Yazidi belief is the similarity between Tawûsê Melek and the Abrahamic Satan (the Islamic Iblīs). A popular Yazidi story narrates the fall of Tawûsê Melek and his subsequent rejection by humanity, with the exception of the Yazidis.\n\nThe \"Kitêba Cilwe\" \"Book of Illumination\", which claims to be the words of Tawûsê Melek, and which presumably represents Yazidi belief, states that he allocates responsibilities, blessings, and misfortunes as he sees fit and that it is not for the race of Adam to question him. Sheikh Adî believed that the spirit of Tawûsê Melek was the same as his own, perhaps as a reincarnation. He is reported to have said:Yazidi accounts of creation differ from that of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. They believe that God first created Tawûsê Melek from his own (God's) illumination (\"Ronahî\") and the other six archangels were created later. God ordered Tawûsê Melek not to bow to other beings. Then God created the other archangels and ordered them to bring him dust (\"Ax\") from the Earth (\"Erd\") and build the body of Adam. Then, God gave life to Adam from his own breath and instructed all archangels to bow to Adam. The archangels obeyed except for Tawûsê Melek. In answer to God, Tawûsê Melek replied, \"How can I submit to another being! I am from your illumination while Adam is made of dust.\" Then, God praised him and made him the leader of all angels and his deputy on the Earth. (This probably furthers what some see as a connection to the Islamic \"Shaytan\", as according to the Quran, he too refused to bow to Adam at God's command, though in this case it is seen as being a sign of Shaytan's sinful pride.) Hence, the Yazidis believe that Tawûsê Melek is the representative of God on the face of the Earth and comes down to the Earth on the first Wednesday of Nisan (April). \n\nYazidis hold that God created Tawûsê Melek on this day and celebrate it as New Year's Day. Yazidis argue that the order to bow to Adam was only a test for Tawûsê Melek, since if God commands anything then it must happen. (\"Bibe, dibe\"). In other words, God could have made him submit to Adam, but gave Tawûsê Melek the choice as a test. They believe that their respect and praise for Tawûsê Melek is a way to acknowledge his majestic and sublime nature. This idea is called \"Knowledge of the Sublime\" (\"Zanista Ciwaniyê\"). Şêx Adî has observed the story of Tawûsê Melek and believed in him.\n\nOne of the key creation beliefs held by Yazidis is that they are the descendants of Adam through his son Shehid bin Jer rather than Eve. The Yazidis believe that before Adam and Eve copulated with each other for the first time, Tawûsê Melek encouraged them to see if they could reproduce on their own. He had the couple place their reproductive fluids in jars and store them for several months. When each jar was opened several months later, Eve's was found to contain vermin and insects, and Adam's was found to have contained a beautiful baby boy, Shehid bin Jer. This lovely child, known as \"son of Jar\" grew up to marry a houri and became the ancestor of the Yazidis. Therefore, the Yazidis regard themselves as descending from Adam alone, while other humans are descendants of both Adam and Eve. This is the reason given for Yazidis being exclusively endogamous; clans do not intermarry with non-Yazidis and accept no converts to Yazidism. A severe punishment for breaking this rule is expulsion, which is also effectively excommunication as the soul of the exilee is forfeit.\n\nA belief in the reincarnation of lesser Yazidi souls also exists. Like the Ahl-e Haqq, the Yazidis use the metaphor of a change of garment to describe the process, which they call \"kiras guhorîn\" in Kurmanji (changing the garment). Spiritual purification of the soul can be attained via continual reincarnation within the faith group, but it can also be halted by means of expulsion from the Yazidi community; this is the worst possible fate, since the soul's spiritual progress halts and conversion back into the faith is impossible. Alongside this notion of continuous rebirth, Yazidi theology also includes descriptions of heaven and hell, with hell extinguished, and other traditions incorporating these ideas into a belief system that includes reincarnation.\n\nThe Yazidi holy books are claimed to be the \"Kitêba Cilwe\" (Book of Revelation) and the \"Mishefa Reş\" (Black Book). However, scholars generally agree that the manuscripts of both books published in 1911 and 1913 were forgeries written by non-Yazidis in response to Western travellers' and scholars' interest in the Yazidi religion; however, the material in them is consistent with authentic Yazidi traditions. True texts of those names may have existed, but remain obscure. The real core texts of the religion that exist today are the hymns known as qawls; they have also been orally transmitted during most of their history, but are now being collected with the assent of the community, effectively transforming Yazidism into a scriptural religion. The qawls are full of cryptic allusions and usually need to be accompanied by \"čirōks\" or 'stories' that explain their context.\n\nYazidi society is hierarchical. The secular leader of the world's Yazidi is a hereditary emir or prince, and the current emir is Prince Tahseen Said. A chief sheikh, the Baba Sheikh, heads the religious hierarchy of the Yazidis, and the current Sheikh is Khurto Hajji Ismail. The Yazidis are strictly endogamous; members of the three Yazidi castes, the murids, sheikhs, and pirs, marry only within their group. Marriage outside the caste is considered a sin punishable by death to restore lost honour.\n\nYazidis have five daily prayers: Worshipers should turn their face toward the sun, and for the noon prayer, they should face toward Laliş. Such prayer should be accompanied by certain gestures, including kissing the rounded neck (\"gerîvan\") of the sacred shirt (\"kiras\"). The daily prayer services must not be performed in the presence of outsiders and are always performed in the direction of the sun. Wednesday is the holy day, but Saturday is the day of rest.\n\nAccording to the Yezidi calendar, April 2012 marked the beginning of their year 6,762 (thereby year 1 would have been in 4,750 BC in the Gregorian calendar).\n\nThe Yazidi New Year, called Serê Sal or Çarşemiya Sor (Red Wednesday), falls in Spring, on the first Wednesday of April (somewhat later than the Equinox). There is some lamentation by women in the cemeteries, to the accompaniment of the music of the \"Qewals\", but the festival is generally characterized by joyous events: the music of \"def\" (drum) and \"shebab\" (shawm), communal dancing and meals, the decorating of eggs.\n\nSimilarly, the village Tawaf, a festival held in the spring in honour of the patron of the local shrine, has secular music, dance, and meals in addition to the performance of sacred music. Another important festival is the \"Tawûsgeran\" (circulation of the peacock) where Qewals and other religious dignitaries visit Yazidi villages, bringing the \"senjaq\", sacred images of a peacock made from brass symbolizing Tawûsê Melek. These are venerated, taxes are collected from the pious, sermons are preached and holy water distributed.\nThe greatest festival of the year for ordinary Yazidis is the \"Cejna Cemaiya\" \"Feast of the Assembly\" at Laliş, the annual seven-day pilgrimage to the tomb of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (\"Şêx Adî\") in Laliş, north of Mosul, Iraq. The festival, which is celebrated from 23 \"Aylūl\" (September) to 1 \"Tashrīn\" (October), is an important time for social contact and affirmation of identity.\n\nIf possible, Yazidis make at least one pilgrimage to Laliş during their lifetime, and those living in the region try to attend at least once a year for the autumn \"Feast of the Assembly\". A sacred microcosm of the world, as it were, it contains not only many shrines dedicated to the \"koasasas\" (reincarnations of the seven holy beings in human form), but a number of other landmarks corresponding to other sites or symbols of significance in other faiths, including \"Pirra selat\" \"Serat Bridge\" and a mountain called Mt. Arafat. The two sacred springs are called \"Zamzam\" and \"Kaniya Sipî\" \"The White Spring\". \n\nDuring the celebration, Yazidis bathe in the river, wash figures of Tawûsê Melek and light hundreds of lamps in the tombs of \"Şêx Adî\" and other saints. They sacrifice an ox, which is one reason they have been connected to Mithraism, in addition to the presence of the dog and serpent in their iconography. The sacrifice of the ox is meant to declare the arrival of fall and to ask for precipitation during winter to bring back life to the Earth in the next spring. Moreover, in astrology, the ox is the symbol of Tashrīn.\n\nThe religious centre of the event is the belief in an annual gathering of the \"Heptad\" in the holy place at this time. Rituals practised include the sacrifice of a bull at the shrine of Şêx Shams and the practice of \"sema\".\n\nThere is also a three-day fast in December.\n\nThe Yazidis' concern with religious purity and their reluctance to mix elements perceived to be incompatible is shown in not only their caste system but also various taboos affecting everyday life. The purity of Earth, Air, Fire and Water is protected by a number of taboos, e.g. against spitting on earth, water or fire. Some discourage spitting or pouring hot water on the ground because they believe that spirits or souls that may be present would be harmed or offended by such actions if they happen to be hit by the discarded liquid.\n\nToo much contact with non-Yazidis is also considered polluting. In the past, Yazidis avoided military service which would have led them to live among Muslims and were forbidden to share such items as cups or razors with outsiders. A resemblance to the external ear may lie behind the taboo against eating head lettuce, whose name \"koas\" resembles Yazidi pronunciations of \"koasasa\". Additionally, lettuce grown near Mosul is thought by some Yazidis to be fertilised with human waste, which may contribute to the idea that it is unsuitable for consumption. However, in a BBC interview in April 2010, a senior Yazidi authority stated that ordinary Yazidis may eat what they want, but holy men refrain from certain vegetables (including cabbage) because \"they cause gases\".\n\nChildren are baptised at birth and circumcision is not required, but is practised by some due to regional customs. Dead are buried in conical tombs immediately after death and buried with hands crossed. Yazidis are predominantly monogamous, but chiefs may be polygamous, having more than one wife.\n\nAs the Yazidis hold religious beliefs that are mostly unfamiliar to outsiders, many non-Yazidi people have written about them and ascribed to their beliefs facts that have dubious historical validity. The Yazidis, perhaps because of their secrecy, also have a place in modern occultism.\n\nThe Theosophical Society, in its electronic version of the \"Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary\" states:\nThe Theosophical Society believes that Sanat Kumara is the \"Lord (or Ruler) of the World\". Just as with Yazidi beliefs about the Peacock Angel, outsiders have, at times, viewed the Theosophical Society as worshiping Satan, due to the similarities between Sanat Kumara and the Biblical Lucifer and/or Satan. Similarly, the Theosophist Mark Pinkham explicitly attempts to link the Yazidi myth of the Peacock Angel to Christ. The Peacock Angel's higher self was represented by Christ, the historical Jesus being Sananda Kumara, Sanat Kumara's brother. Pinkham's claim is that Tawûsê Melek and the Theosophical Sanat Kumara are more or less the same individual and that upon the fall of the Peacock Angel, evil entered the world, causing duality to enter Tawûsê Melek's being. The Angel's fallen state was represented by his being called Satan and his outcast nature. However, Pinkham states that the Angel will eventually succeed in redeeming himself, thereby symbolically returning as Christ. The redemption of the Peacock Angel therefore serves as the redemption of the entire world and the ushering in of the eternal kingdom of God. Pinkham claims that for this reason, the Yazidis refuse to refer to Tawûsê Melek as Satan, as this would introduce time and duality into his being, and mean they must acknowledge Tawûsê Melek's eventual and predestined redemption, wherein he merges with Christ (his higher self).\n\nThe distinction between the Theosophical belief and the classic Yazidi belief, is that the office of “Lord of the World,” is merely an initiation taken by an individual soul. Every individual who takes the ninth initiation also rules the world, and will in some sense experience a fall or incarnation, a la Tawûsê Melek or Satan. The ninth initiation, in Theosophy, is the last initiation available on Earth and there is only one individual on Earth on the ninth initiation at a time.\n\nThe Theosophical schema does not include the existence of higher initiations that exist above the ninth one. The only “thing” above the “Lord of the World” is the “Trinity of the Logos,” a divine and limitless entity that resides inside the sun. However, the Earthly representative of the Logos, is the “Ruler of the World,” which would square with the Yazidi claim that Tawûsê Melek is an emanation of God, but not God himself. A sect of the Ahl-i Haqq, who tend to deify ‘Ali, believe that Tawûsê Melek is merely an incarnation of ‘Ali and serves as his representative on Earth. Furthmore, the Alawites tend to associate ‘Ali with the sun.\n\nIn William Seabrook's book \"Adventures in Arabia\", the fourth section, starting with Chapter 14, is devoted to the \"Yezidees\" and is titled \"Among the Yezidees\". He describes them as \"a mysterious sect scattered throughout the Orient, strongest in North Arabia, feared and hated both by Moslem and Christian, because they are worshippers of Satan.\" In the three chapters of the book, he completely describes the area, including the fact that this territory, including their holiest city of Sheik-Adi, was not part of \"Irak\".\n\nGeorge Gurdjieff wrote about his encounters with the Yazidis several times in his book \"Meetings with Remarkable Men\", mentioning that they are considered to be \"devil worshippers\" by other ethnicities in the region. Also, in Peter Ouspensky's book \"In Search of the Miraculous\", he describes some strange customs that Gurdjieff observed in Yezidi boys: \"He told me, among other things, that when he was a child he had often observed how Yezidi boys were unable to step out of a circle traced round them on the ground\" (p. 36)\n\nIdries Shah, writing under the pen-name \"Arkon Daraul\", in the 1961 book \"Secret Societies Yesterday and Today\", describes discovering a Yazidi-influenced secret society in the London suburbs called the \"Order of the Peacock Angel.\" Shah claimed Tawûsê Melek could be understood, from the Sufi viewpoint, as an allegory of the higher powers in humanity.\n\nIn H.P. Lovecraft's story \"The Horror at Red Hook\", some of the murderous foreigners are identified as belonging to \"the Yezidi clan of devil-worshippers\".\n\nIn Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series novel \"The Letter of Marque\", set during the Napoleonic wars, there is a Yazidi character named Adi. His ethnicity is referred to as \"Dasni\".\n\nA fictional Yazidi character of note is the super-powered police officer King Peacock of the \"Top 10\" series (and related comics). He is portrayed as a kind, peaceful character with a broad knowledge of religion and mythology. He is depicted as conservative, ethical, and highly principled in family life. An incredibly powerful martial artist, he is able to perceive and strike at his opponent's weakest spots, a power that he claims is derived from communicating with Malek Ta'us.\n\nThe Yazidis play a significant role in the thriller \"Genesis Secret\", by Tom Knox, which was an international best-seller in 2006, published in 23 languages. In the book, the Yazidis are portrayed as ancient guardians of the megalithic site, Gobekli Tepe, in Kurdish Turkey.\n\nIn her memoir of her service with an intelligence unit of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division in Iraq during 2003 and 2004, Kayla Williams (2005) records being stationed in northern Iraq near the Syrian border in an area inhabited by \"Yezidis\". According to Williams, some Yezidis were Kurdish-speaking but did not consider themselves Kurds and expressed to her a fondness for America and Israel. She was able to learn only a little about the nature of their religion: she thought it very ancient, and concerned with angels. She describes a mountain-top Yezidi shrine as \"a small rock building with objects dangling from the ceiling\" and alcoves for the placement of offerings. She reported that local Muslims considered the Yezidis to be devil worshippers.\n\nIn an October 2006 article in \"The New Republic\", Lawrence F. Kaplan echoes Williams's sentiments about the enthusiasm of the Yazidis for the American occupation of Iraq, in part because the Americans protect them from oppression by militant Muslims and the nearby Kurds. Kaplan notes that the peace and calm of Sinjar is virtually unique in Iraq: \"Parents and children line the streets when U.S. patrols pass by, while Yazidi clerics pray for the welfare of U.S. forces.\"\n\nTony Lagouranis comments on a Yazidi prisoner in his book \"Fear Up Harsh: An Army Interrogator's Dark Journey through Iraq\":\n\nThe belief of some followers of other monotheistic religions of the region that the Peacock Angel equates with their own unredeemed evil spirit Satan, has incited centuries of persecution of the Yazidis as \"devil worshippers\".\n\nA large Yazidi community existed in Syria, but they declined due to persecution by the Ottoman Empire. Several punitive expeditions were organized against the Yazidis by the Ottoman governors (Wāli) of Diyarbakir, Mosul and Baghdad. The objective of these persecutions was the forced conversion of Yazidis to the Sunni Hanafi Islam of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOn 7 April 2007 a crowd of up to 2,000 Yazidi stoned a 17-year-old Iraqi of the Yazidi faith Du'a Khalil Aswad to death. Rumours that the stoning was connected to her alleged conversion to Islam prompted reprisals against Yazidis by Sunnis, including the 2007 Mosul massacre. In August 2007, some 500 Yazidis were killed in a coordinated series of bombings in Qahtaniya that became the deadliest suicide attack since the Iraq War began. In August 2009, at least 20 people were killed and 30 wounded in a double suicide bombing in northern Iraq, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Two suicide bombers with explosive vests carried out the attack at a cafe in Sinjar, west of Mosul. In Sinjar, many townspeople are members of the Yazidi minority.\n\nIn 2014, with the territorial gains of the Salafist militant group calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) there was much upheaval in the Iraqi Yazidi population. ISIL captured Sinjar in August 2014 following the withdrawal of Peshmerga troops of Masoud Barzani, forcing up to 50,000 Yazidis to flee into the nearby mountainous region. In early August the town of Sinjar was nearly deserted as Kurdish Peshmerga forces were no longer able to keep ISIL forces from advancing. ISIL had previously declared the Yazidis to be devil worshippers and had taken the two nearby small oil fields and the town of Zumar as part of a plan to try to seize Mosul's hydroelectric dam. Up to 200,000 people (including an estimated 40,000 Yazidi) fled the city before it was captured by ISIL forces, giving rise to fears of a humanitarian tragedy. Alongside the local Yazidis fleeing Sinjar were Yazidis (and Shiites) who fled to the city a month earlier when ISIL captured the town of Tal Afar.\nMost of the population fleeing Sinjar retreated by trekking up nearby mountains with the ultimate goal of reaching Dohuk in Iraqi Kurdistan (normally a five-hour drive by car). Concerns for the elderly and those of fragile health were expressed by the refugees, who told reporters of their lack of water. Reports coming from Sinjar stated that sick or elderly Yazidi who could not make the trek were being executed by ISIL. Yazidi parliamentarian Haji Ghandour told reporters that \"In our history, we have suffered 72 massacres. We are worried Sinjar could be a 73rd.\" UN groups say at least 40,000 members of the Yazidi sect, many of them women and children, had taken refuge in nine locations on Mount Sinjar, a craggy, high ridge identified in local legend as the final resting place of Noah's ark, facing slaughter at the hands of jihadists surrounding them below if they fled or death by dehydration if they stayed. Between 20,000 and 30,000 Yazidis, most of them women and children, besieged by ISIL, escaped from the mountain after the People's Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) intervened to stop ISIL and opened a humanitarian corridor for them, helping them cross the Tigris into Rojava. Some Yazidis minority were later escorted back to Iraqi Kurdistan by Peshmerga and YPG forces, Kurdish officials have said.\nTheir plight received international media coverage, which led United States President Barack Obama to authorise humanitarian airdrops of meals and water to thousands of Yazidi and Christian religious minorities trapped on Sinjar mountain. President Obama also authorised \"targeted airstrikes\" against Islamic militants in support of the beleaguered religious minority, and to protect American military personnel in northwest Iraq. American humanitarian assistance began on 7 August 2014, with the UK Royal Air Force subsequently contributing to the relief effort. At an emergency meeting in London, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott also pledged humanitarian support, while European nations resolved to join the US in helping to arm Peshmerga fighters aiding the Yazidis with more advanced weaponry.\n\nLater PKK and YPG fighters with Peshmergas and support of the US airstrikes helped the rest of the trapped Yazidis to escape from the mountain. One relief worker in the evacuation operation described the conditions on Mount Sinjar as \"a genocide\", having witnessed hundreds of corpses. Yazidi girls in Iraq allegedly raped by ISIL fighters have committed suicide by jumping to their death from Mount Sinjar, as described in a witness statement. In Sinjar, ISIL destroyed a Shiite shrine and demanded that the remaining population convert to their version of Islam, pay \"jizya\" (a religious tax) or be executed.\n\nCaptured women are treated as sex slaves or spoils of war, some are driven to suicide. Women and girls who convert to Islam are sold as brides, those who refuse to convert are tortured, raped and eventually murdered. Babies born in the prison where the women are held are taken from their mothers to an unknown fate. Nadia Murad, a Yazidi human rights activist and 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner was kidnapped and used as a sex slave by the ISIL in 2014.\n\nHaleh Esfandiari from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars has highlighted the abuse of local women by ISIL militants after they have captured an area. \"They usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them. The younger girls ... are raped or married off to fighters\", she said, adding, \"It's based on temporary marriages, and once these fighters have had sex with these young girls, they just pass them on to other fighters.\" Speaking of Yazidi women captured by ISIL, Nazand Begikhani said \"[t]hese women have been treated like cattle... They have been subjected to physical and sexual violence, including systematic rape and sex slavery. They've been exposed in markets in Mosul and in Raqqa, Syria, carrying price tags.\" Dr. Widad Akrawi said that ISIL uses slavery and rape as weapons of war.\nIn September 2014, Defend International launched a worldwide campaign entitled \"Save The Yazidis: The World Has To Act Now\" to raise awareness about the tragedy of the Yazidis in Sinjar and to co-ordinate activities related to intensifying efforts aimed at rescuing Yazidi and Christian women and girls captured by ISIL. In October 2014 the United Nations reported that more than 5,000 Yazidis had been murdered and 5,000 to 7,000 (mostly women and children) had been abducted by the ISIL. In the same month, President of Defend International dedicated her 2014 International Pfeffer Peace Award to the Yazidis. She asked the international community to make sure that the victims are not forgotten; they should be rescued, protected, fully assisted and compensated fairly.\n\nISIS has, in their digital magazine \"Dabiq\", explicitly claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", ISIL appeals to apocalyptic beliefs and claims \"justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor to the end of the world\". In December 2014, Amnesty International published a report. Despite the oppression Yazidis' women have sustained, they have appeared on the news as examples of retaliation. They have received training and taken positions at the frontlines of the fighting, making up about a third of the Kurd–Yazidi coalition forces, and have distinguished themselves as soldiers.\n\n\n"}
