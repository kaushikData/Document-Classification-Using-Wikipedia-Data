{"id": "3285814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3285814", "title": "1920 Revolution Brigade", "text": "1920 Revolution Brigade\n\nThe 1920 Revolution Brigades (Arabic كتائب ثورة العشرين \"Kitā'ib Thawrat al-ʿIshrīn\") is a Sunni militia group in Iraq, which includes former members of the disbanded Iraqi army. The group has used improvised explosive devices, and armed attacks against U.S. occupation forces. The group comprises the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement. The group is named in reference to the 1920 Iraqi revolt against the British.\n\nAs of 2014, the group was actively involved in the MCIR insurgent network, particularly in Fallujah.\n\nA US military spokesman states that the \"concerned local nationals\" group is now aligned with U.S. forces, while the Brigades denied this in a posting on its web site: \"We say to … the occupation and to your followers and agents that you made a very big lie\" in linking the group with the Diyala anti-al Qaida campaign. The group maintains that the \"Iraqi Hamas\" organization, which consisted of members who left the Brigades before the Diyala operation, were the ones involved in the operation. Iraqi Prime MinisterNuri al-Maliki]] has feared such US-armed 'concerned local citizens' are an armed Sunni opposition in the making, and has argued that such groups should be under the command of the Iraqi Army or police.\n\nThe 1920 Revolution Brigades describes its aim as to establish a liberated and independent Iraqi state on an Islamic basis. It has been active in the area west of Baghdad, in the regions of Abu Ghraib, Khan Dari and Fallujah and in the governorates of Ninwi, Diyali and al-Anbar. The name of the group (Literally \"Brigades of the Revolution of the Twenty\") refers to the 1920 revolution against British colonial rule in Iraq, drawing an implicit parallel between the nationalist resistance against that occupation with the guerrillas fighting coalition forces today. They are the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement. The logo of the group is a map of Iraq, with a Quran on top of it, and the verse \"Fight them, God shall torture them by your hands\". In the middle there is a mirrored symbol of an AK-47, with an Iraqi flag attached to it. Between the gun and the flag, a small print says \"Islamic Resistance movement\", and below, a larger print reads \"Brigades of the 20th Revolution.\"\n\nThe Brigade first emerged in a 16 July statement in which it claimed that U.S. forces were sustaining higher casualties than were being reported. Since then, it resurfaced periodically, including in graffiti in such insurgent strongholds as Fallujah. This group appears to concentrate on guerilla activity, rather than terrorism, and is sensitive to the opinions of the established Sunni Muslim clergy in Iraq (in contrast to groups such as Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad). High-profile operations include the kidnapping of American citizen Dean Sadek in November 2004 (he appeared in two hostage videos but was never found) and the bombing of the al-Arabiya television network headquarters in Baghdad in October 2005. It has also shot down several American helicopters in the Fallujah region.\n\nLittle is known about the group's leadership. On 2 January 2005, the Ministry of Defence (Iraq) reported that Iraqi security forces arrested Hatim al-Zawba'i, whom they identified as a commander of the 1920 Revolution Brigades. In a statement issued on 13 February 2006, the group vowed to \"carry on jihad until the liberation and victory or [until they are] martyred.\n\nOn March 2007 some of its members broke off from the 1920 Revolution Brigades to form Hamas of Iraq.\n\nIn a statement issued on 18 March 2007, the 1920 Revolution Brigades stated that it had dissolved into two new brigades, \"Islamic Conquest\" and \"Islamic Jihad\". Islamic Conquest became Hamas of Iraq and is the name chosen for its military wing. Islamic Jihad took over the name Twentieth Revolution Brigades, promising to uphold its jihadi inheritance.\n\nThe 1920 Revolution Brigade has used bombings, kidnappings, and armed attacks against U.S. forces but does not target non-Muslims or Shiites, staying out of the sectarian war. As a result, it has developed a growing rift with The Jihad Base Organization in Mesopotamia, which has used suicide bombings to often target Shiites which they regard as infidels. The 1920 Revolution Brigade turned down an offer to pledge allegiance to an insurgent coalition group, the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), established by the Jihad Base Organization in Mesopotamia.\n\nOn 27 March 2007, the leader of the 1920 Revolution Bridage, Harith Dhahir Khamis al-Dari (nephew of the most prominent Sunni Iraqi cleric, Haith al-Dari) was killed in an ISI ambush. Intermittent gunbattles have taken place between fighters of the 1920 Revolution Brigades and the Islamic State in Iraq, and rumors have circulated of negotiations between members of the group and the Iraqi government and U.S. forces.\n\nAlthough the group has used bombings, kidnappings, and armed attacks against U.S. forces, on 20 June 2007, \"The Washington Post\" reported that, per telephone interview with Lt. Col. Joseph Davidson, executive officer of the 2nd Infantry Division, U.S. forces were now \"partnering with Sunni insurgents from the 1920 Revolution Brigades, which includes former members of ousted president Saddam Hussein's disbanded army.\" The group has since replied that: \"We say to … the occupation and to your followers and agents that you made a very big lie\" in linking us with the Diyala anti-al Qaida campaign. The group maintains that the organization to which the US military spokesman referred had become the \"Iraqi Hamas\" organization, which consisted of members who left before the Diyala operation and were no longer associated with the 1920 Brigades.\n\nIn October 2007, \"The Guardian\" reported that the 1920 Revolution Brigades would not join an alliance of six other Iraqi insurgent groups. The six groups listed a 14-point political program, including a call for continued action against US forces and a declaration that all laws passed by the Iraq government were null and void. A spokesman for the brigades said it did not join because it did not want to fight with those Sunni tribal groups working with the US against al-Qaida. The spokesman also denied an Economist report that the 1920 Revolution Brigades was working with Americans, and insisted the group was still attacking Americans.\n\n\n\n"}

She was also the first American female and a female Westerner to have become a swami monk.\n\nLouise was initiated by Vivekananda at Thousand Island Park in 1895. She was given the monastic name Abhayananda. She later disassociated herself from Vivekananda and preached philosophy, retaining the same name. Abhayananda claimed to be the only female swami in the entire world.\n\nThere were many other Westeners who, in the first half of the century, became Hindu disciples/sannyasis/gurus: others included the Mother (b. Mira Alfassa, Paris, 1878), perhaps the first Westener to become a guru in India; Swami Abhayananda (b. Marie Lousie) one of the only three Westeners whom Vivekananda, in 1895, initiated as sannyasis—the other two being Leon Landsberg/Swami Kripananda and Dr Street/Swami Yogananda.\n\nAbhayananda immigrated to the US in 1865. Before becoming a swami and entering monastic life, she lectured on a number of issues such as woman's rights, and was a suffragist.\n\nThere appears to be only one sketch depicting her and only one photograph, appearing in an article as a \"convert to Hinduism\" in the Lethbridge Herald on August 10, 1912. There is a letter written by her addressed to one of his disciples, Sister Christine, referring her last arrival in India as an allusion of her desire for money. Her exact death details are unknown.\n\nAn article in The New York Times parsed \"Swami Abhayananda\": \"Swami means monk, Abahaya means fearless, and nanda means bliss. The literal interpretation of her name is, therefore, the 'Monk of Fearless Bliss'.\"\n\nMarie Louise disassociated herself from Vivekananda after she arrived India. Sister Nivedita's letters portrayed Louise as an egotistic, self-centered woman that had little interest in hearing the Vivekananda's teachings. Louise was also alleged to have come from a destitute past and to have been in need of financial assistance.\n\nAccording to Louise:\n\nI teach four classes of philosophy-the Karma Loga(reporter might have misspelt for Karma Yoga), which is the philosophy of actions; the Bhakti Loga(reporter might have misspelt for Bhakti Yoga, the philosophy of devotion and love; the Rajah Loga (reporter might have misspelt for Raja Yoga), a physiological and psychological man, and the Gnana Loga (reporter might have misspelt for Jnana Yoga, or philosophy. ... I teach Christ the man. All men are Christs, and are crucified on the cross of life.\nRegarding women's suffrage, Louise said:\n\"The woman Suffragists, are children playing with dolls, but if men vote, then women have a right to vote on the theory of right; but on the plane of love they have no right to vote. A 'right' implies brute force and power. A King has a 'right' to behead half of his subjects if he chooses, if the subjects preserve their 'right' to live. It is the 'right' of brutes. My ideal of government is no government at all.\n\n\n"}

The ABAP is composed of 14 \"Akharas\", or organisations of Hindu sants and sadhus. Nirmohi Akhara (involved in the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya) and Shri Dattatreya Akhara are two of the prominent akharas which are part of it.\n\nThe Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad is based on the system of \"Akharas\" in Hindu society. An \"Akhara\" literally means a wrestling ring in Hindi, but also stands for a place of debate. There are 14 such organisations based on the form of Hinduism and Hindu philosophy they adhere to. Most Akharas are Vaishnavas (followers of Lord Vishnu) and Shaivism (followers of Lord Shiva).\n\nThe system of \"Akharas\" may date as far back as early 8th century, when Adi Shankaracharya is believed to have established seven \"Akharas\" (possibly 10 as they are also known as Dasnaami): Mahanirvani, Niranjani, Juna, Atal, Avahan, Agni and Anand Akhara. The earliest recorded founding of an \"Akhara\" was that of the Abhana in 547 CE. During periods of Muslim rule in India and later British rule, the \"Akharas\" congregated and organised together, especially during the \"Kumbha Mela\" to work for the preservation of Hindu religion and culture. In 1565, Madhusudana Sarasvati started preparing \"Akharas\" as an armed military force to resist invasions and protect Hindus.\n\nWhile the ABAP does not participate in electoral politics, it has a position of great importance in Hindu society as a leading Hindu leadership organisation. At times, it has cooperated with the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu religious organisation more openly involved in politics and part of the \"Sangh Parivar\" of Hindu nationalist organisations. However, the ABAP has also openly criticised the VHP for raising unnecessary controversies and refused to follow an agenda set by the VHP..\n\nThe Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad has encouraged and supported the movement for the construction of a Ram Janmabhumi Temple on the site where the now-demolished Babri Mosque stood in Ayodhya. The place is believed to be the site of birth of Rama, the eighth and one of the most popular Avatars of Vishnu. In 1989, the Nirmohi Akhara filed litigation regarding the site, and in 2010 their claim was upheld by the Allahabad High Court, which gave the Akhara control of one-third of the site. The ABAP welcomed the verdict, asserting that it would prevent further exploitation of the issue by political parties.\n"}
{"id": "310244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310244", "title": "Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis", "text": "Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis\n\nThe Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis (AMORC), also known as the Rosicrucian Order, is the largest Rosicrucian organization in the world. It has various lodges, chapters and other affiliated bodies throughout the globe, operating in 19 different languages.\n\nAMORC claims an association with a \"perennial philosophy\", often referred to as \"The Primordial Tradition\". The Order further states that it is heir and custodian of the \"Rose-Croix\" of the past, thereby making it the oldest existing Traditional Fraternity and a modern-day manifestation of the 'Rosicrucian Fraternity' of old, which is believed by some to have originated in the traditions of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery schools. The ancient Mysteries are said to have been preserved through the millennia by closed secret societies until the early years of 17th Century Europe. At that point, according to AMORC internal mythology, the time was right for the existence of this body of secret knowledge to become open, i.e. revealed, to the world, in the form of the Rosicrucian manifestos.\nFamous seventeenth century Rosicrucian Michael Maier described the origins of Rosicrucianism as \"Egyptian, Brahmanic, derived from the Mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs.\" Several of his other works also allude to the mysterious origins of the Rosicrucians.\n\nToday, AMORC is regarded as representing an \"open cycle\" of the ancient Rosicrucian tradition, its existence being a \"reactivation\" of Rosicrucian teaching in the United States, with previous Rosicrucian colonies in the United States having become dormant.\n\nAMORC presents itself as a worldwide philosophical and humanistic, non sectarian and apolitical fraternal order devoted to \"the study of the elusive mysteries of life and the universe.\" It is also open to both men and women of legal adult age (18 years old in most countries) regardless of their various religious persuasions.\n\nThe name AMORC is an abbreviation for the Latin title \"Antiquus Mysticusque Ordo Rosæ Crucis\" (\"Ancient and Mystic Order of the Rosy Cross\" – \"Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis\"). Harvey Spencer Lewis, author and mystic who re-activated AMORC in the United States of America, wrote that \"from the very start, and with the issuance of the first public manifesto, the correct name of the international Rosicrucian organization was used, namely, the \"Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis\". This is a slightly abbreviated form of the original Latin name, \"Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis\", and the initials AMORC were immediately used as well as the true and original symbol of the Rosicrucian Order – the golden cross with but \"one red rose\" in the center\". AMORC holds legal rights to the above-mentioned titles including the title \"Rosicrucian Order\".\n\nAMORC's teachings cover what may be termed the \"Sacred Sciences\" and include ideas based on the major philosophers, particularly Pythagoras, Thales, Solon, Heraclitus, Democritus. The teachings are divided into \"Degrees\" which are further grouped into broad categories under titles such as \" Postulant\", \"Neophyte,\" and \"Initiate\" sections. These degrees cover various fields related to physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual existence such as physics, metaphysics, biology, psychology, parapsychology, comparative religion, traditional healing techniques, health, intuition, extrasensory perception, material and spiritual alchemy, meditation, sacred architecture, symbolism, and that mystical state of consciousness relating to the experience of unity with the Divine.\n\nAMORC is a worldwide organization, established in the United States as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) public benefit corporation, with the specific and primary purpose of advancing the knowledge of its history, principles, and teachings for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes. It is financed mainly through fees paid by its members. Income is used by the organization to pay expenses, develop new programs, expand services, and carry out educational work.\n\nThe organizational headquarters for different jurisdictions of the AMORC are designated as \"Grand Lodges.\" The English-speaking Grand Lodge for the Americas is headquartered in Rosicrucian Park in San Jose, California. All Grand Lodges are governed by The Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC. The Supreme Grand Lodge meets annually, often in Lachute, Quebec, Canada (however, in August 2009 the Supreme Board met in Toulouse, France, in honor of the 100th Anniversary of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation there), and is responsible for the worldwide coordination of AMORC, the establishment of new administrations, and the appointment of jurisdictions to Grand Lodges, usually based on language. This body consists of the Imperator, Grand Masters, and related executive officers.\n\nOn a local level, members of AMORC often form smaller affiliated groups organized as Lodges, Chapters, Pronaoi, or Atrium Groups. These various titles differ according to the number of members of each body in regular attendance. Participation in these groups is optional, and participants retain compulsory membership with their respective Grand Lodge. Many of these groups charge additional dues to participants to cover expenses such as rent, utility and maintenance costs. Most affiliated bodies of the AMORC offer Open Meetings or Lectures to which the general public is invited and welcome.\n\nEach AMORC Grand Lodge has its own headquarters and facilities. In North America, the Grand Lodge is located at 1342 Naglee Ave. The headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas owns the Rosicrucian Park in San Jose, California, founded in 1927, which includes the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, the fifth planetarium built in the USA (and the first to have a US-built star projector, built by Dr. Harvey Spencer Lewis), the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, Rosicrucian Research Library, Grand Temple, Administration Building, Fountain Plaza and Gardens, the Alchemy Garden and the walking Labyrinth.\n\nDiscussion groups, an informal type of gathering for both members and the public, were formally introduced in 2009 in North America. They are authorized by AMORC but are not affiliated bodies.\n\nAccording to AMORC's internal history in 1909 Harvey Spencer Lewis visited France in search of Rosicrucians, was initiated in Toulouse, France, and given the mandate to establish an order in North America. After further qualification and preparation the first official Manifesto was issued in the United States in 1915, announcing the establishment of Rosicrucian activity in America. May Banks-Stacy, the co-founder of AMORC, was said to be one of the last successors to the original colony of Rosicrucians that settled in America during the late 17th century, and an initiate of the Rosicrucians of the East. Lewis became a \"secret partner\" of Big Business in America. According to railroad magnate Arthur Stillwell, no other man has exerted a greater influence as a secret partner in American free enterprise than Lewis. Walt Disney was once a member of AMORC as was \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry, Jack Palance's daughter Holly Palance and many other well known individuals who prefer to remain anonymous.\n\nAMORC headquarters were located in New York City, San Francisco, and then Tampa before moving to San Jose, California, in 1927. Harvey Spencer Lewis died in 1939 and, in accordance with wishes stipulated in his will, was succeeded in the Office of Imperator by his son Ralph Maxwell Lewis who had previously served as Supreme Secretary. Gary L. Stewart who previously served as Grand Master of the English-Speaking jurisdiction and then Vice President of the Board of Directors was appointed to the Office of Imperator upon Lewis' death in 1987 by AMORC's Board of Directors which forms the Supreme Grand Lodge. Christian Bernard who had been the Grand Master of France and then succeeded Stewart to the position of Vice President of the Board was elected to the Office of Imperator in 1990 by the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring World War II AMORC underwent a dramatic period of growth. After the war ended AMORC was able to lend support to its European sister organizations. Eventually many of these then came under the administration of AMORC's leadership in San Jose. 2009, the centennial year of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation in Toulouse, saw growth in membership in the English Grand Lodge for the Americas and very active participation in on-line activities including Facebook, Twitter, online Discussion groups, a social networking site, podcasts and Rosicrucian TV on YouTube. Rosicrucian Park in San Jose received many improvements as well, including the completion of accessibility upgrades to the museum, planetarium and grounds and the installation of sustainable native plant gardens.\n\nAMORC uses \"traditional\" history, consisting of tales and legends represented as having been passed down for centuries by word of mouth as well as the conventional \"chronological\" history, which consists of verifiable fact. According to its \"traditional\" history AMORC traces its origin to \"Mystery Schools\" established in Egypt during the joint reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III and Hatshepsut, about 1500 BCE. They united the priesthoods of Egypt into a single order under the leadership of Hatshepsut's Vizier, Hapuseneb. Each Temple had its associated \"Per Ankh\" (House of Life) where the Mysteries were handed down. In uniting the priesthoods, the \"Per Ankhu\" were also united. These schools were formed to probe into \"the mysteries of life\" — in other words, natural phenomena, and initiatic spirituality. AMORC also claims that among their most esteemed pupils were Pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) and his wife Nefertiti.\n\nOver centuries these Mystery Schools spread into Greece and thence into Rome. During the Middle Ages they were concealed under various names. AMORC claims that Rosicrucianism is mentioned as far back as 1115 CE in a book of the collection of Brother Omnis Moriar in Germany. However, no other record of such a brother and book has appeared. The alleged name probably derives from the opening words of Horace in Ode 3.30 in which he writes: \"Non Omnis Moriar\" (\"I shall not completely die\").\nRosicrucianism rose to considerable prominence in Europe during the 17th century following the publication and wide circulation of a small pamphlet, the \"Fama Fraternitatis\". AMORC scholars have suggested that Rosicrucians first came to America in the area of present-day Carmel-by-the-Sea, California in The Vizcaíno Expedition of 1602–1603. The next Rosicrucian expedition to America is said to have been by the chartered vessel \"Sarah Maria\" during the early months of 1694 under the leadership of Grand Master Johannes Kelpius and they established a colony in what is now Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. They finally settled on the banks of the Wissahickon. \"In that retired valley beside the flowing brook the secret rites and mysteries of the true Rosicrucian Philosophy flourished unmolested for years, until the state of affairs brought about by the American Revolution, together with pernicious Sunday legislation which also discriminated against the keepers of the scriptural Sabbath day, gradually caused the incoming generation to assimilate with the secular congregations.\" This is disputed by another organization, the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross at one time headed by Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer. Johannes Kelpius of the Jacob Boehme Lodge in Germany allegedly led the German Pietists to America, although no historical evidence exists to support this claim, nor the common claim to be connected to the Ephrata Cloister. It is also a fact that the two rival organizations historically disputed their claims to Rosicrucian genuineness.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1990 the leadership of AMORC was entrusted to the Office of an Imperator who was solely responsible for all doctrine and ritual of the Order as well as a corporate president who sat at the head of the board of directors, which was responsible for determining all corporate matters related to the organization. When AMORC reorganized in April, 1990, the dual function of the Office was merged into one position, that of President of the worldwide AMORC organization. However, internally, the President was still referred to by the traditional title of Imperator. In addition to the Imperator, each Grand Lodge has a Grand Master.\n\nIn 1990 there was a dispute over the leadership of the AMORC, which was then under the leadership of Imperator Gary L. Stewart, prompted by allegations made by members of the Board of Directors of embezzlement on the part of Stewart. In April, 1990, a lawsuit was filed by the Board and, as a result of the allegations, Stewart was kept from returning to AMORC's properties by virtue of a Temporary Restraining Order until trial. The newly expanded Board of Directors voted that the Vice President of the Board of Directors, Christian Bernard, should assume Stewart's offices. An installation ritual was held at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, California. During the next three years there was little progress regarding the lawsuit. Eventually, the new AMORC Board of Directors sought to settle out of court, due to the ongoing financial strain of legal costs. On 10 August 1993, AMORC dismissed their case against Stewart with prejudice. The dismissal was the final severing of the relationship between Stewart and AMORC.\n\nThe governance of AMORC is overseen by the Supreme Grand Lodge (the Imperator, Grand Masters and Administrators), with local (geographic and/or language based) Grand Lodges throughout the world.\n\nAfter his removal from AMORC in 1990, former Imperator Stewart founded the Confraternity of the Rose Cross and uses the original version of H. Spencer Lewis' monographs with addenda added by Stewart as well as additional monographs written by Stewart (as opposed to the monographs currently used by AMORC, which were initially rewritten in large parts under Imperator Bernard's supervision and are now regularly revised and updated according to AMORC traditional custom dating from the time of H. Spencer Lewis's first published materials in 1916). Stewart also founded the Order Militia Crucifera Evangelica and assisted with the formation of the British Martinist Order. Other organizations using the name Rosicrucian formed after Stewart's removal from AMORC include the Ghanaian Order of the Rose Cross led by Benjamin Quaye and the Norwegian Order of the Rose Cross led by Robert Aarberg of which both orders are closely allied with Stewart's Confraternity of the Rose Cross; and the short-lived Ancient Rosae Crucis which was led by Ashley McFadden.\n\nA well-known member of AMORC was Mexican muralist painter Diego Rivera. The association has puzzled art historians, as Rivera was a staunch adherent of Marxism. In 1926, Rivera was among the founders of AMORC's Mexico City lodge, called Quetzalcoatl, and painted an image of Quetzalcoatl for the local temple.\nIn 1954, when he tried to be readmitted into the Mexican Communist Party from which he had been excluded because of his support of Leon Trotsky, Rivera had to justify his AMORC activities, which looked strange for a Marxist. Rivera answered that, by joining AMORC, he wanted to infiltrate a typical \"Yankee\" organization on behalf of Communism. However, he also claimed that AMORC was \"essentially materialist, insofar as it only admits different states of energy and matter, and is based on ancient Egyptian occult knowledge from Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti.\"\n\nMany of the activities of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC are open to the public, as well as members. These include:\n\n\nAMORC often organizes various conferences around the world, increasingly having many sessions open to the public, and several councils of experts on various topics. In August 2001 the world convention took place in Gothenburg, Sweden. The main theme of the convention was world peace and harmony. The convention was of significant importance to Rosicrucian history because Imperator Bernard presented the \"Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\" to inform the public about AMORC's position on the current world situation. A subsequent manifesto, the \"Appellatio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\"was issued in 2014 as a call to action on these themes.\n\nIn July 2004 The Rosicrucian World Peace Conference was held in San Jose. Over 2000 Rosicrucians from 70 countries gathered with Imperator Christian Bernard, and North American Grand Master Julie Scott. The Imperator dedicated the Rosicrucian Park's Rosicrucian Peace Garden, designed according to examples from Egypt's 18th Dynasty by Grand Master Emeritus of the English Grand Lodge for Australia, New Zealand and Asia, Peter Bindon.\n\nThe World Convention for 2007 was held in Berlin, Germany with the theme \"Love Will Build the Bridge.\" All of the events, except for the ritualistic convocations, were open to the Public.\n\nCuritiba, Brazil, the headquarters of the Portuguese Grand Lodge of AMORC, hosted the August 2011 World Convention: The Sacred and the Primordial Tradition.\n\nThe World Convention in 2015 was again held in San Jose CA USA celebrating the 100th Anniversary of AMORC's founding in America in 1915.\n\nThe International Research Council is a group of AMORC members who have expertise in several areas, including physics, biology, philosophy and music. According to the AMORC, the members of the International Research Council dedicate themselves to the advancement of their profession for the benefit of humanity.\n\nThe Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum launched a substantial new exhibit on Spiritual and Physical Alchemy on the Spring Equinox 2015.\n\nThe Rosicrucian Order hosted an academic conference for Scholars and Practitioners of Esotericism at Rosicrucian Park, 22–25 July 2010. The theme for the papers and presentations given by members of many different esoteric groups was the influence of esoteric Orders on the modern world. Several of the papers were to be published in the June 2011 Rose Croix Journal.\n\nThe Council of Solace is a group of Rosicrucians who meditate and direct spiritual force for health and harmony daily on behalf of others. They offer free, 24-hour metaphysical aid to those in need, regardless of membership. Members and the public may by invitation take part in the Council of Solace meditation ritual held in various locations.\n\nThe AMORC publishes several publications including a public magazine called the Rosicrucian Digest, an online academic periodical called the \"Rose-Croix Journal,\" as well as books which focus on topics such as metaphysics, mysticism, and Egyptology.\n\nThe Rosicrucian Digest was first published in 1915 under the name \"American Rosae Crucis\", and then \"The Triangle\", \"The Mystic Triangle\" and finally \"The Rosicrucian Digest\". It has been adapted to serve the needs of each period. Beginning with the December 2006 issue (Vol 84:2) the Digest began a series of multimedia thematic issues available online and in print twice a year. The first such issue (December 2006) dealt with Atlantis, while the 2007 volumes covered Ancient Egypt and The Essenes. 2008 issues followed with The Orphic Mysteries and the Delphi, while 2009 issues covered The Pythagoreans and the Eleusinian Mysteries and other Timeline topics through 2014.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the public magazine is named \"Rosicrucian Beacon\" and is published quarterly by the \"English speaking jurisdiction for Europe, Africa and the Middle East of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC.\" In Australasia the magazine is titled \"The Rosicrucian\". Other AMORC jurisdictions have similar publications.\n\nAMORC's \"Rose+Croix Journal\" is \"an international, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, peer-reviewed online journal that focuses on topics that relate to the sciences, history, the arts, mysticism, and spirituality, especially interdisciplinary topics and transdisciplinary inquiries that traverse and lie beyond the limits of different fields of study. These topics may relate to any of the arts and sciences and/or to other emerging fields of human endeavor\" (from the \"Rose+Croix Journal \" http://www.rosecroixjournal.org). The Journal's Website also has a Resources section with the five Rosicrucian Manifestos, \"Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians,\" \"Rosicrucian Documents,\" online editions of the \"Rosicrucian Digest,\" etc. Submissions are solicited from members and the public.\n\nAccording to AMORC tradition, H. Spencer Lewis received the mandate from the Rosicrucians of Toulouse when he was initiated in 1909 to make the tradition available and comprehensible to modern women and men. In accord with this, H. Spencer Lewis, and after him Ralph M. Lewis, used all of the technologies available to them to accomplish their work. An example was the radio station H. Spencer Lewis had broadcasting from his office at the Rosicrucian Park, and before that, at the previous headquarters in Tampa, and San Francisco. The broadcasting from San Jose began on 15 February 1928 and was delivered by two 30-metre radio towers inside the park. The radio towers have since been removed, though for some time AMORC continued to broadcast through the historic San Jose KEEN radio station. Today, the Order communicates using newer media:\n\n\nThe public presence of the Rosicrucians in Western Europe was made known through the publication of three manifestos. AMORC introduced a fourth manifesto, the \"Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\" at an AMORC convention in Sweden in August 2001. The Positio offers AMORC's observations on problems in the modern world, along with proposed solutions. The Positio closes with an invocation that expresses what it calls \"Rosicrucian Utopia\": A subsequent manifesto, the \"Appellatio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\"was issued in 2014 as a call to action on these themes. \nGod of all beings, God of all life, In the humanity we are dreaming of:\n\n\nAMORC awards the titles Frater Rosae Crucis and Soror Rosae Crucis to members initiated into the 10th Degree of the order. These members are considered to have attained a master level of understanding of the society's teachings. Awardees may use the post-nominal letters F.R.C. or S.R.C.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50559325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50559325", "title": "Astronomica (Manilius)", "text": "Astronomica (Manilius)\n\nThe Astronomica ( or ]), also known as the Astronomicon, is a Latin didactic poem about celestial phenomena, written in hexameters and divided into five books. The \"Astronomica\" was penned c. AD 1020 by a Roman poet whose name was likely Marcus Manilius; little is known of Manilius, and although there is evidence that the \"Astronomica\" was probably read by many other Roman writers, no surviving works explicitly quote him.\n\nThe earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly intact, the \"Astronomica\" describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the zodiac and astrology. The poemwhich seems to have been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem \"De rerum natura\"espouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the \"Astronomica\" features a lacuna, which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.\n\nThe poem was rediscovered 14161417 by the Italian humanist and scholar Poggio Bracciolini, who had a copy made from which the modern text derives. Upon its discovery, the \"Astronomica\" was read, commented upon, and edited by a number of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other classical Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This started to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist A. E. Housman published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the \"Astronomica\" to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory. At the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate highly technical astronomical concepts and complex mathematical computations into poetry.\n\nBecause no contemporary Roman sources mention his name, the exact identity of the \"Astronomica\"s author is a tantalizing question, but his name was probably Marcus Manilius. This uncertainty has led to Marcus Manilius being confused over the years with Manilius Antiochus (fl.c.100BC, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his \"Naturalis Historia\"); Flavius Manlius Theodorus (fl.c.AD376409, a consul in AD399) and Boëthius (the sixth-century Roman senator and author of \"De consolatione philosophiae\", whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus Boëthius). Although the poem suggests that the writer was a citizen and resident of Rome, some have contended that Manilius was a non-Roman; according to Katharina Volk, a Latinist who specializes in Manilius, this belief is generally based on either \"the poet's supposedly inferior Latinity\" or \"the wish to see Manilius as the member of a Greek intellectual milieu at Rome\". The 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacobs and the 19th- and 20th-century historian Paul Monceaux have argued that he was an African, based largely on his writing style, which they say resembles that of other African authors. Volk counters this view, arguing that Manilius writes \"from ... a conventional Roman perspective\" and \"takes recourse to Roman history to illustrate the astrological facts he discusses\".\n\nThe work's date has been debated. The only clear reference to an historical event is a reference to the Battle of the Teutoburg Foresta decisive loss for Rome, forcing it to withdraw from Magna Germaniain AD9. In considering the poem's date, scholars have proposed three hypotheses: that it was written entirely under Augustus (who ruled from 27 BC until AD 14), under the reigns of both Augustus and Tiberius (who ruled from AD 1437), or entirely under Tiberius. The first conjecture was favored primarily from the Renaissance until the 19th century, when Karl Lachmann argued that references to the emperor in the poem made more sense if they were referring to Tiberius. At the turn of the 20th century, scholars such as A. E. Housman began favoring the idea that the first two books were written under Augustus, the last two under Tiberius, and that the third was \"undatable\". This debate has not been settled, although Volk has argued that the poem should be dated to c. AD 1020.\n\nAccording to Volk, Manilius's \"Astronomica\" is the earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly extant. Volk wrote that since he dedicates the poem to stellar phenomena, it is \"indicative of the great fascination ... that the stars held for the Romans of Manilius' period\".\n\nThe \"Astronomica\", which is written in hexameters, opens with Manilius contending that he is the \"first to sing of astrology\". He also claims that the god Mercury engendered his interest in celestial bodies.\n\nIn the first book he ponders the origin of the universe, considering theories by Xenophanes, Hesiod, Leucippus, Heraclitus, Thales, and Empedocles before arguing that the universe was created from the four elements and is governed by a divine spirit. According to Manilius, the universe is composed of two spheres: one—the Earth—is solid and the other—the \"sphere of stars\", often called the firmament— is hollow. The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the firmament revolves around it, explaining the movements of the stars. The planets, the moon, and the Sun also revolve around the Earth in the vast space between its surface and the edge of the firmament. Because the Earth is in the center of the universe, it is equidistant from the firmament and is thus not compelled to \"fall\" in any specific direction. According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god (\"conspirat deus\") and is governed by reason (\"ratione gubernat\"). Manilius next discusses the constellations and stars and the celestial circles. In this section, the poet spends considerable time contemplating the Milky Way band, which, after exploring several hypotheses as to its existence, he concludes is likely the celestial abode for dead heroes. The first book ends with an exploration of comets, which Manilius sees as harbingers of calamity or great disaster.\n\nAccording to Volk, books two and three deal mainly with the finer details of the zodiac. Book two opens with a preface in which Manilius presents a brief history of hexameter poetry, singling out Homer and Hesiod. His purpose, he argues, is to emphasize the uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others rather than to insert himself into this poetic tradition. According to Manilius, \"Every path that leads to Helicon has been trodden\" (\"omnis ad accessus Heliconos semita trita est\"; all other topics have been covered) and he must find \"untouched meadows and water\" (\"integra\" ... \"prata\" ... \"undamque\") for his poetry: astrology. Manilius ends the book's preface by saying \"that the divine cosmos is voluntarily revealing itself both to mankind as a whole and to the poet in particular\", and that he is set apart from the crowd because his poetic mission has been sanctioned by fate. The poet then begins his explanation of the first astrologically significant circle: the zodiac itself. He first considers the signs of the zodiac (viz. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces), before discussing the aspects and relationships between the signs and other objects. In this section, the poet briefly discusses the zodiac signs, the Olympian gods who serve as their protectors, and the relationship between the signs and the parts of the human body. The \"Astronomica\" then considers \"dodecatemoria\" before he deviates from the zodiac and begins to discuss the didactic method. The book concludes with a consideration of the second astrologically significant circle, that of the fixed circle of the observer. The last few lines are dedicated to an overview of the \"dodecatropos\".\n\nThe third book—which focuses mainly on \"determin[ing] the degree of the ecliptic which is rising about the horizon at the moment\" of a person's birth—opens with Manilius's reiteration that his work is original. Because his topic is complex and difficult, the poet tells his audience they can \"expect truth but not beauty\". He them discusses the third astrologically significant circle, the lots, which are points on a birth chart that carry special significance. Subsequent verses explain how to calculate the ascendant, the horoscope, and chronocrators; and how to determine the projected length of one's life. The third book concludes with a discussion about the tropic signs, which, while not particularly pertinent to the astrological content of the book, allows Manilius to end the book on a \"poetic note\". Most scholars consider the third book to be highly technical; according to Goold it \"is the least poetical of the five, exemplifying for the most part Manilius's skill in rendering numbers and arithmetical calculations in hexameters\". A similar but less favorable sentiment is expressed by Green, who writes that in this book, \"the disjuncture between instruction and medium is most obviously felt [because] complex mathematical calculations are confined to hexameter and obscured behind poetic periphrasis\".\n\nBooks four and five are largely about \"the effects of particular celestial phenomena on the native\". Book four covers many topics that originated in Egypt, leading Goold to write that Manilius based his work on an Egyptian source. Much of the first portion of this book deals with decans and the \"partes damnandae\", both of which allow Manilius another chance to convert mathematical and astrological tables into poetic verse. A short description of the rising of individual zodiacal degrees is followed by a more comprehensive survey of zodiacal geography. Near the end of the book, Manilius writes about the ecliptic signs. The book is punctuated at lines 4.387407 and 4.866935 by \"exhortation[s] of the frustrated student\", where complaints that astrology is difficult and nature is hidden are countered by statements that \"the object of study is nothing less than (union with) god\" and \"the universe (microcosm) wishes to reveal itself to man\".\n\nMost of the fifth (and final) book is a discussion of \"paranatellonta\" via the myth of Andromeda and Perseus. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents; Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Andromeda was chained to a cliff but before the creature could consume her, Perseus (who had just vanquished Medusa) arrived. He instantly fell in love with Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, \"is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time; Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monster—strictly, Cetus (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as \"belua\" (5.544, 608) and \"monstrum\" (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia\". Green says the story is perfect for Manilius; he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360. Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to Ovid's version of the story and called Manilius's retelling \"a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple\" (\"purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus pannus\"). A similar sentiment was expressed by the Cambridge classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall, who wrote that while the episode was meant to be a \"show piece\", it comes across as \"a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace\". Between lines 5.709–10, there is a large lacuna, meaning that at least some of the work is missing, and then the last few lines of the book concern stars and other stellar phenomena. The book ends with a simile about the \"\"res publica\" of stars\". This section—in which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized system, defined by a hierarchy that prevents \"cosmic disaster\"—seems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.\n\nAccording to Volk, \"The basic tenet of what we might call Manilius' natural philosophy is the idea that the universe is divine\". She writes that Manilius is inconsistent about the location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims the perfectly regular movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars is proof that the universe is the product of a god; he also says the universe itself is a god (\"mundum ... ipsum esse deum\"). Later in the same book, Manilius again says the universe is the \"work of a great divinity\" (\"magni ... numinis ordo\"). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes; \"It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a \"diuinum numen\" (cf. 1.484) or is it a \"deus\" (cf 1.485) itself?\" Volk answers that in the cosmology of the \"Astronomica\", \"God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [and] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god\". According to Volk, this interpretation of the universe, which states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly way, thus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect affecting everything within the cosmos and that fate rules all.\n\nVolk points out the poem borrows or alludes to a number of philosophical traditions, including Hermeticism, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism but the prevailing belief of commentators is that Manilius espouses a Stoic worldview in the \"Astronomica\". A comparison between Manilius's beliefs and those of other Stoics reveals parallels that according to Volk \"are immediately obvious\". For instance, Stoics and Manilius agree on the divinity of the universe, the argument from design, the assumption that the supreme god is both the creator of the universe and the active force within it, the interconnectedness of everything, the understanding that humans are intimately connected to the cosmos, the importance of considering the heavens, and the belief in an inescapable fate that rules over all. The agreement on this latter point is of special importance because, according to Volk, belief in fate is \"one of the most notorious aspects of the Stoic system\".\n\nThe identification of the poem as Stoic, however, is not unanimous. In 1887, against the common opinion of contemporaneous scholars, Gustave Lanson contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. In 2005, Alexander MacGregor said that while contemporary scholars such as Goold and Volk read Manilius as a Stoic, the \"Astronomica\" actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places. Manilius exalts Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God, denies the ekpyrosis (a key Stoic belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every Great Year followed by a cosmic recreation), never discusses the six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero, and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of Pythagorean tenets; the Pythagorean order of the planets, the importance of geometry and numbers, and the significance of tetraktys (triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows). In key places, Manilius also makes use of non-Stoics like Eudoxus of Cnidus and Cicero. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an idealistic Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.\n\nMany consider the \"Astronomica\" to be a work of erudition, elegance, and passion. Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse, and the Harvard University Press later echoed this commendation, writing that Manilius \"exhibit[s] great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form\", and that the poet \"writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars\". Housman, however, calls Manilius \"facile and frivolous\" but also describes him as \"the one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness\". The poem, while metrically correct, has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices. The classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall argues that while \"at his best, Manilius may remind us of Lucretius\", the \"metre [that he uses] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age\". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the \"Astronomica\" idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they argue he wrote and spoke a form of \"Africitas\"—a putative African dialect of Latin \"with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style\"—thus explaining the poem's quirks. Aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of \"Africitas\" in the poem, however, M. Dorothy Brock argues there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa.\n\nIn addition to its stylistic oddities, the \"Astronomica\" includes some internal inconsistencies. According to Green, the poem is \"riddled with confusion and contradiction\"; he cites its \"presentation of incompatible systems of astrological calculation, information overload, deferral of meaning and contradictory instruction\". At the same time, Green notes that similar issues exist in other first-to-third-century astrological works. According to Caroline Stark, Manilius paradoxically claims astrological knowledge may be acquired by individuals and that it is only granted by divine favor. T. Barton says Manilius may have included these contradictions and complexities so he would be regarded as \"a figure of unreachable knowledge for the novice student-reader\". Green, while not ruling out this hypothesis, says Manilius was probably not motivated by a \"desire to carve out for himself a position of power in the new imperial world of experts\" as Barton says. Rather, Green says Manilius—due to his \"pride in poetic innovation\" and his \"deference ... to the Emperor\"—sought to present \"himself as a compliant imperial agent, intent on producing a creative poetic enterprise that plots its own way through the levels of acceptable stellar discourse in the early empire\". David Pingree concludes that the poem's \"principal purpose seems to have been to delight its audience with poetry and to arouse admiration for the poet by its cleverness\".\n\nIt is unknown whether the \"Astronomica\" is a finished work; a large lacuna (i.e. a gap) between lines 5.709 and 5.710 presents a problem with this discussion. According to Housman, based strictly on the contents of the \"Astronomica\", one cannot cast a full horoscope because necessary information—such as an in-depth survey of the planets and the effects constellations both inside and outside the zodiac produce upon their setting—is missing. According to Volk, the lack of a lengthy consideration of the planets is rather puzzling because Manilius claims several times that he will examine their zodiacal nature. Goold writes that \"a didactic poem is seldom an exhaustive treatise\" and argues that Manilius likely gave a \"perfunctory account of the planets' natures in the great lacuna [and then] considered his obligations duly discharged\".\n\nOthers have argued the work was originally longer and some hypothesize it comprised eight books. These writers base their assertion on a letter sent in AD 983 by Gerbertus Aureliacensis (later Pope SylvesterII) to the Archbishop of Rheims, in which the former reports he had recently located \"eight volumes about astrology by Boethius\" (\"viii volumina Boetii de astrologia\") at the abbey at Bobbio. Boethius was often confused with Manilius because one of the former's names was \"Manlius\". Those who favor the idea the poem was once longer argue the manuscript at Bobbio was a misattributed eight-book version of the \"Astronomica\". Goold repudiates this hypothesis, noting the catalogue at Bobbio lists the work Gerbertus was likely referring to as composed of \"three books by Boethius about arithmetic, and the rest [i.e. five] about astronomy\" (\"libros Boetii iii de aritmetica et alterum de astronomia\"). This, according to Goold, is evidence Gerbertus found one manuscript that contained both Boethius's \"De arithmetica\" and Manilius's \"Astronomica\" rather than an eight-book version of the latter.\n\nVolk, when considering the problem of completeness, proposed several hypotheses: the work is mostly complete but internally inconsistent about which topics it will and will not consider; the lacuna in book five may have originally contained the missing information; the lacuna may be relatively small and the work is unfinished; or entire books may have originally existed but were lost over time through the \"hazardous process of textual transmission\".\n\nManilius frequently imitates Lucretius, who wrote the didactic poem \"De rerum natura\". Some classicists have suggested that Manilius may have sought to emulate Lucretius by writing six books, but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce, and it remains mostly speculative. While Lucretius's work espouses Epicureanism (a philosophy that emphasizes materialism and skepticism of superstition and divine intervention), Manilius's work is largely Stoic, and promotes a Greco-Roman understanding of creationism as well as fatalistic determinism. Both Volk and the Lucretian scholar David Butterfield have argued that Manilius is in many ways, an \"anti-Lucretius\", with the former arguing that \"his presentation in the \"Astronomica\" of an orderly cosmos ruled by fate is a direct attack on the random universe depicted by his predecessor\". Manilius sometimes conveys his philosophical stance via grammatical voice: unlike Lucretius, who often uses a passive construction to convey his understanding of nature, Manilius uses active grammatical constructions to convey the intentionality he sees in creation (e.g. \"God and reason, which rules all things, guide earthly animals by heavenly signs\", \"deus et ratio quae cuncta gubernat ducit ab aeternis terrena animalia signis\"). Furthermore, while Lucretius used \"De rerum natura\" to present a non-theistic account of creation, Manilius \"was a creationist rather than a materialistic evolutionist\", and he consequently refers to \"one spirit\" (\"unus spiritus\", 2.64), a \"divine power\" (\"divina potentia\", 3.90), a \"creator\" (\"auctor\", 3.681), and a \"god\" (\"deus\", 2.475) throughout his poem.\n\nThe \"Astronomica\" is influenced by Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Ennius's \"Annales\", and the Greek didactic poet Aratus. The latter's influence on Manilius is especially noticeable, and it seems likely that Manilius based much of his first book on portions of Aratus's \"Phaenomena\". Despite his debt to the poet, Manilius diverges from his understanding of the cosmos; Aratus focuses on mythology and \"graphic description\", whereas Manilius emphasizes the scientific aspects of his work. It is uncertain if Manilius had direct knowledge of Aratus's poem or if he used a translation by Cicero, Ovid, or Germanicus. The latter position is favored by several 21st-century scholars, such as D. Liuzzi and Emma Gee. In regards to the poet's relationship with Germanicus, Wolfgang Hübner writes: \"The few echoes of Germanicus' translation of Aratus are insufficient for us to establish which of the two drew on the other, or whether the two were composed independently of each other.\"\n\nThe \"Astronomica\" directly references Homer (as the \"greatest poet\", \"maximus vates\") as well as Hesiod (calling him \"nearest to [Homer]\", \"proximus illi\"), and alludes to numerous other Greek poets and writers such as Apollonius Rhodius, Choerilus of Iasus, Choerilus of Samos, and Aeschylus. The poem also contains a direct allusion to Ennius's \"Annales\", which, according to Goold, is the \"Astronomica\"s \"one solitary notice of Latin literature.\"\n\nAlthough there are over thirty existing manuscript copies of the \"Astronomica\", the text as it is known today is derived from three key manuscripts: \"Codex Gemblacensis\" (G), \"Codex Lipsiensis\" (L), and \"Codex Matritensis\" (M). These in turn belong to two separate manuscript families: \"α\" (which includes G and L), and \"β\" (which includes M). Of the two families, Robinson Ellis wrote: \"[α] represents a text more correct, but worse interpolated; [β], a text which is fuller of copyists' errors, but less interpolated.\"\n\nThe first family, \"α\", takes its name from a now-lost source and includes manuscripts G and L. G, dating from the late 10th to the 11th century, was found at the monastery of Gembloux in Brabant, in modern-day Belgium; L, from the library of Leipzig, was probably written around the mid-11th century and has many corrections made by a scribe. Housman argues that L is the superior of the two, as it was probably copied straight from α, whereas G was probably derived from a copy of a copy.\n\nThe second family, \"β\", takes its name from the now-lost archetype and includes manuscript M, which itself is a direct descendant of the manuscript that Poggio Bracciolini rediscovered (i.e. the aforementioned manuscript β) near Constance during a break in the Council of Constance c.141617. M had been transcribed by a German amanuensis on Bracciolini's request, but due to the scribe's incompetence the resultant manuscript was riddled with mistakes, prompting Bracciolini to sarcastically remark that the new copy had to be \"divined rather than read\" (\"divinare oportet non legere\"). Although poorly written, M has been singled out as possibly the most important surviving manuscript, because it was a direct copy of the archetype (β), whereas G and L are derived from a less \"faithful\" copy (that is, α) of the archetype.\n\nFollowing the invention of the printing press, the \"editio princeps\" of the \"Astronomica\" was published in Nuremberg around 1473 by the astronomer Regiomontanus from an error-riddled Italian copy. The text was then critically edited by Joseph Justus Scaliger, whose first edition was published in Paris in 1579; a second and improved edition, collated at least partially from the \"Codex Gemblacensis\", was published in Leiden in 15991600, and a third edition was published in 1655 after Scaliger's death by Johann Heinrich Boeckler. An updated edition was published by Richard Bentley in 1739. Then, in five volumes between 1903 and 1930, Housman published what is considered by many scholars the authoritative edition of the poem (with an additional \"editio minor\" in 1932). According to Volk, \"[Housman's] work is famoussome might say notoriousfor its bold handling of the text, its incisive commentary, and its merciless ... invective against other scholars.\" In 1977, G. P. Goold published a Loeb English translation, collated both from manuscript M and from photographs of various manuscripts which had once belonged to Housman; this release marked the first time that the poem had been translated into English prose (the first book of the \"Astronomica\" had previously been translated into English by Edward Sherburne in 1674, and Thomas Creech had translated the entire poem into English verse in 1697). Goold's translation (complete with substantial introductory notes and diagrams) was called \"masterly\" by Volk and Steven Green, both of whom argued that it \"marked a significant development in the accessibility of Manilius to a larger audience\". Goold later issued a second edition of his translation in 1992, as well as a corrected edition in 1997 that included information from W. S. Watt's article \"Maniliana\".\n\nWhile Manilius is not quoted by any extant Roman author, many scholars argue that he is alluded to by a number of authors, including: Ausonius, Claudian, Commodian, Dracontius, Juvenal, Lucan, Manetho, Martianus Capella, Nemesianus, Orientius, Pseudo-Empedocles, Seneca, Sidonius Apollinaris, Tertullian, Titus Calpurnius Siculus, and Venantius Fortunatus. With this said, Hübner cautions that such assumptions should be considered carefully (or downright rejected, in the cases of Manetho and Pseudo-Empedocles), as the similarities may be due to a lost ancient epic precursor that Manilius and the others were all alluding to or borrowing from. The work of Julius Firmicus Maternus (who wrote in the time of Constantine about astrology and other subjects) resembles Manilius's work in many ways; for instance, in his \"Matheseos libri octo\" (composed c.33437), Firmicus follows Manilius's method of instruction closely and analyzes the poet's astrological fundamentals. This suggests that Firmicus almost certainly used Manilius (or someone inspired by him) as a guide. But despite the similarity between Firmicus's work and Manilius's, Firmicus neither mentions Manilius by name nor lists him as among the few Romans (viz. Germanicus, Cicero, and Fronto) who wrote about astrology.\n\nVolk notes that the earliest references to \"Astronomica\"aside from literary allusionsmay be found in two Roman funerary inscriptions, both of which bear the line, \"We are born to die, and our end hangs from the beginning\" (\"nascentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet\") from the poem's fourth book. This theory is not without its detractors, and scholars such as A. Maranini and Gómez Pallarès have suggested that these two inscriptions are forgeries dating from the Renaissance.\n\nFew copies of the \"Astronomica\" survived into the medieval period, and consequently Manilius seems to have been little read during this period. However, there are a few exceptions to this dearth of attention. Hübner, for instance, writes that Manilius may have inspired some of the writings of Columbanus. Additionally, an AD 988 letter from Gerbertus Aureliacensis to the abbey at Bobbio in which a request is made for a work \"by M.Manilius (or possibly Manlius) about astrology\" (\"M.Manilius\" (\"v.l. Manlius\") \"de astrologica\") is evidence that a copy of the \"Astronomica\" was probably kept in the library at Bobbio.\n\nAlthough it was largely ignored during antiquity and the Middle Ages, the poem generated scholarly interest upon its 15th-century rediscovery. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Bonincontri delivered lectures on the \"Astronomica\" to large audiences and compiled his lecture notes into the work's first commentary. Bonincontri was apparently interested in Manilius's treatment of the nature of comets in the first book of the \"Astronomica\", and, according to Stephan Heilen, portions of Bonincontri's \"De rebus naturalibus et divinis\" are based on Manilius's work.\n\nDespite the attention it received after its rediscovery, the \"Astronomica\" has never been as widely studied as other classical Latin poems. With that said, interest in the poem developed in the second half of the 20th century when scholars began to study Manilius's philosophical and scientific ideas. The first full-length English monograph on Manilius and the \"Astronomica\" was Volk's \"Manilius and His Intellectual Background\", which was published in 2009. Two years later, Volk and Green edited \"Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius' Astronomica\" with essays from scholars worldwide. The book's purpose was to \"encourage readers to discover Manilius\" and expand scholarly interest in the \"Astronomica\", since previous research of the work's poetic, scientific, and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to Germany, France, and Italy. And while Manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars, many lay readers find the \"Astronomica\" confusing and overly technical. According to Kristine Louise Haugen, \"The ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by Manilius's hexameter verse must often have made the \"Astronomica\" seem, as it does today, rather like a trigonometry textbook rendered as a Saturday \"New York Times\" crossword.\"\n\nScholars have noted the irony of Manilius's relative obscurity, because he wrote the \"Astronomica\" in the hope of attaining literary immortality. Housman voiced this sentiment in a dedicatory Latin poem written for the first volume of his edition that contrasted the movement of celestial objects with mortality and the fate of Manilius's work. He compared the \"Astronomica\" to a shipwreck (\"carmina\" ... \"naufraga\"), arguing that it was incomplete and imperfect, having barely survived textual transmission; Housman mused that because Manilius's ambitions of literary fame and immortality had been almost entirely dashed, his work should serve as an example of why \"no man ever ought to trust the gods\" (\"ne quis forte deis fidere vellet homo\").\n\n\n\n"}

The emirate was initially based in Kafartab before the Banu Munqidh took over the fortress of Shayzar in 1081 and made it their headquarters for the remainder of their rule. The capture of Shayzar was the culmination of a long, drawn out process beginning with the Banu Munqidh's nominal assignment to the land by the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo in 1025, and accelerating with the weakened grip of Byzantine rule in northern Syria in the 1070s. \n\nUnder the reign of Emir Ali ibn Muqallad (r. 1059–1082), the Banu Munqidh reached their territorial peak with the emirate extending from the Mediterranean port of Latakia to Apamea. The Seljuk conquest of Syria in 1085 and subsequent struggles with local Muslim lords reduced the Munqidh emirate to Shayzar and its environs. Under Emir Sultan ibn Ali (r. 1098–1154), the Banu Munqidh alternated between combating the Crusaders who landed in Syria in 1099 and paying tribute to them. During this period, the family also had to contend with Ismai'li newcomers encroaching on their domains. To firmly protect the emirate, Sultan ultimately put the Banu Munqidh under Zengid suzerainty. After the death of Emir Muhammad ibn Sultan (r. 1154–1157) and his family, the emirate passed to the Zengid emir Nur ad-Din, who granted it to the Banu al-Daya family.\n\nThrough a combination of wealth, diplomatic acumen and military skills, the Banu Munqidh survived as a local power and successfully resisted attempts by the Crusaders and stronger Syrian Muslim dynasties to seize their strategic fortress in Shayzar. Among their enemies and allies, the Banu Munqidh gained a reputation for \"martial valor, honor, piety and courtly refinement\" in the words of historian Adnan Husain. Their rural lands, which were largely populated by Greek Orthodox Christians, were distinguished for their well-kept and prosperous state. From early on, the family was also known to provide refuge for a wide array of people, ranging from Muslim refugees fleeing Crusader assaults or exiled Muslim generals, officials and other dignitaries. The most well-known member of the family, Usama ibn Munqidh (1095–1188), went on to have to have a proficient career in literature and diplomacy serving on the courts of the Zengids, Fatimids, Ayyubids.\n\nThe Banu Munqidh were an Arab family belonging to the Kinana branch of the Banu Kalb tribe. Though the Banu Kalb were largely concentrated around Damascus in the late 10th century, the Kinana inhabited the eastern environs of the Orontes River in northern Syria. A member of the family, Ali ibn Munqidh ibn Nasr al-Kinani, is first mentioned in 960 when he was taken captive by the Byzantines during a major Hamdanid defeat; also taken prisoner was the poet and governor Abu Firas al-Hamdani. \n\nIt was not until the 11th century that the Banu Munqidh emerged in regional politics. At that time, the family entered the service of Salih ibn Mirdas, founder of the Aleppo-based Mirdasid dynasty. According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the Banu Munqidh were numerous and strong enough at the time to \"play an influential role in the life of the Mirdasid dynasty\". Upon capturing Aleppo in 1025, Salih granted the Munqhidi chieftain, Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh, the lands around Shayzar as an \"iqṭāʿ\" (fief); the town of Shayzar itself was in Byzantine hands, however. With their assignment to Shayzar being in name only, the Banu Munqidh instead used Kafartab as their headquarters.\n\nMuqallad died in 1059, after which his son Ali inherited his \"iqtaʿ\". Under Ali, the Banu Munqidh played a dominant role in the affairs of their nominal Mirdasid suzerains. Tensions with the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, Mahmud ibn Nasr, led Ali to depart Aleppo for Tripoli where he was able to gain further recognition of the Banu Munqidh's budding principality in the middle Orontes valley. During the chaotic succession process following Mahmud's death, Ali was instrumental in installing Mahmud's son Sabiq as Aleppo's emir. However, Sabiq's succession was opposed by the other members of the Mirdasid house and the Banu Kilab tribe to whom they belonged who favored Sabiq's brother Waththab. After a number of major battles between the opposing sides and amid severe famine in Aleppo, Muslim ibn Quraysh, the Uqaylid emir of Mosul saw an opportunity to take the city. In the aftermath of his entry into Aleppo in 1080 and the refusal of the Mirdasids to surrender the citadel, Ali intervened to mediate between the two sides. Ultimately, Ali facilitated the city's surrender to Muslim in return for the allotment of \"iqṭāʿat\" to the Mirdasids in Aleppo's hinterland.\n\nMeanwhile, the Banu Munqidh led renewed efforts to capture the Shayzar fortress in what historian Hugh N. Kennedy described as a “long, drawn out process”. The catalyst of these efforts was the weakening grip of the Byzantines in northern Syria following their defeat by the Seljuk Sultanate at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. In 1076, Ali began construction of the Hisn al-Jisr fortress, which would limit Shayzar’s access to the Orontes River. Hisn al-Jisr was used to hamper the flow of supplies into Shayzar from the Byzantine mainland. At the time, it was also utilized by Ali for diplomatic efforts amid the struggle for Syria between the ascendant Seljuks and their opponents. In 1078/79, he sheltered the families of the Seljuks’ Turkish opponents from Aleppo and he hosted the Seljuk general Afshin, persuading him to spare both Kafartab and Byzantine Shayzar from his pillaging. These were early demonstrations of how “diplomatic skills, more than military power, enabled the Banu Munqidh to maintain their precarious independence”, according to Kennedy.\n\nThe Banu Munqidh’s pressure on Shayzar compelled its Byzantine rulers to surrender the fortress to Ali in December 1081 in exchange for a certain sum and guarantees of upkeep of the town bishop’s home. Shayzar became the center of the Munqidh emirate (principality). The family under Ali soon after faced a siege by the Uqaylids but leveraged their significant wealth to settle with Muslim ibn Quraysh. By the time of Ali's death in 1082, the Banu Munqidh's emirate extended to the Mediterranean port town of Latakia and included Apamea and a few smaller places, in addition to Shayzar and Kafartab.\n\nSadid al-Mulk succeeded was succeeded by his son Nasr. The principal challenge the Banu Munqidh faced during Nasr's reign was the expansion of Seljuk rule into Syria. Like their previous encounter with the Uqaylids, the family employed the same strategy to stave off an attack by the Seljuk ruler Sulayman ibn Qutulmush in 1085. Moreover, Nasr's conviction that the Seljuks could not be defeated led him to cede his family's territories in Latakia, Apamea and Kafartab to the sultanate in exchange for their firm recognition of the Banu Munqidh's possession of Shayzar in 1086/87. Through his good offices with the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, he was able to return the ceded towns to the Banu Munqidh in 1091. However, in 1096 Apamea and Kafartab were lost to the family's Arab rival, Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, the formerly semi-independent lord of Homs. Ibn Mula'ib was a former subordinate of Nasr who he gradually had to contend with as a frequently hostile neighbor of the Banu Munqidh. In one encounter, Nasr was badly defeated in an ambush by Ibn Mula'ib during an attack outside Shayzar.\n\nIn 1098, Nasr ibn Ali died and the lordship of Shayzar passed to his sons. For unknown reasons, Nasr's brother and chosen successor, Murshid, withdrew himself from the line of succession in favor of his younger brother Sultan, who had served as the Banu Munqidh's governor in Latakia. Murshid maintained a prominent leadership role as his then-childless brother's deputy. At the turn of the 11th century, the Banu Munqidh’s possessions were under threat not only by their Turkish suzerains, but also the encroachments of the Banu Kilab, the growing presence of the Nizari Ismailis in the coastal mountains of northern Syria and the newly arrived Crusaders. \n\nDuring Sultan’s reign, the Banu Munqidh had become more numerous and Sultan chiefly depended on his own kinsmen in confrontations with the constellation of powers, local and regional, that controlled northern Syria. He could also rely on his Kinana tribesmen to an extent and the militiamen of Shayzar. To a much lesser extent the family recruited Kurdish mercenaries and Turkish \"mamluks\" (slave soldiers). Meanwhile, a tentative alliance was formed with Ibn Mula'ib despite the wounding of Sultan and Murshid in a battle with him in 1104. Together, the Banu Munqidh and Ibn Mula'ib attacked a small Crusader-held fort in their region in 1106, but Ibn Mula'ib betrayed the Banu Munqidh by deserting and stealing their horses. Before the family could retaliate, Ibn Mula'ib was killed by an Ismai'il assassin. At this time, friendly relations were also established with the family's other erstwhile rivals, the Turkish Ibn Qaraja emirs of Hama and Homs.\n\nThe principal Crusader threat to the Banu Munqidh was posed by the neighboring Principality of Antioch. The prince of Antioch, Tancred, attacked and plundered the Banu Munqidh's emirate in 1110 and imposed a heavy tribute on Shayzar, a testament to its wealth at the time. The following year, Tancred built the Tell Ibn Ma'shar fortress along the west bank of the Orontes, across from Shayzar, to prepare an assault against the city. Sultan reached out to Mawdud of Mosul to prevent this, while Tancred gathered a larger Crusader coalition including the rulers of Jerusalem and Tripoli. In the ensuing Battle of Shayzar, which was according to Kennedy was more of \"a prolonged confrontation\" than a battle, the Crusader armies retreated in October 1111. However, the Banu Munqidh continued paying the annual tribute to Antioch.\n\nShayzar also became a target of the Isma'ili sect subsequent to their exodus from Syria's major cities to the coastal mountains. They attempted to seize Shayzar in 1114 while the Banu Munqidh family were away participating in the Easter celebrations of their Orthodox Christian subjects. The attack was coordinated with the town's Isma'ili residents, who had been generally well-treated by the Banu Munqidh. About one hundred Isma'ilis seized the citadel, expelling its residents. A bloody struggle ensued upon the Banu Munqidh's return to Shayzar, and involved the participation of the family's women. It ended with the slaying of all the Ismai'ili attackers and the enactment of certain measures to prevent a recurrence. The following year, a Muslim–Crusader coalition composed of Roger of Antioch, Toghtekin of Damascus and Ilghazi of Mardin besieged Shayzar in response to the plans of the Banu Munqidh's ally Mawdud of Mosul to conquer Syria.\n\nIn 1127 Sultan put the Banu Munqidh under the suzerainty of the ascendant Muslim ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, Imad ad-Din Zengi, which allowed for a greater level of security for the family's domains. This was interrupted by a short siege of Shayzar by the Burid ruler of Damascus, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il, in 1133 and a greater crisis by the Byzantine–Crusader siege of Shayzar in 1138 led by \nJohn II Komnenos. The Byzantine-led army initially attacked the Banu Munqidh-held forts of Kafartab and Hisn al-Jisr, causing their inhabitants to flee, before proceeding in their assault against Shayzar. Arabic and Greek sources both indicate that the Banu Munqidh and the people of Shayzar resisted the siege and the Byzantines' catapults for several days before John II's army withdrew. However, the Arabic sources claim the Byzantines left after hearing of the arrival of Zengid reinforcements while the Greek sources claim the withdrawal was precipitated by a Zengid attack on on Byzantine-held Edessa and Sultan's offer to pay off John II.\n\nThe domain of the Banu Munqidh entered a long period of stability and prosperity beginning in 1138. Shayzar and it’s dependencies remained under the control of Sultan who ruled under the authority of the Zengid dynasty. However, in 1140/41 the Ismai'ils captured the fortress of Masyaf from the Banu Munqidh, who had purchased it in 1127/28. It thereafter became the Isma'ilis' main stronghold in Syria. This generally peaceful period also coincided with tensions between Sultan and his nephews. Murshid's position as the Banu Munqidh's second highest-ranking leader enabled the latter's sons, including Usama, to rise politically within the emirate. They gained a reputation for their martial and diplomatic skills and Sultan viewed their prominence as a threat to his leadership. These tensions culminated after Murshid's death in 1136/37 and the birth of Sultan's son Taj al-Mulk Muhammad in the following year. As a consequence, Usama and his brothers were exiled from Shayzar, finding asylum with Nur ad-Din, the Zengid emir of Aleppo. After Sultan's death in 1154, Taj al-Mulk Muhammad succeeded him without incident. \n\nMost of the Banu Munqidh, including Taj al-Mulk and his children, died in the collapse of the Shayzar citadel during the August 1157 earthquake, which devastated a number of other towns in the area. This brought an end to their rule of the Shayzar principality, which was soon after seized by Nur ad-Din to prevent its capture by the Crusaders. Nur ad-Din did not seek to find any surviving members of the Banu Munqidh to resume their lordship of Shayzar, whose fortifications he had promptly restored. Instead, he handed the town over to a certain Sabiq al-Din Uthman ibn al-Daya. The latter's family, the Banu al-Daya, remained the lords of Shayzar through Ayyubid rule until 1233.\n\nThe Banu Munqidh initially reacted to the Crusader invasion of coastal Syria by offering the Crusader king of Jerusalem, Baldwin I, a tributary arrangement, provisioning of food supplies and protection for Christian pilgrims passing through the family's territory. Though the Kingdom of Jerusalem did not border the Banu Munqidh's domains, the neighboring Frankish principality of Antioch was under Jerusalem's overall authority. This accord with the newly arrived Crusaders in Ma'arrat al-Nu'man spared Shayzar the latter's devastating raids. Intermittent warfare in the form of raids and clashes partly characterized the contact between the Banu Munqidh and the Crusader states, but they largely maintained practical ties. In 1108, a large annual tribute was imposed by the Crusaders on the Banu Munqidh. \n\nIn addition to the financial sums, they also had to provide guides for the emissaries of the neighboring Principality of Antioch on their way to Jerusalem. The family was particularly close to King Baldwin II of Jerusalem (r. 1118-1131) and hosted him in Shayzar in 1124 at the request of his Muslim captor and ruler of Aleppo, Timurtash ibn Ilghazi, during negotiations for Baldwin's release. The Munqidhi emirs Sultan and Murshid successfully mediated the ransom for Baldwin's freedom. Subsequent to his release, Baldwin relieved the Banu Munqidh of their tribute and services in appreciation of their generosity. The bonds forged between the Banu Munqidh and King Baldwin II enabled Usama ibn Munqidh to play a mediating role in the diplomatic negotiations of the early 1130s between Baldwin and Taj al-Muluk Buri, the Burid ruler of Damascus in whose court Usama served. \n\nDespite generally peaceful relations with the Franks, the Banu Munqidh remained loyal to their Muslim suzerains, fighting alongside the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damasucs in their battles and campaigns against the Crusaders in 1111, 1115 and 1119. The family also fended off Crusader attacks against their domains between 1122 and 1124. The family maintained friendly ties with a number of the semi-independent Muslim lords of other fortress towns who shared their social standing, the Fatimid lord Iftikhar al-Dawla of Abu Qubays and the Banu Salim ibn Malik of Qal'at Ja'bar; the former's sister was married to Sultan and the emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar shared similar Arab tribal origins as the Banu Munqidh. The Banu Munqidh's emirs paid social visits to Iftikhar al-Dawla, while keeping frequent contact with Shihab al-Din Salim ibn Malik via letters, couriers and the exchange of gifts. The emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar played a similar diplomatic role as the Banu Munqidh and both families were described in the Syrian \"Chronicon, A.C. 1234\" as \"a good sort of people, friendly to all and good mediators at any time\". \n\nThe Banu Munqidh often provided asylum for refugees and exiles. In 1041, they gave temporary refuge in Kafartab to the Fatimid governor of Syria, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, when he was ousted from Damascus and then escorted him safely to the Citadel of Aleppo. Later, in the Crusader era, the Banu Munqidh gave refuge to Muslim families fleeing the Crusader assault on Ma'arrat al-Nu'man in 1098; the son of their erstwhile rival Khalaf ibn Mula'ib of Apamea in 1106; the ousted Muslim ruler of Tripoli, Qadi Fakhr al-Mulk ibn Ammar, in 1109; and the Isma'ili \"da'i\" (missionary) of Aleppo, Ibrahim, when he fled Seljuk persecution in 1113.\n\nBased on the accounts of Usama ibn Munqidh, the family were avid hunters and went on expeditions in the wetlands of Orontes valley west of Shayzar and in the hills south of the city. The expeditions were led by the family's emirs who led retinues containing tens of horsemen, including relatives and \"mamluks\". Equipped with various birds of prey, dogs and cheetahs, they hunted francolin, waterfowl, hares, wild boars and partridges. However, the ultimate prey of the Munqidhi emirs were lions and leopards, the slaying of which were an apparent symbol and function of the emir's authority. According to Kennedy, \"killing lions and leopards\" was \"one of the ways\" an emir \"demonstrated his protection of and care for the people who lived on his lands\".\n\nFrom the citadel of Shayzar, which was perched on a rocky hilly enveloped by the Orontes River, the Banu Munqidh ruled a relatively a small emirate largely inhabited by Greek Orthodox Christians. Throughout their rule, the emirate was surrounded by frequently hostile powers, whether local or regional Muslim lords, Crusader principalities or Bedouin tribes. In addition to their military abilities, the family often pursued diplomacy and alliances with their larger neighbors. together, their martial skills and diplomatic maneuvers enabled their survival. The Banu Munqidh were described as an \"elite, patrician family of well-known warriors who enjoyed a wide reputation of for martial valor, honor, piety, and courtly refinement\" by historian Adnan Husain. According to an account of a conversation between an emissary of Roger of Antioch and Sultan in 1116, the lands of the Banu Munqidh were distinguished by their development and prosperity from the ruinous state of the surrounding region. This was an apparent testament to the Banu Munqidh’s wealth.\n\n"}

His \"Treatise on Physiology\", reproducing and elaborating on work by William Cheselden, helped revolutionize Chinese and later Japanese medical understanding and treatment.\n\nHobson was born in 1816 in Welford, Northamptonshire, in England. He graduated from London University with a MB and passed an examination as a MRCS.\n\nJoining the London Missionary Society as a medical missionary to the Qing Empire, he departed with his wife Jane Abbey Hobson and Messrs Legge and Milne on . It left London on 28 July 1839, and reached Anyer on 12 November 12 and Macao on 18 December. Assisted by Elijah Bridgman, Hobson found a residence and joined the local Medical Missionary Society. Its hospital reopened on August 1, 1840. When William Lockhart left for Zhoushan at the end of the month and Dr Diver retired from poor health soon afterwards, Hobson was left in sole charge of its operation. In early 1843, he left to establish an MMS hospital in Hong Kong. This opened to patients on June 1 and the demand for its services so outstripped both expectations and capacity that he relied heavily on help from Chinese assistants. This led him to consider how to explain western medical training to the Chinese, then reliant on often pseudoscientific traditional medicine.\n\nIn 1845, his wife's health was so poor that they left for Britain in July but she died while at anchor off Dungeness on December 22. Left with a young son and daughter, he married Rebecca Morrison, the daughter of his fellow Chinese missionary Robert, while in England. He returned with her and Mr Hirschberg on the \"Hugh Walker\". This left Britain on March 11, 1847, and reached Hong Kong on July 27, whereupon he resumed direction of its hospital.\n\nHe visited Guangzhou (then known as \"Canton\") with Mr Gillespie in October 1847 and moved there the next February, operating a clinic out of his residence. In April, he opened a pharmacy and, in June, purchased the house on Kum-Le-Fo (, \"Jīnlì Bù\",  \"Golden Benefit Wharf\") in the western suburbs for use as the Missionary Hospital or Clinic \"Huìài Yīguǎn\"). While there, he was assisted by the Chinese ministers and missionaries Liang Fa and Zhou Xue. At the end of 1854, he traveled to Shanghai for a five-week rest for health reasons. He and his family were forced to evacuate to Hong Kong in October 1856 on account of the onset of the Second Opium War.\n\nThe missionary community of Shanghai prevailed upon him to return in February 1857 and he took Dr Lockhart's place at their hospital when Lockhart returned to England at the end of that year. His eldest son took work with a merchant house, but the rest of the family returned with him to Europe, reaching England in March 1859. His health not permitting his return to China, he then resided at Clifton and Cheltenham. He died at Forest Hill near London in 1873.\n\nBenjamin Hobson published the following works:\n\nFive of the medical works were published with assistance from Kuan Mao-tsai. The illustrations of his \"Treatise on Physiology\" were derived from William Cheselden's 1730 \"Anatomical Tables\" and 1733 \"Osteographia\". Hobson's work has been called \"instrumental\" in introducing Western anatomical knowledge to China and Japan, beginning their shift away from traditional understandings based on the flow of \"qi\" and other pseudoscience.\n\n\n"}

This practice stems from Peter's vision of a sheet with animals, in which Saint Peter \"sees a sheet containing animals of every description lowered from the sky.\" Nonetheless, the New Testament does give a few guidelines about the consumption of meat, practiced by the Christian Church today; one of these is not consuming food knowingly offered to pagan idols, a conviction that the early Church Fathers, such as Clement of Alexandria and Origen preached. In addition, Christians traditionally bless any food before eating it with a mealtime prayer (grace), as a sign of thanking God for the meal they have.\n\nSlaughtering animals for food is often done without the trinitarian formula, although the Armenian Apostolic Church, among other Orthodox Christians, have rituals that \"display obvious links with \"shechitah\", Jewish kosher slaughter.\" The Bible, states Norman Geisler, stipulates one to \"abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from meat of strangled animals\".\n\nIn the New Testament, Paul of Tarsus notes that some devout Christians may wish to abstain from consuming meat if it causes \"my brother to stumble\" in his faith with God (cf. ). As such, some Christian monks, such as the Trappists, have adopted a policy of Christian vegetarianism. In addition, Christians of the Seventh-day Adventist tradition generally \"avoid eating meat and highly spiced food\". Christians in the Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, and Orthodox denominations traditionally observe a meat-free day, especially during the liturgical season of Lent.\n\nWith reference to medieval times, Jillian Williams states that \"unlike the Jewish and Muslims methods of animal slaughter, which requires the draining of the animal's blood, Christian slaughter practices did not usually specify the method of slaughter\". In actual practice, states Williams, European Christians have flexibly practiced both the method of draining the blood, and wringing the animal's neck to retain its blood as valuable food. According to Basheer Ahmad Masri, the \"Jewish and the Christian methods of slaughter fulfill the Islamic condition of bleeding the animal\". In contrast, David Grumett and Rachel Muers state that the Orthodox Christian \"Shechitah\" and Jewish \"Kosher\" methods of slaughter differ from the Muslim \"Halal\" (Dabh) method in that they require the cut to \"sever trachea, oesophagus and the jugular veins\" as this method is believed to produce meat with minimal suffering to the animal.\n\nSome Christian denominations condone the moderate drinking of alcohol (moderationism), such as Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, and the Orthodox, although others, such as Seventh-day Adventists, Baptists, Methodists, and Pentecostals either abstain from or prohibit the consumption of alcohol (abstentionism and prohibitionism). However, all Christian Churches, in view of the Biblical position on the issue, universally condemn drunkenness as sinful.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3476845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3476845", "title": "Consecrated life", "text": "Consecrated life\n\nConsecrated life, in the canon law of the Catholic Church, is a stable form of Christian living by those faithful who are called to follow Jesus Christ in a more exacting way recognized by the Church. It \"is characterized by the public profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in a stable state of life recognized by the Church\". The Code of Canon Law defines it as \"a stable form of living by which the faithful, following Christ more closely under the action of the Holy Spirit, are totally dedicated to God who is loved most of all, so that, having been dedicated by a new and special title to his honour, to the building up of the Church, and to the salvation of the world, they strive for the perfection of charity in the service of the kingdom of God and, having been made an outstanding sign in the Church, foretell the heavenly glory.\"\n\nWhat makes the consecrated life a more exacting way of Christian living is the public religious vows or other sacred bonds whereby the consecrated persons commit themselves, for the love of God, to observe as binding the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience from the Gospel, or at least, in the case of consecrated virgins and widows/widowers, a vow of total chastity. The Benedictine vow as laid down in the Rule of Saint Benedict, ch. 58:17, is analogous to the more usual vow of religious institutes. Consecrated persons are not part of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, unless they are also ordained bishops, priests or deacons.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church comments: \"From the very beginning of the Church there were men and women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate him more closely, by practising the evangelical counsels. They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded religious families. Thus the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted and approved them.\"\n\nConsecrated life may be lived either in institutes or individually. While those living it are either clergy (if ordained) or lay people, the state of consecrated life is neither clerical nor lay by nature.\n\nInstitutes of consecrated life are either religious institutes or secular institutes.\n\nBesides institutes of consecrated life, the Catholic Church recognizes:\n\nSocieties of apostolic life are dedicated to pursuit of an apostolic purpose, such as educational or missionary work. They \"resemble institutes of consecrated life\" but are distinct from them. The members do not take religious vows, but live in common, striving for perfection through observing the \"constitutions\" of the society to which they belong. Some societies of apostolic life, but not all of them, define in their constitutions \"bonds\" of a certain permanence whereby their members embrace the evangelical counsels. The Code of Canon Law gives for societies of apostolic life regulations much less detailed than for institutes of consecrated life, in many instances simply referring to the constitutions of the individual societies. Although societies of apostolic life may in externals resemble religious life, a major distinction is that they are not themselves consecrated and their state of life does not change (i.e. they remain secular clerics or laypersons).\n\nExamples of societies of apostolic life are the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, and the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice, and societies such as the Missionary Society of St. Columban.\n\nEach major development in religious life, particularly in the Latin West, can be seen as a response of the very devout to a particular crisis in the Church of their day.\n\nWhen Constantine the Great was legalizing Christianity in the Roman Empire in the early 4th century, and the Christian faith became the favoured religion, it lost the self-sacrificing character that had profoundly marked it in the age of Roman persecution. In response to the loss of martyrdom for the sake of the Kingdom of God, some of the very devout men and women left the cities for the testings of the life in the desert that was meant to lead the individual back into a more intimate relationship with God, just like the wandering of the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sin. The Greek word for desert, \"eremos\", gave this form of religious living the name \"eremitic (or eremitical) life\", and the person leading it the name hermit. Anthony the Great and other early leaders provided guidance to less experienced hermits, and there were soon a large number of Christian hermits, particularly in the desert of Egypt and in parts of Syria.\n\nThough the eremitic life would eventually be overshadowed by the far more numerous vocations to the cenobitic life, it did survive. The Middle Ages saw the emergence of a variant of the hermit, the anchorite; and life in Carthusian and Camaldolese monasteries has an eremitic emphasis. The Greek Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox Churches have their own eremitic traditions, of which Mount Athos is perhaps the most widely heard of today.\n\nIn modern times, in the Roman Catholic Church the Code of Canon Law 1983 recognises hermits who - without being members of a religious institute - publicly profess the three evangelical counsels, confirmed by vow or other sacred bond in the hands of their respective diocesan bishop, as Christian faithful that live the consecrated life (cf. canon 603, see also below).\n\nThe eremitic life was apparently healthy for some, but led to imbalance in others. Pachomius the Great, a near-contemporary of Anthony the Great, recognized that some monks needed the guidance and rhythm of a community (\"cenobium\"). He is generally credited with founding, in Egypt, the first community of monks, thus launching Cenobitic monasticism.\n\nBasil of Caesarea in the East in the 4th century, and Benedict of Nursia in the West in the 6th century, authored the most influential \"rules\" for religious living in their areas of the Christian world (\"rule\" in this sense refers to a collection of precepts, compiled as guidelines for how to follow the spiritual life). They organized a common life with a daily schedule of prayer, work, spiritual reading and rest.\n\nAlmost all monasteries in the Eastern Catholic Churches and in the Eastern Orthodox Church today follow the Rule of St Basil. The Rule of St Benedict is followed by a variety of orders of monastics in the West, including the Order of Saint Benedict, Cistercians, Trappists, and Camaldolese, and is an important influence in Carthusian life.\n\nCanons regular are members of certain bodies of priests living in community under the Augustinian Rule (\"regula\" in Latin), and sharing their property in common. Distinct from monks, who live a cloistered, contemplative life and sometimes engage in ministry to those from outside the monastery, canons devote themselves to public ministry of liturgy and sacraments for those who visit their churches.\n\nHistorically, monastic life was by its nature lay, but canonical life was essentially clerical.\n\nAround the 13th century during the rise of the medieval towns and cities the mendicant orders developed. While the monastic foundations were rural institutions marked by a retreat from secular society, the mendicants were urban foundations organized to engage secular city life and to meet some of its needs such as education and service to the poor. The five primary mendicant religious Order of the 13th century are the Order of Friars Preachers (the Dominicans), Order of Friars Minor (the Franciscans), Order of the Servants of Mary (Servite Order), Order of St. Augustine or the (Augustinians) and the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (the Carmelites). Unlike the monks and nuns of the earlier orders, the members of the latter orders called their houses convents, rather than monasteries (in English, Dominican convents for men may also be called priories, and Fransciscan and Carmelite convents friaries).\n\nUntil the 16th century recognition was granted only to institutes with solemn vows. Institutes with simple vows arose in the 16th century and increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval. They provided specific services or ministries for the Church and society, building schools, hospitals and new missionary enterprises around the world. The period of their greatest growth was in the wake of the French Revolution in early 19th century France and Belgium. Only in 1900 did they obtain full recognition as religious.\n\nThe Society of Jesus is an example of an institute that obtained recognition as an \"order\" with solemn vows, although the members were divided into the professed with solemn vows (a minority) and the \"coadjutors\" with simple vows. It was founded in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, introducing several innovations designed to meet the demands of the 16th century crisis. Its members were freed from the commitments of common life, especially the common prayer, which allowed them to minister individually in distant places. Their unusually long formation, typically thirteen years, prepared them to represent the intellectual tradition of the Church even in isolation.\n\nBy the constitution \"Inter cetera\" of 20 January 1521, Pope Leo X appointed a rule for tertiaries with simple vows. Under this rule, enclosure was optional, enabling non-enclosed followers of the rule to engage in various works of charity not allowed to enclosed religious. In 1566 and 1568, Pope Pius V rejected this class of institute, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval, finally gaining on 8 December 1900 recognition as religious. Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to social service and to evangelization, both in Europe and in mission areas. The number of these \"congregations\" (not \"orders\") increased further in the upheavals brought by the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of monks and nuns of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living their religious life\n\nSecular institutes have their modern beginnings in 18th century France. During the French Revolution, the government attempted to dechristianise France. The French government had required all priests and bishops to swear an oath of fidelity to the new order or face dismissal from the Church, and had forbidden any form of religious life. Fr Pierre-Joseph Picot de Clorivière, a Jesuit, founded a new society of diocesan priests, the Institute of the Heart of Jesus. He also founded the Daughters of the Heart of Mary (). While living a life of perfection, they did not take vows, remaining a secular institute to avoid being considered a religious society by the government. They would eventually receive pontifical institute status in 1952. The Daughters of the Heart of Mary, though resembling a secular institute in some ways, were recognized as an institute of religious life. On 2 February 1947 Pope Pius XII issued the apostolic constitution \"Provida Mater Ecclesia\" recognizing secular institutes as \"a new category of the state of perfection\" . The 1983 Code of Canon Law recognizes secular institutes as a form of consecrated life. They differ from religious institutes in that their members live their lives in the ordinary conditions of the world, either alone, in their families or in fraternal groups. They include, among others, Caritas Christi, The Grail, and the Servite Secular Institute.\n\n\n"}

Of about 20,000 active Doukhobors in Canada today, ancestors of about 2,500 were Freedomites, of which very few today identify with or practice zealous protesting, and many joined Community Doukhobors.\n\nConfusion that Freedomites were Doukhobors arose because all moved to Canada together to escape religious persecution in Russia, and seek land and freedom. A few, unsatisfied with broken promises by the Canadian government, attempted to trek back to Russia, and called followers of their break away movement \"Svobodniki\" (translated as Freedomite in the press). Journalists rushed to the story when some protested nude, but mistakenly mixed the terms Freedomites with the law abiding Doukhobors, falsely implying that different groups were one group.\n\nFreedomite meetings were similar to other spiritual Christian folk-Protestants from Russia. They met in simple buildings, sat on benches, prayed in Russian, sang religious hymns and songs in Russian, and spoke about matters of religious and community interest mostly in Russian. The ideals of the Freedomites emphasized basic traditional Russian communal living and action—growing food, building homes, living a peaceful rural life, ecstatic religious doctrine when agitated for protest, and anarchic attitudes towards external regulation.\n\nAlthough Canada at first provided a more tolerant religious environment than the Russian Empire, conflict soon developed, most importantly over the schooling of children and land registration. These \"Svobodniki\" (Russian: free people) generally refused to send their children to government-run schools. The governments of Saskatchewan and later British Columbia did not heed reports by sociologists to appease the concerns of parents, and chose to legally charge many of the parents for not sending the children to school.\nThe \"Svobodniki\" became famous for various public protests—sometimes publicly burning their own money and possessions and parading nude in public. There was a doctrinal justification for nudity: that human skin, as God's creation, was more perfect than clothes, the imperfect work of human hands. The public nudity has generally been interpreted as a form of protest against the materialist tendencies of society.\n\nA small minority of the Freedomites were noted for their arson campaigns, as a protest against materialistic life. They targeted belongings and other material possessions. The attacks occurred throughout the 20th century, but the periods of greatest activity were during the 1920s and 1960s. Both arson and bombing were used. The first use of explosives occurred in 1923, and two were killed by their own bombs in 1958 and 1962. Targets included their own property and unfortunate Doukhobor neighbors to further exhibit their loathing of materialism, attacks on schools to resist government pressure to school \"Svobodnik\" children, and attacks on transportation and communications. One such incident was the bombing of a railway bridge in Nelson, British Columbia in 1961. Most of these acts were committed in the nude.\n\nAmong the reactions of the British Columbia and Canadian government was taking away Freedomite children and placing them in an internment center in New Denver. Abuse of these children was later alleged, and a formal apology demanded. The BC government made an official \"Statement of Regret\" that satisfied some, but not others. The Government of Canada has not apologized for its role in the removal, saying that it is not responsible for actions taken by the government in place 50 years ago.\n\nBetween 1953 and 1959, roughly 200 Doukhobor children, aged 7–15, were seized by the BC government, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the federal government in \"Operation Snatch\". These children were confined in New Denver, BC in a prison-like setting. The Sons of Freedom children lost their human rights throughout their imprisonment by the BC government.\n\nThe following is a timeline of the actions that were taken leading up to, during, and after the confinement of the children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the government made a decision to seize the Sons of Freedom children, it was in an attempt to respond to the widespread civil disorder happening in the Kootenays. The Federal Department of Justice faced two problems with the apprehension and conviction of the Doukhobors: where should the adult convicts be confined and what should be done with their children?\n\nIn the years leading up to the creation of the residential school's, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; they seemed to have a problem with any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.\n\n\"It was between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and Elsie Ericson's mother had just begun lighting the stove when four RCMP officers barged into their tiny wooden home in the village of Krestova, B.C. The child jumped out of bed and hid under it, only to be dragged out by their feet. Elsie and her brother spent the next four years in what she said felt like a jail. They were housed with nearly 200 other in a residential school in New Denver, B.C.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Among the factors that brought this about, one stood out in his own mind: at school religion was taught without life or understanding. Ghéon did not miss it. As F. J. Sheed says, \"His was a happy atheism.\" He replaced Catholicism with a semi-pagan cult of beauty in all its forms — nature, literature, music, painting.\n\nHe moved to Paris in 1893 to study medicine. Around the same time, he started to write poetry, along with his colleagues Francis Jammes and Stéphane Mallarmé. He also published avant garde criticism. In 1887 he met André Gide, who became his literary guide and friend for twenty years. Ghéon, writes Gide's biographer Alan Sheridan, \"was Gide's closest friend and companion on innumerable homosexual exploits.\" Ghėon actually drafted a militant text in favour of homosexuality, \"La Vie secrète de Guillaume Arnoult\", which was one of the inspirations for Gide's \"Corydon\". In 1909 they were founding members of the Nouvelle Revue Française (NRF). Ghéon also painted, studied music and travelled widely.\n\nIt was the sceptic Gide who occasioned the first cracks in Ghéon's paganism when he invited him to visit Florence with him in 1912. There Ghéon discovered the religious art of Giotto and Fra Angelico and was overwhelmed to the point of shedding tears. \"At St Mark's,\" he wrote, \"with Christ dying on the cross and the Virgin waiting for the angel in a bare and silent corridor..., even our senses had a soul. Art had transported me before, but never so high.\"\n\nHe served as an army doctor in the First World War. During this period he regained his Catholic faith, as described in his work \"L'homme né de la guerre\" (\"The Man Born from the War\"). His conversion was bound up with a devoutly Catholic naval officer, Pierre Dominique Dupouey, whom he met only three times in the space of a few weeks, but who impressed him greatly. It was again Gide who was the occasion for this fateful encounter: when Ghéon left for the Belgian front, Gide urged him to try to find Dupouey, who had once been his disciple and with whom he still corresponded. On Holy Saturday, 1915, Dupouey was killed in action on the Yser. By Christmas, Ghéon had returned to the Catholic faith.\n\nHe founded the \"Compagnons de Notre Dame\" (Companions of Our Lady), a sort of amateur theatre confraternity of young people, for which he wrote over 60 plays, usually on episodes from the Gospel or the lives of the saints. Ghéon's plays had clear similarities with the medieval mystery and miracle plays. The Companions of Our Lady performed with success in Paris and throughout France, as well as in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, and Ghéon was awarded a prize for his work by the Académie française. He also wrote poems, saints' biographies, and novels, among them a three-part work, \"Les Jeux de l'enfer et du ciel\" (\"Games of Hell and Heaven\"), centred on the Curè d'Ars.\n\nGhéon died of cancer in a Paris clinic on June 13, 1944, a week after the Allied landing in Normandy and six days after the opening of his most recent play, \"Saint Gilles\".\n\nIn 2008 the writer and philosopher Fabrice Hadjadj, reviewing Catherine Boschian-Campaner's biography of Ghéon in \"Le Figaro\", wrote, \"Henri Ghėon is not a minor writer and his work speaks for itself. If his novels recall Dickens, his theatre loses nothing in comparison with Anouilh and Giraudoux. It was he alone who, in the first half of the 20th century, revived the popular burlesque and verticality of the medieval mystery plays, thus anticipating Dario Fo.\"\n\nHis \"Miroir de Peine\" was set to music by Hendrik Andriessen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26571478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26571478", "title": "History of the Jews in the Roman Empire", "text": "History of the Jews in the Roman Empire\n\nThe history of the Jews in the Roman Empire traces the interaction of Jews and Romans during the period of the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 476). Their cultures began to overlap in the centuries just before the Christian Era. Jews, as part of the Jewish diaspora, migrated to Rome and Roman Europe from the Land of Israel, Asia Minor, Babylon and Alexandria in response to economic hardship and incessant warfare over the land of Israel between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires. In Rome, Jewish communities enjoyed privileges and thrived economically, becoming a significant part of the Empire's population (perhaps as much as ten percent).\n\nThe Roman general Pompey in his eastern campaign established the Roman province of Syria in 64 BC and conquered Jerusalem in 63 BC. Julius Caesar conquered Alexandria 47 BC and defeated Pompey in 45 BC. Under Julius Caesar, Judaism was officially recognised as a legal religion, a policy followed by the first Roman emperor, Augustus. Herod the Great was designated ‘King of the Jews’ by the Roman Senate in 40 BC, the Roman province of Egypt was established in 30 BC, and Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea (biblical Edom) were converted to the Roman province of Iudaea in 6 AD. Jewish-Roman tensions resulted in several Jewish–Roman wars, 66-135 AD, which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and institution of the Jewish Tax in 70 and Hadrian's attempt to create a new Roman colony named Aelia Capitolina 130.\n\nAround this time, Christianity developed from Second Temple Judaism. In 313, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan giving official recognition to Christianity as a legal religion. Constantine the Great moved the Roman capital from Rome to Constantinople (‘New Rome’) 330, sometimes considered the start of the Byzantine Empire, and with the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire. The Christian emperors persecuted their Jewish subjects and restricted their rights.\n\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" article on Rome:\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia connects the two civil wars raging during the last decades of the first century BC: one in Judea between the two Hasmonean brothers Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II and one in the Roman republic between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and describes the evolution of the Jewish population in Rome:\n\nEven before Rome annexed Judea as a province, the Romans had interacted with Jews from their diasporas settled in Rome for a century and a half. Many cities of the Roman provinces in the eastern Mediterranean contained very large Jewish communities, dispersed from the time of the sixth century BCE.\n\nRome's involvement in the Eastern Mediterranean dated from 63 BC, following the end of the Third Mithridatic War, when Rome made Syria a province. After the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus, the proconsul Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) remained to secure the area, including a visit to the Jerusalem Temple. During the 1st century BC, the Herodian Kingdom was established as a Roman client kingdom and in 6 AD parts became a province of the Roman Empire, named Iudaea Province.\n\nJulius Caesar formulated a policy of allowing Jews to follow their traditional religious practices, a policy which was followed, and extended, by Augustus, first emperor of Rome, reigned 27 BC - 14 AD. This gave Judaism the status of a \"religio licita\" (permitted religion) throughout the Empire. \n\nJews retained their traditions and customs, including kosher dietary customs. During the late Hellenistic and Roman era, pork, a meat by Jewish law, became a common and frequent cuisine for Romans. Since Jews had the status of a \"religio licita\", allowing them to continue their practices, they refused to eat pork. Jordan Rosenblum has argued that by refusing pork, Jews symbolically separated themselves from Romans and created a cultural identity for themselves. \n\nThe financial crisis under Caligula (37–41) has been proposed as the \"first open break between Rome and the Jews\", even though problems were already evident during the Census of Quirinius in 6 and under Sejanus (before 31).\n\nIn 66 AD, the First Jewish–Roman War began. The revolt was put down by the future Roman emperors Vespasian and Titus. In the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the Romans destroyed much of the Temple in Jerusalem and, according to some accounts, plundered artifacts from the Temple, such as the Menorah. Jews continued to live in their land in significant numbers, the Kitos War of 115-117 nothwithstanding, until Julius Severus ravaged Judea while putting down the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136. 985 villages were destroyed and most of the Jewish population of central Judaea was essentially wiped out – killed, sold into slavery, or forced to flee. Banished from Jerusalem, which was renamed Aelia Capitolina, the Jewish population now centered on Galilee, initially at Yavneh.\n\nAfter the Jewish-Roman wars (66–135), Hadrian changed the name of Iudaea province to \"Syria Palaestina\" and Jerusalem to \"Aelia Capitolina\" in an attempt to erase the historical ties of the Jewish people to the region. In addition, after 70, Jews and Jewish Proselytes were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the Jewish tax, and after 135 were barred from Jerusalem except for the day of Tisha B'Av.\n\nMany of the Judaean Jews were sold into slavery while others became citizens of other parts of the Roman Empire. The book of Acts in the New Testament, as well as other Pauline texts, make frequent reference to the large populations of Hellenised Jews in the cities of the Roman world. These Hellenised Jews were only affected by the diaspora in its spiritual sense, absorbing the feeling of loss and homelessness which became a cornerstone of the Jewish faith, much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world. The policy towards proselytization and conversion to Judaism, which spread the Jewish religion throughout Hellenistic civilization, seems to have ended with the wars against the Romans and the following reconstruction of Jewish values for the post-Temple era.\n\nOf critical importance to the reshaping of Jewish tradition from the Temple-based religion to the traditions of the Diaspora, was the development of the interpretations of the Torah found in the Mishnah and Talmud.\n\nIn spite of the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jews remained in the land of Israel in significant numbers. The Jews who remained there went through numerous experiences and armed conflicts against consecutive occupiers of the Land. Some of the most famous and important Jewish texts were composed in Israeli cities at this time. The Jerusalem Talmud, the completion of the Mishnah and the system of niqqud are examples.\n\nIn this period the \"tannaim\" and \"amoraim\" were active rabbis who organized and debated the Jewish oral law. A major catalyst in Palestinian Judaism is haNasi, who was a wealthy rabbi and one of the last tannaim, oral interpreters of the Law. He was in good standing with Roman authority figures, which aided in his ascent to being the Patriarch of the Jewish community in Palestine. The decisions of the \"tannaim\" are contained in the Mishnah, Beraita, Tosefta, and various Midrash compilations. The Mishnah was completed shortly after 200 AD, probably by Judah haNasi. The commentaries of the \"amoraim\" upon the Mishnah are compiled in the Jerusalem Talmud, which was completed around 400 AD, probably in Tiberias.\n\nIn 351, the Jewish population in Sepphoris, under the leadership of Patricius, started a revolt against the rule of Constantius Gallus, brother-in-law of Emperor Constantius II. The revolt was eventually subdued by Gallus' general, Ursicinus.\nAccording to tradition, in 359 Hillel II created the Hebrew calendar, which is a lunisolar calendar based on math rather than observation. Until then, the entire Jewish community outside the land of Israel depended on the observational calendar sanctioned by the Sanhedrin; this was necessary for the proper observance of the Jewish holy days. However, danger threatened the participants in that sanction and the messengers who communicated their decisions to distant communities. As the religious persecutions continued, Hillel determined to provide an authorized calendar for all time to come that was not dependent on observation at Jerusalem.\n\nJulian, the only emperor to reject Christianity after the conversion of Constantine, allowed the Jews to return to \"holy Jerusalem which you have for many years longed to see rebuilt\" and to rebuild the Temple. However Julian was killed in battle on 26 June 363 in his failed campaign against the Sassanid Empire, and the Third Temple was not rebuilt at that time.\n\nDuring the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 many Jews sided against the Eastern Roman Empire in the Jewish revolt against Heraclius, which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria. In reaction to this further anti-Jewish measures were enacted throughout the Eastern Roman realm and as far away as Merovingian France. Soon thereafter, 634, the Muslim conquests began, during which many Jews initially rose up again against their Eastern Roman rulers.\n\nFollowing the 1st-century Great Revolt and the 2nd-century Bar Kokhba revolt, the destruction of Judea exerted a decisive influence upon the dispersion of the Jewish people throughout the world, as the center of worship shifted from the Temple to Rabbinic authority.\n\nSome Jews were sold as slaves or transported as captives after the fall of Judea, others joined the existing diaspora, while still others remained in Judea and began work on the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jews in the diaspora were generally accepted into the Roman Empire, but with the rise of Christianity, restrictions grew. Forced expulsions and persecution resulted in substantial shifts in the international centers of Jewish life to which far-flung communities often looked, although not always unified, due to the Jewish people's dispersion itself. Jewish communities were thereby largely expelled from Judea and sent to various Roman provinces in the Middle East, Europe and North Africa. The Roman Jewry came to develop a character associated with the urban middle class in the modern age.\n\n\n"}

At birth, he emitted a wondrous light that filled the entire kingdom. When he was young, he was kind, intelligent and wise. He devoted his entire childhood to helping the needy (the poor and suffering, the deserted and single, the hungry and disabled).

It is one of the few myths in which the Jade Emperor really shows his might.\n\nIn the beginning of time, the earth was a very difficult place to live, much harsher than it is now. People had to deal with a variety of monstrous beings, and they didn’t have many gods to protect them; in addition, many powerful demons were defying the immortals of heaven. The Jade Emperor was an ordinary immortal who roamed the earth helping as many people as he could. He was saddened because his powers could only ease the suffering of humans. He retreated to a mountain cave to cultivate his Tao. He passed 3,200 trials, each trial lasting about 3 million years.\n\nOn earth at this time, a powerful, evil entity had the ambition to conquer the immortals and gods in heaven and proclaim sovereignty over the entire universe. This evil entity also went into retreat and meditation to expand its power, though later than the Jade Emperor did. He passed through 3,000 trials, each trial lasting about 3 million years. After its final trial, it felt confident that no one could defeat it. It re-entered the world and recruited an army of demons with the purpose of attacking heaven.\n\nThe immortals, being aware of the threat, gathered themselves and prepared for war. The gods were unable to stop the powerful demon and it defeated them all.\n\nThe Jade Emperor finished his cultivation during this war. When he was changing the land to make it more liveable for men and repelling a variety of monsters, he saw an evil glow radiating from heaven and knew something was amiss. He ascended and saw that the evil entity was too powerful to be stopped by the gods. He challenged it, and they fought. Mountains shook and rivers and seas toppled. Due to his deeper and wiser cultivation, his benevolence instead of his might, the Jade Emperor won the battle. After the evil entity was defeated, its army was scattered by the gods and immortals.\n\nBecause of his noble and benevolent deeds, the gods, immortals and humans proclaimed the Jade Emperor the supreme sovereign of all.\n\nThe world started with \"wuji\" (, nothingness) according to the Chinese creation myth. The Jade Emperor was the head of the pantheon, but not responsible for creation.\n\nIn another creation myth, the Jade Emperor fashioned the first humans from clay and left them to harden in the sun. Rain deformed some of the figures, which gave rise to human sickness and physical abnormalities. (The most common alternative Chinese creation myth states that human beings were once fleas on the body of Pangu.)\n\nIn another myth, Nüwa fashions men out of the mud from the Yellow River by hand. Those she made became the richer people of the earth. After getting lazy, she dipped her scarf into the mud and swung it around. The drops that fell from the scarf became the poorer humans.\n\nIn the popular novel by Wu Cheng'en, the Jade Emperor is featured many times.\n\nIn another story, popular throughout Asia and with many differing versions, the Jade Emperor has a daughter named Zhinü ( or Chih'nü, literally: weaver girl). She is most often represented as responsible for weaving colorful clouds in the heaven. In some versions she is the Goddess Weaver, daughter of the Jade Emperor and the Celestial Queen Mother, who weaves the Silver River (known in the West as the Milky Way), which gives light to heaven and earth. In other versions, she is a seamstress who works for the Jade Emperor.\n\nEvery day Zhinü descended to earth with the aid of a magical robe to bathe. One day, a lowly cowherd named Niu Lang () spotted Zhinü as she bathed in a stream. Niu Lang fell instantly in love with her and stole her magic robe which she had left on the bank of the stream, leaving her unable to escape back to Heaven. When Zhinü emerged from the water, Niu Lang grabbed her and carried her back to his home.\n\nWhen the Jade Emperor heard of this matter, he was furious but unable to intercede, since in the meantime his daughter had fallen in love and married the cowherd. As time passed, Zhinü grew homesick and began to miss her father. One day, she came across a box containing her magic robe which her husband had hidden. She decided to visit her father back in Heaven, but once she returned, the Jade Emperor summoned a river to flow across the sky (the Milky Way), which Zhinü was unable to cross to return to her husband. The Emperor took pity on the young lovers, and so once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, he allows them to meet on a bridge over the river.\n\nThe story refers to constellations in the night sky. Zhinü is the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra east of the Milky Way, and Niu Lang is the star Altair in the constellation of Aquila west of the Milky Way. Under the first quarter moon (7th day) of the seventh lunar month (around August), the lighting condition in the sky causes the Milky Way to appear dimmer, hence the story that the two lovers are no longer separated on that one particular day each year.\n\nThe seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar is a holiday in China called Qixi Festival, which is a day for young lovers much like Valentine's Day in the West. In Japan, it is called Tanabata (star day). In Korea, it is called Chilseok. In Vietnam, it is called Thất Tịch and if it rains on that day, it is said to be Zhinü crying tears of happiness for being reunited with her husband.\n\nThere are several stories as to how the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac were chosen. In one, the Jade Emperor, although having ruled Heaven and Earth justly and wisely for many years, had never had the time to actually visit the Earth personally. He grew curious as to what the creatures looked like. Thus, he asked all the animals to visit him in heaven. The cat, being the most handsome of all animals, asked his friend the Rat to wake him on the day they were to go to Heaven so he wouldn't oversleep. The Rat, however, was worried that he would seem ugly compared to the cat, so he didn't wake the cat. Consequently, the cat missed the meeting with the Jade Emperor and was replaced by the Pig. The Jade Emperor was delighted with the animals and so decided to divide the years up amongst them. When the cat learned of what had happened, he was furious with the Rat and that, according to the story, is why cats and Rats are enemies to this day.\n\nThe Cat however, \"does\" have a place in the Vietnamese zodiac, replacing the Rabbit.\n\nThe Jade Emperor ordered the four dragons, the Yellow Dragon (representation of the Yellow River), the Long Dragon (representation of the Yangtze River), the Black Dragon (representation of the Amur River) and the Pearl Dragon (representation of the Pearl River) by not making a rain since it was his own power to make rain for the crops to save. After 10 days, he did not make it rain because of his selfishness and he broke his own promise to the four dragons to make rain because people may die due to starvation. After the dragons let themselves to defy his orders to make rain without his permission, his men take these dragons to his kingdom and putting them each on a mountain until they die.\n\nThe Jade Emperor was originally the assistant of the Divine Master of the Heavenly Origin, Yuanshi Tianzun. Yuanshi Tianzun is said to be the supreme beginning, the limitless and eternal creator of Heaven and Earth, who picked Yu-huang, or the Jade Emperor, as his personal successor.\n\nThe Jade Emperor will eventually be succeeded by the Heavenly Master of the Dawn of Jade of the Golden Door (). The characters for both are stamped on the front of the arms of his throne.\n\nIn two folk automatic writing texts produced in 1925 and 1972, Guan Yu became the 18th Jade Emperor in about 1840 AD; however, some have disagreed that Guan Yu has succeeded, and thus the Jade Emperor and Guan Yu are often worshiped separately. In Tienti teaching, the reigning Jade Emperor has 55 predecessors.\n\nThe Jade Emperor's Birthday () is said to be the ninth day of the first lunar month. On this day Taoist temples hold a Jade Emperor ritual (, \"\", literally \"heaven worship\") at which priests and laymen prostrate themselves, burn incense and make food offerings.\n\nIn the morning of this birthday, Chinese, Taiwanese as well as Hokkien and Peranakan Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese who practice Buddhism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions set up an altar table with 3 layers: one top (containing offertories of six vegetables (), noodles, fruits, cakes, \"tangyuan\", vegetable bowls, and unripe betel, all decorated with paper lanterns) and two lower levels (containing the five sacrifices and wines) to honor the deities below the Jade Emperor. The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay homage and wish him a long life.\n\nIn Penang, Malaysia, a focal point of the Jade Emperor's Birthday celebrations is Thni Kong Tnua, which gained worldwide fame as one of the featured locations for \"The Amazing Race 16\". The temple, built in 1869, is located at the foot of Penang Hill at the Air Itam suburb near George Town, Penang's capital city. Aside from Thni Kong Tnua, the Chew Jetty in the heart of George Town is another focal point of the Jade Emperor's Birthday celebrations; the festivities in this particular location was captured for a 2014 Malaysian film, \"The Journey\".\n\nYuk Wong Kung Tin () also known as Yuk Wong Po Tin () is a temple in A Kung Ngam, Hong Kong, dedicated to the Jade Emperor. In the mid 19th century, people from Huizhou and Chaozhou mined stones in the hill for the development of the central urban area. They set up a shrine to worship Yuk Wong. At the beginning of the 20th century, the shrine was developed into a small temple and was renovated many times. The latest renovation was in 1992.\n\nA crater on Saturn's moon Rhea, discovered by Voyager 2 spacecraft, is named after him.\n\n"}

Smith and Ida Elizabeth Bowman. He went to school at the University of Utah, where he majored in Theater. In 1929, he married Ruth Pingree. Together they had seven children, Ruth, Ida, R.P. \"Joe\", Denis, Lynne, Hyrum, and Pauline.\n\nAt the time of his calling to the patriarchate, Smith was a member of the church's Mutual Improvement Association General Board, head of the Speech Department at the University of Utah (though he did not hold a Ph.D.), and was also president of the National Speech Association. His calling as patriarch filled a vacancy that had lasted just over ten years, and his selection for the office has been seen by some as a departure from the expected line of patriarchal succession from father to his eldest son in good standing with the church. Some sources suggest this move came during a time when some members of the church's First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were attempting to move away from the rule of primogeniture in selecting the presiding patriarch, giving church leaders the ability to pass over unsuitable candidates who would otherwise inherit the office somewhat automatically. Smith's official title was \"Patriarch to the Church,\" in place of the previous style of \"Patriarch over the Church\" or \"Presiding Patriarch,\" a change which was also accompanied by a reduction in the scope of the duties of the office; Smith was not permitted to ordain or formally supervise local stake patriarchs.\n\nAt the age of 43, Smith was ordained a high priest and Patriarch to the Church on October 8, 1942, by church president Heber J. Grant. He served only four years before it was reported by the church that he had requested to be released from his position. His request was granted by church president George Albert Smith on October 6, 1946, with the church announcing that Smith was released for reasons of \"ill health.\" In 1946 it had been discovered that the patriarch was involved in several homosexual affairs, including two in the 1920s while employed at the University of Utah (with student Norval Service and a drama department colleague named Wallace A. G.), and one while serving as presiding patriarch in the 1940s (with 21-year-old U.S. Navy sailor Byram Dow Browning who was also a Latter-day Saint). Church president George Albert Smith described the scandal as \"a pitiable case\" and \"a sad happening\" in his diary, describing himself as \"heartsick\" and as having a \"restless night\" in conjunction with the events and the necessity of releasing the patriarch.\n\nAfter being released, Smith took his family to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he continued to raise his family and resumed his academic career as a teacher of English and drama. For a time, Smith was not allowed to speak or hold any position in church, but no formal church disciplinary action was taken, and Smith was reportedly \"treated with compassion.\" Approximately a decade after his release as patriarch, Smith's stake president and bishop wrote to church president David O. McKay asking for restrictions on Smith to be lifted. In 1957, after it was established he had forsaken his homosexual behavior, confessed to his wife, and sent a written confession to the First Presidency, Smith was again allowed to serve in the church. Shortly thereafter, Smith's wife Ruth wrote a letter to church president David O. McKay expressing her gratitude for the church's help, stating, \"I know, better than anyone else, the trial our family has been to you and to the authorities.\" From 1957 until his death, Smith served as a member of his stake's high council.\n\nSmith died and was buried in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nSmith's grandson Jefferson Smith served in the Oregon House of Representatives from 2008 to 2012.\n\nSmith shares a name with his grandfather, Joseph F. Smith, and his uncle, Joseph Fielding Smith, both of whom served as apostles and later as church presidents.\n\n\n"}

Based out of Seattle, Washington, U.S., it is named after the mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630).\n\nKepler College was founded in 2000 as an unaccredited institution of higher learning that was authorized to grant degrees from 2000 until 2010 by the Higher Education Coordinating Board of Washington State. Its programs were based in the liberal arts and it offered degrees in astrological studies with a focus on the history of astrology. Since 2010, students have been awarded certificates of completion of a course of study instead of degrees.\n\nIn March 2000, Kepler College received provisional authorization from Washington State's Higher Education Coordinating (HEC) Board to grant degrees while the school pursued regional or national accreditation, a requirement for maintaining degree-granting status.\n\nThe HEC Board's decision was criticized by many academics due to Kepler's focus on the pseudoscience of astrology. An administrator at the University of Washington called the HEC Board's approval \"ludicrous\" and compared the study of astrology to \"quack medicine\". John Silber, chancellor of Boston University, wrote in a \"Boston Herald\" editorial that the school's promoters \"honored Kepler not for his strength but for his weakness, as if a society advocating drunkenness named a school for Ernest Hemingway\". Silber also said, \"The fact is that astrology, whether judged by its theory or its practice, is bunkum. In a free society there is no reason to prevent those who wish to learn nonsense from finding teachers who want to make money peddling nonsense. But it is inexcusable for the government to certify teachers of nonsense as competent or to authorize—that is, endorse—the granting of degrees in nonsense.\"\n\nKepler College promoted itself as the only institution in the Western Hemisphere to offer bachelor's and master's degrees in astrological studies and 31 students enrolled for the first term in July 2000. The majority of coursework was offered online, allowing students from across the U.S. to enroll with the requirement that they were present in-person for one week of the 11-week term.\n\nKepler College did not obtain the required accreditation status by 2010 and as a result, the HEC Board revoked Kepler's right to grant degrees. After losing this authority, Kepler became an online certificate program.\n\n"}
{"id": "38668255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38668255", "title": "Kong Family Mansion", "text": "Kong Family Mansion\n\nThe Kong Family Mansion () was the historical residence of the direct descendants of Confucius in the City of Qufu, the hometown of Confucius in Shandong Province, China. The extant structures mainly date from the Ming and Qing dynasties. From the mansion, the family tended to the Confucian sites in Qufu and also governed the largest private rural estate in China. The Kong family was in charge of conducting elaborate religious ceremonies on occasions such as plantings, harvests, honoring the dead, and birthdays. Today, the mansion is a museum and part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu\".\n\nThe mansion is located immediately to the east of the Temple of Confucius to which it had been formerly connected. The layout of the mansion is traditionally Chinese and separates official spaces in the style of a Yamen in the front of the complex from the residential quarters in the rear. Besides the yamen and the inner quarters, the complex also contains an eastern and a western study as well as a back garden. Within this overall arrangement, the spatial \ndistribution of the buildings according to the seniority, gender, and status of their inhabitants reflects the Confucian principle of order and hierarchy: The most senior descendant of Confucius took up residence in the central of the three main buildings; his younger brother occupied the Yi Gun hall to the east. The eastern study was used by the Duke of Yansheng to meet official guests and worship his ancestors. The western study was used by the family for study, meals, and entertaining friends. In its \npresent layout, the mansion comprises 152 buildings with 480 rooms, which cover an area of . Its tallest structure is the 4-story refuge tower () that was designed as a shelter during an attack but was never used. The mansion houses an archive with about 60,000 documents related to the life in the mansion over a period of 400 years during the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n\nThe first mansion for the Kong family of the Duke Yansheng was built in 1038 during the Song Dynasty. In 1377, the mansion was relocated and rebuilt under orders of the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty. In 1503, during the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor, the complex was expanded into three rows of buildings with 560 rooms and - like the neighboring Confucius Temple - nine courtyards. During the Qing Dynasty, the mansion underwent a complete renovation in 1838 only to be damaged in a fire 48 years later that destroyed the women's quarters in 1886. Even during the fire, men did not dare to enter the women's part of the mansion to fight the fire, leading to greater damage to this portion of the mansion complex. The damaged portions of the mansion were rebuilt two years later; the cost of both these 19th-century renovations was covered by the emperor. Despite these later renovations, the Kong Family Mansion remains the best preserved Ming-era residential complex of its size. The last head of the Kong family to live in the mansion was Kong Decheng, the 77th generation descendant of Confucius. Kong Decheng fled to Chongqing because of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. He did not return to Qufu but moved on to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.\n\nThere is another Kong Family Mansion in Quzhou built by the southern branch of Confucius descendants.\n\nThe major structures along the central axis of the mansion (from south to north) are:\n\nThe main entrance gate to the complex () is marked by a tablet that reads \"Holy Mansion\" \n\nThe central courtyard is flanked to the east and west by former administrative office buildings. The administration of the Kong family's official functions and businesses was structured into departments similar to the six ministries of the imperial government: Department of Rites (ancestor worship), Department of Seals (jurisdiction and edicts), Music, Letters, and Archives, Rent Collection and Sacrificial Fields.\n\nLocated to the north of the Central Courtyard, the Gate of Double Glory () was erected in 1503 and opened only for ceremonial purposes, visits by the emperor, or the arrival of imperial edicts. The structure is 6.24 meters wide, 2.03 meters deep, and 5.95 meters in height. It is also known as the \"Yi Gate\" () or \"Sai Gate\" () .\n\nThe Great Hall () was the site of the duke's official business and the place for the proclamation of imperial edicts. When holding court, the duke was seated in the hall on a wooden chair that was covered by a tiger skin.\n\nThe Second Hall () was used for receiving high-ranking officials as well as for examinations in music and rites by the duke. It contains seven tablets inscribed by emperors, including one with the character \"shou\" (longevity) written by the Empress Dowager Cixi.\n\nThe Third Hall (), also known as the \"Hall of Withdrawal\", was used by the duke for drinking tea.\n\nThis gate () dates to the Ming Dynasty. The gate building stands 11.8 meters wide, 6.1 meters deep, and 6.5 meters tall. During the residence of the Kong family, the gate was heavily guarded and restricted access to the residential portion of the mansion accessible only to the family and a small number of mostly female servants. Trespassing into the inner compound was punishable by death. Drinking water had to be delivered through a trough in the wall. On the internal ghost wall behind this entrance is a painting of a \"tan\" (tān), a mythical animal representing greed. Although the tan already has the Eight Treasures (associated with the Eight Immortals, it is still attempting to swallow the sun. The painting was placed at the exit from the inner apartments to the administrative portion to warn the members of the Kong family against greed in their business dealings outside.\n\nThe Front Reception Hall () is a structure with seven bays that was used for receiving relatives, banquets, marriage and funeral ceremonies.\n\nBuilt during the Qing era reconstruction after the fire of 1886, the Front Main Building () has two storeys and contained the private rooms of the wife and the concubines of the duke\n\nThe rear building () was erected during the reign of the Qing dynasty's Jiaqing Emperor. It has a floor space of 3900 square meters and contained the private rooms of the duke. The last duke to inhabit the Rear Building was Kong Decheng.\n\nOriginally a study for the duke, the rear five rooms () become a quarter for the maids of the residence during the late Qing dynasty.\n\nThe Back Garden () also known as the \nTieshan Garden () was added during the Ming-era expansion of the mansion in 1503. The major building at the northern end of the garden is the Flower Hall ().\n\n\n"}

There are no other mentions of the name anywhere else in the Bible.\n\nHaahashtari or Ahashtari was one of the sons of Naarah, one of the two wives of Asshur (1 Chronicles 4:6). Because the name is used to refer to a family of Judahites who descend from Judah via Ashhur, Thomas Kelly Cheyne believed that the name \"Haahashtari\" arose from a confusion between \"Ha-Ashhuri\" (\"the Ashhurite\") with the obscure term \"ahashtranim\" which appears in Esther 8:10.\n\nHabaiah (also called Hobaiah or Obdia) was the name given to a priestly family mentioned in Ezra 2:61: the \"b'ne habayah\" (literally \"sons/descendants of Habaiah\"). Along with the families Hakkoz and Barzillai, the Habaiah family were priests whose names were not registered in the official genealogical records. As a result, Ezra ruled that their rights to serve as priests would be restricted until such time as a high priest could decide, using the oracular Urim and Thummim, whether they had divine approval to serve as priests.\n\nThe name \"Habaiah\" means \"Yahweh hides\" or \"Yahweh protects,\" and appears in manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint in the forms \"Labeia,\" \"Obaia,\" \"Odogia,\" \"Ebeia,\" \"Ab(e)ia,\" \"Obbeia,\" and \"Obdia.\" \n\nHabazziniah or Habaziniah was either the head of a family of Rechabites (Jeremiah 35:3), or else a place name for the location that a Rechabite lived. According to Cheyne and Black, it may have been a scribal error where the name \"Kabzeel,\" a place in the territory of Judah, was originally intended.\"\n\nHachmoni or Hakmoni is mentioned in passing in 1 Chronicles 27:32, which records that his son Yechiel, a scribe, tutored David's sons.\n\nAccording to I Kings 11:23, Hadadezer (Hebrew: הדדעזר \"hadad`ezer\" \"Hadad helps\") was king of Zobah.\n\nHaddad the Edomite was an adversary of Solomon (I Kings 10:14).\n\nHadlai is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 28:12 as an Ephraimite, and the father of Amasa.

They appear in a list with other returnees in Ezra 2:46, but are omitted in the corresponding place in Nehemiah 7:48. A Hellenized version of this name appears in a similar context in 1 Esdras 5:30. In the New Testament, a prophet who appears in Acts 11:28 and 21:10 is named Agabus, a variant on the name Hagab.\n\nHagab is a different character from Hagabah, which appears in the preceding verse.\n\nHagabah (also Hagaba, Graba, or Aggaba) is identified as the ancestor of a family of Nethinim, or temple assistants, who returned from the Babylonian captivity. They appear in a list with other returnees in Ezra 2:45, Nehemiah 7:48, and 1 Esdras 5:29.\n\nHaggi was a son of Gad according to and .

In a list of workers building the wall of Nehemiah, a man named \"Shallum son of Hallohesh\" is mentioned as having a leadership role. Also in the Book of Nehemiah, a person named Hallohesh is recorded as affixing his seal (an ancient form of signature) to Ezra's covenant between God and the people living around Jerusalem.\n\nThomas Kelly Cheyne believed that the name Hallohesh was a miswritten version of the name \"Hash-shilhi,\" (Shilhi).\n\nHammedatha was an Agagite and the father of Haman (see ).\n\nHammoleketh or Hammolecheth is the sister of Machir, the eponymous ancestor of the tribe or clan of Machir (biblical region) Machir, which is reckoned as a part of the tribe of Manasseh in 1 Chronicles 7. The name appears to mean \"she who reigns\" if it is not a scribal error for some other name, such as Beth-Milcah.\n\nHammelech, in the King James Version is the name of the father of Jerahmeel (Jeremiah 36:26), and it is the name of the father of Malkijah (Jeremiah 38:6). In a number of more recent translations, the Hebrew \"ha-melekh\" is taken as the common noun \"the king\" instead of the proper noun \"Hammelech.\"\n\nHamor was the father of Shechem.

The name \"Hareph\" in this case may refer to a group of people otherwise referred to by the term Hariphite.\n\nHarhaiah, in the Masoretic Text of Nehemiah 3:8, is mentioned in passing, as being the father of Uzziel, a man responsible for the repair of part of the wall of Jerusalem. The awkward phrasing of the verse suggested to Stanley A. Cook (1899) that there had been some scribal mishandling of the verse, and that the verse originally did not contain the name \"Harhaiah.\"\n\nHarhas, according to 2 Kings 22:14 and 2 Chronicles 34:22, was an ancestor of Shallum, the husband of the prophetess Huldah. However, where the Book of Kings has \"Harhas,\" the Book of Chronicles reads \"Hasrah.\"\n\nHarim (; \"destroyed\" or \"dedicated to God\") was the name of three biblical patriarchs:\n\nHarnepher appears only once in the Bible, in 1 Chronicles 7:36, in a passage which surveys the descendants of Asher.

Because the name often appears in lists without any detailed description, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether different verses that use the name are referring to the same Hashabiah or to distinct persons. The following list of nine individuals is the number listed in the \"Encyclopaedia Biblica\", though the encyclopedia does not claim that precisely nine people of this name are mentioned:\n\nHashabnah is the name given for one of the men who signed the covenant between the people of Judah and God in Nehemiah 10:25 (verse 26 in some Bibles). According to Cheyne and Black, the name is likely a miswritten form of \"Hashabniah.\"\n\nHashub is mentioned in passing as the father of Shemaiah, a Levite who is listed among those living in Jerusalem after the end of the Babylonian captivity.\n\nHashubah is listed as one of the children of Zerubabel, the governor of Yehud Medinata.\n\nHasrah, according to 2 Chronicles 34:22, is the name of an ancestor of Shallum, the husband of the prophetess Huldah.

The Ketiv, the version written but not read aloud, reads somewhat differently, in a manner that suggested to Thomas Kelly Cheyne that the opening words of the verse were not the name of the giant, but words that indicated that David and his soldiers stayed in (the city of) Nob. Whatever the case with the Ketiv, the Qere as it now stands asserts that Ishbi-benob was the name of a Philistine giant, who was killed by Abishai son of Zeruiah.

In both passages, the Hebrew text refers to a \"mlk yrb\" (KJV \"King Jareb\") in a way that implies that \"mlk yrb\" is the king of Assyria. However, no Assyrian king by the name of \"Jareb\" is known to history, which has led to a variety of conjectures about what the phrase refers to. According to W. F. Albright, the \"definitive solution\" to the problem is that the text should read \"mlk rb\" or \"mlky rb\", meaning \"the great king\", a Hebrew translation of the common Assyrian royal title \"sharru rabu\".

{"id": "23082927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23082927", "title": "Matrilineality in Judaism", "text": "Matrilineality in Judaism\n\nMatrilineality in Judaism or matrilineal descent in Judaism is the tracing of Jewish descent through the maternal line. Virtually all Jewish communities have followed matrilineal descent from at least early Tannaitic (c. 10-70 CE) times to Modern times. The origins and date-of-origin of matrilineal descent in Judaism are uncertain. Orthodox Jews, who believe that matrilineality and matriarchy within Judaism are related to the metaphysical concept of the Jewish soul, maintain that matrilineal descent is an Oral Law from at least the time of the Receiving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai (c. 1310 BCE). Conservative Jewish Theologian Rabbi Louis Jacobs suggests that the marriage practices of the Jewish community were re-stated as a law of matrilineal descent in the early Tannaitic Period (c. 10-70 CE). \n\nIn practice, Jewish denominations define \"Who is a Jew?\" via descent in different ways. All denominations of Judaism have protocols for conversion for those who are not Jewish by descent.\n\nOrthodox Judaism practices matrilineal descent and considers it axiomatic. The Conservative Jewish Movement also practices matrilineal descent as virtually all Jewish communities have for at least two thousand years. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative Movement to the practice of matrilineal descent. In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis of Reform Judaism passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent, provided that either (a) one is raised as a Jew, by Reform standards, or (b) one engages in an appropriate act of public identification, formalizing a practice that had been common in Reform synagogues for at least a generation. This 1983 resolution departed from the Reform Movement's previous position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. However, the closely associated Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has rejected this resolution and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother. Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. In 1968, the Reconstructionist movement became the first American Jewish movement to pass a resolution recognizing Jews of patrilineal descent.\n\nAccording to the Jewish tradition, the maternal lines of the three founding families of Israel were essential for the foundation of the Nation of Israel. The patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel established the foundation for Israel in three families over three generations. The Torah specifically emphasizes the importance of the bloodlines of the four matriarchs of Israel: Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.\n\nSarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were all family of Abraham. In the Jewish Tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah were as well. The Torah lists the son-after-son descendants from Shem, son of Noah, to Terah, the father of Abraham: Arpachshad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Re'u, Serug, Nahor, Terah. Terach, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran. \n\nIn the Jewish Tradition, Sarah was the daughter of Haran (the brother of Abraham) and the granddaughter of Terah. Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were each direct descendants (through Milcah, daughter of Haran) of both Haran and Nahor, the two brothers of Abraham. Rebekah was the great-granddaughter of Haran and also the granddaughter of Nahor. Rachel and Leah, nieces of Rebekah, also descend from both Haran and Nahor but one generation later than Rebekah.\n\nAbraham and Sarah (who in the Jewish Tradition was greater than Abraham in prophecy) migrated as a married couple out of Ur Kasdim (in Mesopotamia) to Haran (in Mesopotamia) and eventually to the land of Canaan. Sarah came from the same family as Abraham. In the Torah, Abraham refers to Sarah as his sister. According to Jewish Tradition, Sarah was Abraham's niece, Iscah (Jessica). (Haran, brother of Abraham, was the father of both Milcah and Iscah. There is a Jewish oral tradition that Milcah is the ancestor of all prophets of non-Jewish nations.)\n\nBefore fathering Isaac, Abraham had a son, Ishmael, with Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian. After Sarah died, Abraham also had six other children with a woman named Keturah. Isaac alone came from the maternal line of Sarah. The Torah's story line continues with the life of Isaac. \"The Nation of Israel descends directly from Isaac, child of Sarah\", and not directly from Abraham's first born, Ishmael, nor from any of Abraham's six other sons. \nAnd God said to Abraham, \"Be not displeased concerning the lad and concerning your handmaid; all that Sarah tells you, hearken to her voice, for through Isaac will your seed be called….”(Genesis: 21:12) \nIsaac married Rebekah, who came from the City of Nahor in Aram-Naharaim (in Mesopotamia). They had Jacob and Esau. Rebekah came from the same family as Abraham. Under duress, Isaac refers to Rebekah as his sister. The Torah makes it clear that Rebekah was Abraham's great niece through one of his brothers and his great-great niece through his second brother. According to Jewish Tradition, Rebekah was also separately the great-niece of Sarah.\n\nEsau, Jacob's fraternal twin married two Hittite women. Neither were from the family of Abraham. Esau's third wife was from the family of Ishmael. Ishmael's mother was Hagar. None of Esau's children are the focus of the story line of the Torah. (Esau was the progenitor of Edom. One of the sons of the sons of Esau, son of Isaac, was the chieftain of Amalek.)\n\nIn the account of the Torah, Isaac instructed Jacob, who was to father the twelve tribes, specifically to marry a niece of Rebekah. Jacob was married to Leah, and then married Rachel. Rachel and Leah lived in Padan-Aram (in Mesopotamia). They were Jacob's first cousins. They came from the same family as Rebekah. Rachel and Leah were also both Abraham's great-great nieces and his great-great-great nieces. In addition, according to the Jewish Tradition, Rachel and Leah were separately also Sarah's great-great nieces. In the Jewish tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah, handmaidens of Rachel and Leah and the birth-mothers of four of the tribes, were Rachel and Leah's half-sisters.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah had the same father as Rachel and Leah, \"but not the same mother.\" \"It was Rachel and Leah who bore the lines of the kingship, the priesthood and the right to the double portion of the first born in Israel.\"\n\nThe Jewish People see themselves as descending from the three founding families of Israel.\n\nAccording to those who adhere to Jewish Law, Israelite Nationhood or belonging to the Jewish People via descent exclusively follows the mother's line.\n\nThe Matriarchs of Israel are \"the mothers of\" the Tribes of Israel.\n\nFollowing the Torah, Prophets and Writings, kingship in Israel descends directly from Peretz, the firstborn son that Tamar had with Judah and not from Judah's older son, Shelah. \n\nJudah's first wife was the daughter of a Canaani man named Shua, with whom he had three sons. The first two were considered evil and killed by God. The third son was Shelah.\n\nAfter “Shua's daughter, Judah's wife, died;” and after “Judah was consoled,” Judah had an encounter with Tamar that produced twin sons.And it was at the time that she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb.\nAnd it was when she gave birth, that he [the infant] stretched out his hand. And the midwife took and bound a crimson thread on his hand, saying, \"This one came out first.\"\nAnd it was, as he was drawing back his hand, and behold, his brother emerged, and she [the midwife] said, \"With what strength you have burst forth!\" And he [Judah] named him Peretz (burst forth).\nAnd afterwards, his brother emerged, the one on whose hand was the [shining] crimson thread, and he [Judah] named him Zerah (shine). \n\nIn the Jewish Tradition, in addition to Leah, Matriarch of Israel, Tamar is also considered to be the mother of the line of kingship in Israel. Judah's son, Shelah, born from the daughter of Shua, was older, but Shelah did not receive the line of kingship. Instead, it went through Peretz, Judah's first born from Tamar. Judah alone could not establish the line of kingship, only through Tamar could the line of kingship be established in Israel. Following the Torah, Prophets and Writings, \"kingship in Israel descends directly from the firstborn child of Tamar, and not from Judah's older son, Shelah.\"\n\nAnother example in the Torah of the importance of the matrilineal line is the mentioning of the maternal line of Yocheved, the mother of Moses. Even though tribal affiliation traditionally passes through the father, the greatest leader of Israel, Moses, is listed as descending from the House of Levi not only through his father Amram but specifically through his mother Yocheved as well. Yocheved was the daughter of Levi. Correspondingly, Moses's sister Miriam was both the granddaughter of Levi and the great-granddaughter of Levi.\n\nMoses married Zipporah, daughter of Jethro, Priest of Midian. They had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer, both born before the Exodus. The sons of Moses are not explicitly referenced anywhere in Jewish Tradition as being Israelite. The sons of Moses are absent from the genealogy of Levi in Exodus.\n\nMoses married a Cushite woman (who, according to classical interpretations, may or may not refer to Zipporah). The Torah makes no mention of any offspring from this union.\n\nAaron married a woman from the Tribe of Judah. Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel, married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab (descendant of Tamar) and sister of Nahshon, Prince of the Tribe of Judah. They had Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. Aaron and Elisheba's four children were given the priesthood in Israel.\n\nMiriam married a man from the Tribe of Judah. Miriam, Prophetess in Israel, married Caleb ben Yephunneh (descendant of Tamar), a leader in the Tribe of Judah. According to Jewish Tradition, Miriam and Caleb were the parents of Hur, leader in Israel and grandfather of Bezalel (chief artisan for the Tabernacle). \n\nMoses, Aaron and Miriam were the leaders of Israel during the time periods of the Exodus from Egypt and the Revelation at Mt. Sinai.\n\nIn the Jewish Tradition, the Houses in Israel of the Priesthood and the Levites descend from Yocheved, and the House of Kingship in Israel descends from Miriam.\n\nIn the accounts of the Prophets and Writings (which covers a time period of nearly a millennium) there are two cases of non-Israelite women who voluntarily (not resulting from conflict) married Israelites where their children were considered Israelite. According to the Talmud, both of these women, Ruth and Naamah, formally converted. Ruth, \"who lived centuries after Abraham, came from the people of Moab who descend from the older daughter of Lot\". (Lot was the son of Haran and the nephew of Abraham). Ruth the Moabitess became the great-grandparent of King David.\n\nIn the account of the Book of Ruth (which is part of Writings but is set in the time period of the Judges), Naomi was the wife of Elimelech of Bethlehem, Judah. Due to famine in the land, Elimelech went with his family to live in the fields of Moab and then died. Naomi’s two sons married Moabite women. Mahlon (Sickness) married Ruth, and Chilion (Obliteration), Orpah. Naomi’s two sons then died. In a state of poverty and accompanied by her former daughter-in-law, Ruth the Moabitess, Naomi journeyed back to Bethlehem, Judah. Then in selling her late husband’s land in Judah and the estates of her sons, Naomi set up the stipulation that her financial redeemer also marry her former daughter-in-law. The first potential redeemer declined, lest this [marriage] ruin his inheritance. Boaz, the next of kin and descendant of Tamar, became Naomi’s redeemer, married Ruth and became the father of Obed. \nAnd Naomi took the child and placed him in her bosom, and she became his nurse. \nAnd the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, \"A son has been born to Naomi,\" and they called his name Obed- he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. \nNaamah, \"who lived centuries after Abraham, came from the people of Ammon who descend from the younger daughter of Lot\". Naamah the Ammonitess, was the mother of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and a Judean king of the Davidic Line. Naamah is the only presumed wife of Solomon mentioned by name in Jewish scripture. Rehoboam is the only child of Solomon mentioned \"at all\" in Jewish scripture.\n\nThe Jewish Oral Tradition cites the Book of Ezra, Chapters 9, 10, regarding the law of matrilineal descent in Judaism. In the book of Ezra, Ezra the Scribe, (c. 400 BCE) returned to Judea from the Babylonian Exile with more than forty thousand Israelites in order to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. They re-committed to observing the Torah, including separating from their non-Israelite wives (their marriages to Israelites notwithstanding) and the children they had with them (and irrespective of whether or not they had children with them).\nAnd when these were completed, the chiefs approached me, saying \"The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites were not separated from the peoples of the lands, like the abominations of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.\n…And when I heard [of] this matter, I rent my garment and my robe, and I tore the hair of my head and my beard, and I sat bewildered.\n…And now, let us make a covenant with our God to cast out all the wives and those born to them, by the counsel of the Lord and those who hasten to [perform] the commandment of our God, and according to the Law it shall be done. \nEzra designated Elders in Israel who convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter (of Israelite men who needed to separate from their non-Israelite wives- a matter that could require a judicial determination unlike the status of the children that would simply result from this determination) until the first day of the first month when the task was completed. \n\nFollowing the account of Ezra in the Book of Ezra, one hundred and twelve Israelites (out of a congregation of more than forty thousand Israelites) were listed as having been found wanting in this matter \"and some of them had wives by whom they had children.\"\n\nThe medieval French commentator, Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (1040-1105 CE) in his commentary on Prophets references the law of matrilineal descent regarding Tamar, daughter of King David. In the account of the Prophets, in an attempt to stave off Amnon who was obsessed with a sickness over her, Tamar let him know that she was open to a legitimate marriage with him. Tamar and Amnon both had the same father, King David (c. 9th century BCE). Still, Tamar says that King David would permit them to marry legally: “for he will not withhold me from you.” Although they were half siblings biologically, by law they were not related. Tamar’s mother (at least at the time when she was conceived) was not Israelite, her mother was Maacah the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur. According to what Tamar claimed in the account of the Prophets, the law would disregard the biological fact that they shared a father. (In the Jewish Tradition, Amnon was mutilated by Tamar, and in the account of the Prophets, he was killed by Tamar’s brother, Absalom, two years later.)\n\nThe Hellenized Jewish philosopher, Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE) calls the child of a Jew and a non-Jew a \"nothos\" (bastard), regardless of whether the non-Jewish parent is the father or the mother.\nWhile Flavius Josephus (c. 37-100 CE), the Romanized Jewish historian, writing about events that were alleged to have occurred a century prior, has Antigonus II Mattathias (c. 63-37 BCE), the last Hasmonean king of Judea, denigrating Herod –whose father's family were Idumean Arabs forcibly converted to Judaism by John Hyrcanus (c. 134-104 BCE) and whose mother, according to Josephus, was either an Idumean Arab or Arabian (Nabatean-Arab)– by referring to him as \"an Idumean i.e. a half-Jew\" and as therefore unfit to be given governorship of Judea by the Romans:But Antigonus, by way of reply to what Herod had caused to be proclaimed, and this before the Romans…said that they [the Romans] would not do justly, if they gave the kingdom to Herod, who was no more than a private man, and an Idumean, i.e. a half Jew, whereas they ought to bestow it on one of the royal family, as their custom was; for that in case they at present bear an ill-will to him [to Antigonus], and had resolved to deprive him of the kingdom, as having received it from the Parthians, yet were there many others of his family [the Hasmoneans] that might by their law take it, and these such as had no way offended the Romans; and being of the sacerdotal family [the Hasmoneans], it would be an unworthy thing to put them by.\n\nOrthodox Judaism maintains that the Jewish Oral Law of matrilineality in Judaism dates at least to the time of the Receiving of the Torah at Mount Sinai (c. 1310 BCE). The law of matrilineal descent was first codified, as all Jewish Oral Law, in the Mishna (c. 2nd century CE). \n\nThe Talmud (c. 500 CE) adduces the law of matrilineal descent from the Torah: \"you shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. For he will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others…\" The Talmud interprets \"For he\" as the non-Jewish father and the concern is that \"he will turn away your son from following Me.\" The Talmud understands that the offspring of a non-Jewish father and a Jewish mother is \"your son\" as opposed to the second situation mentioned of a non-Jewish mother and a Jewish father where the Torah comments no further because the offspring, according to the Torah, is not Jewish and is not bound to keep the Torah. \n\nThis Jewish Law is codified in the Shulchan Aruch (1563 CE) without mention of any dissenting opinion. No source in any classical Halachic text raises any evidence of a differing ruling about this Jewish Law.\n\nOrthodox Judaism follows matrilineal descent. Orthodox Judaism holds that anyone with a Jewish mother also has irrevocable Jewish status; that even were such a Jew to convert to another religion, that person would still be considered Jewish by Jewish Law.\n\nRabbi Louis Jacobs, who was the founder of the Masorti (Conservative) Jewish Movement in Britain and a well-known theologian writes regarding his review of an article by Professor Cohen on matrilineal descent in Judaism:There has been a development of the law in these instances from Biblical and pre-Rabbinic times. The attempt to find reasons for the change, however, has proved to be elusive and is quite unnecessary since it can be explained entirely economically by the logic of the law itself and is typical of Rabbinic thinking in general. But the development in the law had already taken place before the redaction of the Mishnah at the very latest. With the exception of the Rabbi in the Jerusalem Talmud (Qiddushin, 3:12) who permitted the child of a gentile mother and Jewish father to be circumcised on the Sabbath and whose opinion was vehemently rejected, the law is accepted unanimously in both Talmuds. It is recorded as the law in all the Codes without dissenting voice and has been the universal norm in all Jewish communities. For such a law to be changed, only the weightiest religious and ethical advantages will suffice and it is difficult indeed to discover any such in the change in this particular instance. To change this particular law would strike at the heart of the whole halakhic process and would involve a theological as well as an halakhic upheaval. And for what? The potential loss is great. The gains, if any, are few and the price is far too high.\n\nShaye J. D. Cohen of Harvard University and formerly a Dean at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, questions the date of origin of matrilineal descent:\nThe preexilic portions of the Hebrew Bible are not familiar with the matrilineal principle. Numerous Israelite heroes and kings married foreign women; for example, Judah married a Canaanite, Joseph an Egyptian, Moses a Midianite and an Ethiopian, David a Philistine, and Solomon women of every description. Although Exod. 34:16 and Deut. 7:1-3 prohibit intermarriage only with the Canaanites, a prohibition that was supposed to have originated with the patriarchs Abraham (Gen. 24:3) and Isaac (Gen. 27:46-28:1), some Israelites extended the prohibition to include all foreigners (Judg. 14:3). But it never occurred to anyone in preexilic times to argue that such marriages were null and void. Marriage was the non- sacramental, private acquisition of a woman by a man, and the state had little or no legal standing in the matter. The foreign woman who married an Israelite husband was supposed to leave her gods in her father's house, but even if she did not, it never occurred to anyone to argue that her children were not Israelites. Since the idea of conversion to Judaism did not yet exist, it never occurred to anyone to demand that the foreign woman undergo some ritual to indicate her acceptance of the religion of Israel. The woman was joined to the house of Israel by being joined to her Israelite husband; the act of marriage was functionally equivalent to the later idea of conversion. In some circumstances biblical law and society did pay attention to maternal identity-the children of concubines and female slaves some- times rank lower than the children of wives-but it never occurred to anyone to impose any legal or social disabilities on the children of foreign women.\n\nIn his review of Cohen's article, Rabbi Jacobs accepts that the law may have changed in the early Tannaitic period (circa 10-70 CE): \"From the historical evidence marshalled by Professor Cohen it would appear that the change from the patrilineal to the matrilineal principle for the offspring of mixed unions of Jew and gentile took place in the early Tannaitic period.\" \n\nBut Jacobs dismisses Cohen's suggestion that \"the Tannaim were influenced by the Roman legal system...\" and contends that \"even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system.\"\n\nInstead, Jacobs offers another explanation. Jacobs believes that an Israelite man who married a non-Israelite woman and had a child, that woman and child were considered not part of the \"family clan\" and therefore were not considered Israelite: \"A child born of a Jewish father and a gentile mother cannot be given the status of the father since the patrilineal principle is stated only with regard to unions within the clan. How can the father who steps out of the clan bestow a clan status on the child whom he sires?\"\n\nTherefore, Jacobs hypothesizes:The child of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not a gentile because of the application of any matrilineal principle...He is a child without Jewish parentage since the patrilineal principle cannot operate for a union carried out beyond the limits of the clan. The child is not a gentile because his mother is a gentile but because the only way a child can be born as a Jew is for him to have the Jewishness of his father transmitted to him and this cannot happen where the union is outside of the clan limits. Thus, for the Rabbis there is no switch here from a patrilineal to a matrilineal principle. The patrilineal principle still stands, only it cannot operate in this instance.\n\nThe Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism conducted a survey of 1,617 members of 27 Conservative congregations in the U.S. and Canada in 1995. 69% of respondents to the Ratner Center survey agreed that they would regard personally as a Jew anyone who was raised Jewish—even if their mother was Gentile and their father was Jewish (Wertheimer, 59). In this same survey, 29% of respondents indicated that they attended Jewish religious services twice a month or more and 13% that they engage in the study of a Jewish text once a month or more (Wertheimer, 55-57).\n\nThe Conservative Movement practices matrilineal descent. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative movement to the law of matrilineal descent. Furthermore, the movement stated that any rabbi who accepts the principle of patrilineal descent will be subject to expulsion from the Rabbinical Assembly. Still, the Conservative Movement affirmed that \"sincere Jews by choice\" should be warmly welcomed into the community and that \"sensitivity should be shown to Jews who have intermarried and their families.\" The Conservative movement actively reaches out to intermarried families by offering them opportunities for Jewish growth and enrichment.\n\nIn 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother. As well, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din formed in Denver, Colorado to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism was dissolved in 1983, due to that Reform resolution. However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing \"that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process.\" Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis \"would be able to take local decisions – ratified by the Beit Din – confirming Jewish status.\"\n\nOther movements within the World Union for Progressive Judaism also adopted essentially the same position. These include: Liberal Judaism in England; Progressive Judaism in Australia; one congregation in Austria; some congregations in Eastern Europe. Note that Reform Judaism in Canada and England adopts a different position, similar to that of Conservative Judaism (though there may be an accelerated conversion process for the children of Jewish fathers).\n\nKaraite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. Karraite Judaism does not accept the authoritativeness of the Talmud or Jewish Oral Law.\n\nThe majority view in Karaite Judaism is that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line. Only someone who is patrilineally Jewish (someone whose father's father was Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the \"Mo'eṣet HaḤakhamim\", or the Karaite Council of Sages based in Israel.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism, which values equity and inclusivity, was the first movement to adopt the idea of bilineal descent in 1968. According to Reconstructionist Judaism, children of one Jewish parent, of either gender, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews.\n\nThe State of Israel adheres to the Jewish law of matrilineal descent for matters which could affect Israeli family law.\n\nSeven marriage contracts that took place before the 13th century between Karaite and Rabbinic individuals have so far been discovered in the Cairo Genizah. In the 12th century, approximately 25,000 Jews lived in Egypt, mostly in Cairo. A percentage of the Jewish community was Karaite. Moses Maimonides became one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Egypt shortly after his arrival there in 1165 CE. Virtually all Jews in the world at this time including the Egyptian Jewish Community followed matrilineal descent. In fact, Maimonides (1138-1204 CE) himself re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law:This is the general rule: The status of an offspring from a gentile man or from a gentile woman is the same as his mother's; we disregard the father. The Egyptian Jewish Karaites, however, followed patrilineal descent. Still, these same 12th century Egyptian Karaites forbade marriage with non-Jews and also did not allow converts into their community. In effect then, 12th century Egyptian Karaites required that \"both\" parents be Jewish, but they referred to this requirement as patrilineal descent. Marriages between Karaites and the Rabbinic community came to a halt in the thirteenth century when Maimonides ruled for a specific serious reason that there was a problem with them. This specific ruling by Maimonides also means that Maimonides considered the Karaites of 800 yrs ago of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community to be Jewish on their mother's side as well.\n\nSamson, from the tribe of Dan served as Judge of Israel for twenty years. According to current scholarship, the most recent likely date for the authorship of the Book of Judges is approximately 500 BCE. The reaction of Samson’s parents to his desired marriage to a Philistine woman may indicate the cultural expectations in Israel regarding marriage at this time: And his father and his mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your brothers and among all of my people that you should go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?”… In the account of the Book of Judges, Samson married this woman and soon killed thirty Philistine men in Ashkelon. (Samson’s wife was then given to another man by her father who said that Samson utterly hated her. Samson then set the fields of the Philistines on fire. The Philistines then went and killed this woman and her father.)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16937878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16937878", "title": "Our Lady of America", "text": "Our Lady of America\n\nOur Lady of America is the Blessed Virgin Mary as she identified herself in response to the US Bishops declaring Her Patroness of the United States as The Immaculate Conception, and is not to be confused with and in no way displaces Our Lady of Guadalupe who is known as Empress of the Americas. It is a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary based on private revelations reported by Sister Mary Mildred Neuzil (then using the name Sister Mary Ephrem) of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood. Devotion to Our Lady of America was approved and promoted by Paul Francis Leibold, Archbishop of Cincinnati for the specific group of people who sought private healing through this Marian title. However, the Catholic Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has not officially recognized or approved the alleged apparitions according to the personal diary of Sister Mary Ephrem. The United States and Latin America have churches dedicated to Mary with the title 'María, Reina de las Américas'.\n\nThe devotion to Our Lady of America has its source in a personal diary by Sister Mary Ephrem in which she describes apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary she claims to have experienced some time prior to 1956. Sister Mary Ephrem (baptized Mildred) Neuzil, was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1916 and in 1933 was professed in the Congregation of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of Jesus, of Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe ministry of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood includes prayer, education, art, music, care of the elderly, social services, healthcare, parish and pastoral ministry. Around 1957 Sister Ephrem became part of a cloistered contemplative branch of the same congregation established in New Riegel, Ohio. The New Riegel cloister received papal approval in 1965. In 1977 the three surviving members, including Sister Mary Ephrem separated from the Sisters of the Precious Blood and formed an autonomous congregation, the Contemplative Sisters of the Indwelling Trinity in Fostoria, Ohio, directed by Sister Mary Ephrem. She also established an organization called \"The Our Lady of America Center\". \n\nThe Holy See rejected their petition for separation the following year, on the ground that three was “too small a number for a well-formed community”. The Sisters of the Indwelling Trinity survive to the present day even though they never received approval or have been recognized by the local ordinary of Toledo, Ohio. \n\nSister Mary Ephrem died in 2000.\n\nSister Mary Ephrem allegedly experienced seemingly mystical spiritual experiences of Our Lady of America between September 25, 1956 and November 15, 1956 in the Our Lady Mother of Mercy Chapel in Rome City, Indiana. According to Sister Ephrem's personal diary, upon which accounts of the alleged apparitions are based, these visits requested devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and asked Sister Ephrem to propagate them. She then turned to Monsignor Paul Francis Leibold, her spiritual director until 1972. It is said that Sister Ephrem was asked to have a medal struck that would bear the image of Our Lady of America on the front and the symbol of the Christian Family and the Blessed Trinity on the back. \n\nThe Sisters of the Precious Blood later sold the Rome City property to The Way International, a biblical research, teaching and fellowship ministry.\n\nA booklet containing the contents of the revelation, and bearing the \"Imprimatur\" of Archbishop Leibold, Sister Mary Ephrem's spiritual director, was published in 1960 and again in 1971.\nA distinction must be made between the devotion to Our Lady of America itself, and the claimed apparitions said to have initiated it. In 1963, Leibold, then an auxiliary bishop of Cincinnati (later Archbishop of Cincinnati 1969-1972), granted his Imprimatur to the text of a prayer Sister Mary Ephrem had written in honor of Our Lady of America, and to the design of a medal. While a number of church officials have indicated support for the devotion, finding nothing against church teaching, no decision has been rendered as yet with regard to the supernatural origin of the reported apparitions of Our Lady to Sister Mildred Neuzil. \n\nReports and claims of healings upon the grounds at Rome City, Indiana have not been verified and approved by the Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati has stated that the Devotion to Our Lady of America, as a matter of private revelation, has not been canonically approved despite the claims of some individuals.\n\nIn 1972, Father Albert Gorayeb, of Saint Ann Melkite Catholic Church commissioned an icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As Fr. Gorayeb dedicated the Icon of Our Lady to bless the American people, it bears the title Our Lady of America. On June 27, 1976 Patriarch Maximos V Hakim and Archbishop Joseph Tawil solemnly blessed and consecrated the Icon, as a special blessing to America and to all those who pray before Her. The icon has gone on pilgrimage to parishes that request it, but resides at the Church of St. Ann.\n\nPrayer to Our Lady of America is a popular devotion in the Philippines, with a chapel, three shrines eleven churches dedicated to her. Baguio Cathedral has a Chapel of Our Lady of America. She is considered the patroness of the Thomasites, of Igorot people, of the Cordilleras and of Northern Luzon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3536181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3536181", "title": "Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)", "text": "Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)\n\nPaul Rosenberg (29 December 1881 – 29 June 1959) was a French art dealer. He represented Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Henri Matisse. Both Paul and his brother Léonce Rosenberg were among the world's major dealers of modern art.\n\nThe younger son of antiques dealer Alexandre Rosenberg, Paul and his elder brother Léonce joined their father's business. Alexandre had established his business in 1878, and by 1898 had become a noted dealer of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. He educated his sons in this passion by allowing them both a grand tour via London, Berlin, Vienna and New York to acquire experience and contacts. During the tour, Paul bought two van Gogh drawings and a Manet portrait for $220, which he had transported to his father's gallery and sold onwards at a profit. From 1906 on, the brothers worked as partners within the business. When their father retired, they became directors. Having established their own networks, the brothers opened their own separate galleries in the city's 8th arrondissement, with Paul at 21 rue La Boétie (opened in 1911) and Léonce in the rue de la Baume.\n\nLéonce became a noted champion of Cubism, a lead that Paul followed, but being located in a more noted art district, he gained better contacts and greater finances. Working initially with his brother-in-law Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Paul and his partner Georges Wildenstein established and then won over from Kahnweiler exclusive relationships with: Picasso (from 1918); Braque (1922); Marie Laurencin; Fernand Léger (1927); and latterly Matisse (1936).\n\nPaul's stock included pieces by all of the classical and contemporary French and major European artists, and latterly American artists, including: Marsden Hartley; Max Weber; Abraham Rattner; Karl Knaths; Harvey Weiss; Oronzio Maldarelli; Nicolas de Staël; Graham Sutherland; Kenneth Armitage; and Giacomo Manzù. The result was that from 1920, Paul Rosenberg's company was widely acknowledged to be without doubt the most active and influential gallery in the world.\n\nWith the early artist relationships, like Kahnweiler had, Rosenberg gave the artists financial security by agreeing to buy their works on the basis of an exclusive contract. Rosenberg lent Picasso money after his honeymoon with the ballerina Olga Khokhlova and found them an apartment in Paris next to his own family home, generosity which resulted in a lifelong friendship between these two very different men. Rosenberg's purchases from Picasso included \"Nude, Green Leaves and Bust\" (1932), a portrait of Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter, which Rosenberg sold in New York in 1951 to Frances Lasker Brody. Every summer the Rosenberg family and the Picasso family would depart for the South of France, holidaying there with friends including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Somerset Maugham, Stravinsky, Ravel and Matisse.\n\nRosenberg's reputation for clean dealing enabled him by 1935 to persuade his brother-in-law Jacques Helft, a noted antiques dealer, to open a branch in Bond Street, London, to enable them to engage with more Americans. Noted clients included museums such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) (of which Rosenberg was an early supporter and donor), and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. His private clients included Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Chester Dale, Douglas Dillon, and Marjorie and Duncan Phillips, who through purchases from Rosenberg created much of the modern collections within The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C..\n\nIn the late 1930s, Rosenberg, alert to signs of an approaching war, began quietly moving his collection out of continental Europe to the London branch and to storage in America (via the 1939 New York World's Fair), Australia and latterly South America. He then stopped adding to his collection in France, and advised his artists to make similar arrangements. Although his relocation plans were well advanced, by the time of the 1940 Nazi invasion of France, he still held over 2,000 pieces in the country, both in his gallery and in storage. The Rosenbergs were Jewish and had to flee Nazi-occupied France. They owed their lives to the Portuguese Consul-General in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who issued them visas to his country.\n\nIn July 1940, Nazi Alfred Rosenberg established the Parisian base of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), whose purpose was to confiscate masonic artifacts and the highest-quality works of art for Hitler's planned Führermuseum in Linz, Austria. All looted art works, including Paul Rosenberg's, were initially shipped by truck to the depot created in the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume. There Nazi art historians, experts, photographers, and maintenance and administrative personnel appraised, filed, photographed and packed what were now termed \"ownerless cultural goods\" for rail transport to Germany. French officials at the end of the war estimated that one third of all art in French private hands had been confiscated.\n\nRosenberg, his wife, his daughter Micheline and her husband Joseph Robert Schwartz, all travelled via Lisbon, arriving at the Madison Hotel in New York in September 1940. There, with the help of well established friends and pieces that he had already disbursed around the world, he established a new gallery at No. 79 East 57th Street. The opening was well received by the art world, and garnered a four-page article within \"Art Digest\".\n\nFrom this base post-war, Rosenberg managed to reclaim and re-purchase a number of pieces from his pre-war collection, but these represented less than half of the works he had lost. After the end of hostilities, he personally travelled to Paris to hear the tales of the family chauffeur Louis, who told of the coming of ERR trucks not long after the family had departed. On this first trip, Rosenberg managed to regain the 1918 Picasso portrait of his wife and daughter—one of three—renamed by Göring \"Mother and Child\"—from a small museum in Paris.\n\nRosenberg later regained a number of pieces after their confiscation by the US Army. In 1953, an exhibition of 89 pieces from Rosenberg's personal and private post-war collection were displayed at MoMA. These included \"Nude Reclining by the Sea\" (1868) by Gustave Courbet, which was taken on 5 September 1941 by the ERR in a raid on Rosenberg's bank vault in Bordeaux together with another 162 of his paintings. The Courbet was catalogued at the Jeu de Paume in December 1941. It was later recovered from Göring's personal collection and repatriated to Rosenberg in New York. Rosenberg sold it in April 1953 to the New York collector Louis E. Stern, who donated it in 1964 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nAlexandre joined his father in New York in 1946 and became a partner in 1952. After the death of his father in 1959 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Alexandre became the company's principal. In 1962 Alexandre was a co-founder and first President of the Art Dealers Association of America, remaining one of the association's permanent board members throughout his life. He also served as an adviser to both the American Government and the Internal Revenue Service on matters pertaining to art works. After Alexandre's premature death in 1987 in London from an aneurysm, whilst attending the reunion of the US Army Second Armored Division, his wife Elaine took over the business. Following the death of Micheline in 2007, the family agreed to donate their grandfather's archives to MoMA, which held a supporting exhibition of the collection in 2010.\n\nBecause the Nazis banned so-called \"degenerate art\" from entering Germany, art so designated in France was looted and held in what became known as the \"Martyr's Room\" at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris. Much of Rosenberg's professional and personal collection was branded as \"degenerate art\" and thereby fell under the mandate of the Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art. Following Joseph Goebels personal directive to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the Führermuseum and the wider war effort, Hermann Göring appointed a series of ERR-approved dealers to liquidate these assets. Göring instructed them to give him the proceeds, with which he intended to grow his personal art collection. With much of this looted art sold onwards via Switzerland, Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe.\n\nToday, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large Pablo Picasso watercolor, \"Naked Woman on the Beach\", painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the \"Portrait of Gabrielle Diot\" by Degas.\nIn June 1940, via the Dunkirk evacuation, his son Alexandre Rosenberg had escaped to England. There he was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the Free French Forces. After being part of the D-Day Invasion, in August 1944 north of Paris a troop under the command of Lt. Rosenberg dynamited tracks north of Nazi train No. 40,044 and seized it, as it was attempting to transfer looted treasures to Germany. Upon his soldiers opening the train's boxcar doors, Alexandre viewed many plundered pieces of art that had once been displayed in the home of his father. The seizure saved about 400 pieces of his father's art from being lost, including many masterpieces. Alexandre was demobilized in 1946, and left immediately for his family in New York to join his father's business. The train's interception was the inspiration for the 1964 film \"The Train\", starring Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield, Jeanne Moreau and Michel Simon.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Rosenberg lost a French lawsuit that he started to recover a Matisse in the south of France, after the judge decreed the masterpiece belonged to the defendant, Rosenberg's own family kin. After the death of Paul, the family agreed under Alexandre to continue to try to recover the family art works. Consequently, in 1971 they bought back the Degas \"Deux Danseuses\" for far below its worth.\n\nIn December 1987, whilst reading at the Frick Museum in New York, Elaine Rosenberg found the painting \"Portrait of Gabrielle Diot\" by Degas listed for sale in an art magazine at the Mathias F. Hans Gallery in Hamburg. The listing included the fact that it had come to the current owner via the dealership of Paul Rosenberg. After she called the dealer and explained her connection to the looted picture, the dealer explained that under his confidentiality rules he could not disclose the current owner's name, but promised to let her know this very important piece of information. On calling a few days later, Elaine Rosenberg was told by the dealer that the \"owner\" had taken the piece from the gallery and disappeared without leaving any forwarding details.\n\nHis granddaughter is TV journalist Anne Sinclair, host of political shows and the former wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. In October 1997, Rosenberg's heirs filed suit in United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle, to recover the painting \"Odalisque\" (1927 or 1928) by Matisse from the Seattle Art Museum, the first lawsuit against an American museum concerning ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II. Then museum director Mimi Gardner Gates brokered an 11th hour settlement that returned the artwork, after which the museum sued the gallery which had sold it the painting in the 1950s. As the sole heir to her parents' estate, after the death of her mother Micheline in 2007, Sinclair sold the painting at auction, raising in excess of $33m. In the same year she also donated the 1918 Picasso painting of her grandmother and mother to the Musée Picasso in Paris.\n\nIn 2012, German tax authorities found pieces from Rosenberg's collection in an apartment rented by Cornelius Gurlitt, son of 1930s German art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, in Schwabing, Munich. Over 1,500 pieces were recovered with an estimated value of up to €1bn, including \"Portrait of a Woman\" by Matisse that Rosenberg had left behind after fleeing Paris. Gurlitt's collection was sent to a secure warehouse in Garching. Authorities are presently cataloging the works, researching their pre-war owners, and any surviving relatives.\n\nIn 2012, the Rosenberg family identified \"Profil bleu devant la cheminée\" (Woman in Blue in Front of Fireplace; 1937), a Matisse painting that was confiscated by the Nazis in 1941, in an exhibition catalogue and demanded that the Henie-Onstad Art Centre (HOK) near Oslo, Norway, return it. Rosenberg had bought the painting directly from Matisse in 1937 and had it stored at the time of the Nazi invasion in a bank vault in Libourne, a commune in the Gironde in Aquitaine, southwestern France. The ERR entered the vault in March 1941, and, after cataloging at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in September 1941, it was earmarked for Göring's private collection. Then in the hands of various dealers during the Nazi period, post-war in the late 1940s it was bought by Norwegian shipping magnate Niels Onstad from the Paris-based dealer Henri Bénézit. It has since appeared in numerous publications and toured the world on several occasions. Although under Norwegian law, due to the period of ownership, the painting now belongs to HOK, Norway was one of 44 signatories to the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. Protracted mediation, overseen by Christopher A. Marinello of the Art Recovery Group, saw the painting returned to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg in March 2014.\n\nIn May 2015, Marinello also recovered, for the Rosenberg heirs, \"Portrait of a Seated Woman\" by Henri Matisse, which had been found in the Munich home of Cornelius Gurlitt.\n\nRosenberg is played by Will Keen in the 2018 television series \"Genius\", which focuses on the life and art of Pablo Picasso.\n\n"}

However, it is important to understand the verse in context of both the Qur'an as well as the historical context when Muslims believe it was revealed. It is believed these Verses were revealed after the Battle of Uhud, in which many Muslim men were killed, leaving widows and orphans. Thus, many argue that these Verses have been revealed \"because of Allah's concern for the welfare of women and orphans who were left without husbands and fathers who died fighting for the Prophet and for Islam. It is a verse about compassion towards women and their children; it is not about men or their sexuality.\" \n\nIn the Hadith collection compiled by al-Bukhari, the historical context of Verse 4:3 is further explained when ‘Ursa narrates \n\nThe Qur’anic context can be explained by Surah 4:2, which states \"To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own. For this is indeed a great sin.\" Therefore, the first part of verse 4:3 is dealing with orphan women who are under the protection of a male guardian, and it is advising the guardian to \"deal justly\" with the orphans.\n\nIn the second part of Verse 4:3, the Qu’ran states \"but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.\" If a man cannot deal justly with more than one wife, then he must marry only one. It is clear that this quote was revealed out of compassion towards women, and not as a means to please male sexuality, which is a common modern interpretation of such verses.\n\nPutting the verses regarding polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context by examining the nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [4:21- \"And how could ye take it when ye have gone in unto each other, and they have Taken from you a solemn covenant?\"] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage is more than just a \"solemn covenant\" however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating \"And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect.\" Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that \"They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them.\"\n\nWhilst traditional Islamic scholarship upholds the notion that Islamic law permits polygyny and furthermore enforces the divine command to \"marry only one\" where the man fears being unable to fulfil the rights of all his wives in a fair manner, a substantial segment of the Islamic scholarship elaborates further on the ruling regarding men who are able to ensure complete equality amongst the multiple wives.\n\nTheir opinion was derived from performing ijtihad (independent legal reasoning) which determined their belief that it is to be deemed preferable (even for the male individual who is capable of delivering justice to the multiple families) to refrain from joining more than one wife in the marital bond.\n\nThis opinion has been codified into the official positions of the Hanbali and Shaafi’i schools of jurisprudence which assert that it is held recommended for a Muslim male to have only one wife, even if he may act equitably with more than one woman.\n\nAsh-Shirbeeni from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, said: \"It is a Sunnah not to marry more than one wife if there is no apparent need.\" [Mughni al-Muhtaj 4/207].\n\nAl-Maawardi, from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, said: \"Allaah has permitted a man to marry up to four wives, saying: {…two or three or four…}, but Allaah advised that it is desirable for man to marry only one wife, saying: {…But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one}\" [al-Hawi al-Kabir 11/417].\n\nIbn Qudaamah from the Hanbali School of jurisprudence, said in Ash-Sharh Al-Kabeer: \"It is more appropriate to marry only one wife. The author of Al-Muharrar [i.e. Abul Barakaat Al-Majd ibn Taymiyyah] said this, based on the saying of Allaah (which means) {…But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one}.\" [Ash-Sharh Al-Kabeer authored by Shams-ud-deen Ibn Qudaamah].\n\nThese scholars felt that adherence to monogamy would minimise the risk of oppression because the requirement of meting out justice amongst a plurality of wives would be immensely challenging for any man. Therefore, they opined that it is preferable to avoid polygyny altogether, so one does not even come near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives.\n\nImam Ahmed ibn Naqib al Masri, from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, said ‘’It is fitter to confine oneself to just one’’ [Umdatu Salik].\n\nImam Ghazali, from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, stated: \"It does not call for two wives, [since] plurality may render life miserable and disrupt the affairs of the home.\" [Kitab al Nikah, Ihya Uloom ud Din].\n\nImam Shaafi’i offered an additional exegesis for the final clause of the pivotal verse discussing the divine legislation of polygyny and the divine limitations imposed upon this ancient institution.\nHe espoused that the closing clause of verse 4:3, usually interpreted as ‘that is more suitable that you may not incline to injustice’ should be understood as ‘that is more suitable that you may not be financially strained by numerous children’.\n\nImam Shaafi’i reasoned that divine decree had already listed fear of committing injustice as a reason to not wed more than once, hence it was pointless for the same reason (for not wedding more than once) to be expounded twice in the same verse.\n\nHis alternative interpretation pursued the perception which held that the presence of a plurality of women in a man's conjugal life would produce undesirably large numbers of offspring, which could be a potential cause of financial hardship and poverty in the future.\n\nGiven the emphasis that Islamic law stipulates on the welfare of children and nurturing children with permitted means of income, Imam Shaafi’i opined that it was legislated for a man to marry just once as an increase in the population of a family due to multiple marriages could potentially harbour harmful monetary consequences for the man who marries more than once.\n\nAsh-Shaafi’i is of the view that it is desirable to confine oneself to marrying only one although it is permissible for him to marry more than one. This is to avoid being unfair by being more inclined to some of them than others, or being unable to financially support them. [al-Hawi al-Kabir 11/417].\n\nPrior to the emergence of Islam, the Arabian Peninsula was characterized by a wide range of marriage practices—both polygynous and polyandrous alike, as well as monogamous. As Leila Ahmed states in her work, \"Women and Gender in Islam\", \"evidence suggests that among the types of marriage practiced was matrilineal, uxorilocal marriage, found in Arabia, including Mecca, about the time of the birth of Muhammad (circa 570)--the woman remaining with her tribe, where the man could visit or reside with her, and the children belonging to the mother's tribe--as well as polyandrous and polygamous marriages.\" Thus, it is widely accepted that polygyny was not the only type of matrimony practiced during the jahiliyya (pre-Islamic era), but one part of a highly variegated and diverse pool of matrimony types.\n\nNoteworthy was the fact that it was customary for men to marry women without limit, a practice that ended with the advent of the Qur'an and its divine revelation. It was common in jahiliyya Arabia for there to be no restriction on the number of wives a man could have. Often, tribal leadership tended toward polygynous marriages with the express purpose of establishing relationships with other powerful families, effectively injecting the practice of marriage with a political purpose. Further, it is important to note that marriages in this era, including polygynous ones, were not sacramental in nature, but purely contractual. It was not until Islam, one could say, standardized marriage and therefore what it constituted, that matrimony assumed a different set of characteristics beyond those of the purely contractual.\n\nTo amplify the context within which polygyny occupies an Islamic relevance, one should look to the current debates surrounding polygyny in Islam, and more broadly, polygamy, and the implications that emerged from their contextual transition from the jahiliyya to the Islamic era. Two highly dichotomous views on the social significance of the institutionalization of polygyny by Islam are provided by Leila Ahmed and Asghar Ali Engineer, and their views differ on the question of women. How did the establishment of polygyny in Islam as the only alternative to monogamy change the social condition of women? One verse that is often cited in these arguments is that which was quoted earlier — verse 3 of Surah 4.\n\nSome, like Ali, argue that the overall condition of women who lived in the jahiliyya improved with the advent of Islam. These scholars cite a general establishment of order and protection provided by the Qur'anic verses, espousing the view that \"the position of women was ameliorated to a greater degree by the mission of Muhammad.\" Nefarious practices of infanticide-particularly that of female newborns-capricious divorces, and unlimited license of polygyny all were social phenomena eradicated by the revelation of Qur'anic verses relating to the question of polygyny. Moulavi Chiragh Ali summarizes this view, stating, \"The Qur’an gradually improved and elevated the degraded condition of women [in the jahiliyya] by curtailing, in the first place, the unlimited number of wives to four...and, in the second place, declaring it impossible to deal equitably with more than one wife even if men ‘would fain to do so,’ and thus virtually abolishing polygamy.\" Conversely, those of Ahmed's perspective would argue that with the arrival of Qur’anic law came the loss of sexual autonomy for women. In this view, jahiliyya marriage practices, including that of pre-Islamic polygyny, correlated with women's being \"active participants, even leaders, in a wide range of community activities...their autonomy and participation were curtailed with the establishment of Islam, its institution of patrilineal, patriarchal marriage as solely legitimiate, and the social transformation that ensued.\" An extended discussion of the intersection of feminism and polygyny can be found in later sections of this article; \"see\" Muslim Feminism and Polygyny.\n\nMost modern Muslims view the practice of polygyny as allowed, but unusual and not recommended. The practice of polygyny is often viewed in its historical context, as the marriage was the only way for a woman to be provided for during the time of Muhammad. Many countries today either outlaw the practice of polygyny or place restrictions on it.\n\nSeveral countries, such as Libya, allow polygyny with few or no restrictions.\n\nTurkey was the first Muslim country to legally ban polygyny in 1926. This decision was not based on religious reasons, but rather was an entirely secular ban. Tunisia was the next country to ban polygyny through legislation passed in 1956 and restated in 1964. Unlike Turkey, Tunisia banned polygyny on religious grounds, citing two main reasons. First, the Quran limited the practice of polygyny, thus it did not support the practice and clearly intended for the practice to be eliminated over time. Second, the Quran demands equal treatment of all wives in a polygynous marriage, which is impossible, thus making the practice illegal. Finally, Israel banned polygyny as well by 1978.\n\nThe following countries restrict the practice of polygyny:\n\nSome countries, including India, Iran, Iraq, Bangladesh, Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Jordan, and Kuwait, allow women to include a clause prohibiting polygyny in marriage contracts. Other countries, such as Iran and Pakistan, require that a man get permission to take a second wife from his first wife, and then show the court proof of his first wife's consent. Finally, countries such as Malaysia state that a man must get permission from both his wife and from the governmental religious authority in order to take a second.\n\nAlthough many countries have laws restricting or banning polygyny, it is still practiced illegally. It is difficult to enforce anti-polygyny laws and restrictions in countries with large rural populations. Furthermore, illegal polygyny often occurs in countries with poor social services as women rely on husbands to support them in these situations.\n\nOne way that polygyny is still legally practiced in Iran today is through the practice of \"mut'a\", a temporary contractual relationship based on the mutual consent of a man and a woman. Throughout the contracted time, the woman must remain exclusively faithful to the man, and in return he must provide for her financially. Although this practice is technically legal, it is very highly disputed.\n\nMuslim feminism is a fairly new movement, even though women's rights issues have been at the forefront of social reform for a while. \nThis began to change when Muslim women realized they could alter their roles in society by rereading the main religious texts that dictated Muslim society and ethics. This return to reinterpretation was not a new practice – male Islamic scholars had been doing it ever since Muhammad's death – but for women, it was unprecedented: this was the first time that women were learning how to read and study the Qur'an and the hadiths in an analytical way. Their new religious knowledge led them to a better understanding of their faith, as well as the ability to make educated interpretations of the texts. Many of these Islamic feminist scholars began to realize that there was no inherent tie between Islam and the patriarchal practices of Islamic society. For example, these feminists studied Muhammad's life and argued that he treated women very progressively for that era. Muhammad included all of his wives in his religious practices and respected them enough to take their advice and grievances seriously. They also even accompanied him to battle. According to Muslim feminists, Islamic polygyny was meant to curtail the practice that was already widespread in pre-Islamic times. Conquering rulers would collect massive harems of women and treat them without any respect; whereas Islam reduced the allowable amount of wives each husband could have and required that he treat them all equally. These feminists place emphasis on the idea that only those men who are capable of loving and financially providing for each wife equally are permitted to have more than one. They also point out the practice of polygyny in Islam was created for the purpose of taking care of fatherless children, or orphans. Thus, polygyny was allowable for charitable and honorable purposes. Islamic feminists point out that \"a recognition that gender inequality in the old world was assumed and that perceptions of women in Christian and Jewish texts are not that different from those of Islamic texts\" is lacking from common understandings of Islam.\n\nTwo leading feminist Muslim scholars who are seeking to increase women's rights through the reinterpretation of religious texts are Amina Wadud and Asma Barlas. Both women embrace Islam as a religion that preaches gender equality. They see societal practices, not Islam, as the main problem. Wadud points out the three reasons that the Qur'an views as acceptable forms of polygyny: if the husband is not sexually satisfied he may take another wife rather than turn to prostitutes or an affair, if the first wife is unable to reproduce or another woman with child needs to be taken care of, and/or if the husband is financially stable enough to care for another woman in the Muslim community. According to Wadud, the form of polygyny that the Qur'an supports focuses on \"justice: dealing justly, managing funds justly, justice to the orphans, and justice to the wives.\" Barlas, who published her theological research several years later, argues a very similar point. Both feminist scholars point out the origin of the Islamic theory of polygyny in Ayah 4:3. This verse of the Qur'an was not meant to utilize polygyny as a way to oppress women, but to ensure that they were taken care of.\n\nThe other form of feminism in the Islamic world is independent or state feminism. The premise behind this movement is that \"no reform is possible in an Islamic legal and political system where ‘the very structure of power is male dominated to an absolute degree, back by the Constitution, an all-male clerical system ruling the country.’\" They also point out that Islam supports and perpetuates a clear female role that designates women to the margins of society. These Muslim feminists argue that there is only so much that reinterpreting the texts can do and believe that the best – and perhaps only – way to increasing women's rights is outside of the parameters of Islam. Therefore, changing polygynist practices would involve reforming the political and legal systems instead of just trying to reinterpret the Qur’an and the hadiths to determine if they really support the practice and to what extent.\n\nFeminism's effect on polygyny in Islam is different in every Muslim society, depending on the different cultures that are interacting with Islam in each location. For example, in Iran, changes to women's rights occurred in the wake of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. During this revolution the Family Protection Law, which had given some power to women and imposed minimal restrictions on polygyny, was overturned. Muslim women were encouraged to return to their traditional roles. This loss of rights led to the movement realizing that they could not necessarily rely on the government alone to protect their rights. This spurred the creation of the personal status laws, which covered many issues relating to marriage and divorce including polygyny. Passed in 1986, the law \"effectively reinstates the provision of the 1975 Family Protection Law granting a wife the right to obtain a divorce if her husband marries a second woman without the wife's permission of if…a man does not treat his wives fairly and equally.\" This offers Iranian Muslim women some legal protection against polygyny, but the enforcement of the law is still up to the interpretation of the courts. Muslim women's movement organizations have begun to gain more power in Iran due to the increasing number of Muslim women who are studying the Qur'an analytically. These new scholars are able to argue for interpretations of Islam that empower rather than oppress women. They also lead organizations like the Association of Muslim Women and Zeynab. Many Muslim women also go jalasehs where they can openly discuss religious texts in a safe environment. So even though the revolution attempted to reinstate many patriarchal values, like unlimited polygyny, it ended up inspiring women to push for more rights and become more credible by studying religious texts.\n\nEgypt, Jordan, and Morocco also began restricting polygynous practices in Islam. Egypt's personal status laws underwent many changes between 1979 and 1985, but in the end they were very restrictive for women and reduced the limits on polygyny. This incentivized Egyptian feminists to create a new marriage contract (approved in 2000) that would give women some rights concerning divorce and what was allowable in marriage. Jordan was able to have more success in 2001 when it amended its Civil Status Law, which requires the consent of the wife before the husband marries again. This change was accompanied by a handful of other progressive decisions on women's rights in the country, greatly improving the status of women. Morocco was also pushed along by its Muslim feminist groups to make entering into a polygynous marriage more difficult.\n\nIslamic communities in Asia, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, have also experienced feminist movements which work to restrict polygynous practices. Indonesian feminists have challenged these practices through the study and reinterpretation of religious texts. Fatayat NU, a voluntary Muslim women's organization, was created in 1950 for middle-aged women who were a part of Nahdlatul Ulama, a Sunni Islam group, and wanted to have a voice. Initially experiencing membership issues due to large percentage of women who were married or uneducated, Fatayat NU began to gain power as institutions outside of Indonesia took notice of it and supported the organizations work. The women in Fatayat NU use Islam and the religious texts to justify their actions and guide their decisions, so women who have extensively studied the religion are crucial. Out of the many controversial issues that Fatayat NU takes a stand on, polygyny is one that has recently come into contention. Although polygyny in Indonesia was never very popular, some Muslim women are worried that it is starting to gain more support. Nahdlatul Ulama is one of the organizations that approves of polygyny as an Islamic practice, but Fatayat NU is taking a contradicting stance; the members believe that polygyny can only be possible if men and women are unequal, which goes against their interpretation of the Qur'an's message on gender status.\n\nIn Malaysia, polygyny has been considered a topic that is not fit to be brought up in public, but recently it has begun to enter public discourse. This change came about through the passage of a new Islamic family law, which supports polygynous practices by making them easier for men to take part in. This has created a \"debate between Islamic fundamentalists who dominate the burgeoning Islamic Affairs Department that administers Shariah law and mostly Western-educated Muslim feminists who say the department, in its overzealous interpretation of the Qur’an, has gone overboard in making new laws that discriminate against women and children.\" The campaign against this law was very popular, but the law was still passed. Muslim women's organizations in Malaysia plan to continue protesting it until it is revoked.\n\nMirza Fath Ali Akhundzade is a famous 19th century Azeri playwright who revealed his support for women's rights in his theatrical pieces. Known for his questioning of traditional Islamic beliefs, Akhundzade's plays were seen as a form of protest against ideas like arranged marriage, polygyny, and women obediently serving their husbands. Akhundzade's distaste for polygyny can be traced back to his Islamic upbringing and his mother's marriage to his father and her consequently unhappy relationship with the first wife. Thus, to Akhundzade, polygyny was \"an evil and corrupting practice that not only oppressed women but also caused eternal animosity and hatred between the wives and their children.\" Using satire as his weapon, Akhundzade attempted to impact Islamic society through plays like \"The Story of Monsieur Jourdan the Botanist and Dervish Mast Ali Shah\" (1851), \"The Story of the Vizier of the Khan of Sarab\" (1851), \"The Story of the Bear that Caught the Robber\" (1852), and \"The Story of the Attorneys at Law\" (1855). Each of these plays portrayed women in increasingly progressive ways, so that the main female character in \"The Attorneys at Law\" was complex, strong, and went against her powerful aunt and Islamic tradition to marry for love. Akhundzade's belief that polygyny reflected an unjust treatment of the first wife influenced his ultimate dismissal of Islam as a just and egalitarian religion.\n\nPolygyny has appeared in literature in many different Islamic societies. Indian Muslim literature has traditionally stood divided on its position on polygyny as a justifiable practice. Two Indian authors, Akbari Begum and Bashiruddin Ahmad, revealed in their novels a belief that polygyny is acceptable in certain circumstances; whereas Nazr Sajjad Hyder opposed this notion and completely rejected the practice in her work. \"Gudar ka Lal\" (The Ruby in Rags), written in 1907 by Akbari Begum, projected the author's beliefs on a wide range of subjects involving the treatment of Muslim women and girls, including polygyny. The story's plotline revolves around the relationships between Yusuf Raza and his two wives, Maqbool and Mehr Jabeen. Yusuf Raza remarries when he realizes that his first wife is so uneducated that she does not know how to properly take care of her children or the household. At first, Maqbool is resentful of Mehr Jabeen, but eventually she recognizes Mehr Jabeen's kind and friendly nature, and the two become friends. This happy outcome reflects Begum's belief that polygyny in Islam can be justified when marriages are seen as incompatible and could benefit from a second wife who could help around the house and thus ease tensions. Bashiruddin Ahmad's novel, \"Iqbal Dulham\" (The Bride Iqbal), also promotes the ideal polygynous relationship where the wives become friends and find vital companionship instead of competition. Published in 1908, Iqbal Dulham follows a young man, Iqbal Mirza, who marries a second wife after his first wife fails to conceive children. The initial tension between the wives is relieved when the second wife gives birth. Once Iqbal Mirza has children, his relationship with his first wife improves, and the two wives are then able to become friends. Thus, Ahmad portrays how polygyny can be used to ease the pressure on the first wife to produce children. In both stories polygyny is a solution to domestic disharmony.\n\nNazr Sajjad Hyder, however, shows her disproval of the practice of polygyny in \"Ah-e Mazluman\" (Sighs of the Oppressed), written around 1912. The two households in \"Ah-e Mazluman\", both engage in polygynous practices, but Hyder presents the relationships between husband and wives as very negatively affected; the stories \"accentuate the cruelty of husbands towards their wives and aim to intensify the exclusion and alienation experienced by the first wife.\" Hyder perceives polygyny as a practice that is harming Islam and giving it a bad reputation. She recommends its end and pleads that Muslim men act in a more just manner towards their women.\n\nThe complexity of Islamic polygyny is also revealed in Assia Djebar's \"Ombre sultane\" (Shadow sultana). Written in Algeria in 1987, it is told from the perspective of the first wife, Isma. She thus constructs through her descriptions how the reader perceives the second wife and the husband. The second wife, Hajila, is seen as a rival and is reduced through Isma's portrayals to body parts that are disassociated from Hajila as a whole person. This reveals Isma's lack of respect for Hajila and the process of \"othering\" that Isma uses to degrade Hajila. Hence, the idea that polygyny creates a sense of solidarity between wives is shown to be flawed. Isma also describes Hajila in unflattering terms that distance her from the attentions of the husband they share and of other men. This is in contrast to Isma's depiction of herself as constantly being the object of male desire, creating a sense that sisterhood between the two women is out of the question. However, Isma's diction also creates a relationship between herself and Hajila in which neither can exist without the other; \"they are locked in a sorority created, in a way, in tandem with the patriarchal force that remains a threat to their very existence.\" Therefore, Djebar's portrayal of polygyny is multifaceted and conflicting: it has the ability to create both rivalry and solidarity.\n\nPolygyny in Islam has surfaced in music around the world and across the decades. For instance, in Malaysia in the 1950s and 60s, the famous entertainer P. Ramlee dealt with many sociopolitical issues in his art. Whereas the rest of the music industry was under the outside influence of Latin America, India, and the United States, Ramlee's music was inspired by what was going on in Malaysian society. He critiqued the practice of polygyny to keep in line with his self-proclaimed role of exposing the weaknesses of his society. These socially critical songs did not necessarily fit into the categories of popular music at the time, but they were still embraced by his audiences.\n\nMuslim hip hop has also become increasingly popular, especially as Islam has spread to, and begun to establish itself in, the United States. As young Muslims grow up in the American culture, they are being exposed to ideas and beliefs that earlier generations of Muslims never came into contact with. This has led to a new wave of Muslims trying to reconcile their faith with their country's cultural practices. Out of this tension have risen new forms of Islamic creative expression, including hip hop. Two Muslim hip hop artists who bring up the concept of polygyny in their music are Miss Undastood and Sons of Hagar. \"Miss Undastood, a young veiled, African-American lyricist, raps on her CD \"Dunya or Deen\" (Life or Faith) about war, love, the challenges of being a young Muslim woman in America, and the power of faith.\" One of Miss Undastood's songs, \"Co-Wife,\" criminalizes men who practice polygyny for the wrong reasons: out of lust or when they are financially unstable. Ultimately, though, Miss Undastood believes that Islamic polygyny is justifiable. Sons of Hagar is another hip hop group that seeks to positively portray Islam in their lyrics and support Islamic practices in their actions. Their song, \"Sisterssss,\" supports polygynous practices. The members of the group rationalize that even though polygyny is illegal in America, rapping about it is much less offensive than when other artists rap about prostitutes.\n\nIslamic polygyny has also appeared as a controversial issue in films. For example, \"Ayat-ayat Cinta\" (Verses of Love) was released in Indonesia in 2008. This movie follows the life of Fahri bin Abdillah, a student in Egypt, and his relationships with four other women. The film inspired more open, public discussion on polygyny in Indonesia by calling attention to the conditions of women who enter into polygynous relationships. Another Indonesian movie that tackles the subject of polygyny is \"Berbagi Suami\" (Love for Share), which came out in 2006. The director, Nia Dinata, was inspired by her experiences in Indonesia with women who were in polygynous relationships. She acknowledges that every woman reacted in different ways to their marriage but ultimately all felt isolated and saddened by the addition of a new wife. Three stories are told within the movie and all three leading actresses learn to at least outwardly accept their situations, whether they are the first wife finding about the existence of other women or the new addition to the family who has to situate herself in the household hierarchy.\n\n\n"}

Religions with smaller numbers of followers include Islam (comprising 2% of the population), Catholicism (comprising less than 1% of the population), Evangelicalism, Hellenic Paganism, Sikhism and Hinduism. Also a small number of Greek Atheists exists, not self-identifying as religious. Religion is key part of identity for most Greeks, with 76 % of Greeks in a 2015-17 survey saying that their nationality is defined by Christianity. Statistics on metaphysics and worldview, do not concern narrowly only the hyponym religion.\n\nAs of 2015, 93% of the population of Greece were Christians.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Church, a member of the Eastern Orthodox Communion, is accorded the status of \"prevailing religion\" in Greece's constitution, and Greece is the only country in the world where an Eastern Orthodox Church is clearly recognized as a state religion.

Its members comprise between 88% and 95-98% of the population, the most recent Pew report gave a percentage of 90% as 2015 numbers.\n\nThe status of the Orthodox church as the \"prevailing religion\" is largely based on the role the church played for the preservation of the Greek nation through the years of the Ottoman Empire but also for the role the church played in the Greek War of Independence. As a result, many attribute to the modern Greek nation an ethnoreligious identity.\n\nFurthermore, the mainstream Orthodox clergy's salaries and pensions are paid for by the State at rates comparable to those of teachers. All Greek students in primary and secondary schools in Greece attend Christian Orthodox instruction, although there is an exemption system for students who do not want to attend, as long as the exemption is requested by both parents. In addition, the Constitution prohibits proselytism from other religions.\n\nCatholics made up less than 1% of the total population in 2015.\n\nIndigenous Catholic Greeks number approximately 50,000 and are found all over Greece; the majority, however, live in the Cyclades and the Ionian Islands. The presence of Catholics in the Greek islands is mostly a heritage from the time of the Venetian domination from the Middle Ages. The Catholic community has increased in size in recent years due to immigration and today number over 200,000.\n\nCatholic Greeks of the Byzantine Rite (Uniates) number approximately 6,000 nationwide and mostly live in Athens.\n\nProtestants, including Greek Evangelical Church and Free Evangelical Churches, stand at about 30,000. The Free Apostolic Church of the Pentecost was founded by Dr. Leonidas Feggos in 1965. The official church, Eastern Orthodox, and the State reluctantly gave permission for Pentecostal churches to operate legally. The process of receiving permission from the Ministry of Education and Religion to operate as a church is becoming easier. Assemblies of God, the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and other Pentecostal churches of the Greek Synod of Apostolic Church have 12,000 members. The Independent Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost is the biggest Protestant denomination in Greece with 120 churches. There are no official statistics about Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost, but the Orthodox Church estimates the followers at 20,000.\n\nThe presence of Armenians in Greece dates back centuries (from the Byzantine period), when Armenians settled in Thessalia, Macedonia, Thrace and the islands of Crete and Corfu for various reasons such as war or business.\n\nThe Armenians in Greece acquired the character of a community after the 1920s, when 70,000 to 80,000 survivors of the Armenian Genocide fled to Greece. Today, emigration to North America has diminished the Armenian population of Greece. The number now counts for roughly 20,000-35,000 Greco-Armenians.\n\nSome thousands people are members of the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes, the foremost organisation of Hellenic ethnic religion. Over 100,000 people are \"sympathisers\". On 9 April 2017 the Hellenic ethnic religion was officially recognized by the Greek state.\n\nThe Jewish community in Greece currently amounts to roughly 7,500 people, concentrated mainly in Athens, Thessaloniki, Larissa, Volos, Chalkis, Ioannina, Trikala and Corfu, while very few remain in Kavala and Rhodes. It is composed largely of two groups, the Romaniotes, Jewish communities dating back to Antiquity, and the Ladino-speaking Sephardim, who arrived from Spain and settled chiefly in Thessaloniki during Ottoman times.\n\nThe number of Greek citizens followers of Islam is estimated to be at 97,604 people or 0.95% of the total population, according to the 1991 census. They live mostly in Western Thrace and are turkish, slavonic (Pomaks) and romani (Gypsies) speakers. Immigrant Muslims are estimated between 200,000-300,000. In 2015, Islam was the religion of 2% of the total population of Greece.\n\nSikhs have been in Greece since the World Wars, as part of the British Indian Army. Guru Nanak is also known to have passed through Greece during one of his journeys. However, actual immigration to Greece began in the 1970s. It reached its peak during the 1990s-2000s. As of 2017, Sikhs are estimated to number 20,000-25,000. There are eight Gurudwaras in Greece, most of them based in Central Greece and only one being in Crete. Gurudwaras are often officially documented as personal properties, community centres or libraries, due to the paperwork needed and also due to the lack of recognition of Sikhs by the Greek Government. Sikhs often face racism and discrimination by the Greek public, who confuse them with Muslims, as well as legal challenges, mostly due to the distinct appearance (The Five Ks). Sikhs are not allowed to wear their turbans and ride motorcycles without helmets, as in Britain, where their contributions in the war efforts were recognized and they were allowed to not wear helmets. Young Sikhs often face difficulties when recruited for the mandatory conscription, due to their long hair, beard and turbans. Sikhism is still not an officially recognized in Greece and Sikhs are often not included in censuses. Media coverage of Sikhs is minimal and their religion is often reported as \"a mix of Hinduism and Islam\", while it has a separate belief system and many differences. Sikh Gurudwaras have faced numerous attacks, including gunshots and molotov cocktails, all of which received no media coverage. On March 1, 2006, the Greek government passed a law allowing cremation, a move welcomed by both Sikhs and Hindus. Since the 2008 economic crisis many Sikhs have migrated to other countries, many of whom being Britain, Canada, and Germany\n\nThe number of the followers is not so high amongst the Greeks but it has increased during the last decades because of the immigration of people from East Asia, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia in Greece. Sri Lankan and Southeast Asian migrant workers working in Greece were usually sent back to their home country to be cremated, due to cremation being banned in Greece until 2006. Today there are three religious centers, in Athens, Thessaloniki and Corinth.\n\nHinduism in Greece has a small following. There is a small Hindu community in Athens. There are 25 PIOs and 12 NRIs in the city. On March 1, 2006, the Greek government passed a law allowing cremation. The law was welcomed by the Indian community in Athens.\n\nOther minor faiths in Greece include Jehovah's Witnesses (who number about 28,000), Seventh-day Adventists, Mormons and Scientologists. Groups that constitute less than 1 percent of the population includes Baha'is.\n\n\n"}

He was baptized as a Witness in 1944 and soon began to work as a door-to-door missionary for the Witnesses, first in Montreal and then in Quebec City. At the time, police harassment of Witnesses was widespread in Quebec, and Mr. Saumur had been arrested 103 times for distribution of Witness literature when he decided to challenge the legal basis for the arrests.\n\nA group of Jehovah's Witnesses, along with Saumur, challenged a Quebec City municipal by-law that prohibited the distribution of literature in the street without the proper authorization of the city's Chief of Police on the basis that it was outside of the municipality's jurisdiction and that it had the effect of religious and political censorship. The case reached the Supreme Court in 1953.\n\nIn a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that the subject matter of the law was in relation to \"speech\" or \"religion\" which were both in the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government. The majority noted that the law had the effect that the chief of police would act in the role of a censor, deciding whether certain literature was objectionable. The result, they observed, would be that unpopular groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses would be censored.\n\nThe dissent focused on the purpose of the law, observing that it was intended to protect the public and keep the streets clean. They found no basis for Saumur's claim that it prevented the Jehovah's Witnesses from their religious practice.\n\nThis decision was subsequently used to dismiss more than 1000 cases against Witnesses in the Province of Quebec. It was one of a series of cases the Supreme Court dealt with concerning the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses under the Duplessis government of Quebec. Previous to this there was the case of \"R. v. Boucher\" [1951] S.C.R. 265 according to which mere criticism of the government does not constitute seditious libel. Subsequent to \"Saumur\" was the case of \"Roncarelli v. Duplessis\" [1959] S.C.R. 121 which punished Duplessis for revoking a Jehovah's Witness liquor license.\n\n"}

The motherhouse is located in Saint-Michel-en-Brenne, France, with additional houses in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the United States. As of 2018, the current Superior General is Mother Maria Jean Bréant.\n\nThe Society of Sisters was guided in its initial formation by Archbishop Lefebvre, who was formerly Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, and his sister, Mother Marie Gabriel. For more than forty years, Mother Marie Gabriel had devoted herself to missionary work in Martinique, the West Indies and Africa, in the Congregation of the Holy Ghost Sisters. She had spent much time on the African continent.\n\nIn October, 1973, the first postulant for this new religious congregation, Janine Ward, arrived at Ecône from Australia.\n\nIn 1974, while recovering from an illness in Europe, Mother Marie Gabriel had a religious vision which was to point her in another direction. The signs became clearer: the crisis in the Church, the continual loss of faith and religious spirit in her own congregation, her weakened health, her brother's insistent appeal for aid in transmitting the religious life, all contributed to her decision to guide the fledgling congregation of the Sisters of the Society.\n\nThe first novitiate was installed in Albano, near Rome. There Janine's postulancy continued under Mother Marie Gabriel's guidance until her reception of the habit on September 22, 1974, the true founding of the new religious institute. Two years later, September 29, 1976, the first profession was held. The congregation counted twelve novices and eight postulants in the chapel during this ceremony.\n\nIn May, 1984, Sister Mary Jude, an American sister who spent almost two years at St. Mary's College in Kansas (from 1981 to 1983), became the new Superior General of the Sisters. There were thirty-four professed sisters in eight houses and four different countries at this time.\n\nThe third Superior was Mother Marie-Augustin de Poulpiquet, who from 2006–2018 had been the head of the sisterhood for two terms of office.\n\nOn Monday, April 9, 2018, the capitulars elected Sister Maria Jean Bréant, the former mistress of novices of the Order, the fourth Superior General. Her term of office is six years. Thus far, Sr. Maria Jean worked at the novitiate Notre-Dame de Compassion in Ruffec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work is a \"340-page religious rhapsody\" written in the style of the King James Bible. A work of Spiritualism, the work claims Linton merely served as medium, creating the book by automatic writing. The book features an endorsement by Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, formerly a U.S. Senator from New York and a governor of the Wisconsin Territory.\n\nCharles Linton had worked as a blacksmith, a clerk in Philadelphia, and later, a bookkeeper. He became a \"writing medium\", creating writings purportedly by Daniel Webster and William Shakespeare.\nThe work was published by The Society for the Diffusion of Spiritual Knowledge, an American spiritualist group that had been organized in 1844 by Tallmadge and others.\n\nThe main text is written by Charles Linton in the style of the King James Bible. Beginning with the second edition, \"The Healing of the Nations\" includes an introduction and appendix by Gov. Tallmadge.\n\nThe text is formatted into chapter and verse, in fitting with its emulation of the King James Bible. The text begins:\n1. God the Father reigneth. His are the heavens and the earth. His is space, and its nnmberless inhabitants are but fruits of his will. 2. All his creation enjoyeth each one its own perfected \nhappiness. 3. He giveth joy unto all ; for he being the center of goodness, his effects are purely happy. \nTallmadge gives a biographical sketch of Charles Linton, and then describes personal witness to the work's creation:\n\nA large portion of the book has been written in my presence. I have, therefore, had the very best opportunity of judging of the manner of the writer. During the time I was with liim ho wrote from five to ten pages a day. He wrote rapidly whilst the influence was on him, and when it left he would cease writing, and generally not resume it till the next day.

As soon as the conversation ceased he would go on and finish the sentence without a moment's hesitation.\n\nAuthor David Linton listed \"The Healing of Nations\" as among the four most important books on religious subjects, observing: \"The fact that an un-learned farmer's boy of Pennsylvania should have written so wonderful a book as the 'Healing of the Nations' is to me one of the most wonderful facts of this wonderful age.\" English researcher Frank Podmore opined that \"The Healing of Nations\" \"represents inspirational writing at its best\".\n\n"}

She was born into a large family with little income. She was a member of the Third Order of St. Francis.\n\nOn 10 March 1918, Therese Neumann was partially paralyzed after falling off a stool while attending to a fire in her uncle's barn. She sustained more falls and injuries during this period. After one particular fall she claimed to have lost much of her eyesight, and in 1919 she claimed to have been blinded completely. Bedridden, she reportedly developed horrible bed sores that sometimes exposed bone.\n\nTherese reported that her eyesight was restored on 29 April 1923—the day Therese of Lisieux was beatified in Rome. Therese Neumann had been praying novenas in advance of this day. On 17 May 1925 Therese of Lisieux was fully canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church. Therese Neumann said the saint called to her and then cured her of her paralysis and bed sores.\n\nOn 7 November 1925 Neumann took to her bed again, and on 13 November claimed to have been diagnosed with appendicitis. According to her account, while prepared for surgery she convulsed violently and stared at the ceiling finally saying, \"Yes.\" She asked her family to take her to the church to pray immediately. She then announced that she had been cured of all traces of appendicitis.\n\nPhysicians and skeptics have disputed Neumann's claims of miraculous cures. According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell on one occasion Neumann claimed to have healed herself from blindness, but whilst \"blind\" she was examined and her pupils responded normally to light. Nickell suspected that Neumann's claims were performed by \"hysterical hypochondria\" or \"outright fakery\".\n\nTherese would later apparently develop the stigmata. She said that on 5 March 1926, the first Friday of Lent, a wound had appeared slightly above her heart, but that she had kept this secret. However, she did report a vision of Jesus at Mount of Olives with three Apostles.\n\nOn 12 March, she said she had another vision of Christ at Mt. Olivet, along with the crowning of thorns. She also claimed that the wound above her heart reappeared on this day, and she spoke to her sister about it. She claimed the wound also reappeared on Friday of the following week. By 26 March, she was claiming the same wound accompanied by a vision of Christ bearing the cross and a similar wound on her left hand. Blood was observed on her clothing, and she no longer attempted to keep the information to herself.\n\nOn Good Friday, Neumann, according to her own testimony witnessed the entire Passion of Christ in her visions. She displayed wounds on her hands and feet accompanied by blood apparently coming from her eyes. Blood poured from the wounds, however - according to Josef Hanauer's book \"The Swindle of Konnersreuth\" - onlookers did not actually see the bleeding in action, only the blood itself.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, she claimed a vision of the resurrection of Christ. For several consecutive Fridays after that, she stated she was experiencing the Passion of Christ, apparently suffering in her own body along with all his historic agonies. She claimed to have especially suffered the Passion on Good Friday each year.\n\nOn 22–23 March 1928 Neumann's stigmata claims were investigated at her home by a group of observers including bishops and physicians. Professor Martini the director of the University Hospital Bonn observed Neumann and wrote a report about her stigmata. He found her behaviour suspicious as the blood would only appear from her wounds when he was asked to leave the room. According to Martini:\n\n\"The fact that two or three times the observers were made to go out just at the moment when a fresh effusion of blood evidently came to cover the wounds arouses the suspicion, on the contrary, that during this time something happened which needed to be hidden from observation. It was for the same reason that I disliked her frequent manipulations behind the raised coverings.\"\n\nA psychoanalytic study of Neumann has suggested that her stigmata resulted from post-traumatic stress symptoms expressed in unconscious self-mutilation through abnormal autosuggestibility.\n\nFrom 1923 until her death in 1962, Therese Neumann professed to have consumed no food other than The Holy Eucharist, nor to have drunk any water from 1926 until her death.\n\nMontague Summers in his book \"The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism\" speaks of her supposedly supernatural ability to survive for long periods without food or water.\n\nIn July 1927, Neumann's claims of inedia were examined at her house. She was physically examined and tested by the physician Otto Seidl and four Franciscan nurses, for fifteen days (July 14 to 28). Neumann was not observed to have eaten anything, however, suspicion was generated. At the beginning she had weighed 121 pounds which dropped during the test period to 112.5 pounds. By the last day her weight had returned to normal. Historian Ian Wilson commented the evidence indicated that Neumann \"went back to normal food and drink intake\". The test was never repeated and her family denied permission for any further tests.\n\nWilson found the inedia claims of Neumann suspicious. He noted that she \"had a vigorous, stocky build throughout most of this time, and all reason tells us that it would be impossible to survive so long without food or drink.\"\n\nOtto Seidl who wrote a report in 1928, described Neumann as a hysteric. A recent medical paper that examined Seidl's report commented that \"while under surveillance by four nuns for 14 days, Neumann exhibited no intake of nourishment; weight measurements and urine tests however suggest[ed] the opposite... As far as medical records go, Therese Neumann's is one of a series of surprisingly similar cases of stigmata development, conversion disorder, and alleged absence of nutrition. In nosological terms, these would be classified today as dissociative disorders.\"\n\nPsychologist Donovan Rawcliffe disputed Neumann's inedia claims and suggested she was a \"deliberate fraud aided and abetted by her father.\"\n\nIt was claimed that during some of her Friday trances, she would utter phrases identified by witnesses as ancient Aramaic. She was also said to have been able to understand Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.\n\nDuring the Third Reich, Therese Neumann was the target of ridicule and defamation, as the Nazis knew about her dissenting views and feared her growing popularity. She was observed by the Gestapo. She was never physically harmed, though her family home, parish church and priest's house all received direct attacks. She encouraged Fritz Gerlich to continue his opposition to Hitler and his national-socialist party. Gerlich was subsequently killed for his opposition.\n\nParamahansa Yogananda visited her and wrote about her case in his book \"Autobiography of a Yogi\", published in 1946. He wrote an entire chapter, , which reverently gives a vivid first-hand description of one of her Friday Passion trances.\n\nReinhard Lorenz from Meißen (R.L.M.), a medium from the New Salems Society, received a message about Neumann in 1929, allegedly coming from God the Father. It was published in \"Das Wort\", the periodical of the movement.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, Therese Neumann died from cardiac arrest, after having suffered from angina pectoris for some time.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has neither confirmed nor denied the inedia (from which she suffered according to her critics), nor her stigmata. The \"Resl\", as she is colloquially known, nonetheless attained a place in popular piety — a petition asking for her beatification was signed by 40,000 people. In 2005, Gerhard Ludwig Müller, Bishop of Regensburg, formally opened the Vatican proceedings for her beatification.\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n"}
