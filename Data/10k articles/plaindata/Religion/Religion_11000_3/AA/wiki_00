They should also pray for those who live in hate and discord, so that with divine assistance better and more peaceful times may descend over Hungary.\n\nThe Pope is alarmed over the jailing and torturing of Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty, a violation of human rights and dignity, and an affront against religion itself. Not only the Catholics in Hungary, decent people all over he world watch in horror. The Cardinal stood up for the freedom of the Church and the Hungarian people, and therefore all accusations are highly honourable. The Pope takes part in the continued suffering of the Hungarian bishops. Freedom is so important, that it may be necessary to sacrifice one's life.\n\nThe Pope is quite aware of the great tribulations and sufferings, which the Church has to endure in Hungary. But he is also aware of the great loyalty and strength of its bishops, who are asked to combine courage with wisdom in this situation. He appeals to them to be united. He reminds them, that their forefathers overcame similar problems. They knew that the Christian faith can be maligned and attacked, but never defeated. He appeals to them, to follow their examples. They will find the most wonderful consolation and help; the consolation to work for the peace and kingdom of Christ. His kingdom is not of this world, because of the mandate, to change behaviour and life, in order to reach through this earthly misery the heavenly kingdom. The Pope concludes his letter with the most cordial Apostolic Blessings to his brother bishops and their faithful, especially all those who are persecuted.\n\n"}

Its practitioners are called \"Midew\" and the practices of \"Midewiwin\" referred to as the \"Mide\". The \"Midewiwin\" society is a secretive animistic religion, requiring an initiation, and then progressing to four levels of practitioners, called \"degrees\". Occasionally, male \"Midew\" are called \"Midewinini\", which sometimes is very loosely translated into English as \"medicine man\".\n\nThe Waabanowin (also spelled Wabuowin, Wabunohwin and Wabunohiwin) is the Dawn Society, also sometime improperly called the \"Magical Dawn Society\". Its practitioners are called \"Waabanow\" and the practices of \"Waabanowin\" referred to as the \"Waabano\". The \"Wabanowin\" are distinct society of visionaries. Like the \"Midewiwin\", the \"Waabanowin\" is a secretive animistic religion, requiring an initiation. But unlike the \"Mide\", the \"Waabano\" have sometimes two levels and sometimes four. This variation being dependent on the particular lodge. They were systematically imprisoned in mental hospitals by the United States government in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Because of this persecution the \"Waabanowin\" went underground and have just begun to reemerge since the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. The ceremonies and traditions are closely guarded.\n\nThe Jiisakiiwin are also known as the Shaking Tent or the Juggler's Tent. Among the Anishinaabeg, a particularly powerful and well-respected spiritual leader who had trained from childhood is called a \"Jaasakiid\" or \"Jiisakiiwinini\", also known as a \"Juggler\" or \"Shaking-tent Seer.\" In the past they were hunted down and murdered by both Canadian and United States officials. \n\nAccording to the oral history of the Anishinaabeg, they originally lived on the shores of the \"Great Salt Water\" (presumably the Atlantic Ocean near the Gulf of St. Lawrence). They were instructed by seven prophets to follow a sacred \"miigis\" shell (whiteshell) toward the west, until they reached a place where food grew upon the water. They began their migration some time around 950, stopping at various points several times along the way, most significantly at \"Baawitigong\", Sault Ste. Marie, where they stayed for a long time, and where two subgroups decided to stay (these became the Potawatomi and Ottawa). Eventually, after a trick by two of the clans, the other clans travelled West (see William Warren's account of this incident) and arrived at the wild ricing lands of Minnesota and Wisconsin (wild rice being the food that grew upon the water) and made \"Mooningwanekaaning minis\" (Madeline Island: \"Island of the yellow-shafted flicker\") their new capital. In total, the migration took around five centuries.\n\nFollowing the migration there was a cultural divergence separating the Potawatomi from the Ojibway and Ottawa. Particularly, the Potawatomi did not adopt the agricultural innovations discovered or adopted by the Ojibway, such as the Three Sisters crop complex, copper tools, conjugal collaborative farming, and the use of canoes in rice harvest. \n\nNanabozho (also known by a variety of other names and spellings, including \"Wenabozho\", \"Menabozho\", and \"Nanabush\") is a trickster figure and culture hero who features as the protagonist of a cycle of stories that serve as the Anishinaabe origin belief. The cycle, which varies somewhat from community to community, tells the story of Nanabozho's conception, birth, and his ensuing adventures, which involve interactions with spirit and animal beings, the creation of the Earth, and the establishment of the Midewiwin. The myth cycle explains the origin of several traditions, including mourning customs, beliefs about the afterlife, and the creation of the sacred plant \"asemaa\" (tobacco).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Buddhism encourages independence through non attachment. Non attachment is the idea that in order to be fulfilled and happy in life, a person cannot be attached to any one thing because this thing can cause suffering. In order to be happy and to follow the path of enlightenment, Buddhism teaches people to discard all things in life that can cause pain. This idea is not referring to worldly objects in the physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. To achieve non attachment, one must detach from the idea of a perfect person and holding one’s partner to an impossible standard. Instead, one must accept a partner for who they are unconditionally. In Buddhism, this is the key to a happy romantic relationship. Accepting a partner for who they are, for who they are throughout their life no matter what changes, and making the best of every situation is how one achieves personal fulfillment in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe idea of unconditional love is essentially what Buddhism teaches. Marriage is a social construct that has changed vastly throughout the course of history. People married for a variety of reasons including: status, wealth, power and love. Buddhist text do not delve too deeply into the idea of marriage because Buddhism leaves the decision to marry up to each individual person. In Buddhism, marriage is not a religious obligation, a means for procreation, or a romantic notion of love. It is simply an option for each individual to make. If an individual believes marriage will bring them happiness and keep them on the path of enlightenment, then they are free to make that choice. Buddhism does not provide rules or traditions about marriage; instead, the religion offers advice to help a person live happily while they are married. This advice is thought to help give people the best chance at a happy relationship. Buddhist texts do make it clear that men should be limited to one wife. A major belief in Buddhism in regards to marriage is that one should not stray from their wife and family. In Buddhist text, it is clear that The Buddha thought that the biggest hurdle of man is their weakness to other women. He saw the weakness and trouble that other women brought to a family and advised against it. Instead of a religious obligation, marriage is seen as an individual choice. Buddhism allows for each person to make the decision of whether or not they want to be married, how many children they want to have, and who they want to marry.\n\nThe way Buddhists view divorce is very interesting. The religion does not prohibit it, but, the idea of living the Buddhist lifestyle would suggest that one not need to divorce. If a person is living by the ideals of Buddhism and accepting someone for who they are and following the path of enlightenment, it stands to argument that they would never need a divorce because they would be fulfilled with their marriage and their partner. It is also stated that separation is preferable to being miserable for a prolonged period of time. The religion prefers that a couple separate rather than live together and be counterproductive to personal fulfillment and enlightenment. Buddhism also made it clear that to prevent divorce; older men should not have younger wives. The claim was that the age difference would make them incompatible and cause problems leading to divorce. Overall, Buddhism says that any person is free to divorce, especially if it is hindering their path to personal fulfillment. However, it makes the important distinction that living a Buddhist lifestyle would mean creating a happy and strong relationship that would not end in divorce.\n\n"}

{"id": "8756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8756", "title": "Daniel Dennett", "text": "Daniel Dennett\n\nDaniel Clement Dennett III (born March 28, 1942) is an American philosopher, writer, and cognitive scientist whose research centers on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and philosophy of biology, particularly as those fields relate to evolutionary biology and cognitive science.\n\nAs of 2017, he is the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies and the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University. Dennett is an atheist and secularist, a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board, and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, as well as an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. Dennett is referred to as one of the \"Four Horsemen of New Atheism\", along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens.\n\nDennett is a member of the editorial board for \"The Rutherford Journal\".\n\nDennett was born on March 28, 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth Marjorie (née Leck) and Daniel Clement Dennett, Jr. Dennett spent part of his childhood in Lebanon, where, during World War II, his father was a covert counter-intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services posing as a cultural attaché to the American Embassy in Beirut. When he was five, his mother took him back to Massachusetts after his father died in an unexplained plane crash. Dennett's sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett. Dennett says that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending summer camp at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, \"You know what you are, Daniel? You're a philosopher.\"\n\nDennett graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1959, and spent one year at Wesleyan University before receiving his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Harvard University in 1963. At Harvard University he was a student of W. V. Quine. In 1965, he received his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he studied under Gilbert Ryle and was a member of Hertford College. His dissertation was entitled \"The Mind and the Brain: Introspective Description in the Light of Neurological Findings; Intentionality\".\nDennett describes himself as \"an autodidact—or, more properly, the beneficiary of hundreds of hours of informal tutorials on all the fields that interest me, from some of the world's leading scientists\".\n\nHe is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.\n\nIn February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.\n\nIn 2012, he was awarded the Erasmus Prize, an annual award for a person who has made an exceptional contribution to European culture, society or social science, \"for his ability to translate the cultural significance of science and technology to a broad audience.\"\n\nIn 2018, he was awarded an Honorary Degree by Radboud University, located in Nijmegen, Netherlands for his contributions to and influence on cross-disciplinary science.\n\nWhile he is a confirmed compatibilist on free will, in \"On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want\"—Chapter 15 of his 1978 book \"Brainstorms\", Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to libertarian views.\n\nWhile other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including William James, Henri Poincaré, Arthur Holly Compton, and Henry Margenau, Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:\n\nLeading libertarian philosophers such as Robert Kane have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, character and values, and feelings and desires. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:\n\nDennett has remarked in several places (such as \"Self-portrait\", in \"Brainchildren\") that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in empirical research. In his original dissertation, \"Content and Consciousness\", he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as \"Content and Consciousness\" has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided \"Brainstorms\" into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in \"The Intentional Stance\" and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in \"Consciousness Explained\". These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.\n\nIn chapter 5 of \"Consciousness Explained\" Dennett describes his multiple drafts model of consciousness. He states that, \"all varieties of perception—indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity—are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'\" (p. 111). Later he asserts, \"These yield, over the course of time, something \"rather like\" a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...\" (p. 135, emphasis in the original).\n\nIn this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as Neural Darwinism. He also presents an argument against qualia; he argues that the concept is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of physicalism. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.\n\nDennett self-identifies with a few terms: \"[Others] note that my 'avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters' often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors.\"\n\nIn \"Consciousness Explained\", he affirms \"I am a sort of 'teleofunctionalist', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist'\". He goes on to say, \"I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of verificationist\".\n\nMuch of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (\"Kinds of Minds\"), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (\"Freedom Evolves\").\n\nDennett sees evolution by natural selection as an algorithmic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as long division often incorporate a significant degree of randomness). This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who preferred to stress the \"pluralism\" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).\n\nDennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly adaptationist, in line with his theory of the intentional stance, and the evolutionary views of biologist Richard Dawkins. In \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould. This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology and its descendant evolutionary psychology, which Gould and Richard Lewontin opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and Steven Pinker. Strong disagreements have been launched against Dennett from Gould and his supporters, who allege that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould's to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett's \"Darwinian fundamentalism\".\n\nDennett's theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller.\n\nIn \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Dennett writes that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejects the idea of the naturalistic fallacy as the idea that ethics is in some free-floating realm, writing that the fallacy is to rush from facts to values.\n\nIn his 2006 book, \"\", Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.\nIn this book he declares himself to be \"a bright\", and defends the term.\n\nHe has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a \"Don't ask, don't tell\" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, \"Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind\".\n\nHe has also written about and advocated the notion of memetics as a philosophically useful tool, most recently in his \"Brains, Computers, and Minds\", a three-part presentation through Harvard's MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.\n\nDennett has been critical of postmodernism, having said: Postmodernism, the school of \"thought\" that proclaimed \"There are no truths, only interpretations\" has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for \"conversations\" in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.\n\nDennett adopted and somewhat redefined the term \"deepity\", originally coined by Miriam Weizenbaum (daughter of computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum). Dennett used \"deepity\" for a statement that is apparently profound, but is actually trivial on one level and meaningless on another. Generally, a deepity has two (or more) meanings: one that is true but trivial, and another that sounds profound and would be important if true, but is actually false or meaningless. Examples are \"Que sera sera!\", \"Beauty is only skin deep!\", \"The power of intention can transform your life.\" The term many times.\n\nWhile approving of the increase in efficiency that humans reap by using resources such as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett sees a danger in machines performing an ever-increasing proportion of basic tasks in perception, memory, and algorithmic computation because people may tend to anthropomorphize such systems and attribute intellectual powers to them that they do not possess. He believes the relevant danger from AI is that people will misunderstand the nature of basically \"parasitic\" AI systems, rather than employing them constructively to challenge and develop the human user's powers of comprehension.\n\nAs given in his most recent book, \"From Bacteria to Bach and Back\", Dennett's views stand in contradistinction to those of Nick Bostrom. Although acknowledging that it is \"possible in principle\" to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency, Dennett maintains that the difficulties of any such \"strong AI\" project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized. According to Dennett, the prospect of superintelligence (AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains) is at least 50 years away, and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.\n\nDennett married Susan Bell in 1962. They live in North Andover, Massachusetts, and have a daughter, a son, and five grandchildren.\n\nDennett is an avid sailor.\n\n\n"}

It stands on the West bank of the Nile at Luxor, 1 km from Malkata and about 4 km south of Medinet Habu. \n\nToday all that remains of the temple is its small main building and ruins of the propylon, along with its brick enclosure wall and the well. The temple precinct had an area of 74×51 metres; the temple itself is much smaller, with an area of 13×16 m. Its entrance faces south. The outer walls do not have much decoration but on the inside the reliefs are well preserved. The shrine is surrounded by a corridor from which side chapels and a \"wabet\" (place of cleansing) open; also the stairs lead to the roof from this corridor. On the southern side of the outer wall some stone blocks from earlier buildings had been reused, judging from the reliefs on them most of them appear to be from Medinet Habu.\n\nThe propylon is located 60 meters east from the temple, and is lavishly decorated on all sides.\n\nThe importance of the Isis temple of Deir el-Shelwit is because Graeco-Roman era religious buildings are rare in this area, and this is the only one not associated with the Theban Triad but with Isis.\n\nAccording to inscriptions on the propylon, construction of the Isis temple started around the beginning of 1st century CE. No earlier building is known to have stood on this site. According to one theory the temple's construction started under the reign of Nectanebo II and reached its finished form during the Greek-Roman era.\n\nThe temple was first examined by Karl Richard Lepsius in the mid-19th century, but he did not make a detailed description of it. A French expedition led by Christiane Zivie studied the inscriptions on the propylon and published their studies in 1992. Between 1971 and 1979 archaeologists from the Waseda University of Japan worked on the site, they cleared the enclosure wall and the enclosed precinct from debris and excavated the temple's well which was filled with pottery shreds. Thirty-two strata of fillings were detected in the well, up to the point of 4 meters under ground level, where water made further excavation impossible. Remains found in the well prove that the well (and the temple itself) was already abandoned and used as a trash deposit by the Coptic era.\n\nThe reliefs of the temple are dated to the Greek-Roman era and are similar to the ones in Dendera and Philae. On the walls of the temple and the pylon the cartouches of Hadrianus, Antoninus Pius, Galba, Otho, Vespasianus and Julius Caesar can be seen. On the reused blocks built into the outer walls of the temple reliefs stylistically dated to the New Kingdom can be seen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31104427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31104427", "title": "Early life of L. Ron Hubbard", "text": "Early life of L. Ron Hubbard\n\nL. Ron Hubbard was the inventor of Dianetics and founder of Scientology. Born in Tilden, Nebraska in March 1911, Hubbard grew up with his family in Helena, Montana. He was unusually well-traveled for a young man of his time due to his father's frequent relocations in connection with his service in the United States Navy. He lived in a number of locations in the United States and traveled to Guam, the Philippines, China, and Japan. He enrolled at George Washington University in 1930 to study civil engineering, but dropped out in his second year. While at GWU, he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for fellow students which looms large in his official biography but was a flop according to contemporary accounts. He subsequently spent time in Puerto Rico panning for gold, before returning to the United States, marrying his pregnant girlfriend, and embarking on a career as a \"penny-a-word\" writer.\n\nThe Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic terms and draws on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy. The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that many aspects of the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of Jesus. Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church. According to James R. Lewis and Olav Hammer, in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal implies the construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two essential things, Hubbard’s individuality and texts written by him.\n\nLafayette Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska. He was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a former United States Navy sailor who worked as a newspaper employee at the time of his son's birth, and Ledora May Waterbury, a housewife who had originally trained as a teacher. L. Ron was named after his maternal grandfather, Lafayette \"Lafe\" O. Waterbury. After moving to Kalispell, Montana, the family settled in 1913 in the state capital, Helena. Hubbard's father worked as a manager and bookkeeper, first for a local theater and later for a coal company owned by his father-in-law. The elder Hubbard re-enlisted in the Navy when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, while his mother Ledora May worked as a clerk for the state government.\n\nSome early Scientology biographies present a fictitious family heritage for Hubbard. According to an account published in the Church of Scientology's \"Ability\" magazine in 1959, Hubbard was \"descended from Count de Loup who entered England with the Norman invasion and became the founder of the English de Wolfe family which emigrated to America in the 17th century. On his father's side, from the English Hubbards, who came to America in the 19th century.\" The story went that Count de Loup (or de Loupe) was a French courtier who saved the King of France from an attack by a wolf; the grateful monarch bestowed the title of Count de Loupe, which was eventually anglicized to \"De Wolf\", the name of Hubbard's maternal grandfather. No records exist to substantiate this story. Harry Ross Hubbard was an orphan, born Henry August Wilson in August 1886, who had been adopted by an Iowa farming couple by the name of Hubbard. The couple changed his given names to Harry Ross.\n\nA biographical profile published by the Church of Scientology in 1973 states that the young Hubbard \"spent many of his childhood years on a large cattle ranch in Montana\" that was owned by his wealthy grandfather, Lafe Waterbury. According to Church accounts, Hubbard passed long days on the ranch \"riding, breaking broncos, hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer.\" Another Church biography describes his grandfather as a \"wealthy Western cattleman\" from whom Hubbard \"inherited his fortune and family interests in America, Southern Africa, etc.\"\n\nContemporary records and Hubbard's relatives contradict this depiction. Hubbard's grandfather, Lafe Waterbury, briefly owned a plot of land covering 320 acres (0.5 mi) near Kalispell, where he pastured horses and worked as a veterinarian. A local city directory for 1913 stated Waterbury's assets as a relatively modest $1,550. The Hubbards and Waterburys lived in a pair of townhouses, not a ranch, in the center of Helena, only two blocks from each other and not far from the Montana State Capitol. They also owned a small plot outside the city. Hubbard's aunt told the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 1990 that the family did not have a ranch, \"just several acres (with) a barn on it. ... We had one cow (and) four or five horses.\"\n\nBiographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology depict Hubbard as a child prodigy. He is portrayed as riding a horse before he was able to walk and able to read and write by the time he was four. According to a Scientology account, the young Hubbard lived in the rugged West, \"[r]iding horses at the age of three and a half\" and facing dangers such as \"escaping a pack of coyotes astride his mare named Nancy Hanks.\" He was said to have \"considered until he was 10 years old that the handling of a rifle or hunting coyotes or trying to break broncos was more useful than school knowledge\", and \"[a]ttempts to send him to school were seldom availing.\"\n\nAccording to the Church publication \"What is Scientology?\", Hubbard was \"reading and writing at an early age, and soon satisfying his insatiable curiosity with the works of Shakespeare, the Greek philosophers, and other classics.\" His mother Ledora is described as \"a rarity in her time. A thoroughly educated woman, who had attended teacher's college prior to her marriage to Ron's father, she was aptly suited to tutor her young son.\" Christensen comments that this presentation of the exceptional qualities of his mother is typical of hagiographies – such as the Virgin Mary – and forms a kind of after-the-event rationalization, in which qualities assigned to the subject are also attributed to the subject's mother. Presenting Ledora as \"aptly suited\" to educate her son suggests that she was, in effect, chosen to be his mother; she is not presented as responsible for stimulating her son's interest in the classics but was there simply to assist his development. (Indeed, as Christiansen notes, his parents do not have important roles in his official biography and are only significantly mentioned at the beginning of the story, where their respective professions are emphasized.)\n\nHubbard's official biographers also state that, during his childhood in Montana, he was befriended by \"Old Tom\", a medicine man from the Native American Blackfeet tribe. He is also purported to have become, at six years old, \"one of the few whites ever admitted into Blackfoot society as a bona fide blood brother\". This has been disputed by his unofficial biographers. Jon Atack notes that the Blackfoot reservation was over a hundred miles away from Helena. A \"Los Angeles Times\" investigation in 1990 reported that \"Old Tom\" was not listed in a 1907 register of the Blackfeet and that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood. Although the Church of Scientology states that Hubbard was awarded blood brotherhood \"in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders\", a Scientologist of fractional Blackfoot ancestry sought during the mid-1980s to prove that Hubbard had been a Blackfoot blood brother but was unsuccessful.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas. Harry Hubbard rejoined the Navy as an enlisted man but was promoted to Ensign in October 1918 and Lieutenant in November 1919. His posting aboard the USS \"Oklahoma\" in 1921 required his wife and son to relocate to the ship's home ports, first San Diego, then Seattle. Hubbard joined the local Boy Scouts and later said that when he was 13, he became the \"youngest Eagle Scout in the country\". The Boy Scouts of America has said that, at the time, it did not keep a record of the ages of its Eagle Scouts, only an alphabetical list of those who had received the award. Journalist Michael Streeter comments that, in light of this, \"it remains unclear just how Hubbard would have known he was its youngest member.\"\n\nA Scientology biography states that Hubbard's achievement of Eagle Scout status was \"an early indication that he did not plan to live an ordinary life.\" Christiansen notes that this passage implies that Hubbard consciously \"planned\" to live an extraordinary life, strengthening the underlying idea that from early childhood he worked towards the goals that led to Scientology. He was presented to President Calvin Coolidge in a ceremony that the Church of Scientology describes as Hubbard having \"represented American Scouting at the White House\", by which time \"the thirteen-year-old L. Ron Hubbard had become a reasonably famous figure in fairly adventurous circles.\" Atack describes the event more prosaically as a meet-and-greet in which Hubbard was one of forty boys who spoke their names to the President and shook his hand. Another Scientology biography says that Hubbard became \"the fast friend of the President's son, Calvin Coolidge, Jr., whose untimely death is probably responsible for L. Ron Hubbard's early interest in healing research.\" Atack deems this fictitious, as Calvin Coolidge, Jr. and Hubbard never crossed paths.\n\nThe Hubbards traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1923 aboard the USS \"U.S. Grant\", traveling from Seattle to Hampton Roads, Virginia, via the Panama Canal. During this trip, Hubbard reportedly received an education in Freudian psychology from Commander Joseph \"Snake\" Thompson, a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and student of Sigmund Freud. According to the Church of Scientology, Thompson \"took it upon himself to pass on the essentials of Freudian theory to his young friend.\" Hubbard later said that through Thompson's friendship, \"I attended many lectures given at naval hospitals and generally became conversant with psychoanalysis as it had been exported from Austria by Freud.\" Another Scientology text states that Thompson spent \"many an afternoon in the Library of Congress teaching L. Ron Hubbard what he [knew] of the human mind.\"\n\nThere is no independent confirmation of Hubbard's claims, though Thompson's existence has been proven. This encounter is used in Scientology's biographies as evidence that Hubbard was trained in a scientific approach to the mind, but found it unsatisfying. Christiansen notes that Dianetics was \"very much inspired by Freudian theory\". Hubbard's invocation of Thompson therefore serves to highlight his claimed knowledge of Freud's ideas, but also his exceptional maturity; as the official account has it, \"Ron was also left with many unanswered questions\" which prompted him to undertake further enquiries. This, in Christiansen's view, has strong parallels with the story of the child Jesus: \"in particular, the emphasis on the clever child having different skills and qualities from those of boys of the same age\", as displayed in incidents such as the twelve-year-old Jesus lecturing the scribes in the Temple of Jerusalem.\n\nThe following year, Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington. His son was enrolled at Union High School, Bremerton and later studied at Queen Anne High School in Seattle. In 1927, Hubbard's father was sent to the U.S. Naval Station in Guam. Although Hubbard's mother also went to Guam, Hubbard himself did not accompany them but was placed in his grandparents' care in Helena, Montana, to complete his schooling.\n\nBetween 1927 and 1929, Hubbard traveled to Japan, China, the Philippines, and Guam. \"What is Scientology\" and other Scientology texts present this era as a time when he sought, and was freely offered, ancient Eastern wisdom but found it lacking, as he had earlier with Western science. A biographical account in Hubbard's 1982 novel \"Battlefield Earth\" says that, \"he worked... aboard a coastal trader which plied the seas between Japan and Java. He came to know old Shanghai, Beijing and the Western Hills at a time when few Westerners could enter China.\" He is said to have spent weeks questioning Buddhist lamas and watching them meditate. He also recounted meeting Old Mayo, supposedly the last Chinese magician in a line that stretched back to the Court of Kublai Khan. According to the Church of Scientology, these travels were funded by his \"wealthy grandfather\". Hubbard is described not as a tourist but as a gifted student, intensely curious for answers to human suffering and warmly received everywhere because he was perceived as special. He is purported to have faced many dangers in the company of \"Major Ian Macbean of the British Secret Service\", including an \"encounter with Cantonese pirates, the engineering of a jungle road across Guam's denser corner, and the evening he decked an Italian swordsman named Giovinni. (Although not before he took a saber cut across the left cheek, and Macbean nearly lost a hand).\"\n\nHubbard's unofficial biographers present a very different account of his Asian travels, drawing on his school records, his contemporary diaries, and his father's service record. Hubbard recorded two trips to the east coast of China in his diaries. The first was made in the company of his mother while traveling from the United States to Guam in 1927. It consisted of a brief stop-over in two Chinese ports before the pair transferred to a U.S. Navy transport, the USS \"Gold Star\", for the journey to Guam. Hubbard spent about six weeks on the island before returning to the United States aboard the USS \"Nitro\". He used his diary to record his impressions of the places he visited, noting his unfavorable impression of the poverty and the appearance of the inhabitants of Japan and China, whom he described as \"gooks\", \"lazy\", and \"ignorant\". His second visit was a family holiday that took Hubbard and his parents to China via the Philippines in 1928. It is unclear whether he ever traveled to western China, Tibet, or India; Atack comments that Hubbard's only corroborated visit to India appears to have been a flight change at Calcutta in 1959.\n\nOn his return to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard enrolled at Helena High School, but earned poor grades. He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle. In June, he traveled to Guam on a U.S. Navy transport, the USS \"Henderson\", to reunite with his parents. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nA number of naval families, including Hubbard's, traveled from Guam to China aboard the \"USS Gold Star\" between October and December 1928. The ship visited Manila in the Philippines and traveled on to Qingdao (Tsingtao), from where Hubbard and his parents traveled inland to Beijing, before returning to the ship for transport to Shanghai and Hong Kong and finally back to Guam. The Church of Scientology presents a completely different version of this family holiday, stating that Hubbard \"made his way deep into Manchuria's Western Hills and beyond – to break bread with Mongolian bandits, share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of Kublai Khan.\" According to Atack, these occurrences are not mentioned in the diary that Hubbard kept of his trip. Many years later, Hubbard said that \"I was a harum-scarum kid; I wasn't thinking about deep philosophic problems.\"\n\nAs on his previous trip, Hubbard recorded his impressions in his diary. He remained unimpressed with China. After seeing Qingdao he wrote: \"A Chinaman can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down.\" He characterized the sights of Beijing as \"rubberneck stations\" for tourists and described the palaces of the Forbidden City as \"very trashy-looking\" and \"not worth mentioning\". He visited a section of the Great Wall of China near Beijing, which did impress him, but his overall conclusion of the Chinese was very negative: \"They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here.\"\n\nBack on Guam, Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays. He is said to have \"befriend[ed] the local Chamorros and [taught] in the native schools\", exploring \"cliff-side caves to disabuse local villagers of a devil named Tadamona\". Despite his mother's assistance with his education, he failed the Naval Academy entrance examination. His father's next posting took the family to Washington, D.C., where Hubbard was sent to study at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia within the D.C. metropolitan area. The Hubbards returned to Helena, Montana for a short visit to Hubbard's grandparents in August 1929 before he enrolled at Swavely the following month.\n\nHubbard proved unable to enter the Naval Academy because he was found to be too near-sighted to meet the physical admission criteria. In the late 1940s, Hubbard wrote a series of private Affirmations in which he tells himself \"your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy.\"\n\nIn February 1930 he enrolled at Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. as a means of earning credits for admission to George Washington University, thereby avoiding the university's entrance examination, and successfully graduated in June. The following September, he entered George Washington University as a freshman.\n\nWhile at Woodward, the 19-year-old Hubbard enlisted as a Private in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, stating his age as 21 and listing his profession as \"photographer\". He was promoted to First Sergeant only six weeks later, a development that Atack attributes to the fact that the unit he joined – the 20th Marine Corps Reserve – was actually a training unit connected with George Washington University. His character was rated \"excellent\" but on October 22, 1931 he was discharged with the notation, \"Not to be re-enlisted.\" Despite his limited experience of the Marine Corps, he told readers of \"Adventure\" magazine in October 1935 that \"I've known the Corps from Quantico to Peiping, from the South Pacific to the West Indies.\"\n\nHubbard's two-year career at George Washington University looms large in his own accounts and the biographies published by the Church of Scientology. George Malko comments in \"\",\n\nOfficial biographical accounts of his life state that his \"study of engineering, mathematics and nuclear physics laid the foundation for his later philosophical research.\" A profile in one of his books attributes \"the mathematical precision of the Scientology Religion\" to his studies. According to one Scientology account,\n\nHubbard's education in \"atomic and molecular phenomena\" is highlighted in many Scientology biographies. According to one, he was \"a member of the first U.S. course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics.\" A 1961 publication calls him \"L. Ron Hubbard, C.E., Ph.D., a nuclear physicist ... educated in advanced physics and higher mathematics and also a student of Sigmund Freud and others, [who] began his present researches thirty years ago at George Washington University.\" In 1959, another Scientology publication described him as \"Doctor Hubbard, American nuclear physicist and leading world authority on the subject of life sources and mental energies and structures.\" He told Scientologists in later years that \"Nearly all nuclear physicists – atomic and molecular phenomena boys – 'Buck Rogers Boys', we were known as ... Like so many physicists I wrote science fiction for years, and that was the only remunerative use I made of this material.\"\n\nOne account published by the Church of Scientology says that Hubbard theorized that \"the world of subatomic particles might possibly provide a clue to the human thought process\" and he was \"concerned for the safety of the world, recognising that if man were to handle the atom sanely for the greatest benefit, he would first have to learn to handle himself.\" He enrolled on a nuclear physics course \"to synthesise and test all knowledge for what was observable, workable and could truly help solve man's problems.\" Another profile calls him \"a product of the atomic age\" and describes how his classmates dreamed of unlocking the energy of the atom, while Hubbard himself sought to \"discover the basic equations of life force, simply, to him, another kind of energy.\" Hubbard stated that he \"set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy.\"\n\nOther Scientology accounts present a different perspective. A 1959 biography describes Hubbard as \"never noted for being in class\" and says that he \"thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects.\" He attributed his choice of course to his father, having \"decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics and so I found myself obediently studying.\" In a 1953 lecture, he said that he was \"forced into engineering, mathematics, majoring in nuclear physics – very antipathetic to me, but there was order and there was discipline ...\" Christiansen comments that the claims made about Hubbard's expertise and scientific knowledge are crucial to Scientology's own self-image and legitimation. Hubbard is presented as \"a man with an impressive amount of various theoretical as well as practical personal competences and educational qualifications.\" Scientology traces its own origins to Hubbard's \"scientific\" methodology, which he is said to have learned while at university. Although Scientology positions itself as a religious belief, it nonetheless claims to be a true science, a \"technology\" capable of achieving precise and replicable results.\n\nHubbard's academic record, which came to light in the 1970s, revealed that he had been a student in George Washington University's School of Engineering and had majored in civil engineering. He attended the summer semester in 1931 and the fall and spring semesters in 1931–32. In September 1931, he was placed on probation and he failed to return for the fall 1932 semester. A Scientology account says that he \"excell[ed] in but thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects\"; while the latter may have been true, the former certainly was not, as his grades were consistently poor. At the end of his first year, he received a D average grade, earning an A for physical education, B for English, C for mechanical engineering, D for general chemistry and Fs for German and calculus. During his second year, he enrolled in a class on atomic and molecular physics – the \"nuclear physics\" course cited in his official biographies – but earned an F grade. His other grades were also poor, ranging from a B for English to D in calculus and electrical and magnetic physics. He dropped out soon afterwards. Although Hubbard told \"Look\" magazine in 1950 that \"I never took my degree,\" a biography published a few years later by the Church of Scientology's \"Ability\" magazine nonetheless identifies him as the holder of a \"B. S. in Civil Engineering\".\n\nHubbard was far more interested in extracurricular activities, particularly writing and participating in the university flying club. He wrote for the George Washington University student newspaper, \"The University Hatchet\", as a reporter for a few months in 1931. According to official biographies, \"he earned his wings as a pioneering barnstormer at the dawn of American aviation\" and became \"a roving reporter for \"Sportsman Pilot\"\" who \"helped inspire a generation of pilots who would take America to world airpower.\" One account published by the Church of Scientology states that he was \"recognized as one of the country's most outstanding pilots. With virtually no training time, he takes up powered flight and barnstorms throughout the Midwest.\" His pilot's license, however, records that he only qualified to fly gliders rather than powered aircraft.\n\nHubbard left the university after two years and married in 1933. He began writing for the popular pulp magazines at that time. His first story was \"The Green God,\" which appeared in \"Thrilling Adventures\" in 1934. According to James R. Lewis, Associate Professor of Religion at University of Tromso, he was a quick and prolific writer, which fellow authors envied. According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard's decision to drop out of university was not the result of educational failure on his part, but was instead because he found that \"beyond a basic methodology, university offered nothing.\" Hubbard is said to have \"decid[ed] that formal study had nothing more to offer\".\n\nHubbard's final semester at George Washington University saw him embark on what the Church of Scientology describes as a career as an \"adventurer and explorer\". In May 1932, he announced in \"The University Hatchet\" that he had organized an expedition to the Caribbean for \"fifty young gentleman rovers\" aboard the schooner \"Doris Hamlin\". The aims of the \"Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition\" were to explore and film the pirate \"strongholds and bivouacs of the Spanish Main\" and to \"collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums\".\n\nThe expedition did not go according to plan after its departure from Baltimore on June 23, 1932. Ten of the \"gentleman rovers\" pulled out before the start and the ship was blown far off course by storms, making an unplanned first landfall at Bermuda. Eleven more members of the expedition quit while there, before the ship sailed on to its intended first port of call, Martinique. \"En route\", it was discovered that the ship's fresh water had all leaked away. More expedition members abandoned ship on arrival. As the expedition was critically short of money, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore, bringing to an end what the captain described as \"the worst trip I ever made\". Hubbard nonetheless presented the expedition as a success and blamed the captain for its travails: \"the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts.\"\n\nThe Church of Scientology states that a \"National Museum\" (it does not specify which one) acquired specimens collected by the expedition and the \"New York Times\" purchased some of its photographs. Hubbard's book \"Mission into Time\" states that the expedition's underwater films and specimens \"provided the Hydrographic Office and the University of Michigan with invaluable data for the furtherance of their research.\" However, Hubbard's unofficial biographer Russell Miller reports that the \"New York Times\" \"hold[s] no photographs from the expedition, [has] no evidence that it was ever intended to buy such photographs, nor indeed any indication that the newspaper was even aware of the expedition's existence,\" and that neither the U.S. Hydrographic Office nor the University of Michigan has any record of films or specimens from the expedition.\n\nAccording to the Church of Scientology, \"even some fifty years later, those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage as the one grand adventure in the twilight of their youth.\" Hubbard put it somewhat differently, writing in 1935 that the expedition \"was a crazy idea at best, and I knew it, but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet.\" He told \"Look\" magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition \"was a two-bit expedition and financial bust, and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933.\" The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds.\n\nAfter leaving university, Hubbard is said to have carried out a further expedition to Puerto Rico. It is described by a 1959 biography as having been undertaken to \"blow off steam by leading an expedition into Central America \". An account published in \"Mission into Time\" states \"Conducting the West Indies Minerals Survey, he made the first complete mineralogical survey of Puerto Rico. This was pioneer exploration in the great tradition, opening up a predictable, accurate body of data for the benefit of others. Later, in other, less materialistic fields, this was to be his way many, many times over.\" The Church of Scientology claims that Hubbard's father \"had long dreamed of augmenting his Lieutenant's pay with a mining venture and a bit of investment capital from like-minded officers\" and dispatched Hubbard to the Puerto Rican hinterland where he \"sluiced inland rivers and crisscrossed the island in search of elusive gold.\" While there, Hubbard \"conducted much ethnological work amongst the interior villages and native hillsmen\".\n\nThe expedition's existence has been questioned by Hubbard's unofficial biographers. Miller states that neither the United States Geological Survey nor the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources have records of any such expedition. Hubbard stayed on Puerto Rico from November 1932 to mid-February 1933. According to Miller, Hubbard went there for an entirely different purpose. Harry Ross Hubbard sent a letter to the Navy Department on October 13, 1932, in which he requested a passage for his son to San Juan to \"place his services at the disposal of the American Red Cross in their relief work on that island.\" Three weeks earlier, Puerto Rico had been hit by the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane and suffered catastrophic damage. The storm killed 225 people, injured 3,000 more, and left over 100,000 people homeless. Hubbard traveled to the island aboard the USS \"Kittery\", arriving on November 4. It is unclear whether he contributed to the Red Cross relief effort, though in a 1957 lecture he said that he had been \"a field executive with the American Red Cross in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster.\"\n\nAt some point during his short stay on the island, he appears to have done some work for a Washington D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated. A letter dated February 16, 1933 describes Hubbard as the company's \"field representative\" who accompanied the letter's author on a survey of a small property near the town of Luquillo, Puerto Rico. According to his own account, Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold. A photograph published in Hubbard's book \"Mission into Time\" shows him using a gold pan alongside the caption \"Sluicing with crews on Corozal River '32\" and an article in the August 18, 1933 \"Washington Daily News\" describes Hubbard as having \"left here last year for Antilles, West Indies, in search of gold so that he might return and marry the girl he met shortly before his departure\". In 1935, Hubbard wrote in \"Adventure\" magazine,\n\nHe married the girl in question, Margaret \"Polly\" Grubb, on April 13, 1933. Chronically short of money, he turned to full-time fiction writing to support himself and his new wife; six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933 as he embarked on a literary career that made him a somewhat well-known figure in the world of pulp magazine fiction.\n\nHubbard's early life is accorded great significance by the Church of Scientology, which draws on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy. Dorthe Refslund Christensen comments:\n\nHubbard portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer, world traveler and nuclear physicist. By contrast, his critics have characterized him as a liar, charlatan, and madman. Many of his autobiographical statements have been proven to be fictitious. The Church's portrayal of Hubbard's life displays many standard features of hagiography, such as the emphasis on the continuity of the subject's life. Events are woven together in a seamless tapestry that culminates in the subject's achievement of his spiritual goals. They are presented as part of a \"master plan\" that gives meaning to the subject's life in the context of a belief system. By doing this, the belief system is legitimized and given an aspect of genuineness through stressing its originator's personal qualities.\n\nHubbard is therefore portrayed, as he put it himself, as a man who \"knew exactly where I was going\" from the age of three. He is presented as a person who constantly worked towards a single objective. Each event in his life is seen as a stepping stone along the way to the development of Dianetics and Scientology. He is cast as a singular and forward-thinking individual whose unique qualities and knowledge are essential prerequisites for his discoveries. As the Church puts it, \"even in his early youth he exemplified a rare sense of purpose and dedication which, combined with his adventurous spirit, made him a living legend.\" The story of Hubbard's early life, as told by the Church, is closely related to Scientology's own self-image as a synthesis of Western scientific precision with Eastern philosophy. His claimed knowledge of these fields and practices underlines his claim to have founded a religion that combines the best of both to appeal to all people.\n\n"}

Unlike Bible software that is designed for in-depth Bible study, daily devotionals in electronic form are designed to focus the mind on one or two thoughts.\n\nDevotional classics such as Oswald Chambers' \"My Utmost for His Highest\" went electronic as a part of Bible software book collections when Bible software emerged in the 1980s in response to the capabilities of personal computers. These early versions were awkward to scroll through. The emergence of the internet in the 1990s prompted an explosion of online daily devotional offerings. With the advent of cell phones, iPods and smart phones, mobile delivery of daily devotionals has changed even more.\n\nThe same electronic publishers that brought Bible software to desktop users—e-Sword, LOGOS, Pradis, PC Study Bible, Online Bible, and QuickVerse, among others, also include devotional classics in electronic media. These devotional materials are tied to the user's computer.\n\n\n\"Our Daily Bread\" was among the earliest of the classic devotionals to appear on the Internet. Online archives of the devotional are available back to January 1994. Upper Room Ministries began emailing the \"Upper Room\" daily devotional guide in 1997. In the years following, many Christian organizations began adding a daily devotional to their website. The following is an incomplete list of daily devotional services available through recognized Christian organizations.\n\nMany of the web-based devotional providers offer mobile delivery of their electronic devotionals.

All of these mobile options require connection to the internet.\n\nA number of devotional providers also offer a daily devotional in text-message format appropriate for any cell phone with text capability. Internet service is not required. Many providers offer this service for free while some charge a monthly fee. Of the fee-based service providers, a small number, such as The Bible Now, use the monthly fee to support other faith-based initiatives, including Christian adoption (such as the Aspen Project) and short-term missions to Mexico (Casa por Cristo).\n\n"}

At the time of Pakistan's creation the 'hostage theory' had been espoused. According to this theory the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India. However, Khawaja Nazimuddin, the 2nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, stated: \"I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be\".\n\nIt is estimated that 95% of Pakistanis are Muslims (75-95% Sunni, 5-20% Shia and 0.22-2.2% Ahmadi, who are not permitted to call themselves Muslims—see Religious discrimination in Pakistan), while the remaining 5% includes Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, members of other faiths and atheists.\n\nProgress on religious freedom is being made gradually as Pakistan transitions to democracy from Zia's legacy, in 2016 Sindh with Pakistan's largest Hindu minority passed a bill that outlawed forced conversions. The bill was tabled by a faction of the Pakistan Muslim League which in Sindh is led by Sufi leader Pir Pagara, called PML-F, Pakistan Muslim League functional. Pakistan is 96% Muslim, and most provinces are overwhelmingly Muslim, Pakistan's most religiously diverse province is Sindh with an 8% religious minority population (predominantly Hindus and also Christians) and there is significant protection within Sindh province against forced conversions against one's will.\n\nThe original Constitution of Pakistan did not discriminate between Muslims and non-Muslims. However, the amendments made during President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization led to the controversial Hudood Ordinance and Shariat Court. Later, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government tried to enforce a Shariat Bill, passed in May 1991. After the incident of 9/11, Pervez Musharraf government took steps to curtail the religious intolerance of non-Muslims.\nThe Pakistani government does not restrict religious publishing. However, it restricts the right to freedom of speech with regard to religion. Speaking in opposition to Islam and publishing an attack on Islam or its prophets are prohibited. Pakistan's penal code mandates the death penalty or life in prison for anyone defiling the name of Muhammad. This penal code mandates life imprisonment for desecrating the Quran, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for insulting another's religious beliefs with intent to outrage religious feelings.\n\nPakistan's blasphemy laws are problematic both in their form and their application and have been the source of much debate and harm since the 1980s. It has been alleged in some cases that Muslims who have engaged in public debate about their religion have been prosecuted for blasphemy. The Federal Minister for Minorities Affairs, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated on 2 March 2011 for his lifelong stand against the laws and the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was killed by his own bodyguard on 4 January 2011 for standing up for a blasphemy defendant.\n\nChristian scriptures and books are available in Karachi and in travelling bookmobiles. Hindu and Parsi scriptures are freely available. Foreign books and magazines may be imported freely, but are subject to censorship for religious content.\n\nThe Pakistan government does not ban formally the public practice of the Ahmadiyya, but its practice is restricted severely by law. A 1974 constitutional amendment declared Ahmadis to be a non-Muslim minority because, according to the Government, they do not accept Muhammad as the last prophet of Islam. However, Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims and observe Islamic practices. In 1984, under Ordinance XX the government added Section 298(c) into the Penal Code, prohibiting Ahmadis from calling themselves Muslim or posing as Muslims; from referring to their faith as Islam; from preaching or propagating their faith; from inviting others to accept the Ahmadi faith; and from insulting the religious feelings of Muslims.\n. This section of the Penal Code has caused problems for Ahmadis, particularly the provision that forbids them from \"directly or indirectly\" posing as Muslims. The Ahmadis must not use the standard Muslim greeting form and must not name their children Muhammad. The constitutionality of Section 286(c) was upheld in a split-decision Supreme Court case in 1996. The punishment for violation of this section is imprisonment for up to 3 years and a fine. It has been alleged that this provision has been used extensively by the Government and anti-Ahmadi religious groups to target and harass Ahmadis. Ahmadis also are prohibited from holding any conferences or gatherings.\n\nIn 1980s Zia ul-Haq introduced a system under which non-Muslims could vote for only candidates of their own religion. Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of affirmative action designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue. But critics argue that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Pakistan's separate electoral system for different religions has been described as 'political Apartheid'. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.\n\nThe judicial system encompasses several different court systems with overlapping and sometimes competing jurisdiction, reflecting differences in civil, criminal, and Islamic jurisprudence. The federal sharia court and the sharia bench of the Supreme Court serve as appellate courts for certain convictions in criminal court under the Hudood Ordinances, and judges and attorneys in these courts must be Muslims. The federal sharia court also may overturn any legislation judged to be inconsistent with the tenets of Islam.\n\nThe Hudood Ordinances criminalize non-marital rape, extramarital sex, and various gambling, alcohol, and property offences. The Hudood Ordinances are applied to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Some Hudood Ordinance cases are subject to Hadd, or Quranic, punishment; others are subject to Tazir, or secular punishment.\n\nAlthough both types of cases are tried in ordinary criminal courts, special rules of evidence apply in Hadd cases, which discriminate against non-Muslims. For example, a non-Muslim may testify only if the victim also is non-Muslim. Likewise, the testimony of women, Muslim or non-Muslim, is not admissible in cases involving Hadd punishments. Therefore, if a Muslim man rapes a non-Muslim woman in the presence of women or non-Muslim men, he cannot be convicted under the Hudood Ordinances.\n\nChristian Church leaders argue that the government needs to go beyond the rhetoric of \"minorities are enjoying all rights in the country\" when they are not, and take practical steps to ensure that this is done. \nAccording to a survey in 2010 by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 76% of Pakistanis polled supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam.\n\nThe Penal Code incorporates a number of Islamic law provisions. The judicial system encompasses several different court systems with overlapping and sometimes competing jurisdictions that reflect differences in civil, criminal, and Islamic jurisprudence. The Federal Shari'a Court and the Shari'a bench of the Supreme Court serve as appellate courts for certain convictions in criminal court under the Hudood Ordinance, which criminalizes rape, extramarital sex, property crimes, alcohol, and gambling; judges and attorneys in these courts must be Muslim. The Federal Shari'a Court may overturn any legislation judged inconsistent with the tenets of Islam. In March 2005, however, the Supreme Court Chief Justice ruled that the Federal Shari'a Court had no jurisdiction to review a decision by a provincial high court even if the Federal Shari'a Court should have had initial appellate jurisdiction.\n\nFor both Muslims and non-Muslims, all consensual extramarital sexual relations are considered a violation of the Hudood Ordinances. If a woman cannot prove the absence of consent in a rape case, there is a risk that she may be charged with a violation of the Hudood Ordinances for fornication or adultery. The maximum punishment for this offence is public flogging or stoning. However, there are no recorded instances of either type of punishment since the law was introduced.\n\nAccording to a police official, in a majority of rape cases, the victims are pressured to drop rape charges because of the threat of Hudood adultery charges being brought against them. A parliamentary commission of inquiry for women has criticized the Hudood Ordinances and recommended their repeal. It also has been charged that the laws on adultery and rape have been subject to widespread misuse, and that 95 percent of the women accused of adultery are found innocent in the court of first instance or on appeal. This commission found that the main victims of the Hudood Ordinances are poor women who are unable to defend themselves against slanderous charges. According to the commission, the laws also have been used by husbands and other male family members to punish their wives and female family members for reasons that have nothing to do with perceived sexual impropriety. Approximately one-third or more of the women in jails in Lahore, Peshawar, and Mardan in 1998 were awaiting trial for adultery under the Hudood Ordinances. \n\nHowever, a major amendment was passed to fix and/or get rid of these archaic laws. The Woman's Protection Bill passed in 2006. It returned a number of offences from the Zina Ordinance to the Pakistan Penal Code, where they had been before 1979, and created an entirely new set of procedures governing the prosecution of the offences of adultery and fornication, whipping and amputation were removed as punishments. The law meant women would not be jailed if they were unable to prove rape, and allows rape to be proved on grounds other than witnesses, such as forensics and DNA evidence. \n\nAccording to Minorities Concern of Pakistan, forced conversion of Christian and Hindu girls are on the rise in Pakistan. Three international Christian organizations are planning to raise their voice on this issue in the UN.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs, which is entrusted with safeguarding religious freedom, has on its masthead a Koranic verse: \"Islam is the only religion acceptable to God.\" The Ministry claims that it spends 30 percent of its annual budget to assist indigent minorities, to repair minority places of worship, to set up minority-run small development schemes, and to celebrate minority festivals. However, religious minorities question its expenditures, observing that localities and villages housing minority citizens go without basic civic amenities. The National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP) of the Catholic Bishops' Conference, using official budget figures for expenditures in 1998, calculated that the Government actually spent $17 (PRs850) on each Muslim and only $3.20 (PRs160) on each religious minority citizen per month.\nReligious minority interests have also been represented by a Minorities Ministry, which has taken various forms and now sits under the Religious Affairs Ministry again, since June 2013.\n\nOn 23 September 2009, the United States House of Representatives introduced a \"House Resolution 764\" which calls on Pakistan to restore religious freedom in the country where Hindus, Christians, Ahmadiyyas and Bahai's (the religions mentioned by name) are subjugated. The resolution was introduced by Representative Chris Smith. As of December 2016, the resolution failed.\n\n"}

It is aimed at propagation of puritanical interpretation of Islam, and \"dawah\" (proselytization). The organization operates pesantren (Islamic seminary), mass media, women’s division, and coop.\nHidayatullah was founded on 7 January 1973 (2 Dzulhijjah 1392 Hijriah), by Ustadz Abdullah Said in Balikpapan as a form of pesantren (Islamic school, most of whom are boarders). From a pesantren, Hidayatullah was developed further with many activities such as social, mission, education and economy programs and spread to many regions. As of 2003, this institution had networks in 200 cities, in every province in Indonesia. By the first national meeting on July 9–13, 2000 in Balikpapan, Hidayatullah changed its form to a mass organization and declared itself as an Islamic Struggle Movement.\nIts mission is to realize society based on Al-Qur'an that free from thoughts, ism and attitude that allying Allah (syirik). The strengthen of sentence of tauhid “Laa ilaaha illallah” on earth · The executing of Syari’ah Islam by whole Muslims · Realization of the strength of Islam people in many life area · The birth of combatant cadre · Increase of standing, degree and prestige of the weak and oppressed onesTake role effectively in doing reform process (tajdid) in philosophy of Islam thought as basic for development of Islam civilization in the future · Prepare concept and strategy of struggle accurately · Prepare and build organizations of dakwah, education, social, politic, youth, female matters, and others that are strong, solid, modern and professional · Labouring and pushing the efforts on enhancing the quality of human resources.\n\nHidayatullah leadership is built based on a prophet method that follows priority scale from the most principle (ushul) until the non-principle (furu’iyyah). While the main agenda that becomes focus work is: streamlining of aqidah, leadership and organization matters (tajdid); awareness brighten (tilawatu ayatillah); soul purify (tazkiyatun-nufus); instruction and education (ta’limatul-kitab wal-hikmah) going to the birth of leadership and best ummah.\nHidayatullah was born when Muslims were awaiting the coming of a XV Hijriah century, believed to be the era of Islam resurrection. The main theme at that time was “Back to Qur'an and Sunnah.” Hidayatullah is a thought movement that tries to interpret “Back to Qur’an and Sunnah” more concretely, so, Al-Qur'an and Sunnah became a blueprint for Islam civilization development.\n\nHidayatullah believes that the setback of Muslems is mostly caused by a partial understanding of the universality of Islam. Each group takes the theme and program focus according to their partial view, and then even theme and program focus become a kind of group ideology. As an Islam mass organization that is based on cadre, Hidayatullah claims themselves to be an Islamic Struggle Movement (Al-Harakah Al-Jihadiyah Al-Islamiyah) with dakwah (mission) and tarbiyah (education) as main programs.\n\nAs a mass organization, membership of Hidayatullah is inclusive, and so its mission, vision, and movement basic concept. Hidayatullah makes its affiliates and related institutions autonomous and function as educational basic and member recruitment.\n\nHidayatullah is an institution for Moslems that want to realize their idealism to build Islamic society, refer to prophet method (manhaj nubuwwah). Hidayatullah is steadfast in its adherence to the Al Quran and Sunnah. Its obedience toward Allah and Muhammad is absolute; therefore all matters must be returned to Allah and Muhammad.\n\nHidayatullah opened its membership in January 2001 to all adult Muslim. Becoming a member of Hidayatullah means taking part in a new wave of campaigns to uphold the faith: Laa Ilaaha illallah – Muhammad.\n\nMembers are entitled to training and education that will result in the establishment of Hidayatullah cadres. They are then expected to give back to society by bringing to it Islamic solutions to various problems.\n\nCentral Official Members consist of the Council of Sharia, the Council of Representatives (Syura) and the Central Executive Board. Sharia Council is the highest institute of organization, led by a chairman that also represents “imam” (leader) of Hidayatullah, called as General Leader. Council of Representatives represents observation institute for executive, this council consist of 25 members that are elected through national deliberation. General Leader ratifies Central Executive Board in national deliberation for 5 years duration.\n\nStructures under Central Executive Board consist of Regional Executive Boards, Area Executive Boards (sub-province), Branch Executive Boards (district), and Subsection Executive Boards (sub-district). The chief of regional Executive Board downwards selected by deliberation in each level and have responsibility upwards and also to constituents.\n\nHidayatullah networks are supported by existence of 21 Regional Executive Boards and 194 Area Executive Boards. Of these, 51 are located in Java and 143 in outside of Java.\n\nIts Chairman of Sharia Council is Abdurrahman Muhammad, while its Chairman of Syura is Abdul Qadir Jailani.\nHidayatullah main program is dakwah (mission) and tarbiyah (education). Since its first step, Hidayatullah have sent students to do dakwah as part of education process. Existence of Hidayatullah in various places is an effort to build wide dakwah network and can reach and serve all levels of ummah. Hidayatullah tries to put da’i as “missionaries of Islam” so that the profile of da’i is ones who have excellent and militant characteristic and also have potency to build a balance civilization between earthly and eternity.\n\nSince 1978 Hidayatullah have sent da’i around the country. Hidayatullah tries to enhance the quality of da’i by founding Religion College of Islam Lukman Al Hakim (STAIL) in Surabaya and Moslem Law Science College of Hidayatullah (STIS) in Balikpapan as education institutes for cadre of da’i. Because of profession of da’i more tend to dedication therefore Hidayatullah give full scholarship (expense of living cost and education) for students of STAIL and STIS with tenure pattern. In this way expected can be yielded da’i with stratum one qualification in education, dakwah and syariah who have militant soul, ready to be assigned entire Indonesia, expected can stay permanently, given subsidy for maximal 3 years or till they able to be economic performer where they are assigned.\n\nSince year 1998 this cadre of da’i education institute have yielded and sent its grads to various area especially east and middle Indonesia. Every year Hidayatullah sends at least 150 da’i to many regions in Indonesia with 50 among them are stratum one grads from cadre of da’i education institute.\n\nAll Hidayatullah cadres are expected to go out preaching to the general public every Saturday.\n\nIn second 25 years step of Hidayatullah, education has a central and strategic role, especially when it is connected with effort to enhance human resources quality. It is caused by the realization for human standing and prestige increase and socialization of Islam values can be done only by high quality human resource.\n\nAccording to Islam terminology, high quality human resource is human being capable to use all thinking and recitation potency inside himself or herself well balanced so that all domination of science, domination of technology and his/her skill give benefit to himself/herself, his/her environmental and world generally. Therefore, the development of human resource must be focused on the principles of tauhid and good behaviour without ignoring standing of intellectuality.\n\nHidayatullah introduces concept of integral Islam education and implement it in management of Hidayatullah schools from kindergarten until college level. The \"integral\" term shows a unity of all existing element, either faith and godly and science and technology, school and society, formal and non-formal, etc.\n\nHidayatullah education institute covers Kindergarten and Play Group, Elementary School or Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in almost all areas, Junior High School/Madrasah Tsanawiyah and Senior High School/Madrasah Aliyah at least in each region and 3 colleges in Surabaya, Balikpapan and Depok.\n\nBeside Religion College of Islam Lukman Al Hakim (STAIL) in Surabaya and Moslem Law Science College of Hidayatullah (STIS) in Balikpapan as education institute for da'i cadre, Hidayatullah is starting Management Science College in Depok that is expected can yield grads that able to manage the Hidayatullah charitable efforts including economic efforts.\n\nOpening Hidayatullah's 2016 national conference, Riau Islands governor Nurdin Basirun welcomed the large scale and success of the organisation's many schools.\n\nHidayatullah pesantrens as does pesantrens in other places, have function as place to deepen science of religion. Pesantren with width of campus it had also have function as miniature or sample project to leadership and organized life in Islam. Besides dwelt by students who live in hostel, pesantren is also dwelt by teachers, nursemaid, organizer and jamaah of Hidayatullah that willing to live in pesantren in order to learn how to live in leadership and be organized.\n\nWith all limitation but with full seriousness, we try to strengthen syariah. Leadership is obeyed; obligation to do shalat, fast and tithe, charity and alms is intensified.\n\nCentre Education of Pious Child (Pusat Pendidikan Anak Shaleh - PPAS) is institution in the form of pesantren for orphans and poor children that place priority on growth of religious values through the reading of the Qur'an (tilawah), sanctifying of soul (tazkiyah), and studying (ta’limah). PPAS with its management have a multi-dimension characteristic for children; as substitute of parents, mini laboratory of life, and place to strengthen faith and enhance knowledge.\n\nAside from expectation to minimize economic inabilities, PPAS are expected to be able to produce cadres of combatant (mujahid) that will be ahead in the front line to straighten up the pennant of Islam.\n\nThe existence of more than 200 PPAS with averagely 150 orphans and poor children per PPAS is prove of the siding of Hidayatullah’s to the weak (dhu’afa) and the oppressed ones (mustadh’afin), the orphans and poor children. This is one of commitments that get primary attention since the beginning of Hidayatullah’s steps.\n\nBaitul Maal Hidayatullah (BMH) is an institute under Hidayatullah that have functions to manage funds of ummah’s zakat, infaq, shadaqah and waqaf. As embodiment from society and government to Hidayatullah, Baitul Maal Hidayatullah (BMH) have achieved confirmation as a national institute organizer of religious obligatory through decree of Republic Indonesia Religion Minister No. 538 year 2001.\n\nBMH organizes fund property of ummah that entrusted to Hidayatullah to be channelled to empowerment of ummah, moving forward education institute and also social, moving forward mission of Islam, lessening the oppressed and weak. Now BMH have owned 30 representative offices and 144 partner networks.\n\n\"Voice of Hidayatulah\" is one of business entity in Hidayatullah that is concentration in press. Initially, the magazine is only in the form of bulletin, masterpiece result of some student in pesantren Hidayatullah in Balikpapan. Considering what a strategic is dakwah through mass media, the bulletin continues to be developed.\n\n\"Voice of Hidayatullah\" contains about dakwah dynamics and problems, either in Indonesia and also world. In it there is rubric interview popular figure, study of Al-Qur'an and Hadits, heroic story of struggle of da’i in various area all over the country, till the problem of family.\n\nThe magazine now reaches 60.000 exemplar. Its main office is in Surabaya.\n\nRepresenting Hidayatullah’s autonomous organization that has owned 15 official members of region in all over Indonesia. Mushida move in dakwah area, education and social focus on women, family and children empowerment.\n\nMushida’s vision is “Developing Qur’ani Families as Especial Bollard for Formed Tauhid Society”. To reach the vision, every program of Mushida flange to the forming of muslimah personal that is rahmatan lil ‘alamin, and build buttonhole of muslimah which have quality in supporting its role as personal, wife, mother and member of society.\n\nConstruction of members program in the form of activity of ceremony of ta’lim which executed routinely.

Altogether in order to yielding and developing innovative products and services with high quality and also valuable in order to developing strong and self-supporting ummah economy.\n\nHaving been founded in East Kalimantan, Hidayatullah naturally has a great concern for the development of the remove areas of the province. This concern was behind the sending, since early 1980s, of da’i (religious teachers or preachers) to the hinterland. Most of the da’i have since built their own pesantren in areas where they were posted –this in addition to the continued effort of the Hidayatullah to develop boarding schools in whatever regions where there are none.\n\nThe province of Papua is another focus of attention of the Hidayatullah. Its da’is can be found in almost all cities and towns of the province, whose main activity is building the Islamic Boarding Schools for local children . The same drive of the Hidayatullah preachers could be said for those posted in East Timor before the territory’s independence from Indonesia.\n\n"}

Therefore before human, the \"hinn\", \"binn\", \"timm\", \"rimm\", \"jann\" and \"jinn\" roamed the earth. These six periods symbolize a negative progress until humans emerge, thus the first letters of the first four circles mean \"Habtar\" (here referring to the personification of evil) and the latter referring to Jann and Jinn as subordinates of the devil. The following circle divides human history, starting with Adam and ends with Muhammad, the period in which humans now live.\n\nAlternatively, hinn have been said to be associated with air and another creature, binn, with water in a document called, \"Revelations of ʻAbdullah Al-Sayid Muhammad Habib\". In the same document, hinn and binn are said to be extinct, unlike jinn.\n\nAccording to Ibn Kathir the hinn belongs together with the jinn to those creatures who shed blood on earth before humankind, causing the angels to protest against God's command to place Adam as a vicegerent. In his work \"Al-Bidāya wa-n-Nihāya\" he relates, the hinn and binn were exterminated by the jinn, so that they could dwell on earth. \n\nMuhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur states in his work \"at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer\", the hinn and binn may be a reference to Persian mythology or the Ancient Greek Titans, who were driven away by their deities.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the \"Hinn\" supported the angels, led by Iblis during a battle against the earthen jinn, who bore disaster on the world. Tabari explained the Hinn were created out of fire, like the jinn. But the Hinn, who belong to Iblis´s group are created out of the fire of \"samum\" (scorching fire), which is mentioned in the Quran (15:27) while the regular jinn are created out of \"marij min nar \"(smokeless flame), which is mentioned in (55:15).\n\nAccording to some folklore, the Hinn are believed to be still alive and took shape of dogs. Based on a hadith, if a wild dog approaches a Muslim, he shall throw some food to him and chase him away, because he would have an evil soul.\n\nHinn were mentioned in pre-Islamic poems along with jinn.\n"}
{"id": "873184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=873184", "title": "Holy card", "text": "Holy card\n\nIn the Christian tradition, holy cards or prayer cards are small, devotional pictures mass-produced for the use of the faithful. They usually depict a religious scene or a saint in an image about the size of a playing card. The reverse typically contains a prayer, some of which promise an indulgence for its recitation. The circulation of these cards is an important part of the visual folk culture of Roman Catholics, and in modern times, prayer cards have also become popular among Orthodox Christians and Protestant Christians, although with the latter, biblical themes are emphasized within them.\n\nOld master prints, nearly all on religious subjects, served many of the same functions as holy cards, especially the cheaper woodcuts; the earliest dated surviving example is from 1423, probably from southern Germany, and depicts Saint Christopher, with handcolouring, it is found as part of the binding of a manuscript of the \"Laus Virginis\" (1417) which belongs to the John Rylands Library, Manchester. Later engraving or etching were more commonly used. Some had elaborate borders of paper lace surrounding the images; these were called \"dévotes dentelles\" in France.\n\nOne use of such cards is illustrated in an early 15th-c painting of the Annunciation by Robert Campin, which stages the event in a bourgeois home; above the fireplace, a print of Christopher carrying the Christ child is tacked to the wall, possibly as a more affordable alternative to a painting.\n\nThe invention of colour lithography made it possible to reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of the cards. An early centre of their manufacture was in the environs of the Church of St Sulpice in Paris; the lithographed images made there were done in delicate pastel colours, and proved extremely influential on later designs. Belgium and Germany also became centres of the manufacture of holy cards, as did Italy in the twentieth century. Catholic printing houses (such as Maison de la Bonne Presse in France and Ars Sacra in Germany) produced large numbers of cards, and often a single design was printed by different companies in different countries.\n\nSpecial holy cards are printed for Roman Catholics to be distributed at funerals; these are \"In memoriam cards\", with details and often a photograph of the person whom they commemorate as well as prayers printed on the back. Other specialized holy cards record baptisms, confirmations, and other religious anniversaries. Others are not customized, and are circulated to promote the veneration of the saints and images they bear.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, some Protestants also produced similar images of their own. They produced \"Bible cards\" or \"Sunday school cards\", with lithographed illustrations depicting Bible stories and parables, more modern scenes of religious life or prayer, or sometimes just a Biblical text illuminated by calligraphy; these were linked to Biblical passages that related to the image. The reverse typically held a sermonette instead of a prayer. Imagery here was always the servant of text, and as such these Protestant cards tended to be replaced by tracts that emphasized message instead of imagery, and were illustrated with cartoon-like images if they were illustrated at all.\n\nThe \"Head of Christ\" painting has been printed more than 500 million times, including pocket-sized cards for carrying in a wallet. In the World War II era, \"millions of cards featuring the Head of Christ were distributed through the USO by the Salvation Army and the YMCA to members of the American armed forces stationed overseas\". During the Cold War, both Catholics and Protestants helped to popularize these cards, presenting \"a united front against the menace of godless Communism\".\n\nIn Ireland, cards are sold certifying that a Mass has been said for the benefit of sick or dead people, and are typically given to the family of the sick or dead person. Disputes arose over the validity of cards issued by priests living outside Ireland. Section 99 of the 2009 Charities Act regulates sales of Mass Cards, which can only be sold \"pursuant to an arrangement\" with a \"recognised person\", such as a Bishop, without stipulating whether that person had to be resident in Ireland or not. A court challenge to the new law by a business that sold 120,000 cards a year failed in late 2009. A breach of the law can result in a 10-year prison sentence or a €300,000 fine.\n\n\n\n"}

The iatromantis, a form of Greek shaman, is related to other semimythical figures such as Abaris, Aristeas, Epimenides, and Hermotimus.\nIn the classical period, Aeschylus uses the word to refer to Apollo and to Asclepius, Apollo's son.\n\nAccording to Peter Kingsley, \"iatromantis\" figures belonged to a wider Greek and Asian shamanic tradition with origins in Central Asia. A main ecstatic, meditative practice of these healer-prophets was incubation (ἐγκοίμησις, \"enkoimesis\"). More than just a medical technique, incubation reportedly allowed a human being to experience a fourth state of consciousness different from sleeping, dreaming, or ordinary waking: a state that Kingsley describes as “consciousness itself” and likens to the \"turiya\" or \"samādhi\" of the Indian yogic traditions. Kingsley identifies the Greek pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides as an \"iatromantis\". This identification has been described by Oxford academic Mitchell Miller as \"fascinating\" but also as \"very difficult to assess as a truth claim\".\n"}

His primary duty is to lead the Dratshang Lhentshog (Commission for the Monastic Affairs) of Bhutan, which oversees the Central Monastic Body, and to arbitrate on matters of doctrine, assisted by \"Five Lopen Rinpoches \" (learned masters). The Je Khenpo is also responsible for many important liturgical and religious duties across the country. The sitting Je Khenpo is also formally the leader of the southern branch of the Drukpa Kagyu sect, which is part of the Kagyu tradition of Himalayan Buddhism. Aside from the King of Bhutan, only the Je Khenpo may don a saffron kabney.\n\nAccording to the dual system of government established by Ngawang Namgyal in the 17th century, the powers of the government of Bhutan are ideally split between the religious branch, headed by the Je Khenpo, and the administrative branch, headed by the Druk Desi. The position of Je Khenpo is granted on merit by election, and typically is given to the most respected monk in the Dratshang Lhentshog (Commission for the Monastic Affairs). Thus, unlike reincarnation lineages such as the Dalai Lama, Zhabdrung Rinpoche, or Panchen Lama, the position of Je Khenpo is never held by a child but always by a seasoned monk.\n\nHistorically, the role of the Je Khenpo was quite powerful. The Je Khenpo and Druk Desi collaborated to disempower the office of the Zhabdrung through finding multiple incarnations of various aspects of the Zhabdrung; both the Je Khenpo and the Druk Desi wanted to retain the power they had accrued through the dual system of government. However, since the establishment of the monarchy in 1907, the relative influence of the Je Khenpo has diminished. Nonetheless, the position remains a powerful one and the Je Khenpo is typically viewed as the closest and most powerful advisor to the King of Bhutan.\n\nThe 67th Je Khenpo, Ngawang Thinley Lhundup, died at the age of 84 on 10 June 2005. He was noted as a strict disciplinarian who would not compromise any rules in managing the Central Monastic Body. In addition to his position as Je Khenpo, he was recognized as the tulku of Nyizergang, the seat of the tertön Woogpa Lingpa, in Wangdue Phodrang Province.\n\nThe 70th and present Je Khenpo is \"His Holiness Tulku\" Jigme Choedra. He is believed to be the reincarnation of Maitreya as well as the mahasiddha Saraha, Hungchen Kara, Kheuchung Lotsawa, and Pema Tsering.\n\nIn 2008, the office of the Je Khenpo was codified as part of the Constitution of Bhutan. Under Article 3 Section 4, the King appoints the Je Khenpo as the spiritual leader of Bhutan on the recommendation of the Five Lopons. In turn, the Je Khenpo appoints, on the recommendation of the Dratshang Lhentshog (Commission for the Monastic Affairs), monks with the nine qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in \"ked-dzog\" (stages of development and completion in Vajrayana practice) as the Five Lopons.\n\n"}

Also known as the Windmill Hill Cemetery, it is the site of the earliest known Jewish burials in Gibraltar. The cemetery opened by 1746 and closed in 1848. It is the burial site of a number of Gibraltar's Chief Rabbis. The graveyard is protected by the law of Gibraltar.\n\nJews' Gate Cemetery, also known as the Windmill Hill Cemetery, is located on Windmill Hill near the southern entrance to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve on the Rock of Gibraltar. It is positioned along Queen's Road, southeast of its junction with Engineer Road. That is also the location of the Pillars of Hercules Monument which depicts \"The Ancient World\" \"(see below)\". The earliest known Jewish burials in Gibraltar are located within the cemetery and date back to 1746. The cemetery closed for burials on 6 May 1848. A letter dated 31 May 1848 from the Colonial Secretary indicated that: \"The Governor has given conclusive orders that no more interments shall take place at the former Burial Ground above Wind Mill Hill but that all future Hebrew dead shall be deposited in the allotted portion of the New Cemetery.\"\n\nThe reason for this location for burials of members of the Jewish community is uncertain. One theory is that the more visible and accessible cemetery utilised by Christians, near the border with Spain, was more subject to the laws regarding expulsion of Jews, which had been mandated by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The best-preserved gravestones at Jews' Gate Cemetery are those that, until recently, were protected by a layer of mud and peat. The inscriptions on the limestone tombstones that have been exposed to the elements have become difficult to decipher. During half of the year, the winter and spring, plants are allowed to grow freely in the cemetery, in deference to the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society. The area is a favoured mating and nesting ground of the Barbary partridge; after their nesting season, the cemetery is cleared and the impression of neglect is removed.\n\nWithin the centre of the cemetery is a stone wall in height which encloses the burial sites of ten to twelve of Gibraltar's Judges of Religious Law. The oldest tomb of the Tsadikim (Righteous people) within the enclosure, at the far left, is that of Chief Rabbi Solomon Abudarham. He succeeded Rabbi Yehuda ben Yitshak Halevi as Gibraltar's Chief Rabbi. Abudarham inaugurated the Flemish Synagogue on Line Wall Road at the turn of the 19th century, laying the stone which still bears his name. He also established a school of religious study in Parliament Lane. Abudarham died in 1804, victim of a yellow fever epidemic. In 1820, the Academy of Rabbi Solomon Abudarham on Parliament Lane was converted into the Abudarham Synagogue. The inscription on his gravestone reads:\n\nThe second oldest tombstone is the third from the left. The grave is that of Rabbi Raphael Moshe Hassan, who died in 1810. His inscription is also legible and reads:\n\nThe fifth tomb from the left in the enclosure is that of Rabbi Avraham Haim Burgel, the son of Rabbi Nathan Burgel, author of \"Hok Natan\". The younger Burgel died in 1813. His epitaph is:\n\nRabbi Yeshaya Anahory also died in 1813, shortly after Rabbi Burgel. His tomb is within the far right of the walled enclosure. His inscription has been transcribed as:\n\nThe gravestone second from the left is that of Rabbi Yosef Elmalech ben Ayush. He first served as a rabbi in Morocco in 1788, and later accepted the position of Dayan (rabbinical judge) in Gibraltar, and remained there until his death in 1823. The fourth gravestone from the left is that of Rabbi Avraham Yisrael who died in 1844.\n\nIn the southern portion of the cemetery is a smaller enclosure with just a single grave, that of Rabbi Yisrael ben Yeshaya who died in 1841. After his death, the position of Chief Rabbi in Gibraltar remained open for four decades. Adjacent to the wall surrounding the rabbi's tomb, is that of Rabbi Yitshak Halevi III. He died in 1847, the year before the cemetery's closing. By then, there was little remaining space in the graveyard, which would make sense of the south-north orientation of his tomb, compared to the east-west alignment of other graves. Another grave within Jews' Gate Cemetery is that of Rabbi Raphael Hayyim Moses Benaim.\n\nIn 1989, the Gibraltar Heritage Trust designated the Jews' Gate Cemetery on Windmill Hill as a Category A Listed Building on Schedule 1, as noted in the Gibraltar Heritage Trust Act.\n\n"}

The stupa is also famous for its Buddhist relics, which were transferred to the U Khanti Hall at Mandalay Hill, in Mandalay, Burma after their discovery.\n\nAccording to Buddhists the building of the stupa was foretold by the Buddha:\n\nThe same story is repeated in a Khotanese scroll found at Dunhuang, which first described how Kanishka would arrive 400 years after the death of the Buddha. The account also describes how Kanishka came to raise his stupa: \n\nThe original Kushan stone stupa was probably built after the death of Kanishka the Great, between 150 and 300 CE, but probably circa 151 CE, with a shape similar to the contemporary Loriyan Tangai stupas and the addition of schist reliefs. \n\nThe stupa was rebuilt under Kushan rule in the 4th century CE into a cruciform stupa with a tower-like structure, with four staircases and four corner bastions, and possibly pillars at each corner. The stupa's symmetrically cross-shaped plinth measured , though the plinth had large staircases at each of the stupa's sides. In total, the base of the stupa may have spanned on each side. The plinth was likely decorated with sculpted reliefs, while niches built into the dome's four cardinal points was inlayed with precious stone. The tall wooden superstructure was built atop a decorated stone base, and crowned with a 13-layer copper-gilded \"chatra.\" Modern estimations suggest that the stupa had a height of .\n\nThe stupa was then destroyed by the White Huns during their invasion of the area in the 460s CE. \n\nThe stupa's wooden superstructure was rebuilt atop the stone base, and crowned with a 13-layer copper-gilded \"chatra.\" In the 5th century CE, stucco imagery was probably added to the site, in keeping with contemporary popularity for Buddhist imagery.\n\nSung Yun noted in the early 6th century that the tower had been struck by lightning at least three times, having been rebuilt after each strike. The tall stupa with a copper top acted as a lightning rod. This propensity to attract lightning strikes may explain the dearth of any surviving examples of wooden-tower stupas.\n\nThe stupa was discovered and excavated in 1908–1909 by a British archaeological mission under David Brainard Spooner, and led to the discovery in its base of the Kanishka casket, a six-sided rock crystal reliquary containing three small fragments of bone, relics of the Buddha (which were transferred to Mandalay, Burma and a dedication in Kharoshthi involving Kanishka.\n\nIn the 400s CE, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim \"Faxian\" visited the structure and described it as \"the highest of all the towers\" in the \"terrestrial world\", which ancient travelers claimed was up to tall, though modern estimates suggest a height of .\n\nIn 520 CE, Sung Yun describes the stupa in the following terms:- \n\nThe stupa is believed to have influence later constructions of \"tower stupas\" throughout ancient Turkistan. The construction of wooden towers topped with metal \"chatras\" made such buildings act as lightning rods, which could explain why such towers have all but disappeared.\n\nThe site has not been preserved. The location was re-identified in 2011. It is located outside the Gunj Gate of the old Walled City of Peshawar and is called Akhunabad.\n\n"}
{"id": "251226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251226", "title": "Kingdom Hall", "text": "Kingdom Hall\n\nA Kingdom Hall is a place of worship used by Jehovah's Witnesses. The term was first suggested in 1935 by Joseph Franklin Rutherford, then president of the Watch Tower Society, for a building in Hawaii. Rutherford's reasoning was that these buildings would be used for \"preaching the good news of the Kingdom\". Jehovah's Witnesses use Kingdom Halls for the majority of their worship and Bible instruction. Witnesses prefer the term \"Kingdom Hall\" over \"church\", noting that the term often translated \"church\" in the Bible refers to the congregation of people rather than a structure.\n\nKingdom Halls are typically modest, functional structures with practicality in mind. As Witnesses do not use religious symbols, such are not displayed on or in Kingdom Halls. An annual yeartext, or \"theme scripture\", which is the same for all congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, is prominently displayed in each Kingdom Hall. This text can be displayed in several languages if the Hall is used by foreign language congregations. A Kingdom Hall typically has a library, contribution boxes, and a literature counter, where publications are displayed, stored and dispensed.\n\nSome Kingdom Halls have multiple auditoriums to allow more than one congregation to conduct meetings simultaneously. Where there is more than one auditorium, each auditorium or the entire structure may be referred to as \"a Kingdom Hall\". Larger \"Assembly Halls\" or \"Convention Centers of Jehovah's Witnesses\", or any rented arena or stadium used for larger gatherings of Jehovah's Witnesses are also regarded 'as a large Kingdom Hall'; undignified behavior is considered inappropriate during their religious events, even if the facility is an entertainment venue.\n\nCongregations typically meet in their Kingdom Halls two days each week for worship. Meetings usually open and close with song and prayer. Meetings held in the Kingdom Hall include Bible readings and public talks on matters such as the Bible, family life, Christian qualities and prophecy. There are also discussions of specially prepared study articles in \"The Watchtower\" magazine and other publications of Jehovah's Witnesses. Witnesses also meet in Kingdom Halls for preparation and prayer before engaging in their door-to-door ministry.\n\nKingdom Halls may also be used to teach sign language or other foreign language classes. Kingdom Halls are also used for sessions especially developed for particular areas of service, such as the \"Pioneer Service School\" for full-time preachers, and the \"Kingdom Ministry School\" for elders and ministerial servants. In areas where the literacy rate is low, congregations may arrange to use Kingdom Halls to conduct literacy classes, which non-Witnesses may also attend.\nKingdom Halls may be used for wedding ceremonies of Witness-baptized couples. A couple sends a request in writing to the congregation's \"service committee\", which assesses whether the couple is \"in good standing, living in harmony with Bible principles and Jehovah’s righteous standards\" and that they also approve of the members of the couple's wedding party (that is, groomsmen and bridesmaids).\n\nJehovah's Witnesses attach no special significance to a Kingdom Hall wedding over a secular service, and Witness couples may choose to be married elsewhere for personal or practical reasons. Kingdom Halls are not used for wedding receptions or other social events.\n\nFuneral services may be held in a Kingdom Hall if the body of elders considers that \"the deceased had a clean reputation and was a member of the congregation or the minor child of a member\". The family of the deceased may ask any respected male member of the congregation to conduct the service, which involves a simple Bible-based discourse. Depending on family preference and local custom, a Kingdom Hall funeral may or may not have the casketed deceased present.\n\nDisaster relief efforts of Jehovah's Witnesses are typically channeled through permanent local Disaster Relief Committees under the various branch offices, and are staged at Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls as close as practical to the disaster area. Major disaster relief efforts include:\n\n\n\n\nThe construction crews of Kingdom Halls and larger Assembly Halls consist of volunteering Jehovah's Witnesses, sometimes from other countries, who have been pre-approved for work on construction sites.\n\nIn many countries, a number of standard designs for construction are used that can be built in just a few days. The act of constructing a Kingdom Hall in this manner is called a \"quick-build\", although typically the preparation work involving the structural foundation and surrounding surface may take several weeks prior to the scheduled build. For various reasons, not all Kingdom Halls are constructed as \"quick-builds\" or using the standard designs. There is however, a noticeably dominant architectural style of the Kingdom Hall which is often used based on standardized design concepts and models, depending on needs.\n\nA Kingdom Hall or Assembly Hall may be created by renovating an existing structure, such as a theater or non-Witness house of worship. In areas of repeated or reputed vandalism, particularly in cities, some Kingdom Halls are built without windows to reduce the risk of property damage.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced to elders in the United States that new Kingdom Halls worldwide would all be based on one of three similar design plans, depending on the required size.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses' branch offices appoint local Regional Building Committees (RBC) to oversee the construction and maintenance of their places of worship. The objective of such committees, which usually consist of five to seven persons, often with experience in the construction trades, is to coordinate the efforts of those involved so as to provide attractive and functional facilities that are financially viable.\n\nRBCs cooperate with local congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses seeking to build or renovate a place of worship, under the direction of the local branch office. Committees help in assessing the suitability of a possible construction site, purchasing the land and materials and coordinating the efforts of volunteers from the wider area. Members of a Regional Building Committee work voluntarily and receive no remuneration for their work.\n\nOn Saturday, January 31, 2015, in a special meeting with all elders in the United States via live video feed, it was announced that Regional Building Committees will be replaced by Local Design/Construction Department of the branch office, but with a more defined organizational structure.\n\nIn 1983, an arrangement was instituted whereby Kingdom Halls were financed by loans from the Watch Tower Society. In addition to contribution boxes for local congregation expenses and \"the worldwide work\", each congregation had a contribution box specifically for voluntary donations toward Kingdom Hall construction. These donations were pooled by the Watch Tower Society into the \"Society Kingdom Hall Fund\", which was used for financing the construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide, particularly in developing nations. When a congregation received local approval to build a new Kingdom Hall, the congregation could apply for a loan from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. The congregation repaid the loan to the Watch Tower Society, in addition to its continued contributions to the Kingdom Hall Fund. Interest was charged on the loans until September 2008.\n\nThe way Kingdom Halls are funded was significantly modified in 2014. The provision of Kingdom Hall loans from the Society was ceased, as was the separate \"Society Kingdom Hall Fund\". Instead, all congregations contribute an ongoing pre-determined amount to the branch office each month, in addition to donations for other purposes, into a single \"World Wide Work\" fund, and new Kingdom Halls are financed by the branch office. The stated purpose was so that areas without the resources for a new hall may be supplemented by funding from more affluent areas.\n\nRoutine maintenance of Kingdom Halls is performed by the members of the congregations that use them, typically according to a scheduled checklist. The \"Kingdom Hall operating committee\" oversees maintenance of the building; at least one elder or ministerial servant from each congregation is selected to be part of the operating committee. Kingdom Hall maintenance costs are covered by donations to a local fund.\n\n"}

It was created in July 1914, by Brother Déodat. He planned to create a miniature version of the grotto and basilica at Lourdes, the Rosary Basilica. Some articles in the \"Daily Mail\" said that it \"is the smallest functioning chapel in Europe, if not the world\". The chapel is non-denominational.\n\nThe chapel was originally built by Brother Déodat in March 1914 (measuring 9 feet long by 4.5 feet wide). After taking criticism from other brothers, Déodat demolished the chapel. He finished a second chapel in July 1914 (measuring 9 feet by 6 feet). However, when the Bishop of Portsmouth visited in 1923, he could not fit through the door, so Déodat again demolished it. The third and current version of the chapel started soon after the last demolition, and measures 16 feet by 9 feet. Déodat went to France in 1939 and died there, never having seen his chapel finished.\n\nIn 1977, a committee was established to restore the chapel, and today it falls under the care of Blanchelande College.\n\nIn 2010, five stained glass windows were smashed, causing £3,000 worth of damage and leading to condemnation of the vandals. The windows had been smashed previously, notably three times in 2003. The chapel has been described as \"probably the biggest tourist attraction in Guernsey\", and \"intricate\".\n\nIn late 2013, there was major work on the overgrowth which was, in places, hiding parts of the chapel.\n\nIn November 2015 it was closed to allow some major structural work to be undertaken. The works include underpinning the building, stabilising the foundations and weatherproofing the building, and are estimated to cost £500,000. Fundraising is being undertaken.\n\nFully open again to the public in April 2017, the major works such as stabilising the foundations are complete however additional fundraising is needed to finish the final phase of renovation.\n\nThe Little Chapel is decorated with seashells, pebbles, and broken china. \"From a distance the colours and design make a pleasing whole, close-up it's amazing to see all the different pieces used to create the effect.\" It has room for around eight people.\n\nThe chapel was brought sudden fame following a \"Daily Mirror\" article, which led to islanders donating coloured china; the Lieutenant-Governor of the island offered mother of pearl, and other gifts came from around the globe.\n\nThe mosaic style is \"\"pique-assiette\" or \"Picassiette\"\" (a French term based on a pun blending \"pique-assiette\" – literally, plate-pincher, the sort of person crashing into a party to enjoy a free meal – and famous artist Pablo Picasso).

{"id": "30862875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30862875", "title": "Manimekalai", "text": "Manimekalai\n\nManimekalai (), by the poet Chithalai Chathanar, is one of The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature according to later Tamil literary tradition. \"Manimekalai\" is a poem in 30 cantos. Its story is a sequel to another of the Five Great Epics, \"Silappatikaram\", and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who became a Buddhist Bikkuni.\n\nThere is some controversy about the exact date of this work. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar believed it must have been composed before the 5th century. Paula Richman believes it was composed in the 6th century CE. According to Hikosaka (1989), Manimekalai was written between A.D. 890 and 950, an inference based on linguistic assessment.\n\nThe aim of the author, Seethalai Saathanar (or Cīttalai Cāttanār) was to compare Buddhism favourably with the other prevailing religions in South India in order to propagate Buddhism. He criticizes and exposes the weaknesses of the other contemporary Indian religions, while praising the Buddha's Teaching, the Dharma, as the most perfect religion.\n\nAs a continuation of Silappatikaram (), this epic describes how Manimekalai, the beautiful daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, follower of local deities later included in Hinduism, converted to Buddhism. According to the poem, Maṇimekalai studies the six systems of philosophy of Hinduism and other prevalent religions of the time and compares them to the teachings of the Buddha. She is most impressed with Buddhism which treats everyone equal with loving kindness and fraternity. Later, upon hearing doctrinal expositions from the Buddhist teacher Bhikshu Aravaṇa Aḍigal, she becomes a dedicated Bhikshuni or Buddhist nun. Manimekhalai fully practices the Buddha's teachings and attains the highest stage of Buddhist spiritual knowledge or attainment, i.e. she became an arhant. The Manimekhalai poem thus is an example of female spiritual empowerment within a culture wherein otherwise there were few options for women. Pandit Iyothee Thass (1845-1914) revealed more about Manimekalai as \"Arachchelvi\" (Female Arhant) and documented some original poems written by Seeththalai Saththanar, which are not available in the Manimekalai as edited by U.V. Swaminatha Iyer who allegedly left out some of the original poems.\nThe epic gives much information on the history of Tamil Nadu, Buddhism and its place during that period, contemporary arts and culture, and the customs of the times. The exposition of the Buddhist doctrine in the poem deals elegantly with the Four Noble Truths (\"ārya-satyāni\"), Dependent Origination (\"pratītyasamutpāda\"), mind (citra) and Buddhist practices like virtue (\"Śīla\") and non-violence (\"ahimsa\").\n\nThe poem is set in both the harbour town of Kāveripattinam, the modern town of Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu, and in Nainatheevu of Nāga Nadu, a small sandy island of the Jaffna Peninsula in modern Sri Lanka. The story runs as follows: The dancer-courtesan Manimekalai is pursued by the amorous Cholan prince Udayakumāran, but rather wants to dedicate herself to a religious celibate life. The sea goddess Manimekala Theivam or Maṇimekhalā Devī puts her to sleep and takes to the island Maṇipallavam (Nainatheevu). After waking up and wandering about the island Maṇimekalai comes across the Dharma-seat, the seat on which Buddha had taught and appeased two warring Naga princes, which was placed there by the God Indra. Those who worship it miraculously know their previous life. Manimekalai automatically worships it and recollects what had happened in her previous life. \n\nShe then meets the guardian goddess of the Dharma seat, Deeva-Teelakai (Dvīpa Tilakā) who explains to her the significance of the Dharma seat and lets her acquire the magic never-failing begging bowl (cornucopia) called Amṛta Surabhi (”cow of abundance”), which will always provide food to alleviate hunger. The goddess also predicts that Bhikshu Aravaṇa Aḍigal in her native town will teach her more. Manimekalai then used the mantra which the sea goddess had given her and returns to Kāveripaṭṭinam, where she meets the Bhikshu Aravaṇa Aḍigal, who expounds her the Buddha's Teaching and advises her about the nature of life. She then becomes a Buddhist nun or Bhikshuni and practices to rid herself from the bondage of birth and death and attain Nirvāṇa.\n\n\nThe poem relates that the town Kāveripattinam or Puhār was swallowed up by the sea (i.e. destroyed by a tsunami or flood) due to the Cholan King not holding the annual Indra festival and thereby causing the wrath of the sea goddess Manimekalā. This account is supported by archaeological finds of submerged ruins off the coast of modern Poompuhar. Ancient ruins of a 4th-5th century Buddhist monastery, a Buddha statue, and a Buddhapāda (footprint of the Buddha) were also found in another section of the ancient city, now at Pallavanesvaram. The town of Kāveripaṭṭinam is believed to have disappeared between the 3rd and the 6th century CE.\n\nThe work contains no direct references to Mahāyāna as propagated by Nagarjuna, etc., and appears to be a work of an early Buddhist, Sravakayana school such as the Sthavira or Sautrantika school. The emphasis on \"the path of the Pitakas of the Great One\" (i.e. Tipitaka) and the exposition of Dependent Origination, etc., in Chapter 30, could suggest that it is work of the Sautrantika school. A.K. Warder instead suggests that the poem may be affiliated with the Theravada school.\n\nIn the conclusion of the poem, Aravaṇa Aḍigal encourages full liberation from the three roots of evil—greed, hatred and delusion (\"rāga, dosa, moha\"). The final sentence of the poem states that Maṇimekhalai strove to rid herself of the bondage of birth. This emphasis on liberation from the defilements (\"kilesa\"), ending the cycle of birth, old age and death (\"samsara\"), and becoming an arahant, also suggests that the author of the poem was affiliated to an early Sravakayana Buddhist school. Aiyangar (p. 80) suggests that the Buddhist logic as expounded by Aravaṇa Aḍigal in Chapter 29 of the \"Maṇimekhalai\" antedates the logic of Dignāga and his school.\n\nThe Manimekhalai is the only extant Tamil Buddhist literary work of what once was an extensive literature. The reason for its survival is probably its status as the sequel to the \"Silapathikaram\" or \"Sīlappadhikāram\". \nTamil Nadu produced many Buddhist teachers who made valuable contributions to Tamil, Pali and Sanskrit literature. Reference to their works is found in Tamil literature and other historical records.\n\nLost Tamil Buddhist works are the poem \"Kuṇḍalakesī\" by Nāgaguttanār, the grammar \"Vīrasoliyam\", the Abhidhamma work \"Siddhāntattokai\", the panegyric \"Tiruppadigam\", and the biography \"Bimbisāra Kadai\".\n\nThe first translation of \"Manimekalai\" by R. B. K. Aiyangar, was published in \"Maṇimekhalai in its Historical Setting\". Extracts of this were republished in Hisselle Dhammaratana's \"Buddhism in South India\" A more recent translation of the poem was done by Alain Daniélou with the collaboration of T.V. Gopala Iyer.\n\nThere is also a Japanese translation by Shuzo Matsunaga, published in 1991.\n\nU. V. Swaminatha Iyer (1855-1942 CE) resurrected the first three epics of Tamil literature from appalling neglect and wanton destruction of centuries. He reprinted this literature present in the palm leaf form to paper books. Ramaswami Mudaliar, a Tamil scholar first gave him the palm leaves of \"Civaka Cintamani\" to study. Being the first time, Swaminatha Iyer had to face a lot of difficulties in terms of interpreting, finding the missing leaves, textual errors and unfamiliar terms. He went for tiring journeys to remote villages in search of the missing manuscripts. After years of toil, he published \"Civaka Cintamani\" in book form in 1887 CE followed by \"Silapadikaram\" in 1892 CE and \"Manimekalai\" in 1898 CE. Along with the text, he added a lot of commentary and explanatory notes of terms, textual variations and approaches explaining the context.\n\nTo some critics, \"Manimekalai\" is more interesting than \"Silappadikaram\", but in terms of literary evaluation, it seems inferior. The story of Manimekalai with all its superficial elements seems to be of lesser interest to the author himself whose aim was pointed toward spreading Buddhism. In the former, ethics and religious doctrine are central, while in the latter poetry and storyline dominate. \"Manimekalai\" also criticizes Hinduism while preaching the ideals of Buddhism as it downplays human interests in favor of supernatural features. The narration in \"akaval\" meter moves on in \"Manimekalai\" without the relief of any lyric, which are the main features of \"Silappadikaram\". \n\n\"Manimekalai\" in puritan terms is not an epic poem, but a grave disquisition on philosophy. There are effusions in the form of a song or a dance, which style may not go well with western audiences as they are assessed to be inspired on the spur of the moment. According to Calcutta review, the three epics on the whole have no plot and no characterization for an epic genre. The plot of \"Civaka Cintamani\" is monotonous and deficient in variety in strength and character and does not stand the quality of an epic.\n\n\n"}

He did not live long enough to witness the implementation of his proclamation.\n\nMashhadi Jews living in the current Iranian diaspora remain steadfast in their community ties. Religion, community, and nationality are key components forming the identity of the Mashhadi Jewish community. Similar to many of their Jewish brethren, the Jews of Mashhad gravitated towards professions that allowed their trade skills to flourish. They were avid merchants, navigating the ancient Silk Road. Mashhadi Jews were held with the highest regard by Sunni Turkmen and Shiite Mashhadi tradesmen, because of their reputation for honorable and ethical business practices. The perils of travel subjected Mashhadi traders to freezing temperatures, murderous bandits, and limited means of transportation.\n\nDue to their occupations and the arduous conditions involved in their travels, Mashhadi men adopted a lifestyle which required spending several months to years on the road without their families. Modern Mashhadi men continue their forefathers’ unique tradition of working as traveling merchants to support their families. Mashhadi women have likewise upheld their matriarchal tradition of creating family and community cohesiveness by nurturing home, family, and community relationships. Unlike their female predecessors, modern Mashhadi women are exemplary businesswomen, who are heirs to the savvy trade skills of their ancestors.\n\nThe pivotal historic event that transformed an undefined group of Iranian Jews into an unfaltering community was the Allahdad (means “God’s Justice”) of 1839. Building social tensions and resentment and suspicion by Shiite Muslims of the Jewish inhabitants of Mashhad's Eydgah ghetto, culminated in an explosive event. A blood libel on the commemoration day of a holy Muslim Imam led to a devastating pogrom. On the eve of Mashhad's Allahdad (March 27, 1839), an estimated thirty-six Jews were killed and approximately seven Jewish girls were abducted to become Muslim child brides. Within the next twenty-four hours, under the risk of death, approximately three hundred Jewish families made the pretense of converting to Islam, under the advisement of their community leaders. The term Allahdad was coined by the forced converts to relate their past sins with the calamity they were enduring.\n\nFollowing the forced conversions, a number of Jewish families, unable to sustain the facade of Muslim faith, escaped to Herat, Afghanistan. Later on, from Afghanistan to Sub-Continent (Pakistan). Very few Mashhadi converts permanently assimilated to Islam. It is estimated that the remaining community members proceeded to live dual lives as crypto-Jews through the 1920s. During this time, the Jadid-al-Islam (a term meaning “New Muslims”) boasted of two known Sheikhs, fifty-seven known Hajjis, and twenty-one known Karbalais while preserving their secret Jewish identities. Their ties to the Islamic religion were complex at times.\n\nMashhadi families gradually migrated to Marv and surrounding areas of Czarist Turkmenistan, in an effort to escape persecution in Mashhad and look for better business opportunities in pre-communist Russia. The seemingly stable social and trade environment of Russia did not benefit them for long. In the fall of 1917, the Russian revolution caused the first return of Mashhadi Jews, from Marv to Mashhad. Mashhadis who remained in Russia, fell prey to Stalin's “purge of petit bourgeoisie” and some members of the community were imprisoned. In 1925, Reza Shah made an agreement with Stalin to exchange Iranian and Russian nationals. The imprisoned Mashhadis were released to return home, once again. A second blood libel in 1946 led the disenchanted community's gradual relocation to the tolerant cities of Tehran and Jerusalem, joining the few Mashhadi families who already resided there.\n\nWithin an eighty-year span, the Mashhadi community migrated at least five times to avoid persecution. Throughout this short period they migrated from Mashhad to Herat, Mashhad to Russia and back, Mashhad to Jerusalem and Tehran, ultimately fleeing during the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Mashhadi communities now exist in Israel, New York, Milan, Hamburg, London and Pakistan. In Pakistan, Mashhadi families are Muslims. Some of them are Shia and some of them are Sunnis.\n\nMashhadi youth have assumed their predecessors' ethos of primarily socializing and marrying within their community. This once necessary survival mechanism has transitioned to a comfortable modus operandi for today's Mashhadis. Many praise the modern Mashhadi community for their sense of unity, while some question their insular lifestyle. All perspectives undeniably credit the Mashhadi community for their fervor in upholding their Jewish heritage and traditions.\n\nThe resounding conclusion of the Mashhadi story is one that reflects their ability to protect their inherent Jewish religion. The unusual survival method of the Mashhadi crypto-Jews laid the foundation for a modern Mashhadi community who now safely and proudly practice Judaism.\n\nIranian Jews are considered to be the descendants of the Assyrian 722 B.C. and Babylonian Exiles 586 B.C. Within this diaspora, a smaller tribe of Jews evolved, due to their geographic setting in the city of Mashhad, and their robust community ties. \n\n"}

{"id": "53188524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53188524", "title": "Myōjin", "text": "Myōjin\n\nMyōjin (明神 'shining deity', 'illuminating deity', or 'apparent deity') or Daimyōjin (大明神 'great shining/apparent deity') was a title historically applied to Japanese (Shinto) deities (\"kami\") and, by metonymy, their shrines.\n\nThe term is thought to have been derived from \"myōjin\" (名神 'notable deity'), a title once granted by the imperial court to \"kami\" deemed to have particularly impressive power and virtue and/or have eminent, well-established shrines and cults. This term is first attested in the \"Shoku Nihongi\", where offerings from the kingdom of Bohai (Balhae) are stated to have been offered to \"the eminent shrines (名神社 \"myōjin-sha\") in each province\" in the year 730 (Tenpyō 2).\n\nAn epithet homophonous with this imperially bestowed title, \"shining/apparent \"kami\"\" (written with different Chinese characters), was in popular usage from around the Heian period up until the end of the Edo period, coexisting with titles with more explicit Buddhist overtones such as \"gongen\" (権現 'incarnation') or \"daibosatsu\" (大菩薩 'great bodhisattva').\n\nThe earliest recorded usages of 'shining/apparent deity' are found in sources such as in the \"Sumiyoshi-taisha Jindaiki\" (住吉大社神代記, \"The Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine's Records of the Age of the Gods\", supposedly compiled in the year 731 but thought to actually be of a much later date), which refers to the three Sumiyoshi deities as 'Sumiyoshi Daimyōjin' (住吉大明神), and the \"Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku\" (completed in 901), which refers to 'Matsuo Daimyōjin' (松尾大明神).\n\nWhile at first this title did not yet seem to have the Buddhist connotations that would later be associated with it, the connection between \"daimyōjin\" with the concept of \"honji suijaku\" (i.e. that the native \"kami\" are actually manifestations of Buddhist deities) was reinforced by an apocryphal utterance of the Buddha often claimed to be derived from the \"Karuṇāpuṇḍarīka-sūtra\" (悲華經 \"Compassionate Lotus Sutra\"; Japanese: \"Hikekyō\") quoted and alluded to in various medieval works, but which is not in the actual sutra's text: \"After I have passed into \"nirvana\", during the Latter Day of the Law, I shall appear as a great shining/apparent deity (大明神) and save all sentient beings.\"\n\nUp until the early modern period, use of titles such as \"myōjin\" or \"gongen\" for many deities and their shrines were so widespread that these gods were rarely referred to by their proper names. For instance, both the god of Kashima Shrine and the shrine itself were known as 'Kashima Daimyōjin' (鹿島大明神); the deity enshrined in Suwa Grand Shrine was called 'Suwa Daimyōjin' (諏訪(大)明神), and so on. (cf. Hachiman-daibosatsu (八幡大菩薩) or Kumano Gongen (熊野権現)). After his death, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was deified under the name 'Toyokuni Daimyōjin' (豊国大明神).\n\nUnder Yoshida Shintō, the conferral of ranks and titles like \"myōjin\" was institutionalized, with the sect issuing out authorization certificates to shrines for a fee. The sect considered the title to be higher than the overtly Buddhist \"gongen\" as part of the sect's inversion of \"honji suijaku\", an issue which became a point of contention with the Sannō Ichijitsu Shintō (山王一実神道) sect spearheaded by the Tendai monk Tenkai.\n\nWhen the Meiji government officially separated Shinto from Buddhism, official use of titles and terminology perceived as having Buddhist connotations such as \"(dai)myōjin\", \"(dai)gongen\" or \"daibosatsu\" by shrines were legally abolished and discouraged. However, a few deities/shrines are still often referred to as \"(dai)myōjin\" in popular usage even today. (E.g. Kanda Myōjin in Chiyoda, Tokyo, enshrining the deified vengeful spirit of Taira no Masakado).\n\n"}
{"id": "77231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77231", "title": "Ninhursag", "text": "Ninhursag\n\nNinḫursaĝ, also known as Damgalnuna or Ninmah, was the ancient Sumerian mother goddess of the mountains, and one of the seven great deities of Sumer. She is principally a fertility goddess. Temple hymn sources identify her as the \"true and great lady of heaven\" (possibly in relation to her standing on the mountain) and kings of Sumer were \"nourished by Ninhursag's milk\". Sometimes her hair is depicted in an omega shape and at times she wears a horned head-dress and tiered skirt, often with bow cases at her shoulders. Frequently she carries a mace or baton surmounted by an omega motif or a derivation, sometimes accompanied by a lion cub on a leash. She is the tutelary deity to several Sumerian leaders.\n\nNin-hursag means \"lady of the sacred mountain\" (from Sumerian NIN \"lady\" and ḪAR.SAG \"sacred mountain, foothill\", possibly a reference to the site of her temple, the E-Kur (House of mountain deeps) at Eridu. She had many names including Ninmah (\"Great Queen\"); Nintu (\"Lady of Birth\"); Mamma or Mami (mother); Aruru, Belet-Ili (lady of the gods, Akkadian)\n\nAccording to legend, her name was changed from Ninmah to Ninhursag by her son Ninurta in order to commemorate his creation of the mountains. As Ninmenna, according to a Babylonian investiture ritual, she placed the golden crown on the king in the \"Eanna\" temple.\n\nSome of the names above were once associated with independent goddesses (such as Ninmah and Ninmenna), who later became identified and merged with Ninhursag, and myths exist in which the name Ninhursag is not mentioned.\n\nPossibly included among the original mother goddesses was Damgalnuna (great wife of the prince) or Damkina (true wife), the consort of the god Enki. \nThe mother goddess had many epithets including \"shassuru\" or 'womb goddess', \"tabsut ili\" 'midwife of the gods', 'mother of all children' and 'mother of the gods'. In this role she is identified with Ki in the Enuma Elish. She had shrines in both Eridu and Kish.\n\nIn the legend of Enki and Ninhursag, Ninhursag bore a daughter to Enki called Ninsar (\"Lady Greenery\"). Through Enki, Ninsar bore a daughter Ninkurra. Ninkurra, in turn, bore Enki a daughter named Uttu. Enki then pursued Uttu, who was upset because he didn't care for her. Uttu, on her ancestress Ninhursag's advice buried Enki's seed in the earth, whereupon eight plants (the very first) sprung up. Enki, seeing the plants, ate them, and became ill in eight organs of his body. Ninhursag cured him, taking the plants into her body and giving birth to eight deities: Abu, Nintulla (Nintul), Ninsutu, Ninkasi, Nanshe (Nazi), Azimua, Ninti, and Enshag (Enshagag).\n\nIn the text 'Creator of the Hoe', she completed the birth of mankind after the heads had been uncovered by Enki's hoe.\n\nIn creation texts, Ninmah (another name for Ninhursag) acts as a midwife whilst the mother goddess Nammu makes different kinds of human individuals from lumps of clay at a feast given by Enki to celebrate the creation of humankind.\n\nHer symbol, resembling the Greek letter \"omega\" Ω, has been depicted in art from approximately 3000 BC, although more generally from the early second millennium BC. It appears on some boundary stones—on the upper tier, indicating her importance. The omega symbol is associated with the Egyptian cow goddess Hathor, and may represent a stylized womb. The symbol appears on very early imagery from Ancient Egypt. Hathor is at times depicted on a mountain, so it may be that the two goddesses are connected.\n\nHer temple, the Esagila (from Sumerian E (temple) + SAG (head) + ILA (lofty)) was located on the KUR of Eridu, although she also had a temple at Kish.\n\n\nMichael Jordan, Encyclopedia of Gods, Kyle Cathie Limited, 2002\n\n"}
{"id": "23591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23591", "title": "Panentheism", "text": "Panentheism\n\nPanentheism (meaning \"all-in-God\", from the Ancient Greek \"pân\", \"all\", \"en\", \"in\" and \"Theós\", \"God\") is the belief that the divine pervades and interpenetrates every part of the universe and also extends beyond time and space. The term was coined by the German philosopher Karl Krause in 1828 to distinguish the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed pantheism of Baruch Spinoza. Unlike pantheism, which holds that the divine and the universe are identical, panentheism maintains an ontological distinction between the divine and the non-divine and the significance of both.\n\n\nThe religious beliefs of Neoplatonism can be regarded as panentheistic. Plotinus taught that there was an ineffable transcendent God (\"the One\", \"to En\", τὸ Ἕν) of which subsequent realities were emanations. From \"the One\" emanates the Divine Mind (\"Nous\", Νοῦς) and the Cosmic Soul (\"Psyche\", Ψυχή). In Neoplatonism the world itself is God (according to Plato's Timaeus 37). This concept of divinity is associated with that of the \"Logos\" (Λόγος), which had originated centuries earlier with Heraclitus (c. 535–475 BC). The \"Logos\" pervades the cosmos, whereby all thoughts and all things originate, or as Heraclitus said: \"He who hears not me but the Logos will say: All is one.\" Neoplatonists such as Iamblichus attempted to reconcile this perspective by adding another hypostasis above the original monad of force or \"Dunamis\" (Δύναμις). This new all-pervasive monad encompassed all creation and its original uncreated emanations.\n\nBaruch Spinoza later claimed that \"Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.\" \"Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.\" Though Spinoza has been called the \"prophet\" and \"prince\" of pantheism, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg Spinoza states that: \"as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\". For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under two attributes of Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.\n\nAccording to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote \"Deus sive Natura\" (God or Nature) Spinoza did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence. Furthermore, Martial Guéroult suggested the term \"panentheism\", rather than \"pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, \"in\" God. Yet, American philosopher and self-described panentheist Charles Hartshorne referred to Spinoza's philosophy as \"classical pantheism\" and distinguished Spinoza's philosophy from panentheism.\n\nIn 1828, the German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781–1832) seeking to reconcile monotheism and pantheism, coined the term \"panentheism\" (from the Ancient Greek expression πᾶν ἐν θεῷ, \"pān en theṓ\", literally \"all in god\"). This conception of God influenced New England transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. The term was popularized by Charles Hartshorne in his development of process theology and has also been closely identified with the New Thought. The formalization of this term in the West in the 19th century was not new; philosophical treatises had been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia.\n\nPhilosophers who embraced panentheism have included Thomas Hill Green (1839–1882), James Ward (1843–1925), Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison (1856–1931) and Samuel Alexander (1859–1938). Beginning in the 1940s, Hartshorne examined numerous conceptions of God. He reviewed and discarded pantheism, deism, and pandeism in favor of panentheism, finding that such a \"doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations\". Hartshorne formulated God as a being who could become \"more perfect\": He has absolute perfection in categories for which absolute perfection is possible, and relative perfection (i. e., is superior to all others) in categories for which perfection cannot be precisely determined.\n\nEarliest reference to panentheistic thought in Hindu philosophy is in a creation myth contained in the later section of Rig Veda called the Purusha Sukta, which was compiled before 1100 BCE. The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the cosmos. It presents the nature of Purusha or the cosmic being as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it. From this being the sukta holds, the original creative will proceeds, by which this vast universe is projected in space and time.\n\nThe most influential and dominant school of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta, rejects theism and dualism by insisting that \"Brahman [ultimate reality] is without parts or attributes...one without a second.\" Since Brahman has no properties, contains no internal diversity and is identical with the whole reality it cannot be understood as an anthropomorphic personal God. The relationship between Brahman and the creation is often thought to be panentheistic.\n\nPanentheism is also expressed in the Bhagavad Gita. In verse IX.4, Krishna states: \n\nMany schools of Hindu thought espouse monistic theism, which is thought to be similar to a panentheistic viewpoint. Nimbarka's school of differential monism (Dvaitadvaita), Ramanuja's school of qualified monism (Vishistadvaita) and Saiva Siddhanta and Kashmir Shaivism are all considered to be panentheistic. Caitanya's Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which elucidates the doctrine of Acintya Bheda Abheda (inconceivable oneness and difference), is also thought to be panentheistic. In Kashmir Shaivism, all things are believed to be a manifestation of Universal Consciousness (Cit or Brahman). So from the point of view of this school, the phenomenal world (\"Śakti\") is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (\"Cit\"). Thus, Kashmir Shaivism is also propounding of theistic monism or panentheism.\n\nShaktism, or Tantra, is regarded as an Indian prototype of Panentheism. Shakti is considered to be the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy and dynamism, and the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Shiva is her transcendent masculine aspect, providing the divine ground of all being. \"There is no Shiva without Shakti, or Shakti without Shiva. The two ... in themselves are One.\" Thus, it is She who becomes the time and space, the cosmos, it is She who becomes the five elements, and thus all animate life and inanimate forms. She is the primordial energy that holds all creation and destruction, all cycles of birth and death, all laws of cause and effect within Herself, and yet is greater than the sum total of all these. She is transcendent, but becomes immanent as the cosmos (Mula Prakriti). She, the Primordial Energy, directly becomes Matter.\n\nTaoism says that all is part of the eternal tao, and that all interact through qi.\n\nThe Reverend Zen Master Soyen Shaku was the first Zen Buddhist Abbot to tour the United States in 1905–6. He wrote a series of essays collected into the book \"Zen For Americans\". In the essay titled \"The God Conception of Buddhism\" he attempts to explain how a Buddhist looks at the ultimate without an anthropomorphic God figure while still being able to relate to the term God in a Buddhist sense:\n\nAt the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much of Christianity, whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar, \"panentheism,\" according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and more than the totality of existence. \nThe essay then goes on to explain first utilizing the term \"God\" for the American audience to get an initial understanding of what he means by \"panentheism,\" and then discusses the terms that Buddhism uses in place of \"God\" such as Dharmakaya, Buddha or AdiBuddha, and Tathagata.\n\nPanentheism is also a feature of some Christian philosophical theologies and resonates strongly within the theological tradition of the Orthodox Church. It also appears in process theology. Process theological thinkers are generally regarded in the Christian West as unorthodox. Furthermore, process philosophical thought is widely believed to have paved the way for open theism, a movement that tends to associate itself primarily with the Evangelical branch of Protestantism, but is also generally considered unorthodox by most Evangelicals.\n\nIn Christianity, creation is not considered a literal \"part of\" God, and divinity is essentially distinct from creation (i.e., transcendent). There is, in other words, an irradicable difference between the uncreated (i. e., God) and the created (i. e., everything else). This does not mean, however, that the creation is wholly separated from God, because the creation exists in and from the divine energies. In Eastern Orthodoxy, these energies or operations are the natural activity of God and are in some sense identifiable with God, but at the same time the creation is wholly distinct from the divine essence. God creates the universe by His will and from His energies. It is, however, not an imprint or emanation of God's own essence (\"ousia\"), the essence He shares pre-eternally with His Word and Holy Spirit. Neither is it a directly literal outworking or effulgence of the divine, nor any other process which implies that creation is essentially God or a necessary part of God. The use of the term \"panentheism\" to describe the divine concept in Orthodox Christian theology is problematic for those who would insist that panentheism requires creation to be \"part of\" God.\n\nGod is not merely Creator of the universe, as His dynamic presence is necessary to sustain the existence of every created thing, small and great, visible and invisible. That is, God's energies maintain the existence of the created order and all created beings, even if those agencies have explicitly rejected him. His love for creation is such that He will not withdraw His presence, which would be the ultimate form of annihilation, not merely imposing death, but ending existence altogether. By this token, the entirety of creation is fundamentally \"good\" in its very being, and is not innately evil either in whole or in part. This does not deny the existence of spiritual or moral evil in a fallen universe, only the claim that it is an intrinsic property of creation. Sin results from the essential freedom of creatures to operate outside the divine order, not as a \"necessary\" consequence of having inherited human nature.\n\nMany Christians who believe in universalism – mainly expressed in the Universalist Church of America, originating, as a fusion of Pietist and Anabaptist influences, from the American colonies of the 18th century – hold panentheistic views of God in conjunction with their belief in \"apocatastasis\", also called universal reconciliation. Panentheistic Christian Universalists often believe that all creation's subsistence in God renders untenable the notion of final and permanent alienation from Him, citing Scriptural passages such as Ephesians 4:6 (\"[God] is over all and through all and in all\") and Romans 11:36 (\"from [God] and through him and to him are all things\") to justify both panentheism and universalism. Panentheism was also a major force in the Unitarian church for a long time, based in part on Ralph Waldo Emerson's concept of the Over-soul (from the synonymous essay of 1841).\n\nPanentheistic conceptions of God occur amongst some modern theologians. Process theology and Creation Spirituality, two recent developments in Christian theology, contain panentheistic ideas. Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000), who conjoined process theology with panentheism, maintained a lifelong membership in the Methodist church but was also a Unitarian. In later years he joined the Austin, Texas, Unitarian Universalist congregation and was an active participant in that church. Referring to the ideas such as Thomas Oord's ‘theocosmocentrism’ (2010), the soft panentheism of open theism, Keith Ward's comparative theology and John Polkinghorne's critical realism (2009), Raymond Potgieter observes distinctions such as dipolar and bipolar:\n\nThe former suggests two poles separated such as God influencing creation and it in turn its creator (Bangert 2006:168), whereas bipolarity completes God’s being implying interdependence between temporal and eternal poles. (Marbaniang 2011:133), in dealing with Whitehead’s approach, does not make this distinction. I use the term bipolar as a generic term to include suggestions of the structural definition of God’s transcendence and immanence; to for instance accommodate a present and future reality into which deity must reasonably fit and function, and yet maintain separation from this world and evil whilst remaining within it.\nSome argue that panentheism should also include the notion that God has always been related to some world or another, which denies the idea of creation out of nothing (\"creatio ex nihilo\"). Nazarene Methodist theologian Thomas Jay Oord (* 1965) advocates panentheism, but he uses the word \"theocosmocentrism\" to highlight the notion that God and some world or another are the primary conceptual starting blocks for eminently fruitful theology. This form of panentheism helps in overcoming the problem of evil and in proposing that God's love for the world is essential to who God is.\n\nThe Christian Church International also holds to a panentheist doctrine.\n\n\"Gnosticism\" is a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems prevalent in the first and second century AD. The teachings of the various gnostic groups were very diverse. In his \"Dictionary of Gnosticism\", Andrew Phillip Smith has written that some branches of Gnosticism taught a panentheistic view of reality, and held to the belief that God exists in the visible world only as sparks of spiritual \"light\". The goal of human existence is to know the sparks within oneself in order to return to God, who is in the Fullness (or Pleroma).\n\nGnosticism was panentheistic, believing that the true God is simultaneously both separate from the physical universe and present within it. As Jesus states in the Gospel of Thomas, \"I am the light that is over all things. I am all ... . Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.\" This seemingly contradictory interpretation of gnostic theology is not without controversy, since one interpretation of dualistic theology holds that a perfect God of pure spirit would not manifest himself through the fallen world of matter.\n\nManichaeism, being another gnostic sect, preached a very different doctrine in positioning the true Manichaean God against matter as well as other deities, that it described as enmeshed with the world, namely the gods of Jews, Christians and pagans. Nevertheless, this dualistic teaching included an elaborate cosmological myth that narrates the defeat of primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.\n\nValentinian Gnosticism taught that matter came about through emanations of the supreme being, even if to some this event is held to be more accidental than intentional. To other gnostics, these emanations were akin to the Sephirot of the Kabbalists and deliberate manifestations of a transcendent God through a complex system of intermediaries.\n\nWhile mainstream Rabbinic Judaism is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of Maimonides (c. 1135–1204), the panentheistic conception of God can be found among certain mystical Jewish traditions. A leading scholar of Kabbalah, Moshe Idel ascribes this doctrine to the kabbalistic system of Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (1522–1570) and in the eighteenth century to the Baal Shem Tov (c. 1700–1760), founder of the Hasidic movement, as well as his contemporaries, Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezeritch (died 1772), and Menahem Mendel, the Maggid of Bar. This may be said of many, if not most, subsequent Hasidic masters. There is some debate as to whether Isaac Luria (1534–1572) and Lurianic Kabbalah, with its doctrine of tzimtzum, can be regarded as panentheistic.\n\nAccording to Hasidism, the infinite Ein Sof is incorporeal and exists in a state that is both transcendent and immanent. This appears to be the view of non-Hasidic Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, as well. Hasidic Judaism merges the elite ideal of nullification to a transcendent God, via the intellectual articulation of inner dimensions through Kabbalah and with emphasis on the panentheistic divine immanence in everything.\n\nMany scholars would argue that \"panentheism\" is the best single-word description of the philosophical theology of Baruch Spinoza. It is therefore no surprise, that aspects of panentheism are also evident in the theology of Reconstructionist Judaism as presented in the writings of Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983), who was strongly influenced by Spinoza.\n\nSeveral Sufi saints and thinkers, primarily Ibn Arabi, held beliefs that have been considered panentheistic. These notions later took shape in the theory of wahdat ul-wujud (the Unity of All Things). Some Sufi Orders, notably the Bektashis and the Universal Sufi movement, continue to espouse panentheistic beliefs. Nizari Ismaili follow panentheism according to Ismaili doctrine. Nevertheless, some Shia Muslims also do believe in different degrees of Panentheism.\n\nAl-Qayyuum is a Name of God in the Qur'an which translates to \"The Self-Existing by Whom all subsist\". In Islam the universe can not exist if Allah doesn't exist, and it is only by His power which encompasses everything and which is everywhere that the universe can exist. In Ayaẗ al-Kursii God's throne is described as \"extending over the heavens and the earth\" and \"He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them\". This does not mean though that the universe is God, or that a creature (like a tree or an animal) is God, because those would be respectively pantheism, which is a heresy in traditional Islam, and the worst heresy in Islam, shirk (polytheism). God is separated by His creation but His creation can not survive without Him.\n\nThe Mesoamerican empires of the Mayas, Aztecs as well as the South American Incas (Tahuatinsuyu) have typically been characterized as polytheistic, with strong male and female deities. According to Charles C. Mann's history book \"\", only the lower classes of Aztec society were polytheistic. Philosopher James Maffie has argued that Aztec metaphysics was pantheistic rather than panentheistic, since Teotl was considered by Aztec philosophers to be the ultimate all-encompassing yet all-transcending force defined by its inherit duality.\n\nNative American beliefs in North America have been characterized as panentheistic in that there is an emphasis on a single, unified divine spirit that is manifest in each individual entity. (North American Native writers have also translated the word for God as the Great Mystery or as the Sacred Other) This concept is referred to by many as the Great Spirit. Philosopher J. Baird Callicott has described Lakota theology as panentheistic, in that the divine both transcends and is immanent in everything.\n\nOne exception can be modern Cherokee who are predominantly monotheistic but apparently not panentheistic; yet in older Cherokee traditions many observe both aspects of pantheism and panentheism, and are often not beholden to exclusivity, encompassing other spiritual traditions without contradiction, a common trait among some tribes in the Americas.\n\nThe Sikh gurus have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout. God is described in the Mool Mantar, the first passage in the Guru Granth Sahib, and the basic formula of the faith is:\n\n— ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥\n\n\"Ik Oankar Satnaam KartaaPurakh Nirbhau Nirvair AkaalMoorat Ajooni Saibhan GurPrasad\"\n\nOne primal being who made the sound (oan) that expanded and created the world. Truth is the name. Creative being personified. Without fear, without hate. Image of the undying. Beyond birth, self existent. By Guru's grace~\n\nGuru Arjan, the fifth guru of Sikhs, says, \"God is beyond colour and form, yet His/Her presence is clearly visible\" (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 74), and \"Nanak's Lord transcends the world as well as the scriptures of the east and the west, and yet He/She is clearly manifest\" (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 397).\n\nKnowledge of the ultimate Reality is not a matter for reason; it comes by revelation of the ultimate reality through nadar (grace) and by anubhava (mystical experience). Says Guru Nanak; \"budhi pathi na paiai bahu chaturaiai bhai milai mani bhane.\" This translates to \"He/She is not accessible through intellect, or through mere scholarship or cleverness at argument; He/She is met, when He/She pleases, through devotion\" (GG, 436).\n\nGuru Nanak prefixed the numeral one (ik) to it, making it Ik Oankar or Ek Oankar to stress God's oneness. God is named and known only through his Own immanent nature. The only name which can be said to truly fit God's transcendent state is SatNam ( Sat Sanskrit, Truth), the changeless and timeless Reality. God is transcendent and all-pervasive at the same time. Transcendence and immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality. The Reality is immanent in the entire creation, but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully. As says Guru Tegh Bahadur, Nanak IX, \"He has himself spread out His/Her Own “maya” (worldly illusion) which He oversees; many different forms He assumes in many colours, yet He stays independent of all\" (GG, 537).\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, God is described as a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. The connection between God and the world is that of the creator to his creation. God is understood to be independent of his creation, and that creation is dependent and contingent on God. Accordingly, the Bahá'í Faith is much more closely aligned with traditions of monotheism than panentheism. God is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. Instead, in the Bahá'í understanding, the world of creation emanates from God, in that all things have been realized by him and have attained to existence. Creation is seen as the expression of God's will in the contingent world, and every created thing is seen as a sign of God's sovereignty, and leading to knowledge of him; the signs of God are most particularly revealed in human beings.\n\nIn Konkōkyō, God is named “Tenchi Kane no Kami-Sama” which can mean “Golden spirit of the universe.” Kami(God) is also seen as infinitely loving and powerful.\n\nPeople associated with panentheism:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4723009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4723009", "title": "Perry Cox", "text": "Perry Cox\n\nDr. Percival Ulysses \"Perry\" Cox, M.D., is a fictional character played by John C. McGinley on the American television comedy-drama \"Scrubs\". Dr. Cox appeared in every episode except \"My Last Words,\" \"My Comedy Show,\" and \"My Full Moon,\" all in Season 8.\n\nMcGinley, Zach Braff, and Donald Faison were the only cast members who returned as regulars for Season 9.\n\nDr. Cox is sarcastic, bitter, cynical, uncaring, snobbish, and has a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants. At the beginning of the series, he is the chief attending physician at Sacred Heart Hospital; he is later promoted to residency director and, by the eighth season, to chief of medicine. In the ninth and final season, he becomes a professor when Sacred Heart is turned into a medical school. He is the superior and unwilling mentor of the series' protagonist, John \"J.D.\" Dorian (Zach Braff). He has a \"married but not married\" relationship with his ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), with whom he has a son, Jack, and a daughter, Jennifer Dylan. He treats virtually everyone in the hospital with derision, especially his longtime nemesis, Chief of Medicine Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).\n\nCox is athletic, often found playing basketball in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In \"My Friend the Doctor\", he shows off by slam-dunking a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, he tries to hide his injury. He is also extremely egocentric; when named by a magazine as the best doctor in the city, he lines up every staff member beneath him, and his ex-wife, to consecutively praise him.\n\nCox grew up in an Irish Catholic family and has a younger sister, Paige (Cheryl Hines). Their family was extremely dysfunctional; their father was an abusive alcoholic, and their mother did nothing to prevent the abuse. Cox has a strained relationship with his born-again Christian sister, who reminds him of the childhood he has tried to forget.\nIronically, while he goes out of his way to distance himself from others, Cox often gets mixed up in the lives of both his patients and those around him. This personal involvement often manifests in destructive ways, with Cox either internalizing his feelings or externalizing them by targeting those around him. Despite this, he has intervened in some situations, with no expectation of personal gain and often to his own detriment, to help others. A notable example is when he punches Kelso in the face in front of the entire staff when Kelso berates Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke).\n\nAccording to McGinley in the Season 1 DVD bonus features, Dr. Cox's habit of often touching his nose is a homage to Paul Newman's character in \"The Sting\", although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just a sign signifying \"it's going to be OK\", as it was used in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to Gregory House. This is further explored in \"My House\", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp. At the end of the episode, through a series of circumstances, Dr. Cox walks into the room where the other characters are sitting and in a very House-esque way, gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out through the whole episode.\n\nCox accepts the position of chief of medicine after Kelso retires. The position, however, does not come easily. He temporarily holds the position until the board finds a replacement, Dr. Taylor Maddox (Courteney Cox). After concluding that Dr. Maddox is, in fact, worse than Kelso, Dr. Cox teams up with the Janitor and Kelso to oust her. After Dr. Maddox is fired, the position is vacant until Dr. Kelso, behind Cox's back, recommends him for the job. Dr. Cox is initially hesitant to take the job out of fear of losing the connection he has with his patients. Although it takes a few days, Kelso convinces him to accept the position.\n\nIn the Season 2 DVD commentary of \"His Story\", series creator Bill Lawrence stated that one of Dr. Cox's quirks is that he knows if someone is standing behind him and who it is, without turning around to check. This quirk is defied in \"My Finale\" when J.D. stands behind Cox as he tells one of the new interns how he really feels; throughout the speech, he gives no sign that he knows that J.D. is behind him.\n\nHe is also a very good golfer, regularly besting Kelso.\n\nCox harbors an intense hatred for Hugh Jackman, mentioning him frequently in his rants about things he hates throughout the series. According to a 2006 interview with McGinley, Cox's reason for hating Jackman may be that Bill Lawrence envies the actor's talent.\n\nCox is occasionally seen wearing a Detroit Red Wings jersey. McGinley is a Red Wings fan and a close friend of former Detroit defenseman Chris Chelios, whose name can be seen on the back of Cox's jersey. He has also been seen wearing a T-shirt for Cheli's Chili Bar, a small chain of restaurants owned by Chelios.\n\nCox is a graduate of Hale University and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the former being a fictional adaptation of Yale University.\n\nDr. Cox is often seen drinking scotch and has acknowledged (humorously) that he has a drinking problem. Cox drinks so much that J.D. fears that Cox will die of liver disease. After making a mistake about a transplant patient that results in three deaths, a guilt-ridden Cox goes to work drunk and falls into a deep depression. J.D. eventually helps him forgive himself, however. His son Jack's first full sentence is \"Daddy drinks a lot\".\n\nDr. Cox constantly berates the residents, giving John \"J.D.\" Dorian female nicknames (e.g. \"Tiffany\", \"Jennifer\", \"Carol\", \"Betsy\", \"Lindsey\") and regularly calling him \"Newbie\". He also calls Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) \"Barbie\", Turk (Donald Faison) \"Gandhi\" and Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins) \"Bob-O\", \"Bobcat\", and \"Beelzebob\". The one person he openly admits to tolerating is head nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). Throughout Season 1, he and Turk compete for her affections, with Cox eventually bowing out when he sees that Turk and Carla are in love. In one episode, it is seen that Cox helped Turk with how to deal with women when they are mad, Turk eventually taking Perry's advice. Turk soon learns that Carla and Cox went on a date before Turk came to the hospital. Despite his contempt for Turk in early seasons, Cox develops a restrained level of respect for him, and even occasionally gets along with and relates to him. Being reluctant at first, he even appoints Turk as the Chief Surgeon of Sacred Heart. Cox makes this decision after being told by Kelso that his own promotions by Kelso were against the latter's personal disdain for Cox, yet Cox's excellent medical knowledge made him the best candidate nonetheless - a feature that Turk shares with Cox.\n\nHe berates Elliot almost as much as J.D., frequently making fun of her insecurity, hairstyle and WASP background. However, he has also been known to stand up for her: he punches Kelso in the face when he yells at her in front of the staff.\n\nCox despises Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine. They disagree constantly about the best way to provide care, with Cox advocating for patients and Kelso adhering to the hospital's bottom line. At one point, he even punches Kelso in the face. On occasion, however, they have acknowledged the necessity of the other's position, and Kelso has admitted that they need each other. When Kelso retires and Cox succeeds him as chief of medicine, Cox confides in him about the pressures of the job, and the two form a \"secret friendship\".\n\nWhile Dr. Cox has had limited interactions with veteran nurse Laverne Roberts (Aloma Wright), his cynicism drives him to mock her strong religious beliefs on occasion. This culminates in Cox confronting her about a seemingly \"miraculous\" accident, unwilling to accept it as divine intervention. Visibly upset, Laverne replies that after 24 years as a nurse, she has to believe in a \"bigger plan\", otherwise she'd lose all hope. Taken aback, Cox uncharacteristically apologizes and sincerely replies that he wishes he could also believe that. When she dies in the following episode, he joins the rest of the staff in bidding her farewell and drinking in her honor.\n\nHe berates J.D. from their first meeting and emphatically denies being his mentor, despite J.D.'s repeated attempts to win his favor. Nonetheless, Cox has shown concern for J.D.'s welfare, such as telling him not to blame himself for a patient's death and (reluctantly) comforting him when his father dies. He also tells J.D. that he trusts him as a doctor and a person and has taken an interest in him from the start because he seems \"to actually give a crap\". Cox also recommends him as a promising, skilled, and hard-working doctor to a review board. In \"My Finale\", Cox finally admits that he considers J.D. a talented doctor, a good person, and a friend, although he has to be tricked to do it. He refuses to say this directly to J.D. or to hug him. A flash-forward scene at the end of the episode suggests that Cox will be a part of J.D.'s life well into the future (reluctantly, of course).\n\nIn the ninth season, Sacred Heart has become a medical school, and Cox is hired as a professor. He immediately begins berating the series' new protagonist, Lucy Bennett (Kerry Bishé), and takes an interest in one of his students, Drew Suffin (Michael Mosley). He calls the latter \"Number 1\" and makes him his protégé, much to J.D.'s chagrin. However, he still provides advice and support to J.D. (albeit in his usual sarcastic fashion) by telling him that he has to learn to let his students make their own mistakes.\n\nCox's family is from Pittsburgh. He has a sister, Paige (Cheryl Hines), who is a born-again Christian. Cox is presented as an ardent skeptic who says that he does not \"technically believe\" in God. His political views are varied; he has expressed disdain for members of both political parties, as well as \"registered Independents\". He opposes the Iraq War and is disgusted when Elliot reveals that she is a Republican. He also uses \"Republican\" as an insult for Paige.\n\nCox's father was an abusive alcoholic, and his mother would \"watch silently while he drunkenly knocked [Dr. Cox and Paige] from room to room.\" At the end of one episode, he admits to his sister that seeing her reminds him of the childhood he has tried so hard to forget.\n\nCox was apparently legally divorced from Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller Lawrence), but the two have lived together in an exclusive relationship since Jordan discovered she was pregnant. As revealed in flashbacks, the marriage appears to have started out strongly, but went downhill and eventually ended when Jordan slept with Dr. Cox's then-protégé Peter Fisher (Jay Mohr). Later in the series, it is revealed that Ted did not submit the divorce papers properly, so Cox and Jordan have been married during the entire run of the show. They immediately resume the role of husband and wife since they have already reconciled, but they quickly become dissatisfied with being an ordinary married couple, so they agree to go back to acting as though they were divorced, even going so far as to actually legally divorce with Ted (again) ending their marriage. In later seasons, Cox quietly resumes wearing his wedding ring, and Jordan soon acquiesces to the marriage title after the birth of their second child, and it is implied that they have remarried.\n\nHe has two children with Jordan: a son named Jack and, after an unsuccessful vasectomy, a daughter named Jennifer Dylan (J.D.). Jack is played by Andrew Miller and his twin brother (although in a cameo appearance in \"My Missed Perception\", he is played by Bill Lawrence and Christa Miller's son, William). When Jordan first becomes pregnant with Jack, she tells Cox that she was impregnated by a Greek bellboy, wanting Cox to stay because he wants to rather than out of obligation to his child. At first, Cox feels nothing for the then-nameless boy, but begins to feel a connection after the child responds to the name Jack, which Cox had been trying to impress upon him for some time. J.D.'s college friend Spencer (Ryan Reynolds) accidentally tells Cox that he is actually Jack's biological father, and he takes on the role of father much more seriously. Cox has a very unorthodox way of raising Jack, often treating him like his \"drinking buddy\". Nonetheless, Cox loves his son and tries fervently to be a better father than his own was. He often talks to Jack in lieu of a therapist. He also dotes on his daughter; among other things, he goes far out of his way to have someone else give her a shot so that she will not associate him with pain.\n\nCox is best friends with Jordan's brother, Ben (Brendan Fraser), and is hit hard when he is diagnosed with leukemia; he is initially too afraid to treat him because he fears he will lose him. He rallies, however, and helps Ben go into remission. Ben dies in the episode \"My Screw Up\", but Cox convinces himself that he is still alive. When he finally admits that Ben is dead, he is devastated, and uncharacteristically allows people to comfort him at the funeral.\n"}

Like most Christian churches in Ireland, it is organised on an all-island basis, in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The church has approximately 225,000 members.\n\nThe Church has a membership of approximately 225,000 people in 536 in 403 charges across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. About 96% of the membership is in Northern Ireland. It is the second largest church in Northern Ireland, the first being the Roman Catholic Church. In the Republic the church is the second largest Protestant denomination, after the Church of Ireland. All the congregations of the church are represented up to the General Assembly (the church's government).\n\nPresbyterianism in Ireland dates from the time of the Plantation of Ulster in 1610. During the reign of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) a large number of Scottish Presbyterians emigrated to Ireland. The first move away from the Church of Scotland, of which the Presbyterians in Ireland were part, saw the creation of the Presbytery of Ulster in 1642 by chaplains of a Scottish Covenanter army which had arrived to protect the mostly Protestant British (Scottish and English) settlers in Ulster and to crush the Irish Rebellion of 1641 threatening these settlers. It succeeded in protecting the settlers, but failed abysmally to crush the rebellion. Under the more secure protection of Cromwell congregations multiplied and new presbyteries were formed. However, after the Restoration, nonconforming ministers were removed from parishes of the Established Church, but no matter the opinions of the king on religion, the Irish administration could not afford to alienate such a substantial Protestant population and Presbyterianism was allowed to continue in the country, with the stipends of ministers paid through the \"regium donum\" – literally 'the King's gift'.\n\nWilliam III rewarded Presbyterian support against James II (James VII of Scotland) with an increase in the \"regium donum\". From the 1690s, Presbyterian congregations, now organised in the Synod of Ulster, enjoyed practical freedom of religion, confirmed by the Toleration Act of 1719. However, their members remained very conscious both of continuing legal disabilities under the penal laws and of economic hardship as many were tenant farmers and objected to the payment of tithes to support the Church of Ireland. Throughout the eighteenth century, many Presbyterians were involved in movements for reform, which culminated with their prominent involvement in the United Irishmen.\n\nThe eighteenth century saw significant tensions within the Synod of Ulster, which was divided between the Old Lights and the New Lights. The Old Lights were conservative Calvinists who believed that ministers and ordinands should subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith. The New Lights were more liberal and were unhappy with the Westminster Confession and did not require ministers to subscribe to it. The New lights dominated the Synod of Ulster during the eighteenth century, allowing the more conservative Scottish Presbyterian dissenters, Seceders and Covenanters to establish a strong presence in Ulster.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, a belief that some of those who did not subscribe to the Westminster Confession were in fact Arian provoked a new phase of the conflict. This ended when seventeen ministers opposed to subscription seceded with their congregations to form the Remonstrant Synod. This led to the restoration of obligatory subscription to the Westminster Confession within the Synod of Ulster and facilitated union with the Seceders in 1840 to create the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, whose first moderator was Dr Samuel Hanna. The united church was active in missionary activity both at home and abroad, particularly benefitting from the evangelical Ulster Revival of 1859.\n\nThe headquarters of the church are at Assembly Buildings, Fisherwick Place, Belfast, which were extensively renovated as part of a multimillion-pound project in 2010–2012. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, a founding member of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, has 540 in 19 presbyteries across Ireland. The church's two nineteenth century theological colleges, Magee College (Derry) and Assembly's College (Belfast), merged in 1978 to form Union Theological College in Belfast. Union offers post-graduate education to the denomination's candidates for the full-time ministry.\n\nUntil 2007 the church was connected to a credit union, Presbyterian Mutual, that collapsed with the savings of almost 10,000 members, almost all of whom were also members of the church.\n\nThe PCI is involved in education, evangelism, social service and mission in a number of areas around the world:\n\n\nApart from the seats for worshippers, the inside of a Presbyterian church is dominated by four items of furniture.\n\n\nThe Word of God is central in the Presbyterian Church, along with Prayer and Praise. The worship is a mix of prayers, hymns, psalms, paraphrases, Scripture readings and sermons. In recent years, psalms and paraphrases have been used less but are still an important part of worship. The order of service varies from church to church but it generally involves a hymn, followed by a prayer, followed by a children's address and a children's hymn. This is then followed by an expository sermon by the minister and another hymn, then another prayer and a closing hymn. Many Presbyterian churches mix Psalms and formal hymns with choruses, suitable for children, and many churches now have praise bands with a variety of instruments, as well as the traditional organ.\n\nThe motto of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland is \"Ardens sed Virens\" – \"burning but flourishing\". It is usually seen alongside the Burning Bush, the church's symbol. A burning bush was included in the more modern logo (top).\n\nAccording to the Bible, in Exodus 3:2, Moses heard the voice of God coming from a burning bush that was not consumed by fire. This occurred after he had to flee Egypt, and was when he was called to go and demand the release of the Israelites.\n\nThe Presbyterian church has been active in commenting on a variety of social issues within and outside the denomination. In May 2006, the church's press officer announced that ministers could bless same-gender civil partnerships. However, in June 2006, the General Assembly (GA) voted to ban its ministers from blessing same-gender relationships reversing the previous announcement. In 2015, the church voiced its opposition to the legalisation of gay marriage. On women's issues, the church ordains women as ministers. On life issues, the denomination opposes abortion except for when the woman's life is in danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Additionally, military chaplains themselves are sometimes regarded as \"symbols of faith\" for military personnel who face challenges to their faith and values.\n\nOn July 29, 1775, the Continental Congress established the military chaplaincy, but chaplains did not wear insignia until 1880.\n\nAlthough the Latin cross has long been the symbol for the majority of United States military chaplains, this first official chaplain insignia was the \"shepherd's crook\" (staff). Authorized in General Order Number 10, and remaining in force for the period February 13, 1880 – May 5, 1888, it was described as \"embroidered frosted silver bullion in center of black velvet shoulder straps, and was considered appropriate for both the frock coat or undress uniform.\" The plain \"Latin cross\" (silver on dark-blue shoulder straps) became the authorized chaplain insignia in 1898, replacing the shepherd's crook. Today, despite the fact that the shepherd's crook is no longer used as an insignia for individual chaplains, it is included in the design of the Chaplain Corps regimental insignia in honor of its place in Army Chaplain Corps history.\n\nJewish chaplains were first authorized to serve during the Civil War, but it was during World War I that the issue of insignia reached the army, when Congressman Isaac Siegel from New York petitioned the army that rabbis serving in uniform be permitted to wear \"some other insignia in place of the cross.\"\n\nWithin two weeks of receiving this request, the army issued a directive stating that \"Objections having been made to Jewish Chaplains wearing the prescribed insignia, you are authorized by the Secretary of War to omit the prescribed insignia\" (the cross).\n\nHowever, after battlefront reports indicated that difficulties arose from the fact that Jewish chaplains wore no insignia, the army began to look into various proposals, including a continuation of the practice of having Jewish chaplains wear no insignia, to the creation of a separate insignia for them, to a return to the shepherd's crook as a shared symbol for all chaplains. General Henry Jerver, acting assistant chief of staff for the army favored the third alternative, and within weeks of his decision this became the official policy for the Army. However, many Christian chaplains opposed this change of policy, and in August 1918 General Pershing cabled the War Department to inform it of this opposition. Not all Christian chaplains opposed the idea of a universal symbol, and some went on record agreeing with the statement of one chaplain that \"I am a chaplain of the Christian faith, but I welcome the change. The shepherd's crook is symbolic of the chaplain's work.\"\n\nReturning to a consideration of the three options of no insignia for Jewish chaplains, a shared insignia, or a separate insignia, the army opted for a separate Jewish chaplain insignia that included an image of the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, using Roman numerals to indicate the commandments, with a small six-pointed Jewish star on top of the tablets. Other symbols considered included a six-pointed star (hexagram), which was rejected by the army because it could too easily be confused with the 5-pointed star worn by generals; a seven-branched candelabra (Menorah); and two \"Lions of Judah\" supporting the six-pointed star.\n\nThis symbol would remain the insignia for Jewish chaplains until 1981, when the navy changed its insignia to include the first ten letters of the Hebrew alphabet—to replace the Roman numerals—and both the army and the air force followed suit. While the official change to Hebrew letters became official November 9, 1981 Jewish chaplains were not required to make the uniform change until January 1, 1983.\n\nInsignia decisions for chaplains representing faith groups other than Christianity and Judaism have not been made unilaterally by the army, but instead have been joint decisions for all military chaplains.\n\nThe Continental Navy, predecessor of the United States Navy, was approved by the United States Congress on October 13, 1775, with navy regulations (adopted November 28, 1775) that included as its second article: \"The Commanders of the ships of the thirteen United Colonies are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent.\" But, while the need for navy chaplains was recognized from the beginning, attitudes and policies toward navy uniforms or insignia for its chaplains went through many changes before final decisions were made. 1847 navy regulations did authorize chaplains to wear a blue uniform with black collar and cuffs with no insignia, and later, in 1864, chaplains were provided the same uniform as other staff officers, with the use of a silver cross as a corps device.\n\nHowever, regulations for navy chaplain uniforms and insignias changed a number of times over the following years: 1869–1876, when chaplains were considered as officers without rank, they wore the cross without any additional \"sleeve lace\"; in 1876, uniforms were no longer authorized for chaplains, who were to wear either civilian clothing or the vestments appropriate to their faith group; in 1883, the uniform became an option for chaplains, with the cross; and then in 1894, the epaulets and passants were removed so that chaplain uniforms had no insignia at all, neither any that indicated they were officers nor even the cross signifying that they were chaplains.\n\nIt was not until 1905 that the navy uniform code included a permanent regulation for chaplains: along with ranks equivalent to line officers, they were to wear naval officer's uniforms with the sleeve braid in \"lustrous black\" (not gold, like that of other officers), and to wear both the officer rank insignia and a gold cross. In 1918, naval staff corps rules were changed, and the distinctive black braid of chaplains was replaced by the same gold braid worn by other officers, along with the Latin cross.\n\nThe navy policy on insignia for Jewish chaplains was not resolved as quickly as it was in the army. When Rabbi David Goldberg entered the navy October 30, 1917, receiving orders after basic training to report to the , he asked a senior chaplain about the fact that he was told to wear the Latin cross, receiving the response that \"the men understood that he wore the insignia of the corps and not his faith group.\" Goldberg wore the cross throughout the time he served on the ship, but after reporting to his next assignment ashore the combination of his shipboard experience and the number of letters he received from rabbinic colleagues objecting to his wearing a cross finally led to his petitioning the navy in 1918 to allow him to wear the Star of David instead.\n\nWhen Goldberg's request to wear the six-pointed star was rejected—based on the same fears the army had that a six-pointed star would be too similar to the five-pointed star worn by flag officers—he recommended the shepherd's crook as a universal symbol, a recommendation that met with opposition from many Christian chaplains. However, the Navy did authorize Goldberg to wear that symbol himself, in place of the cross. Goldberg wore this insignia until the end of World War II, when navy policy eventually changed to allow navy Jewish chaplains to wear the tablets and the star, the same insignia worn by Jewish chaplains in the army. This change took place in 1941, after only two Jewish chaplains (Goldberg and Harold Strauss) had worn the Shepherd's Crook insignia.\n\nAlthough the shepherd's crook has not been used as a chaplain insignia since that time, the term used for the active duty chaplain with the earliest appointment is the \"Gray Shepherd.\"\n\nAs in the case of the army, decisions about chaplain faith group insignia after those made regarding Jewish chaplains (the original decision and the later decision to change Roman numerals to Hebrew letters) have not been made unilaterally by the navy, but instead have been joint decisions for all military chaplains.\n\nNavy chaplains also serve Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine. Although they have the option of wearing marine corps or coast guard uniforms when assigned to their respective units, the chaplain corps insignia remain that of the navy.\n\nThe United States Merchant Marine is a civilian auxiliary of the United States Navy, but in accordance with the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 its members are considered military personnel during times of war when the merchant marine comes under the navy. Until World War I, merchant mariners did not wear uniforms, but they were introduced in 1919, because \"young Americans now entering the merchant service have more regards for themselves and their job when wearing a uniform, and that the merchant sailor commands greater respect when ashore, either at home or in foreign ports, if in uniform. The uniform introduced in 1919 was based on U.S. Navy uniforms with enough differences to distinguish between the two services, including wreaths for officers on cap and sleeve insignia and shoulder boards. Chaplain insignia with the wreaths were created around 1943, at a time when merchant marine officers were drawn from the civilian population, including many retired coast guard and navy officers.\nToday, when active-duty Navy chaplains serve with the USMM, such as the two stationed at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, they wear standard navy uniforms and insignia\n\nOn July 28, 1942, Chaplain Charles Carpenter was appointed to the newly created position of air chaplain for the Army Air Force, within the larger United States Army organization. Later, when the United States Air Force was established as a separate service on September 18, 1947, the original plan was that chaplain support would continue to be provided by Army chaplains. However, on May 10, 1949, the decision was made that the still new branch of the military would have its own chaplains. At that point, chaplains serving with the Air Force began to wear Air Force uniforms, but continued to use the same Jewish and Christian Chaplain Corps insignia that had been used by the Army. In 1981, when the Navy approved the change to the Jewish chaplain insignia, from Roman numerals to Hebrew letters, both the Army and Air Force made the same change soon thereafter. Since then, the approval of insignia to represent chaplains of other faith groups has been made jointly by of all branches of the United States Armed Forces. However, while the designs for the insignia are the same for all services, the Air Force categorizes the insignia as \"occupational badges,\" with different \"wear use\" rules than the other services.\n\nAdditionally, while the Civil Air Patrol chaplain program is a separate organization than the USAF Chaplain Corps, it was established in 1950 under the guidance of the Air Force chief of chaplains and \"is modeled after the Air Force Chaplain Service,\" and follows the same rules for faith group insignia.\n\nOther than the short period 1880–1888 when all army chaplains wore the Shepherd's Crook, the Latin cross (also referred to as the \"Christian cross\") has been the symbol for all Christian chaplains, regardless of denomination, although in some other nation's military forces, separate symbols are used for some Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant Chaplains, and sometimes for specific groups within the larger Protestant faith group, such as Calvinist Chaplains, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs includes a number of different denominational versions of the cross on gravestones in veterans cemeteries.\n\nSome Christian groups, like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), do not normally use the symbol of the cross—but do accept it as the uniform insignia for Christian military chaplains. So for example, the LDS Church teaches that its members \"remember with reverence the suffering of the Savior. But because the Savior lives, we do not use the symbol of His death as the symbol of our faith,\" and therefore \"The only members of the Church who wear the symbol of the cross are Latter-day Saint chaplains, who wear it on their military uniforms to show that they are Christian chaplains.\" Similarly, because the cross is not normally a symbol used by the Unitarian Universalist Church (UU), an article on military chaplains written for members of that religious group had to explain that \"UUs in the military are considered Protestants, and wear crosses.\"\n\nIn 2008, Michael Hiles, a clergyman reporting for training as a Navy chaplain candidate identified himself as a Messianic Jew (a Jew who accepts Christian theological views regarding Jesus, including the changes to Judaism such beliefs entail), requesting that he still be permitted to wear the insignia of a Jewish chaplain. The November 26, 2008 decision from Vice Admiral Mark E. Ferguson, president of the Navy Uniform Board and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education, was that Hiles would be required to wear the cross linked to his Christian (and non-Jewish) faith beliefs. Given the choice of wearing the cross or given the right to withdraw from training, he chose the latter.\n\nThe Jewish Chaplain insignia made up of two tablets of the Ten Commandments, with ten Roman numerals symbolizing the commandments, and with the six-pointed Star of David above the tablets, was adopted for Jewish army chaplains in 1917, and for Jewish naval chaplains in 1941. The original Army description did not specifically reference a star \"per se\", but instead read \"a double Tablet bearing numerals from I to X, surmounted by two equilateral Triangles interlaced.\"\n\nBefore the tablets-and-star design was approved for United States Navy Jewish chaplains, only two Jewish chaplains wore the Shepherd's Crook insignia: Chaplain David Goldberg, during WWI, and Chaplain Harold Strauss, 1931–1941. Beginning in 1917, Goldberg first wore the cross—the original symbol for all navy chaplains—until receiving permission to wear the Shepherd's Crook instead.\n\nOn August 5, 1980, Navy Chief of Chaplains Rear Admiral Ross Trower convened a blue ribbon panel made up of Jewish chaplains to consider the \"beneficial suggestion\" made to the Navy to change the Roman numerals to Hebrew letters. The question had been raised before and not all Jewish authorities were in favor of the change because of the concern that the insignia might be considered \"holy\"—\"even mildly holy\"—because of the presence of Hebrew writing. In fact, in a 1972 responsum from the National Jewish Welfare Board authored by Rabbi Solomon Freehof, he recommended maintaining Roman numerals although he did state that when it came to using Hebrew letters simply to indicate numbers, \"there is no strict law against it.\" Nevertheless, based on the panel's unanimous 1980 recommendation to make the change, Chaplain Trower made the formal recommendation to the President of the Navy Uniform Board that the Navy should make the change unilaterally, without the additional time that would be required for all services to study the question. Included in his recommendation was the statement that\nThe President of the Navy Uniform Board approved the change on December 17, 1980, with the army and air force quickly approving the change as well. (Note that the Roman numeral version read left to right, with the first five numerals on the left tablet and the second five on the right; the Hebrew reads right to left, with the first five numerals on the right and the second five on the left, as per Jewish tradition. Jewish tradition states that the tablets had flat tops and may even have been square instead of rectangular, but the Christian-influenced rectangular tablets with round tops is nonetheless very frequently found in Jewish art and synagogues, and was not objected to here either.) The new insignia was authorized for wear from 1981, with a grace period authorized to allow Jewish chaplains to make the required uniform changes by January 1, 1983.\n\nOn December 14, 1992, the Army Chief of Chaplains requested that an insignia be created for future Muslim chaplains, and the design (a crescent) was completed January 8, 1993.\n\nIn 1990 the Army made the decision to create an insignia for future Buddhist chaplains, and the Armed Forces Chaplains Board (the board made up of the three Chiefs of Chaplains and active-duty Deputy Chiefs of Chaplains for the Army, Navy, and Air Force) began working with the Army's Institute of Heraldry. The design was completed in August 1990, representing the dharmacakra (the \"wheel of dharma\" or sometimes, \"wheel of law\"), an eight-spoked wheel \"representative of religious observances.\"\n\nAs of 2011, a Hindu faith community endorsing agency was approved by the Department of Defense and began to seek volunteers to serve as Hindu chaplains in the United States military. Military officials, including the members of the Armed Forces Chaplains Board, worked to consider possible insignias, while members of the Hindu community did so as well. According to Hindu Air Force officer Ravi Chaudhary, one of the officers involved in the effort, individuals and groups throughout the country, including the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, were contacted.\n\nAs part of the study, insignias used by Hindu chaplains in other militaries were studied, such as the insignia authorized August 22, 1996 for the first Hindu chaplain to serve in the South African military: a lamp (deepa) and flame. The first insignia ever developed for Hindu military chaplains, it shows a clay lamp representing the human body into which \"the oil of devotion to God\" must be introduced, symbolizing \"the perennial quest of all Hindus: Tamaso ma jyotir gamaya\" – \"O Lord, lead us from darkness to Light.\" However, the recommendation made to the Pentagon was the \"om,\" a symbol that Chaudhary said means \"truth and peace.\"\n\nAccording to Chaudhary, the first Hindu chaplain was army Captain Pratima Dharm, who holds degrees in psychology and theology, and is already serving on active duty at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In addition to being the first Hindu chaplain in the United States military, she will also be the first female of Indian descent to serve as a United States Army chaplain. According to an article in the \"Stars and Stripes\" Dharm has worn the cross on her uniform with the endorsement with the Pentecostal Church of God, but has now been endorsed by the Hindu endorsing agency, Chinmaya Mission West.\n\nIn an official statement, United States Army Chief of Chaplains Douglas Carver confirmed the appointment of Dharm as the army's first Hindu chaplain: \"The Chief of Chaplains is pleased to announce the endorsement of the Army’s first Hindu chaplain by Chinmaya Mission West. This continues our Army’s enduring commitment to the free exercise of religion for our Nation’s sons and daughters, including the hundreds of Hindu soldiers serving in our ranks.\"\n\nEnlisted personnel who serve as assistants to chaplains do not wear any specific faith group symbols, but they have military branch or occupational insignia/badges identifying them as army chaplain assistants/chapel activities specialists, navy religious program specialists, and air force chaplain assistants, that incorporate broader symbols of faith and care.\n\nThe Army Chaplain Assistant Badge was authorized in 1984, incorporating cupped hands representing support given to the chapel and its programs, and a chapel door symbolizing \"a welcome to all worshippers.\"\n\nThe rating badge for navy religious program specialists (RP) includes a compass rose, a globe, and an anchor. The RP rating was established January 15, 1979, and the insignia (which has never changed) was approved by the Chief of Naval Operations on May 9, 1979. According to navy documents, the compass symbolizes that religion can give direction to life; the globe is a symbol of the fact that religious program specialists work throughout the world; and the anchor is a symbol of Navy heritage.\n\nThe air force has three levels of badges: other than the basic badge, there is a Chaplain Assistant Badge-Senior, and a Chaplain Assistant Badge-Master. Each one is based on level of training and qualifications. The badge was established September 1, 1994, and the design was based on the 1990 USAF chaplain theme, \"Live by faith.\" According to \"A History of the Chaplain Assistant,\" \"The badge symbolizes the career field mission of supporting the religious needs of the Air Force community in peace, war, national emergencies, and military contingencies.\"\n\nIn addition to chaplain insignia, Department of Defense instructions on the \"Accommodation of religious practices within the military services\" state that \"chaplains may wear any religious apparel or accouterments with the uniform while conducting worship services and during the performance of rites and rituals associated with their religious faith.\" In addition to allowing religious apparel drawn from civilian faith group sources, some religious apparel has been issued by the military, sometimes with military service, Chaplain Corps, or chaplain religious symbols included in the design. While in the past, religious items to support chaplains and chapel programs were made available by individual service organizations such as the Army Service Forces, today a chaplain is attached full-time to the Defense Logistics Agency, with a mission statement that reads: \n\nIn addition to military-issue religious vestments to be worn by chaplains during worship services or religious rites, United States Army Chief of Chaplains Charles Brown had a lapel pin created during the 1960s showing the Army Chaplain Corps seal (then with symbols of Christian and Jewish chaplains) for chaplains to wear with civilian clothing, in the same way some civilians wore lapel pins with their college seals. However, it turned out that government funding was not authorized for the production of a civilian clothing accessory, so production was halted and wear was discontinued.\n\n<gallery widths=100px heights=150px perrow=6 caption=\"Military issued scarves/stoles\">\nImage:Army Christian scarf.jpg|Army-issued scarf/stole for Christian chaplains\nImage:Army Christian stole.jpg|More modern \"camouflage\" scarf/stole for Christian chaplains\nImage:Army Jewish prayer shawl.jpg|Army-issued prayer shawl (tallit) for Jewish chaplains\nImage:Army camouflage prayer shawl.jpg|More modern prayer shawl (tallit) for Jewish chaplains\nImage:USAF Christian Chaplain scarf.jpg|Air Force-issued scarf/stole for Christian chaplains\nImage:USAF Jewish Chaplain prayer shawl.jpg|Air Force-issued prayer shawl (tallit) for Jewish chaplains\n</gallery>\n\nIn addition to special religious apparel rules for chaplains and worshipers during religious services or rites, military instructions also authorize all military personnel to wear \"articles of clothing worn as part of the doctrinal or traditional observance of the religious faith practiced by the member,\" as long as they are worn under the uniform in a way that makes them \"not visible or apparent\" (such as some Mormon undergarments or Jewish apparel that can be worn under outer clothing); or, if they are visible, the articles of clothing must be \"neat and conservative.\" Some military regulations, such as Army Regulation 670-1, expand the phrase to \"neat, conservative, and discreet,\" and the latest revised version of the Department of Defense Instruction (1300.17) which lays the foundation for all religious accommodation policies in the United States military now defines \"neat and conservative\" as (in part) \"discreet, tidy, and not dissonant or showy in style, size, design, brightness, or color.\" This exact wording has also been incorporated into Secretary of the Navy Instruction 1730.7C, which establishes policy for the Department of the Navy, noting that it applies not only to the Navy and Marine Corps but also to the coast guard \"when operating as a service in the navy under Title 14, U.S. Code, Section 3.\"\n\nProcedures for considering requests for waivers to allow religious apparel have been established by each service, such as the \"Religious Apparel Waivers\" table published in Air Force Instruction 36-2903, \"Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.\"\n\nThe various branches of the military have added different color requirements for religious head coverings, sometimes so that they blend more with uniform colors. For example, the air force requires that approved religious head coverings must be either \"dark blue or black,\", the navy and coast guard requirement is that it must be \"either black or hair-colored\" (that is, as spelled out in coast guard policies, \"black or match the hair color of the wearer\")\n\nJewelry with religious meaning or symbolism is also authorized, providing it meets the \"neat, conservative, and discreet\" requirement, and generally follows the rules for any jewelry that can be worn with a military uniform.\n\nTattoos that \"advocate religious discrimination\" are listed among prohibited tattoos for military personnel.\n\nAll branches of the United States military currently prohibit beards, although some mustaches are allowed, based on policies that were initiated during the period of World War I. If mustaches are worn, they cannot be \"handlebar\" mustaches; they must be \"neatly trimmed, tapered, and tidy,\" not presenting \"a chopped off or busy appearance\"; and \"no portion of the mustache will cover the upper lip line or extend sideways beyond a vertical line drawn upward from the corners of the mouth.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Penny Jolly, who has studied \"social trends in appearance,\" beards \"were eliminated in the US military in WWI due to the need to wear gas masks. Razors were issued in GI kits, so men could shave themselves on the battlefield.\" However, the link between the requirement to shave and the use of gas masks has been called only one of \"several theories.\" Other theories include the fact that the massive build-up of the military for WWI brought with it many men from rural areas, and this \"sudden concentration of recruits in crowded army induction centers brought with it disease, including head lice. Remedial action was taken by immediately shaving the faces and cutting the hair of all inductees upon their arrival.\"\n\nHistorically beards were commonplace in the United States military, and as one report states \"it is harder to find a picture of a general from the American Civil War \"without a beard than with one.\" But beginning with World War I and clearly by World War II, beards were universally prohibited, with the military citing concerns that included the need for \"uniformity, hygiene, discipline, or tactical demands—such as the proper fitting and seal of a gas mask.\"\n\nFrom 1970–1984, the United States Navy briefly restored beards. The temporary change began on November 10, 1970, when then-Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Elmo Zumwalt explicitly authorized beards for active duty naval personnel, in his \"Z-gram\" number 57, \"Elimination of Demeaning or Abrasive Regulation,\" although his position was that they were already implicitly allowed based on policy changes made by his predecessor, Thomas H. Moorer.\nThe navy ban on beards was reinstated in 1984 by CNO James D. Watkins.\n\nReligious laws and traditions regarding grooming have made both hair and beards visible religious symbols for many faith groups, including Sikhs for whom \"Kesh,\" \"unshorn hair,\" is one of the \"Five Ks\"—5 compulsory \"articles of faith\" for baptized Sikhs. Other faith groups, including Judaism and Islam, include certain groups that believe shaving is permitted and other groups that believe it is not. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an example of a faith group that takes the opposite approach, strongly encouraging some or all of its members to shave. In some cases shaving is mandated for some members, including those engaging in their missionary service, or studying or working at the church-sponsored Brigham Young University.\n\nUnited States military instructions note that \"hair and grooming practices required or observed by religious groups are not included within the meaning of religious apparel,\" and therefore do not fall under the overall religious accommodation guidance that authority to approve requests are normally given to individual commands, as specified by each service (although denials of requests are subject to review at the \"Service Headquarters level\"). Instead, requests for grooming waivers based on religion have been decided at the highest levels of each branch of the military, with the United States Army approving new waivers in 2009 for the first time in more than twenty years. However, the Army stresses that such waivers are \"temporary\" and \"assignment specific,\" and that it can rescind the waivers at any time \"in the interest of military necessity.\"\n\nBeards have been authorized for non-religious reasons in today's military, including medical reasons related to skin conditions, with Army directives noting that \"soldiers will keep the growth trimmed to the level specified by appropriate medical authority,\" and Air Force Instructions limiting the length of a beard approved for medical reasons to 1/4 inch.\" Other examples include waivers for some members of the military's Special Forces, based on the rationale that \"in hot spots such as Afghanistan, many members of those elite units grow beards to make themselves less conspicuous to locals.\" The policy for beards lasted for almost a decade and according to some reports was also (at least in part) \"a show of deep respect for Afghanistan's male-dominated, bearded tribal culture.\" However, as of noon September 7, 2010 (based on an order issued the previous day) beards for Special Forces troops in Afghanistan were \"deauthorized\" due to \"a vastly changed operational environment.\" Because DOD Instructions on religious accommodation note that \"precedents\" for non-religious reasons should be taken into account when considering religious accommodation requests, those in favor of additional waivers for beards for religious reasons hope such precedents—in addition to precedents of waivers issued for religious reasons—will help support additional religious accommodation waivers.\n\nSome military spokespersons have cited concerns that beards might interfere with gas masks, but those in favor of beards have challenged those concerns, and some experts note that the application of vaseline to the beard can provide the mask's required seal. In one case, before being allowed to deploy to the First Gulf War, Jewish Chaplain Jacob Goldstein (an army reservist who has been granted a waiver to wear a beard) had to prove that he could don his mask safely and securely within the same 8-second time period given to others—and Goldstein (who says \"the mask issue is bogus\") showed that he could. Gas masks do vary from one nation to another, and it has been reported that even masks manufactured in Israel, a nation where they are routinely distributed to citizens, may not work properly for men with facial hair. While special \"beard-friendly\" masks that cover the entire head of the wearer are manufactured there, a reported shortage has driven that nation's Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi to rule that ultra-orthodox Jews can shave or trim their beards in order to ensure that their masks fit, and urged them to carry scissors with them so that they can shave quickly in the event of a chemical or biological gas attack.\n\nOther military representatives have said that religious accommodation requests to waive the prohibition for beards could be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only from those already in the military. However, critics have noted that such a policy would require an applicant to be a hypocrite: requesting a shaving waiver based on the fact that he cannot shave, but first shaving in order to enlist and qualify to submit a request. According to some commentators, the real reason beards have been prohibited is the feeling that they \"are unseemly and make service members appear sloppy.\" Army Regulation 670-1 states that \"personal appearance\"—including \"strict grooming standards\"—is an \"essential part of discipline\" and \"a neat and well-groomed appearance by all soldiers is fundamental to the Army and contributes to building the pride and esprit essential to an effective military force.\"\n\nSome changes in military regulations are making it easier for civilian clergy with beards who hold reserve commissions as chaplains to report for short periods of active duty without shaving off their beards. For example, Air Force Instruction 36-2903, revised July 18, 2011, directs that \"During tours of less than 30 days, Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) chaplains not on extended active duty may request a beard waiver for religious observance when consistent with their faith.\"\n\nOne example of visible religious apparel cited in the instructions as authorized, provided it passes the \"neat and conservative\" test, is the kippah (skullcap) worn by some Jewish personnel, referred to in some military directives by the Yiddish word, \"yarmulke.\" The modern history of authorizing the kippa under the rubric of \"religious accommodation\" began with a 1986 Supreme Court case (Goldman v. Weinberger) involving an orthodox rabbi who was serving in the air force as a psychologist, not a chaplain, who had been told to remove his kippa. When the court affirmed that existing military regulations did give the military the right to prohibit the kippa if it so chose—and deferred to Congress to decide whether to change the situation—Congress attempted to introduce the \"neat and conservative\" approval rule in a proposed \"Religious Apparel Amendment.\" That proposed amendment failed to pass for two years, ultimately passing after a story about two navy chaplains present during the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing was read into the \"Congressional Record.\" The story focused on Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli, who tore off a piece of his Marine Corps uniform to replace Jewish Chaplain Arnold Resnicoff's kippah, bloodied after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines. This amendment passed, and was eventually incorporated into the newer DOD religious accommodation directive, which now exists in revised form as DOD Instruction 1300.17.\n\nResnicoff's report of the bombing, written at the request of the White House, and read in April 1984 as a keynote speech by President Ronald Reagan, explained the symbolism of Pucciarelli's actions and this kippah:\nThis story of this \"camouflage kippah\"—its symbolism in terms of Judaism as a sign of reverence and its symbolism in the military as a sign of interfaith cooperation and respect—was retold at many levels, including another occasion involving President Reagan, during a White House visit of the \"American Friends of Lubavitch.\" After telling them the Beirut story, Reagan asked them about the meaning of the kippah. Rabbi Abraham Shemtov responded, \"Mr. President, the kippah to us is a sign of reverence,\" and one of his colleagues, Rabbi Feller, continued, 'We place the kippah on the very highest point of our being—on our head, the vessel of our intellect—to tell ourselves and the world that there is something which is above man's intellect—the infinite Wisdom of God.\"\n\nAlthough a number of military instructions use the Jewish headcovering as an example—noting factors that must be met to qualify under the \"neat and conservative\" requirement—the same criteria for permission apply to head coverings regardless of the faith of the military person requesting permission: \"Religious headgear that meets these criteria is authorized irrespective of the faith group from which it originates.\"\n\nSikh turban and grooming requirements have a unique history in terms of religious accommodation because they were allowed, then disallowed, and finally allowed once again, at least for some specific individual cases, as of 2010. Since 1948, Sikh men had served in the military with uniform policy waivers that allowed them to follow their faith group requirements for beards and long hair, with the hair covered by turbans, until the army eliminated such religious accommodation policies in 1984, when then-army Chief of Staff John A. Wickham, Jr. eliminated the exception for Sikhs and others who wore \"conspicuous\" items of faith. All this was in parallel with regulations within the United States Navy, as from the time of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's service, through the issuance of his \"Z-grams\" numbers 57 and 70, in early November 1970 and late January 1971 respectively, permitting well-groomed facial hair on all United States Navy personnel until the timeframe of Ronald Reagan's presidency.\n\nUnited States Army Regulation 600-20 grants permission to personnel who received waivers to grooming standards for beards or long hair prior to January 1, 1986 to continue on active duty for as long as they are \"otherwise qualified for retention.\" However, these individuals \"will not be assigned permanent change of station or temporary duty outside of CONUS [the Continental United States] due to health and safety considerations.\" Two Sikhs in the Army's medical field, doctor (Colonel) Arjinderpal Singh Sekhon, and dentist (Colonel) G. B. Singh, continued under this \"grandfather clause\" until their retirements in 2009 (for Sekhon) and 2007 (for Singh).\n\nHowever, in March 2010 United States Army Captain Tejdeep Singh Rattan graduated United States Army Officer Training at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, to become the first new Sikh officer allowed to serve with a beard and turban in more than 25 years. According to news reports, \"Rattan wears a fatigue-colored turban, and when he needs to wear a helmet, he puts on a mini-turban underneath it. He says he's gotten a positive response from other officers in training.\"\nOther Sikhs have since been granted permission as well, including Captain Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, an Army doctor who told the story of how his first sergeant \"pulled him out of the crowd\" on his first day of training at Fort Sam Houston, to tell the other soldiers about the \"long ordeal\" Kalsi endured in order to enlist. He quoted the First Sergeant as saying that \"The Army is made up of different shades of green, and if you have any objection to him being here, you need to tell me now,\" at which point all the other soldiers applauded him.\n\nWhile Rattan and Kalsi are both officers, in 2011, Army Specialist Simranpreet Lamba became the first enlisted man to be granted a waiver for his beard and turban as Sikh \"articles of faith\" in 26 years. Despite the fact that his education would have qualified him for service as an officer, his status as a non-United States citizen barred him from officer status, so he enlisted under \"the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest recruiting program, which enlists legal non-citizens with critical language skills, such as Lamba's knowledge of Punjabi and Hindi.\" During Combat Basic Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, Lamba was naturalized as a United States citizen, saying that becoming a United States citizen and a United States soldier were always part of his \"childhood dream\": \"I believe that I already have the warrior ethos in me and the warrior blood in me. That's why it's been my childhood dream to always be in the armed forces. And I'm really happy that my childhood dream came true. And I'm a proud U.S. Army Soldier today.\" Now that he is a United States citizen, Lamba plans to continue to serve as a soldier, but hopes to apply to Officer Candidate School (OCS) sometime in the future.\n\nArmy spokesperson Major General Gina Farrisse stated that each religious accommodation request regarding grooming will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, rather than considering the right \"a blanket accommodation for any other individual\" Speaking of the permission given to Kalsi, Major General Farrisse noted that Kalsi's \"beard, shorn hair, and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times.\" She said the exception could be revoked \"due to changed conditions.\"\n\nAs of June 2011, similar waivers of military grooming policies, allowing beards, have been granted to at least two Muslim soldiers.\n\nThe right of Muslims to keep beards is an issue that has been discussed in other nations, including India. Maulana Hasan Mehndi, a Shia cleric in Calcutta, someone who has advocated for Muslim rights in that nation, has stated that \"Shaving is forbidden in Islam. But that doesn’t mean the beard has to be of an inordinate length. Individual institutions may have its own rules, but we cannot neglect our allegiance to the Almighty.\" On the other hand, some Muslim scholars believe that the beard is not a requirement for Muslim men, but that it is certainly \"encouraged\" according to Islamic law.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Orthodox rabbi Menachem Stern has requested similar permission to wear a beard to allow him to serve as a Jewish chaplain, ultimately filing suit December 8, 2010, in Federal Court in Washington, D.C. (\"Stern v. Secretary of the Army\", 1:2010cv02077) alleging discrimination on the part of the Army for refusing to allow him to serve as a chaplain without shaving his beard. Stern's suit includes documentation that shows he informed the army that he could not shave, but was nevertheless granted a commission as an Army Reserve 1st lieutenant. The commission was rescinded the day after it was granted, based on an army decision that it was granted based on an \"administrative error\" that did not take into account the \"no beard policy.\"\nNathan Lewin, the lead counsel for Stern's lawsuit, had represented Rabbi Michell Geller, an Air Force chaplain, in a similar case in 1976. Lewin notes that the military was directed to permit Geller to keep his beard, and did not appeal that decision. In the Stern lawsuit, as in the earlier Geller lawsuit, Lewin's position on behalf of his client is that \"Even if the military thinks regular servicemen should be clean-shaven, clearly chaplains who are teaching religion are in a different category.\"\n\nAn \"Army Times\" editorial praised military decisions regarding religious needs in the case of Sikhs and Muslims, and strongly urged the Army to take the same policy regarding Jews for whom a beard was a faith requirement:\nOne waiver for beards has been granted to Army Reserve Chaplain (Rabbi) Jacob Goldstein (originally granted when he served as a chaplain for the New York Army National Guard and continued after his transfer to the United States Army Reserve), who has served since 1977 on deployments to areas including Bosnia, South Korea, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He also served on the staff of the United States Army Chief of Chaplains, and after the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, he served for five months as the senior chaplain for all military branches at Ground Zero. He was the only Jewish chaplain in Grenada in 1983, and during a two-month deployment to Iraq in 2003, he helped set up a sukkah (a religious requirement for the Jewish festival of Sukkot), in Saddam Hussein’s palace. Goldstein served with the National Guard, wearing the beard as a result of the waiver he received until he reached mandatory retirement age, when the U.S. Army Reserve approved his application to serve as a reserve chaplain, agreeing to retain the waiver.\n\nGoldstein's nephew, Rabbi Chesky Tenenbaum, was granted a 2007 waiver to serve in the Maryland Defense Force, a state military organization that primarily provides support to the Maryland National Guard. Tenenbaum said that he was thankful that, like his uncle, he successfully passed the \"beard threshold.\" In March 2008, the Georgia State Defense Force also approved its first waiver for a beard when Rabbi Zalman Lipskier was commissioned as a chaplain.\nMany observant Jews follow opinions by religious authorities who do not see beards as an absolute religious requirement, and at least one Orthodox rabbi, Shmuel Felzenberg, from the community known as Chabad—a group for whom beards are normally considered required—made the decision to shave (a very difficult decision for him, he admits) in order to serve as a military chaplain after discussing the matter with the rabbi he considers his teacher and mentor. Even though he says that shaving—even with the approval of his teacher—\"was ultimately a strong, bitter pill to swallow\", he does it in order to be \"afforded the opportunity to serve.\" However, he says he uses an electric razor, the approach to shaving that is least objectionable in terms of Jewish law (rather than a razor, which all rabbinic authorities agree is prohibited based on traditional Jewish law), and \"from the moment\" he goes on leave to \"the moment\" he must return to duty, he does not shave.\n\nHowever, for many other religiously observant Jews, even such compromises are unacceptable—because for them the prohibition is \"non-negotiable\". They base their beliefs on the ruling of rabbis such as the \"Tzemach Tzedek\", a past leader of the Chabad movement, who wrote that \"any means of removing hair from a man’s face is forbidden.\" That is the position taken by Menachem Stern—that he is \"strictly prohibited from shaving or removing\" his facial hair \"in any manner.\" In his original application for the chaplaincy, he wrote that \"by not trimming my beard, I represent the unadulterated view of the holy Torah, the way we believe a person should live.\"\n\nThe Army had argued that religious accommodation non-shaving waivers that have been granted since 2009 to Sikhs and Muslims cannot serve as precedents for Stern's request because the former are \"temporary\" and \"assignment specific\", can be rescinded at any time based on military necessity, and were granted to applicants who had already begun military service, whereas Stern is requesting a \"blanket waiver\" as a prerequisite for his service as a chaplain.\nHowever, in December 2011, news reports indicated that the suit against the army had been won, and Rabbi Stern would be allowed to serve without shaving his beard. Stern was sworn in and began serving as an Army chaplain in 2013, followed a year later by USAF chaplain, Rabbi Elie Estrin.\n\nThe basic Department of Defense Instruction on accommodation of military practices in the United States military was amended as of January 22, 2014. For the first time, \"grooming\" rules such as the wearing of beards, was brought under the rubric of \"religious accommodation,\" with procedures instituted for individual requests to wear beards for religious reasons.\n\nIn addition to religious apparel worn based on faith group requirements, the military ID tag, nicknamed \"dog tag,\" is the one government-issued uniform item that indicates the religion of military personnel. Two tags, each on a separate chain, are worn around the neck under the uniform, and in the case of death one is removed for record keeping and one is left on the body. While the tag helps to identify the body after loss of consciousness or death, and provides some immediate help to medical personnel (such as blood type), it includes religious affiliation (unless the individual has chosen to have \"no religious preference\" listed) so that, when possible, a chaplain of that person's faith group could respond, especially when specific religious rituals or ministrations such as \"last rites\" are indicated. Religious information also aids in decisions regarding care of the body, including arrangements for burial. Individuals can also wear a small religious symbol, such as a cross or Star of David (either personal or government-issue), on the ID chain, for personal reasons or to make speedy religious identification easier. Additionally, some religious groups supply small items for the chain as well, such as the mezuzah supplied to WWII Jewish personnel by the National Jewish Welfare Board.\nThe practice of keeping some tag or mark for identification in case of serious injury or death seems to have begun in the Civil War, when Americans first made them themselves and later were able to purchase commercially made tags, when civilian groups realized there might be a \"market\" for such items. In 1906 the Army made the tags official and required and ten years later, July 6, 1916, changed to the two tag requirement.\n\nDuring World War II, a dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: \"P\" for Protestant, \"C\" for Catholic, or \"H\" for Jewish (from the word \"Hebrew,\" for \"Hebrew faith\"), or \"NO\" or \"NONE\" (or just no religious designation letter) to indicate no religious preference. Army Regulation 606-5 soon included X and Y in addition to P, C, and H: the X indicating any religion not included in the first three, and the Y indicating either no religion or a choice not to list religion. In 1953, there was an effort to persuade the White House to have the military add a religious designation for Muslims on military tags, when WWII Army veteran Abdullah Igram wrote to President Dwight D. Eisenhower to say that he had tried unsuccessfully to have an \"M\" (for Muslim) added to his dog tags, and recommending that \"M\" for \"Muslim\" or \"I\" for \"Islam\" be added to the religious choices for future soldiers. The story of his efforts is retold in an article in the Toledo, Ohio \"Toledo Blade,\" with the headline, \"Vet leads U.S. Moslems in fight for recognition.\" According to Igram's family, the White House sent a letter thanking him for his suggestion, but Igram's widow confirmed that her late husband's efforts were not successful.\n\nBy the time of the Vietnam War, IDs spelled out the broad religious choices such as PROTESTANT and CATHOLIC, rather than using initials, and also began to show individual denominations such as \"METHODIST\" or \"BAPTIST.\" Tags did vary by service, however, such as the use of \"CATH,\" not \"CATHOLIC\" on some Navy tags. For those with no religious affiliation and those who chose not to list an affiliation, either the space for religion was left blank or the words \"NO PREFERENCE\" (or some variation, such as \"NO RELIGIOUS PREF\") were included.\n\nToday, military personnel can list any religion on their ID tags, and today's tags spell out religions and belief systems such as Wicca that would have fallen under the \"X\" (\"other\") category on WWII tags or \"Atheist,\"\n\nSome churches, like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), provide information to members entering the military, stressing the importance of listing their religions correctly on ID tags. For LDS members, the Church's \"Military Relations Committee\" notes that some military reps might try to record their religion as \"Protestant,\" but directs that \"if anyone tries to list you as 'Protestant,' do not permit it.\" Members are told to ensure that the church's full name is recorded in their records and that \"Latter-Day Saints\" is embossed on their ID tags.\n\nWhile tags can be purchased commercially, military personnel programs allow only for certain selections. The Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers (MAAF) calls the regulations pertaining to religion on ID tags \"an immediate and constant source of discrimination in the military for many soldiers.\" MAAF has previously suggested administrative adjustments, but has most recently advised that the question be removed from the mandatory inprocessing and required that it be instead an optional selection.\n\nIronically, although the ID tags include religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them issued or reissued without religious affiliation listed—or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without—out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands. Some Jewish personnel avoided flying over German lines during WWII with ID tags that indicated their religion, and some Jewish personnel avoid the religious designation today out of concern that they could be captured by extremists who are anti-semitic. Additionally, when American troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War there were allegations that some United States military authorities were encouraging Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags. (It has been reported that Jewish personnel, along with others, were encouraged to \"use discretion\" when practicing their religion while deployed to Saudi Arabia). However, the story that some Jews were given military ID tags during the Gulf War with the designation \"Protestant-B\" as a code name for Jewish (a story included in one civilian writer's anthology of military stories she had been told by others, and then that one story was reprinted or quoted in many other in-print or online locations including Hadassah Magazine) has been the subject of much debate as to its veracity, with some military personnel stating that the story is \"absolutely false.\" There is at least one official record of a Jewish Marine requesting guidance from a Jewish organization about whether he should list his religion as Jewish on his tags, receiving a response strongly encouraging him to keep the designation on the tags.\n\nIn the Navy, when a chaplain leads a shipboard worship service, a \"worship pennant\" showing the Chaplain insignia of that chaplain's faith group is flown, over the United States flag. According to the United States Flag Code, \"No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy.\"\n\nThe original worship pennant (Church Pennant) displayed a cross but in 1975 the Secretary of the Navy approved a \"Jewish worship pennant,\" displaying the Jewish Chaplain insignia, originally with Roman numerals and later redesigned to include Hebrew letters within the design. While the worship pennants may also be flown ashore during worship services, they are only flown over the American flag when flown on a ship.\n\nThe Marine Corps Flag Manual authorizes the use of Navy worship pennants \"as authorized by commanding officers to designate the time and place of divine service, and in the field to indicate the chaplain's quarters or office.\" \n\nThe Army authorizes the use of official Chapel flags for display in Army military chapels, and very similar Chaplain flags (smaller than Chapel Flags and with no fringe) to mark the location of worship services led by a chaplain in the field. Chapel and Chaplain flags are dark blue with the appropriate chaplain insignia centered in white, and available as of 2011 for Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist chapel use.\n\nAdditionally, the Army has a number of other flags. There is a \"regimental color,\" housed at the United States Army Chaplain Center and School, that shows the emblem of the Chaplain Corps against a dark blue background, with a banner reading \"Chaplain Corps\" underneath it. There is also a \"positional color,\" housed in the Office of the Chief of Chaplains, showing the emblem of the Chaplain Corps against a white background, with a banner reading \"United States Army\" underneath it. Also, like all flag and general officers, both the Army Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains are authorized personal flags with one or two stars respectively, in accordance with their rank—but unlike most other Army general officer flags that have the white stars shown against a scarlet background, as of 1952 the color of the Chaplain Corps general officer flag background is \"ecclesiastical purple.\" The Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains of the Navy do not have distinctive flags, but instead use flags with blue stars superimposed on a white background along with other staff corps officers not eligible for command at sea, while line officers (those eligible for command at sea) use flags with white stars against a blue background. In the Air Force, all general officers including the Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains use the same individual (rank) flags, with white stars indicating rank against a blue background.\n\nThe Navy has a flag with the Chaplain Corps emblem against a white background, which is housed in the office of the United States Navy Chief of Chaplains.\n\nThe Air Force has a Chaplain Corps (formerly, Chaplain Service) Flag, also referred to as a \"Religious Flag.\"\nThe flag has the Chaplain Corps emblem against a blue background, with 2-inch yellow fringe along three edges, and is manufactured in two sizes—4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches, and 3 feet by 4 feet. According to USAF Instruction (AFI 34-1201), the flag\n\nFlags with the emblem of the Army and Air Force are official flags, referenced in official documents, and in the case of the Army, produced by the Institute of Heraldry. The flag with the emblem of the United States Navy Chaplain Corps does not appear to have official status, but has rather been locally produced by the office of the Chief of Navy Chaplains.\n\nChapel and Chaplain flags are identical in design (except for the fringe on the chapel flag), but differ in size, with the Chapel flag's measuring 4 foot 4 inch hoist by 5 foot 6 inch fly, with a 2.5 inch white fringe, and the Chaplain's flag measuring a 2-foot hoist by 3 foot fly. Both Chapel and Chaplain flags incorporate the faith group insignia of the chaplain for whom the flag is flown. The Chapel flag is authorized to be flown only in military chapels, while the Chaplain's flag is \"used as authorized by commanders to designate the time and place of religious service and in the field to indicate the chaplain’s quarters or office.\"\n\nThe Army Chaplain School flag is an official flag, produced by The Institute of Heraldry. The flag for the Navy Chaplaincy School and Center is locally produced without official standing.The Air Force does not appear to use a Chaplain School flag.\n\nBeginning in 1940, the policy was established that military chapels would be constructed with no permanent religious symbols, exterior or interior:\n\nAlthough some older military chapels still include religious symbols, and some older military installations (including United States Service academies) maintain chapels dedicated for specific religious worship, all current instructions and design manuals for new chapel construction and chapel usage follow this 1940 policy, explicitly prohibiting the use of permanent religious symbols, and even direct that temporary religious symbols should be displayed only during scheduled religious services. So, for example, Army regulations state that:\n\nThe naval facilities design manual for chapels and religious educational facilities includes the following directions:\n\nSimilarly, training manuals for religious program specialists prescribe that chapels should be set up with no religious symbols except when the spaces are prepared for religious services:\nAir force design policies include the statement, \"Do not use religious symbols,\" in the section on \"Exterior elements,\" and continue the theme in various sections that deal with interior elements as well. For example, in the section on stained glass windows, instructions state \"Use stained glass windows in the sanctuary, the blessed sacrament and reconciliation room, and the all faiths room. Ensure they do not contain religious symbols.\" On the other hand, \"The chapel should be easily identifiable with a high, steeply pitched roof over the primary worship space. The use of stained glass sets chapel facilities apart as places of beauty and spiritual inspiration.\" The overall policy for religious symbols in air force chapels is summed up in the statement that \"Because of their multi-faith use, these facilities must be religiously neutral in design, as well as flexible in their programming. Liturgical furnishings specific to individual faith groups must therefore be moveable and architectural form, images and permanent ornamentation acceptable to all users.\"\n\nPolicies vary among military services when it comes to removing permanent religious symbols from the building or grounds of military chapels that are inconsistent with these policies, and decisions to remove existing symbols have sometimes been met with controversy.\n\nFor example, there was some controversy in 2008 when the army announced plans to remove three wooden crosses outside the chapel serving military personnel in Kosovo’s \"Camp Bondsteel,\" replacing them with a monument displaying the Chaplain Corps seal. In an interview with Fox News Channel, Lieutenant Colonel William D. Jenkins of the 35th Infantry Division's Kosovo Force 9 said that the Base Camp Planning Board approved the removal of the crosses in accordance with army regulations, which require the exterior to be free of any specific faith group symbols. Jenkins said that \"The interior of each U.S. Army chapel reflects faith-specific signs, symbols, etc., during each faith group's service so that their faith is fully represented during their service...[but]The exterior of Army chapels is a different matter since the chapels are used by many different faith groups.\" He said that the crosses would still be used during special services, such as the Easter Sunrise Service.\n\nSimilarly, a cross was removed from a military chapel in Afghanistan in November 2011, at the \"remote post\" of Marmal, based on the army regulations prohibiting permanent symbols of any religion or faith group.\nOn the other hand, in June 1998, the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland added a crescent to the exterior wall of its chapel, where a cross and Star of David were already displayed, rather than removing all symbols and replacing them with a more inclusive symbol. As of 2011, the new symbol for Buddhist chaplains has not been added.\n\nIn at least one case a religious symbol has been removed from a chapel and then reinstated when local base leadership changed. In 1994, the commander of Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, at the recommendation of the base chaplain, had a cross removed from the top of the \"Chapel on the Thames,\" also known as the \"Sailors' Chapel\" and the \"Submarine Memorial Chapel.\" The cross, which was not part of the original chapel construction, but had been added some years later, was to be relocated within the chapel area where other religious symbols were kept. That action drew criticism from some individuals, including letters to the editor in the local civilian paper, and finally elicited an editorial in that paper defending the decision: \"Men of many faiths lost their lives on submarines...The changes being made to Navy places of worship are part of a larger effort to become sensitive to the dignity of all people who serve in the military... The Navy is a Navy not just of Christians, but of Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and others.\" Despite positions articulated in statements such as this one, the next commanding officer had the cross replaced.\n\nBased on conversations in 2008 regarding crosses outside the chapel at Naval Air Station Atsugi in Japan, Navy policy sets a higher priority on removing permanent religious symbols from a chapel when it is the only chapel on a base. Where more than one chapel exists, Navy policy may be more lenient when it comes to existing symbols on one particular chapel. One example is Naval Station Norfolk's Frazier Hall, one of the Navy's oldest chapel complexes, where separate Catholic and Protestant chapels are co-located with Jewish and Muslim Chapels.\n\nThe rule requiring chapels to be religiously neutral except during a religious worship service also applies to Veterans Administration chapels. In 2008, the chaplain of the Veterans Affairs hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina resigned when Christian symbols were removed from the hospital chapel—after complaints of religious insensitivity regarding chapel symbols were lodged following a non-denominational ceremony in that chapel to remember victims of the September 11 attacks.\n\nA slightly different issue involving a cross on a military base—but erected separately from a chapel as a memorial to marines killed in Afghanistan—involves a 13-foot cross erected on top of a hill at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, in California. The American Center for Law & Justice is arguing on the part of those who erected the cross that it should be allowed to stay because \"crosses are used as a widespread and universal symbol of remembrance,\" not just as religious symbols, while other groups, such as the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, are arguing that the cross should not be allowed to remain. A similar cross was erected in 2003, but was destroyed in a fire, so the new cross has been created with \"fire-retardant\" material. A spokesman for Camp Pendleton was quoted as saying that the Camp Pendleton \"legal staff is carefully researching and reviewing the topic in order to make a balanced and unbiased command recommendation that is ultimately supported by the law.\"\n\nIn 2010, vandals used a religious symbol in a negative way, adding a wooden cross to a non-Christian military worship area as an apparent attempt to make an anti-religious statement against the \"Earth-centered\" worship area (\"stone circle\") set aside at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) for the use of adherents of faith groups that identify themselves as \"Pagans,\" such as Wiccans or Druids. According to the local Colorado Springs gazette, \"Whoever left the cross exploited the most sacred object of Christianity for an act of confrontation.\"\n\nLieutenant General Michael C. Gould, USAFA Superintendent, said that it was important that the academy support the religious needs of all cadets, and that USAF Instruction 36-2706 gives air force leaders guidance in terms of defining \"religion\" as \"a personal set or institutional system of attitudes, moral or ethical beliefs and practices held with the strength of traditional religious views, characterized by ardor and faith and generally evidenced through specific religious observances.\"\n\nGould said that the incident was being taken very seriously, because respect for the religious beliefs of others is an especially important lesson for USAFA cadets, who \"learn that to succeed as an Air Force officer we must be able to support and respect the people who we lead, serve with and fight alongside even if they do not share our personal beliefs... Cadets learn that every servicemember is charged with defending freedom for all Americans and that includes the freedom to practice a religion of their choice or to not practice any religion at all.\"\n\nAcademy officials took actions to send a clear message that the \"Cadet Chapel Falcon Circle,\" the area set aside for Earth-centered worship, \"is to be treated with respect and dignity, just as any other religious structure or location.\"\n\nIt has been pointed out that in some ways the lack of permanent symbols itself becomes a symbol: \"a visible symbol of how people of different beliefs can not only tolerate one another, they can live in the same house.\"\n\nThe history of government issued headstones predates the Veterans Administration and the National Cemetery Administration, with roots that can be traced back to America's frontier days, when garrison commanders took on the responsibility of burying their soldiers. However, it was not until the creation of the national army that was established at the beginning of the Civil War that army regulations (General Orders Number 75, September 11, 1861) assigned the national commanders of the military with the responsibility for burials and grave markings—and the Quartermaster General of the Army was tasked with providing the actual \"headboards.\" Much later, following World War I, a board of officers approved the white marble headstone, slightly rounded at the top—and for the first time, two specific religious markings (the Latin Cross for Christians, and the Star of David for Jews) were authorized for use. Changes in construction and designed continued to be made, and in February 1951, he Secretary of the Army approved the addition of a Buddhist emblem in addition to the Cross and the Star.\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) establishes policies for religious symbols on headstones and markers in United States National Cemeteries, although the US Department of the Army continues to oversee two of them, including Arlington National Cemetery. In contrast with the small number of religious symbols that have been approved by DOD over the years for chaplain insignia, the VA has approved over forty five separate religious symbols for use on cemetery headstones and markers (those used in national cemeteries and those issued to families of eligible veterans for use in private cemeteries) and has a process in place to consider and approve additional religious symbols based on requests by the next of kin of the deceased.\n\nAlthough current procedures allow for speedy approvals of new religious symbols, the pentacle (the pentagram within a circle), the symbol now used for Wiccan headstones and markers, was approved only after ten years of efforts that concluded with a lawsuit against the VA, resulting in a settlement that accorded that symbol the same status as any other religious or belief system allowed.\n\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State represented the plaintiffs, saying that \"we uncovered evidence that the reason the pentagram hadn't been approved was straightforward religious bias... The Justice Department knew that if they didn't do the right thing, then a federal judge would tell them to and, in the process, would state very publicly all the things they've done wrong over the past decade.\"\n\nThe first \"interfaith\" headstone—including a Wiccan Pentacle for Jan Deanna O'Rourke and a Christian Cross for her husband—was installed at Arlington National Cemetery on May 1, 2007, and dedicated on July 4, 2007.\n\nIn addition to individual gravesites, a number of memorials to United States military chaplains who died while on active duty have been or are in the process of being erected at Arlington National Ceremony, in an area called \"Chaplains Hill,\" to symbolize the ultimate sacrifice of military chaplains. Before 2011, three chaplain memorials existed at Arlington: one for all chaplains who died on active duty during WWI, and two others for chaplains who have died since then—one for Roman Catholic chaplains and one for Protestant chaplains.\n\nOn October 24, 2011, a fourth memorial was unveiled during a dedication ceremony at the cemetery, listing the names of the fourteen Jewish chaplains who have died on active duty.\n\nThe first memorial, remembering twenty-three chaplains who died during WWI, was dedicated on May 5, 1926. The memorial includes two quotations: \"Greater Love Hath No Man Than This, That A Man Lay Down His Life For His Friends,\" and \"To You From Falling Hands We Throw The Torch – Be Yours To Hold It High.\"\n\nThe memorial to 134 Protestant chaplains who lost their lives in WWI and WWII was dedicated in Arlington Cemetery on October 26, 1981 (although according to the information on its plaque, it had been created earlier and located in the Washington, D.C. Memorial Chapel of the General Commission on Chaplains and Armed Forces Personnel Building) and bears the words \"To the Glory of God and the Memory of the Chaplains Who Died in Services Of Their Country.\" On May 21, 1989, the third memorial—in memory of 83 Catholic chaplains who died in WWII, in the Korean War, and in the Vietnam War—was dedicated, with the inscription \"May God Grant Peace to Them and to the Nation They Served So Well.\"\n\nThe fourth chaplain memorial to be approved is the memorial for thirteen fallen Jewish chaplains, approved by the United States House of Representatives on May 24, 2011, Although designed and paid for with private funds, congressional authorization was required for the memorial to be created and installed.\n\nRetired navy Chaplain Harold Robinson, current Director of the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council (a part of the \"Jewish Community Centers Association\" (JCCA)), was one of the leaders in the effort to establish the Jewish Chaplains Memorial. Speaking of the need to add the memorial to those already present to honor fallen Protestant and Catholic chaplains, Robinson said that \"It's a matter of principle. It's a matter of keeping faith with those who kept faith with us. There are about 255 chaplains who died in active service; 242 of them are memorialized on Chaplains Hill. From my perspective that's wrong.\"\n\nThe idea for the memorial was the brainchild of Ken Kraetzer, a member of the Sons of the American Legion, who learned that three of the famous four chaplains who died on board the troop transport were immortalized at Arlington, but not the Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Goode. He helped mobilize other individuals and groups, including the Jewish Federations of North America, the Jewish War Veterans, and the JCCA, to help work toward the memorial's creation.\n\nThe monument was designed by New York artist Deborah Jackson, with the understanding that the design had to be approved by both the Secretary of the Army and the United States Commission of Fine Arts (which met in June 2011) after which time fabrication of the monument plaque began. Before the actual installation and dedication at Arlington Cemetery, creators and backers of the monument first arranged for it to \"go on tour to different communities, giving people a chance to see it and learn more about the role of Jewish chaplains.\" According to the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council the plan is to dedicate the monument during the fall of 2011, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Jewish chaplaincy, based on the Civil War commissioning of the first Jewish chaplain. In addition to the names of the thirteen fallen Jewish chaplains, the memorial will include the words of a Jewish folk proverb, \"I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders.\"\n\nIn a ceremony \"steeped in Hebrew prayers and military hymns,\" the fourth memorial was unveiled and dedicated on October 24, 2011.\n\nAlthough no symbol incorporated into the design of the American flag has ever officially been given religious meaning by the United States government, there is a military ceremony of folding the flag into a triangle before presenting it during military ceremonies—including ceremonies such as official retirements or the retirement portion of a \"change of command,\" or the military portion of a burial ceremony—that has sometimes been associated with religious symbolism.\n\nThe exact origin of the tradition or the words that accompany it is uncertain, although it is believed that it most likely began during World War I \"when patriotism was high and the United States Flag was universally embraced as a national symbol\".\n\nOver the years, various \"scripts\" have been developed for such ceremonies, to be read at each step of the folding, and some of these have linked the flag to religion in general or to a specific religious faith group in particular. Because such scripts can give the impression that either Congress or the military (or a specific branch of the military) had assigned a specific religious significance to the military tradition of folding the flag, military efforts have been made to ensure that any words recited during the ceremony avoid giving such an impression. So, for example, the Air Force issued an official flag folding script in 2006 which ends with these words:\nAir Force Instruction 34-1201 includes the following guidance:\nThe Veterans Administration has published guidance that the reading of religious words to accompany the folding of the flags at burials within V.A. cemeteries will be allowed when requested by the family of the deceased. Groups such as the American Legion offer versions of the script that include religious meanings, and current V.A. policy is that \"Volunteer honor guards will accept requests for recitations that reflect any or no religious traditions, on an equal basis.\" However, the volunteers should be relatives or friends, rather than \"federal employees\" of the Veterans Administration.\n\nThe \"National Flag Foundation,\" a group that describes itself as \"America's leading non-profit patriotic educational organization promoting respect for our nation's most important symbol: The Flag of the United States of America,\" has developed a script that it recommends for use during a twelve-step flag-folding ceremony at burials. Its script links to the folds to \"national virtues,\" including those attributed to the colors of the Flag as specified in 1782 by Charles Thomson, then Secretary of Congress. The virtues linked to the folds of the flag in the National Flag Foundation script include: liberty, unity, justice, perseverance, hardiness, valor, purity, innocence, sacrifice, honor, independence, and truth.\n\nAt the United States Naval Academy, a tradition developed that included marching flags, including the American flag, up the aisle of the chapel during Protestant services, briefly dipping the flags toward the altar. According to an academy spokesman quoted in a 2006 article, this flag-dipping ritual at the USNA Protestant chapel \"is the only one throughout the Navy where the flag has been incorporated in that way.\"\n\nIn the Fall of 2007, when complaints were made that dipping the flag toward a religious altar was inappropriate, then-academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Jeffrey Fowler directed that the practice be discontinued. However, after some controversy, the practice was reinstated.\nClark Rogers, Director of educational programs for the National Flag Foundation, was quoted as saying that he realizes that different branches of the military have their own traditions, but \"the United States Flag Code says the flag should not be dipped for any person or thing.\" The practice of refusing to dip the flag based on the flag code is most well known in regards to the world Olympic Games, where the United States team has refused to dip the flag toward any nation's leaders since 1936. Some United States naval officers have pointed out that \"Naval Telecommunications Procedures: Flags, Pennants and Customs\" states that the \"Navy allows American ships to lower their flags if returning a salute, but not to be the first one to dip their colors.\" Dipping first is a sign of disrespect as stated in the Flag Code: \"No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing.\"\n\nIn January 2010 news reports revealed that Trijicon, a Wixom, Michigan-based contractor used by the United States military, had been inscribing \"secret codes\" for New Testament Bible verses on rifle scopes used by United States Army and Marine Corps forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Citations included references to Jesus as \"the light of the world\", and were added without United States military approval or knowledge. So, for example, the code \"2COR4:6\", located near the string of letters and numerals used for other manufacturing information such as serial numbers, was a reference to verse 4:6 in the New Testament book Second Corinthians: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\"\nUnited States military leaders reacted with surprise, expressing concern based on the fact that \"U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious 'Crusade' in its war against al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents.\" Defense Department photos revealed that the rifles that included the verses were being used by Iraqi forces that included Muslims who had no knowledge of the Christian Bible verses on the sights. The Al Jazeera news service reported that the fact that weapons with \"Christian references\" had been distributed to Afghan soldiers would provide the Taliban with a \"propaganda coup.\" Similarly, the United States-based \"Muslim Public Affairs Council\" warned that this practice \"would stoke the fires of extremists who accuse the United States of carrying out a religious crusade in Asia and the Middle East.\"\n\nABC news consultant and retired army Major General William Nash was quoted by ABC news as saying he had \"no problem\" with organizations providing Bibles and other religious tracts to United States troops. \"But I do have a problem,\" said Nash, \"with military equipment being labeled in a way where it seems like it's our god against their god.\" Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) president Mikey Weinstein said that a private company can do whatever it wants to, but when a company becomes a defense contractor, responsibilities change. MRFF, one of the lead organizations in publicizing the problem—helping to break the stories on ABC news and \"Nightline\"—was initially criticized by Trijicon as a \"non-Christian\" group, but criticism of the verses on military weapons was quickly leveled by numerous secular and religious groups, including Christian and interfaith organizations. In fact, the reaction to the discovery was referred to as \"a maelstrom of media attention and criticism.\"\n\nSome initial military reactions seemed to dismiss the news as if it were of little importance, with one spokesperson comparing the verses to the presence of the phrase \"In God we Trust\" on United States currency. However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a \"stinging criticism of the contractor,\" Petraeus said that \"It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do.\" Petraeus added that \"There’s a reason that we put people through cultural awareness training...I can assure you that there is much greater sensitivity among our troops about this sort of thing than apparently there is from the contractor.\"\n\nTrijicon's sales director reported that the practice of putting Bible references on their products, including gun scopes, had been continuing for almost 30 years, begun by Glyn Bindon, the founder of the company, and continued by his son Stephen after Glyn Bindon's death. The company said it had sold similar rifle sights to militaries in Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain. However, \"bowing to Pentagon concerns and an international outcry,\" Trijicon announced that it would \"immediately\" stop embossing the verses on products produced for any military. Additionally, it was providing \"modification kits\" to remove the inscriptions from weapons already purchased. The Trijicon website (FAQs section) includes a note that their products for consumers other than the military will continue to be inscribed with the Bible references.\n\nIn 2009, military leaders discarded and burned \"unsolicited\" Bibles sent to a soldier in Afghanistan by a United States church that had located Bibles translated into Dari and Pashto, \"the two most common Afghan languages.\" Military spokespersons said that the Bibles could be used for proselytization of Muslims (or contribute to the perception that United States troops were engaged in proselytization), actions which are strictly against United States policy for deployed troops. Central Command \"General Order Number 1\" (updated as General Order Number 1B), specifically prohibits \"proselytizing of any faith, religion, or practice,\" and military representatives say that \"\"if actions were perceived in this manner,\" they could \"endanger American troops and civilians in the devoutly Muslim nation.\" According to Afghan law, it is a crime to try to convert a Muslim to another faith.\"\n\nNews about the Bibles had reached the Al Jezeera network, which had broadcast a story about the possibility that American troops were violating anti-proselytization rules. The report included video footage of U.S. Army Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) Gary Hensley telling soldiers that they had a responsibility to \"hunt people for Jesus\": \"The special forces guys—they hunt men basically. We do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down... Get the hound of heaven after them, so we get them into the kingdom. That's what we do, that's our business.\" The footage shows a discussion between soldiers and their chaplain discussing how the Bibles might be distributed without violating the military's general order against proselytization, \"although they don't arrive at any clear plan.\" When a reporter from Al Jazeera brought up the issue of using the Bibles to proselytize Afghans during a May 4, 2009, Pentagon news conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen stated that \"from the United States military's perspective,\" it is \"not our position to ever push any specific kind of religion. Period.\"\n\nBibles and other religious materials have been provided to support the free exercise of religion on the part of military personnel for many years, including some distributed at no cost or reduced cost by organizations such as the American Bible Society (ABS), often using approaches by these groups that \"partnered with Chaplains for distribution to troops and sailors, airmen and marines.\" In fact, \"Upon its founding the ABS immediately began distributing Bibles to military servicemen, with sailors of the USS \"John Adams\" being the first recipients in 1817.\" During World War II, the military supply system began to include religious materials for military personnel, and at the request of then-Army Chief of Chaplains (Major General) William R. Arnold, the Government Printing Office (GPO) began printing various versions of the Bible: a Roman Catholic version of the New Testament in 1941–42, a Protestant version in 1942, and a Jewish version of the Hebrew Scriptures in 1941–42. (According to Bible scholar John D. Laing, it is possible that the reason that only Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish holy books were printed was that those were the three faith groups represented by chaplains at that time.)\n\nFor a number of reasons, including the fact that \"one Bible does not fit all\", and different chaplains and religious communities preferred different versions of the Bible, such items are no longer printed by the GPO, but \"instead publishers may apply for a national stock number their items and chaplains can order the supplies they wish to use or have on hand for distribution to their service members.\" Through this process, \"there are numerous versions of the Bible available for order through official channels with government funds.\"\nSome civilian groups, like the \"Military Bible Association\", work to produce and distribute Bibles to military personnel as part of their mission statements. The Military Bible Association advertises that it has produced a \"Leader's Bible\" that is \"an update of the King James Bible created by \"military chaplains\": \"The Military Bible Association was founded to provide military men and women with The Leader’s Bible, an update of the King James Version by Military Chaplains. The Military Bible Association realizes the need to reach out to the military, because military personnel are often a forgotten group, who need the love of Christ.\" Although \"military chaplains\" are credited with helping to create the Bible, and the cover of the book includes the words \"translated by military chaplains,\" chaplains actually mentioned by name on the website—either endorsing the Bible or as members of the organization—are retired from the military.\n\nHowever, while many groups work to provide Bibles for the military, sometimes promoting their relationships with retired or active duty chaplains, the actual use of military symbols—the emblem of the Department of Defense or emblems for one or more branches of the military—on Bibles available for purchase became a source of controversy in 2005. Some of these Bibles—printed and published by civilian publishing houses or churches—bear titles such as \"The Soldier’s Bible\" or \"The Airman’s Bible,\" which (according to critics) when linked to the symbols might give the impression that the military is endorsing (or even \"establishing\") religion in general, or the specific religion or faith group for whom one particular version of the Bible is considered holy.\n\nAccording to news reports, the army’s position is that official military symbols can only be used with the permission of \"The Institute of Heraldry\", which authorizes usage on publications of \"an official or quasi-official nature.\" Critics claimed that Holman Bible Publishers (owned by the Southern Baptist Convention), the publisher of many versions of military Bibles that feature official emblems, was using the emblems without authorization, but Ricky King, Holman’s product development manager, said that the company has \"written permission on file from each branch of the military service.\" Additionally, the Bibles do include a statement, \"set in small type on the third page at the front,\" that \"The seal of the Army is used by permission but in no way carries the endorsement of this product by the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense or the government of the United States.\" Some constitutional lawyers point out that a disclaimer \"is not a sure-fire means to avoid First Amendment litigation. Ronald Eades, University of Louisville School of Law explains that \"disclaimers help, but they're not a perfect solution.\" However, because permission to use the emblems was on file, the publisher has continued to print the Bibles.\n\nHowever, National Public Radio published an article in its on-line edition, written by Jeff Brady and entitled \"’The Soldier’s Bible’ draws fire,\" which said that the emblems make the Bibles appear to be \"official government publications.\" In addition to the emblems, \"inspirational words\" from a number of military leaders are included on the back cover. Barry Lind, representing Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that the Bibles could give the impression that the military is \"promoting a particular evangelical religious viewpoint.\"\n\nEarlier, in April 2003, the American Bible Society had already published an edition of the Bible titled \"The Holy Bible (Good News Translation/GNT): Armed Forces Edition\" which also had official military emblems on the front and back covers: the emblems of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chaplain Corps on the front, and the emblems of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard on the back. The ABS describes this work as \"A historic Military Bible developed with the Chiefs of Chaplains of the Armed Services. Easy to read and understand Good News Translation in Desert camouflage cover. Includes photos of military personnel from all branches, familiar hymns, inspirational quotations.\" According to news reports, the practice of having chaplains distribute Bibles to those who desire them is a long-standing tradition in the military, but \"showing favoritism [by the military or the Chaplain Corps] toward a particular religion would constitute establishment.\" Therefore, although this edition of the Bible includes a welcome letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains at the time it was published—Major General Gaylord T. Gunhus, United States Army, Rear Admiral Barry C. Black, United States Navy, and Lorraine K. Potter, United States Air Force—that letter notes that \"Department of Defense chaplains represent the American landscape of faith groups and religious communities,\" and that because the Bible is both \"the most influential book in all human history\" and \"for many a constant companion to aid in directing one's life\":\n\nJune 2012 news sources announced that permission granted to use military emblems on Bibles had been revoked, with publishers notified in 2011 that the decision was made based on new military trademark licensing issues. One navy spokesman quoted in a Fox News online report stated that the decision was a \"trademark issue,\" and \"not a matter of religion.\" Additionally, the Department of Defense announced that all Bibles with military emblems must be removed from military stores. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation had threatened to sue the government if permission to use military emblems on Bibles was not revoked, noting that the Bibles were both an \"unconstitutional government endorsement of religion\" and a \"national security threat.\"\n\nThe use of military emblems on \"prayer coins\" created by the \"American Defenders of Freedom\" (ADOF), distributed at no charge to military chaplains only if the chaplains clearly indicate on the order forms \"how tracts/coins will be used for evangelism\"\nis another example of a controversy regarding military symbols and religious materials. ADOF materials state that: \"To obtain our materials without charge the Chaplain must describe in his/her order how our materials will be used in an evangelism process to share the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. Chaplains will be required to pay for Prayer Coins used for other than ministry purposes, such as awards, recognitions, remembrances, etc.\" Additionally, ADOF notes that \"Prayer Tracts and Prayer Reminder Coins are provided without charge to Chaplains for evangelistic Christian Ministry to troops, sailors, airmen and marines. Coins may also be purchased for special uses other than ministry…\"\n\nWhile coins had the emblems of the army, navy, and air force until 2008, Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter withdrew Navy permission to use its seal, necessitating a redesign of the coins to include army and air force emblems—announced in ADOF's January 2008 newsletter with the following statement: \"\"The Navy Prayer Reminder Coin was completely re-designed (an improvement) because the Secretary of the Navy would not give permission to use the official Navy seal on the Navy Prayer Reminder Coin – Satan is always at work.\"\n\nWhile most issues involving the military and religious apparel involve requests from service personnel for permission to wear apparel required by their own religions, in December 2001 air force Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally (a graduate of the Air Force Academy, and then the highest-ranking female fighter pilot in the air force) sued the air force because of the policy that required female military personnel assigned to bases in Saudi Arabia to wear the Muslim abaya, a \"head-to-toe\" robe, whenever they were off base. McSally's suit alleged that \"the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men.\" In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:\n\nGeneral Tommy Franks, head of the United States Central Command, announced in 2002 that women would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be \"encouraged\" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change—which was strongly criticized by Saudi officials as both a violation of Islamic law and Saudi sovereignty—Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been \"under review\" before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a court martial if she did not comply and wear the abaya.\n\nCritics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for \"women diplomats\" assigned to the United States Embassy in Riyadh, who were actually encouraged not to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, \"because they are representing the United States.\" Embassy officials stated that \"in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress.\" According to these United States officials, \"the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe.\"\n\nEventually Congress \"approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers’ money to buy them.\"\n\nNearly a decade after the abaya requirement was rescinded in Saudi Arabia, \"strong encouragement\" to wear the hijab, a female headscarf, was the military policy in force for female personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Some female personnel wear it over their helmets and some chose to wear the scarves in place of their helmets. According to McSally, \"Some servicewomen have taken off the regulation helmet and worn just the scarf, even when on patrol outside, in their combat uniforms and body armor, M-4s slung over their shoulders. The more common practice is to wear the scarf under one’s helmet or around the neck, pulling it on as the servicewoman removes her Kevlar helmet upon entering a village or building.\"\n\nWhile the military defends the policy of encouragement to wear the hijab as a \"sign of respect\" to the local culture that \"\"can help promote greater trust and a fuller interaction with the local population,\" McSally, who retired from the air force as a colonel, said that \"especially in combat settings,\" when a superior tells a military subordinate that a practice is encouraged, \"the very mention of the practice creates pressure to comply.\" In a February 18, 2011 op-ed in \"The Washington Post,\" she said that the policy of encouraging women to wear the \"Muslim headscarves\" is \"appeasement, not respect\" and that \"American servicewomen will continue to be viewed as second-class warriors if leaders push them to take up the customs of countries where women are second-class citizens.\" She wrote that \"Top military leaders should issue guidance that U.S. servicewomen are not authorized to wear a Muslim headscarf while in their uniform conducting military duties. If they don't, Congress should intervene again, as they did on the abaya, and prohibit its wear.\"\n\nThe basic words \"chaplain\" and \"chapel\" are derived from an ancient story about symbols of religion and faith:\n\nChaplains no longer guard a \"relic\" like St. Martin's cloak, but they themselves have been called symbols of service, faith, hope, and cooperation across faith lines, and even reminders of \"the presence of God\" in stories such as that of the \"Four Chaplains\" (sometimes referred to as the \"Immortal Chaplains\")—two ministers, a Catholic priest, and a rabbi—who each gave up his life jacket to save others when the was torpedoed during WWII, and the four Army chaplains ministered to the wounded and dying until they themselves died. That story, told in print, art, and film has become a symbol of \"interfaith in action,\" the phrase used by the Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation, and included on the 1948 postage stamp dedicated to their memory. Vassar College professor Deborah Dash Moore has referred to the story of the Four Chaplains by saying that \"The symbolism of their deaths exemplified faith confronting diversity, the triumph of cooperation over religious competition, the ultimate sacrifice by officers for their men, the power of duty over death.\"\n\nUniversity of Toronto professor Doris L. Bergen has written that because of the \"chaos and terror\" encountered during military service, the chaplain becomes \"a symbol that somehow, even in the midst of death and fear, there is meaning,\" and a symbol of the ability to maintain \"courage, hope, and steadfastness in the face of alienation and destruction.\" According to a letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains that was included in the 2003 edition of the American Bible Society's \"Armed Forces Bible,\" chaplains are \"a visible reminder of the Holy.\" Similarly, an August 2011 Washington Post \"Guest Voice\" op-ed noted that:\n\nFor both military personnel and civilians, the work of chaplains became a symbol of cooperation that crossed many lines, including racial lines at a time when such cooperation was considered noteworthy (and even newsworthy) in the civilian community—as evidenced by a 1943 newsreel of Army Chaplain School training (then at Harvard University) which featured captions such as \"White and Negro chaplains come out of the school building and march,\" and \"White and Negro Chaplains perform a drill at Harvard University Chaplain School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\"\n\nScholars have noted that interfaith cooperation among chaplains in the military led to improved interfaith relations in America—to the point that, at least according to some, it actually \"transformed religion in America in the postwar period\"\nCivilian communities felt the impact where former chaplains left the military to take positions at civilian houses of worship, but even where that did not happen, citizens were affected by the stories of military personnel and their chaplains, which became symbols of both cooperation across faith lines and faith in the face of adversity. Additionally, the military chaplain became a symbol in some religious communities (such as the Jewish community) for the kind of spiritual leader its members desired for themselves:\n\nWhen President Reagan quoted the words that the service of chaplains during and after the 1983 Beirut bombing symbolized that \"we Americans still believed that we could be proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain,\" that speech was one of many that saw the presence of military chaplains as both a symbol of faith and a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect. In the words of that report:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4130077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4130077", "title": "Sasan", "text": "Sasan\n\nSāssān (Middle Iranian > Persian ساسان, also known as Sasan), considered the eponymous ancestor of the Sasanian (or Sassanid) Dynasty (ruled 224-651) in Persia, was \"a great warrior and hunter\" and a Zoroastrian high priest in Pars. He lived some time near the fall of the Arsacid (Parthian) Empire in the early 3rd century CE.\n\nThere are many slightly different stories concerning Sasan and his relation to Ardashir I, the founder of the Sasanian Empire. The northern Iranian historian Tabari mentions that Sasan married a princess of the Bāzarangid family, the vassal dynasty of Pārs, and that Sasan was a grandfather of Ardashir I, while Papak is named as Ardashir I's father.\n\nAccording to the Pahlavi book of Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan, Sasan's wife was a daughter of a nobleman called Papak. The marriage was arranged by Papak after hearing that Sasan has \"Achamenian (Achaemenid) blood in him\". Their son was Ardashir I. Sasan vanishes shortly after Ardashir appears in the story and Papak is \"considered the father of Ardashir\".\n\nThese stories on different relations between Ardashir, Pāpak, and Sāsān have, according to Frye, a Zoroastrian explanation. Sasan was indeed the father of Ardashir and \"disappears\" from the story after the birth of Ardashir. Similar to the current Zoroastrian practices, Papak had then taken the responsibility of his daughter and her son Ardashir after Sasan \"disappears\" and is named afterwards as the father of Ardashir.\n\nIn the Kabe Zartosht inscription of Shapur I the Great, the four named persons \"Sasan, Papak, Ardashir, Shapur\" have different titles: Sasan is named as \"hwataw\" or \"xwadāy\" (\"the lord\", usually given to sovereigns of small local principalities), Papak as \"shah\", Ardashir as \"shāhanshāh\" (\"King of Kings of the Sasanian Empire\") and Shapur as \"King of Kings of Iran and Aniran\".\n\nHowever, according to Touraj Daryaee, Sasanian sources cannot be trusted because they were from the royal Sasanian archives, which were made by the court, in the words of Daryaee, \"to fit the world-view of the late Sasanian world\". Daryaee and several other scholars state that Sasan had his name from a deity who was known in many parts of Asia but not in Fars, the homeland of the Sasanians, which thus means that Sasan was an Iranian foreigner from the west or the east who had settled in Fars, whose inhabitants did not know about this deity he believed in. Sasan later managed to become the priest of the important Anahid temple in Estakhr, the capital of Fars. According to the Bundahishn, which according to Daryaee was made independently and not by the Sasanian court, Sasan's daughter later married Papak and bore him Ardashir. Furthermore, the Bundahishn states that Sasan was the son of a certain Weh-afrid.\n\nThe political ambition of Sasan was evoked by the troubles and weakness of the last years of the Parthian empire. According to Tabari, Papak managed to consolidate his power with the help of his own sons Shapur and Ardashir. This is considered the beginning of the Sasanian dynasty.\n\nSasan's family became the rulers of the second Persian Empire and ruled over a great portion of western Asia (the first Persian Empire having been ruled by the dynasty of Cyrus the Great). The three founders of this new empire – that is, Papak and his two sons – are depicted and mentioned on the wall of the harem of Xerxes at Persepolis, a remnant site of the Achaemenids, a representation suggested to be the evidence of a claim to Achaemenid heritage likely later added.\n\nSasan is known for his efforts to try to bring Zoroastrianism back into the empire. He even encouraged Papak to take over the Parthian satrapy of Pars.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "650498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=650498", "title": "Shaktism", "text": "Shaktism\n\nShaktism (Sanskrit: \"\", lit., \"doctrine of energy, power, the Goddess\") is a major tradition of Hinduism, wherein the metaphysical reality is considered metaphorically feminine Adi Parashakti is supreme . It includes a variety of goddesses, all considered aspects of the same supreme goddess. Shaktism has different sub-traditions, ranging from those focussed on gracious Gauri to fierce Kali, and some Shakti sub-traditions associate their goddess with Shiva or Brahma or Vishnu.\n\nThe Sruti and Smriti texts of Hinduism are an important historical framework of the Shaktism tradition. In addition, it reveres the texts \"Devi Mahatmya\", the \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\", and Shakta Upanishads such as the Devi Upanishad. The \"Devi Mahatmya\" in particular, is considered in Shaktism to be as important as the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nShaktism is known for its various sub-traditions of Tantra, as well as a galaxy of goddesses with respective systems. It consists of the Vidyapitha and Kulamārga. The pantheon of goddesses in Shaktism grew after the decline of Buddhism in India, wherein Hindu and Buddhist goddesses were combined to form the Mahavidya, a list of ten goddesses. The most common aspects of Devi found in Shaktism include Durga, Kali, Amba, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Parvati and Tripurasundari. The goddess-focussed tradition is particularly popular in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Kumaon, Mithila (North Bihar) and Nepal and the neighboring regions, which it celebrates through festivals such as the Durga puja. Shaktism's ideas have influenced Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions, with the goddess considered the \"Shakti\" of Vishnu and Shiva respectively, and revered prominently in numerous Hindu temples and festivals.\n\nOne of the earliest evidence of reverence for the feminine aspect of God in Hinduism appears in chapter 10.125 of the \"Rig Veda\", also called the Devi Suktam hymn:\n<poem>\nI am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first of those who merit worship.\nThrough me alone all eat the food that feeds them, – each man who sees, breathes, hears the word outspoken.\nI, verily, myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome.\nI bend the bow for Rudra [Shiva], that his arrow may strike, and slay the hater of devotion.\nOn the world's summit I bring forth sky the Father: my home is in the waters, in the ocean as Mother.\nI created all worlds at my will, without any higher being, and permeate and dwell within them.\n</poem>\n–Devi Sukta, \"Rigveda 10.125.3 – 10.125.8\",\nThe Vedic literature reveres various goddesses, but far less frequently than gods Indra, Agni and Soma. Yet, they are declared equivalent aspects of gender neutral Brahman, of Prajapati and Purusha. The goddesses often mentioned in the Vedic layers of text include the Ushas (dawn), Vac (speech, wisdom), Sarasvati (as river), Prithivi (earth), Nirriti (annihilator), Shraddha (faith, confidence). Goddesses such as Uma appear in the Upanishads as another aspect of Brahman and the knower of ultimate knowledge, such as in section 3 and 4 of the ancient \"Kena Upanishad\".\n\nHymns to goddesses are in the ancient Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\", particularly in the later (100 to 300 CE) added \"Harivamsa\" section of it. The archaeological and textual evidence implies, states Thomas Coburn, that the Goddess had become as much a part of the Hindu tradition, as God, by about the third or fourth century. The literature on Shakti theology grew in ancient India, climaxing in one of the most important texts of Shaktism called the \"Devi Mahatmya\". This text, states C. Mackenzie Brown – a professor of Religion, is both a culmination of centuries of Indian ideas about the divine feminine, as well as a foundation for the literature and spirituality focussed on the feminine transcendence in centuries that followed. The \"Devi-Mahatmya\" is not the earliest literary fragment attesting to the existence of devotion to a goddess figure, states Thomas B. Coburn – a professor of Religious Studies, but \"it is surely the earliest in which the object of worship is conceptualized as Goddess, with a capital G\".\n\nOther important texts of Shaktism include the \"Shakta Upanishads\", as well as Shakta-oriented Upa Puranic literature such as the \"Devi Purana\" and \"Kalika Purana\", the \"Lalita Sahasranama\" (from the \"Brahmanda Purana\"). The \"Tripura Upanishad\" is historically the most complete introduction to Shakta Tantrism, distilling into its 16 verses almost every important topic in Shakta Tantra tradition. Along with the \"Tripura Upanishad\", the \"Tripuratapini Upanishad\" has attracted scholarly bhasya (commentary) in the second half of 2nd-millennium, such as by Bhaskararaya, and by Ramanand. These texts link the Shakti Tantra tradition as a Vedic attribute, however this link has been contested by scholars.\n\nShaktas conceive the Goddess as the supreme, ultimate, eternal reality of all existence, or same as the Brahman concept of Hinduism. She is considered to be simultaneously the source of all creation, its embodiment and the energy that animates and governs it, and that into which everything will ultimately dissolve. According to V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar – a professor of Indian history, in Shaktism theology \"Brahman is static Shakti and Shakti is dynamic Brahman.\"\n\nShaktism views the Devi as the source, essence and substance of everything in creation. Its texts such as the \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\" states:\n\nShaktism's focus on the Divine Feminine does not imply a rejection of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi is considered to be the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.\n\nThe philosophical premises in many Shakta texts, states June McDaniel – a professor of Religious Studies, is syncretism of Samkhya and Advaita Vedanta schools of Hindu philosophy, called \"Shaktadavaitavada\" (literally, the path of nondualistic Shakti).\n\nThe seventh book of the \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\" presents the theology of Shaktism. This book is called \"Devi Gita\", or the \"Song of the Goddess\". The Goddess explains she is the Brahman that created the world, asserting the Advaita premise that spiritual liberation occurs when one fully comprehends the identity of one's soul and the Brahman. This knowledge, asserts the Goddess, comes from detaching self from the world and meditating on one's own soul.\n\nThe \"Devi Gita\", like the \"Bhagavad Gita\", is a condensed philosophical treatise. It presents the divine female as a powerful and compassionate creator, pervader and protector of the universe. She is presented in the opening chapter of the \"Devi Gita\" as the benign and beautiful world-mother, called \"Bhuvaneshvari\" (literally, ruler of the universe). Thereafter, the text presents its theological and philosophical teachings.\nThe \"Devi Gita\" describes the Devi (or Goddess) as \"universal, cosmic energy\" resident within each individual. It thus weaves in the terminology of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. The text is suffused with Advaita Vedanta ideas, wherein nonduality is emphasized, all dualities are declared as incorrect, and interconnected oneness of all living being's soul with Brahman is held as the liberating knowledge. However, adds Tracy Pintchman – a professor of Religious Studies and Hinduism, \"Devi Gita\" incorporates Tantric ideas giving the Devi a form and motherly character rather than the gender-neutral concept of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta.\n\nSub-traditions of Shaktism include \"Tantra\", which refers to techniques, practices and ritual grammar involving \"mantra\", \"yantra\", \"nyasa\", \"mudra\" and certain elements of traditional kundalini yoga, typically practiced under the guidance of a qualified guru after due initiation (\"diksha\") and oral instruction to supplement various written sources. There has been a historic debate between Shakta theologians on whether its tantric practices are Vedic or non-Vedic.\n\nThe roots of Shakta Tantrism are unclear, probably ancient and independent of the Vedic tradition of Hinduism. The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century, and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and political instability in and after 14th-century CE.\n\nShaktas approach the Devi in many forms; however, they are all considered to be but diverse aspects of the one supreme goddess. The primary Devi form worshiped by a Shakta devotee is his or her \"ishta-devi\", that is a personally selected Devi. The selection of this deity can depend on many factors, such as family tradition, regional practice, guru lineage and personal resonance.\n\nSome forms of the goddess are widely known in the Hindu world. The common goddesses of Shaktism, popular in the Hindu thought at least by about mid 1st-millennium CE, include Parvati, Durga, Kali, Amba, Tripurasundari, Lakshmi (and her avatars such as Radha, Sita), and Saraswati. The rarer forms of Devi found among tantric Shakta are the Mahavidyas, particularly Tara, Bhairavi, Chhinnamasta, Kamala and Buvaneshwari. Other major goddess groups include the \"Sapta-Matrika\" (\"Seven Little Mothers\"), \"who are the energies of different major gods, and described as assisting the great Shakta Devi in her fight with demons\", and the 64 \"Yoginis\".\n\nThe Vidyāpīṭha is subdivided into Vāmatantras, Yāmalatantras, and Śaktitantras.\n\nThe Kulamārga preserves some of the distinctive features of the Kāpālika tradition, from which it is derived. It is subdivided into four subcategories of texts based on the goddesses Kuleśvarī, Kubjikā, Kālī and Tripurasundarī respectively. The Trika texts are closely related to the Kuleśvarī texts and can be considered as part of the Kulamārga.\n\nShaktism encompasses a nearly endless variety of beliefs and practices – from animism to philosophical speculation of the highest order – that seek to access the Shakti (Divine Energy or Power) that is believed to be the Devi's nature and form. Its two largest and most visible schools are the \"Srikula\" (family of \"Sri\"), strongest in South India, and the \"Kalikula\" (family of \"Kali\"), which prevails in northern and eastern India.\n\nThe \"Srikula\" (family of \"Sri\") tradition (\"sampradaya\") focuses worship on Devi in the form of the goddess \"Lalita-Tripura Sundari\", who is regarded as the Great Goddess (\"Mahadevi\"). Rooted in first-millennium Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir Valley, Srikula became a force in South India no later than the seventh century, and is today the prevalent form of Shaktism practiced in South Indian regions such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Tamil areas of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Srikula's best-known school is Srividya, \"one of Shakta Tantrism's most influential and theologically sophisticated movements.\" Its central symbol, the \"Sri Chakra\", is probably the most famous visual image in all of Hindu Tantric tradition. Its literature and practice is perhaps more systematic than that of any other Shakta sect.\n\nSrividya largely views the Goddess as \"benign [\"saumya\"] and beautiful [\"saundarya\"]\" (in contrast to Kalikula's focus on \"terrifying [\"ugra\"] and horrifying [\"ghora\"]\" goddess forms such as Kali or Durga). In Srikula practice, moreover, every aspect of the Goddess – whether malignant or gentle – is identified with Lalita.\n\nSrikula adepts most often worship Lalita using the abstract \"Sri Chakra\" yantra, which is regarded as her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily as part of the worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the \"Sri Meru\". It is not uncommon to find a \"Sri Chakra\" or \"Sri Meru\" installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – \"there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. But what you see in the temples is not the \"srichakra\" worship you see when it is done privately.\"\n\nThe Srividya \"paramparas\" can be further broadly subdivided into two streams, the \"Kaula\" (a \"vamamarga\" practice) and the \"Samaya\" (a \"dakshinamarga\" practice). The \"Kaula\" or \"Kaulachara\", first appeared as a coherent ritual system in the 8th century in central India, and its most revered theorist is the 18th-century philosopher Bhaskararaya, widely considered \"the best exponent of Shakta philosophy.\"\n\nThe \"Samaya\" or \"Samayacharya\" finds its roots in the work of the 16th-century commentator Lakshmidhara, and is \"fiercely puritanical [in its] attempts to reform Tantric practice in ways that bring it in line with high-caste brahmanical norms.\" Many Samaya practitioners explicitly deny being either Shakta or Tantric, though scholars argues that their cult remains technically both. The Samaya-Kaula division marks \"an old dispute within Hindu Tantrism,\" and one that is vigorously debated to this day.\n\nThe \"Kalikula\" (family of \"Kali\") form of Shaktism is most dominant in Nepal, northern and eastern India, and is most widely prevalent in West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Odisha, as well as parts of Maharashtra, Bangladesh and some parts of Kerala. \"Kalikula\" lineages focus upon the Devi as the source of wisdom (\"vidya\") and liberation (\"moksha\"). They generally stand \"in opposition to the brahmanic tradition,\" which they view as \"overly conservative and denying the experiential part of religion.\"\n\nThe main deities of Kalikula are \"Kali\", \"Chandi\", \"Parvati\" and \"Durga\". Other goddesses that enjoy veneration are \"Tara\" and all the other \"Mahavidyas\" as well as regional goddesses such as \"Manasa\", the snake goddess, and \"Sitala\", the smallpox goddess – all of them, again, considered aspects of the Divine Mother.\n\nIn Nepal devi is mainly worshipped as Kali, Bhawani, Matrika and Navadurga.There are many shakti peeth in Nepal including the main shakti peeth Guhyeshwari Temple of Guhyeshwari Devi also called as Guhekali Bhagawati on the bank of holy Bagmati river. She is one of the important deity in kalikula.\nTwo major centers of Shaktism in West Bengal are Kalighat in Calcutta and Tarapith in Birbhum district. In Calcutta, emphasis is on devotion (\"bhakti\") to the goddess as \"Kali\":\n\nAt Tarapith, Devi's manifestation as \"Tara\" (\"She Who Saves\") or \"Ugratara\" (\"Fierce Tara\") is ascendant, as the goddess who gives liberation (\"kaivalyadayini\"). [...] The forms of \"sadhana\" performed here are more \"yogic\" and \"tantric\" than devotional, and they often involve sitting alone at the [cremation] ground, surrounded by ash and bone. There are shamanic elements associated with the Tarapith tradition, including \"conquest of the goddess', exorcism, trance, and control of spirits.\"\n\nThe philosophical and devotional underpinning of all such ritual, however, remains a pervasive vision of the Devi as supreme, absolute divinity. As expressed by the nineteenth-century saint Ramakrishna, one of the most influential figures in modern Bengali Shaktism:\n\nShaktas celebrate most major Hindu festivals, as well as a huge variety of local, temple- or deity-specific observances. A few of the more important events are listed below:\n\nThe most important Shakta festival is \"Navratri\" (lit., \"Festival of Nine Nights\"), also known as \"Sharad Navratri\" because it falls during the Hindu month of Sharad (October/November). This is the festival that worships the Navadurgas, forms of Parvati. This festival – often taken together with the following tenth day, known as \"Dusshera\" or \"Vijayadashami\" – celebrates the goddess Durga's victory over a series of powerful demons described in the \"Devi Mahatmya\".\nIn Bengal, the last four days of Navaratri are called Durga Puja, and mark one episode in particular: Durga's iconic slaying of Mahishasura (lit., the \"Buffalo Demon\").\n\nWhile Hindus of all denominations celebrate the autumn Navratri festival, Shaktas also celebrate two additional Navratris – one in the spring and one in the summer. The spring festival is known as \"Vasanta Navaratri\" or \"Chaitra Navatri\", and celebrated in the Hindu month of Chaitra (March/April). Srividya lineages dedicate this festival to Devi's form as the goddess Lalita. The summer festival is called \"Ashada Navaratri\", as it is held during the Hindu month of Ashadha (June/July). The Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu, with Vaishno Devi considered an aspect of Durga, celebrates Navaratri. \"Ashada Navaratri\", on the other hand, is considered particularly auspicious for devotees of the boar-headed goddess Varahi, one of the seven Matrikas named in the \"Devi Mahatmya\".\n\nFifth day of Magha Gupta Navratri is very important for all branches of Shakta-pantha. Specially in Vindhyachal mahashakti peetham, thousands of chandipatha and other secret rituals performed this day to please Aadishakti. This is the festival of union of Shakti & Shiv (Shiva-Shiv). On the same basis Shiva-Shiv Sammoh is formed by Awadhoot Kripanandnath at Awadhoot Ashram, Vindhyachal in 1980.\n\nLakshmi Puja is a part of Durga Puja celebrations by Shaktas, where Laksmi symbolizes the goddess of abundance and autumn harvest. Lakshmi's biggest festival, however, is \"Diwali\" (or \"Deepavali\"; the \"Festival of Lights\"), a major Hindu holiday celebrated across India and in Nepal as Tihar. In North India, Diwali marks the beginning of the traditional New Year, and is held on the night of the new moon in the Hindu month of Kartik (usually October or November). Shaktas (and many non-Shaktas) celebrate it as another Lakshmi Puja, placing small oil lamps outside their homes and praying for the goddess's blessings. Diwali coincides with the celebration of Kali Puja, popular in Bengal, and some Shakta traditions focus their worship on Devi as Parvati rather than Lakshmi.\n\"Jagaddhatri Puja\" is celebrated on the last four days of the Navaratis, following Kali Puja. It is very similar to Durga Puja in its details and observance, and is especially popular in Bengal and some other parts of Eastern India. \"Gauri Puja\" is performed on the fifth day after Ganesh Chaturthi, during Ganesha Puja in Western India, to celebrate the arrival of Gauri, Mother of Ganesha where she brings her son back home.\n\nMajor Shakta temple festivals are \"Meenakshi Kalyanam\" and \"Ambubachi Mela\". The \"Meenakshi Kalyanam\" is a part of the Chithirai Thiruvizha festival in Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of goddess Meenakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Parvati in marriage to Shiva. \"Ambubachi Mela\" or Ameti is a celebration of the menstruation of the goddess, by hundreds of thousands of devotees, in a festival held in June/July (during the monsoon season) at Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam. Here the Devi is worshiped in the form of a yoni-like stone, and the site is one of Shakta Pitha or pilgrimage sites in Shaktism.\n\nShaktism tradition practices animal sacrifice to revere goddesses such as Kali in many parts of India but particularly in the eastern states of India and Nepal. This is either an actual animal, or a vegetal or sweet dish substitute considered equivalent to the animal. In many cases, Shaktism devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.\n\nIn Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakti temples, particular to mark the legend of goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon. This involves slaying of a goat, chicken or a male water buffalo. This practice is rare among Hindus, outside this region.\n\nIn Bengal, animal sacrifice follows the guidelines in texts such as Mahanirvana Tantra are followed in selecting the animal, then a priest offers a prayer to the animal, then recites the Gayatri Mantra in its ear before killing it. The meat of the sacrificed animal is then eaten by the Shakta devotee.\n\nIn Nepal, animal sacrifice \"en masse\" occurs during the three-day-long Gadhimai festival. In 2009 it was speculated that more than 250,000 animals were sacrificed during this event.\n\nIn Odisha, during the Bali Jatra, Shaktism devotees sacrifice male goats to the goddess Samaleswari in her temple in Sambalpur, Orissa.\n\nThe Rajput of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses on Navratri, and formerly offered a sacrifice of a goat to a goddess revered as Kuldevi – a practice that continues in some places. The ritual requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The ritual is directed by a priest. The \"Kuldevi\" among these Rajput communities is a warrior-pativrata guardian goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.\n\nAnimal Sacrifice of a buffalo or goat, particularly during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced in parts of South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.\n\nIn the 19th-century through the early 20th-century, Indian laborers were shipped by the British Empire into colonial mining and plantations operations in the Indian ocean and the Caribbean regions. These included significant number of Shakta devotees. While instances of Shakta animal sacrifice during Kali puja in the Caribbean islands were recorded between 1850s to 1920s, these were relatively uncommon when compared to other rituals such as temple prayers, community dancing and fire walking.\n\nShaktism has at times been dismissed as a superstitious, black magic-infested practice that hardly qualifies as a true religion at all. A representative criticism of this sort issued from an Indian scholar in the 1920s:\n\nThe tantra practices are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias on the part of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These are some of the reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.\n\nBeyond tantra, the Shakta sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others. These traditions compare with Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartism as follows:\n\nThere is no census data available on demographic history or trends for Shaktism or other traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary on the relative number of adherents in Shaktism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Shaktism tradition is the smaller group with about 30 million or 3.2% of Hindus. In contrast, Galvin Flood states that Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are difficult to separate, as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals revering gods and goddesses henotheistically, with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati and other aspects of the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati (such as Durga, Radha, Sita and others) and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.\n\nShakta temples are found all over South Asia. Many towns, villages and geographic landmarks are named for various forms of the Devi. Major pilgrimage sites of Shaktism are called \"Shakti Peethas\", literally \"Seats of the Devi\". These vary from four to fifty one.\n\nSome Shakta temples are also found in Southeast Asia, the Americas, Europe, Australia and elsewhere. Examples in the United States include the \"Kali Mandir\" in Laguna Beach, California; and \"Sri Rajarajeswari Peetam\", a \"Srividya\" temple in rural Rush, New York.\n\nSome feminists and participants in New Age spirituality who are attracted to goddess worship\", suggest Shaktism is a \"symbol of wholeness and healing, associated especially with repressed female power and sexuality.\" However, these are adaptions and do not share Shakta theology.\n\nThere has been a significant sharing of ideas, ritual grammar and concepts between Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana tradition) found in Nepal and Tibet and the Tantric Shakta tradition of Hinduism. Both movements cherish female deities, view the female creativity as the power behind the universe, and the feminine as the ontological primary. According to Miranda Shaw, \"the confluence of Buddhism and Shaktism is such that Tantric Buddhism could properly be called Shakta Buddhism\".\n\nThe Buddhist Aurangabad Caves about 100 kilometers from the Ajanta Caves, dated to the 6th to 7th-century CE, show Buddhist Matrikas (mother goddesses of Shaktism) next to the Buddha. Other goddesses in these caves include Durga. The goddess iconography in these Buddhist caves is close, but not identical to the Hindu Shakta tradition. The \"seven goddess mothers\" are found in other Buddhist caves and literature, such as their discussion in the Buddhist text \"Manjusrimulakalpa\" and \"Vairocanabhisambodhi\".\n\nIn Jainism, ideas similar to Shaktism tradition are found, such as the Vidyadevis and the Shasanadevis.\n\nThe secondary scripture of Sikhs, \"Dasam Granth\" attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, includes numerous sections on Shakta goddesses, particularly Chandi – the fierce warrior form of the Hindu goddess. According to Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh – a professor of Religious Studies, the stories about goddess Durga in the \"Dasam Granth\" are reworkings of ancient Shakti mythologies. A significant part of this Sikh scripture is based on the teachings in the Shakta text \"Devi Mahatmya\" found in the \"Markandeya Purana\" of Hinduism.\n\nSome Westerners believe that many central concepts of Shaktism – including aspects of kundalini yoga as well as goddess worship – were once \"common to the Hindu, Chaldean, Greek and Roman civilizations,\" but were largely superseded in the West, as well as the Near and Middle East, with the rise of the Abrahamic religions:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2260505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260505", "title": "Spiritualist church", "text": "Spiritualist church\n\nA spiritualist church is a church affiliated with the informal spiritualist movement which began in the United States in the 1840s. Spiritualist churches are now found around the world, but are most common in English-speaking countries, while in Latin America, where a form of spiritualism called spiritism is more popular, meetings are held in spiritist centres, most of which are non-profit organizations rather than ecclesiastical bodies.\n\nThe origin of mediumship is usually linked to the Fox sisters at Hydesville, Arcadia, New York in 1848, but some believers date the unofficial beginning of modern American Spiritualism to the Shakers and similar religious groups. By 1853 the movement had reached San Francisco and London, and by 1860 was worldwide. The Fox family remained very active in Spiritualism for many years. Other notable Spiritualists of that era were Mercy Cadwallader, who became a sort of missionary for the movement, and Emma Hardinge Britten, who wrote for the first Spiritualist newspaper in Britain, \"The Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph\".\n\nBy the 1870s there were numerous Spiritualist societies and churches throughout the US and Britain, but there was little in the way of national organization of mediums in Britain or the United States although some regions of Britain had organized \"Federations\" that might have up to thirty circles of similar beliefs. In 1891 the National Federation of Spiritualists (NFS) came into existence and grew quite large before its name change to the Spiritualists' National Union (SNU) in 1902.\n\nBritish spiritualists of this time were often adherents of the temperance and anti-capital punishment lobbies, often held radical political views and were frequently vegetarians. Some were active in the advocacy of women's rights and female suffrage, and a minority espoused Free Love: the popular perception of Spiritualists was often of radicals in the Victorian period.\n\n\"Two Worlds\" was the major British magazine of spiritualism and had a fairly large circulation, and it advertised the existence of local circles. D.D. Home one of the most renowned mediums of his era, did much to make spiritualism fashionable among the aristocracy by his high-profile activities. Trance mediumship flourished and table turning was a popular craze, reputedly even reaching Buckingham Palace.\n\nBy 1924 there were 309 Spiritualist churches affiliated to the SNU or one of the many other organisations. In 1932, a new magazine, \"Psychic News\", joined \"Two Worlds\" on the newsstands of Britain and carried news of the doings in local Spiritualist churches.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1938 there was the British College of Psychic Studies (1920 to 1947) led by Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie in London, but more successful was the Arthur Findlay College at Stansted which continues to today.\n\nIn 1957 Spiritualist churches in Britain divided between the Spiritualists' National Union, influenced by Arthur Findlay's beliefs and holding spiritualism to be a religion, and the circles of Christian Spiritualism, who hold Spiritualism to be a denomination of Christianity. Spiritualists National Union churches form the large majority and are affiliated to Spiritualist Association of Great Britain (SAGB), which is not a church per se, but rather an organization for mediums. The SNU also has some member churches in other English speaking countries. Christian Spiritualist churches are mainly affiliated to The Greater World Christian Spiritualist Association (GWCSA).\n\nOther Spiritualist groups in the UK include the White Eagle Lodge, founded by the medium Grace Cooke, the Institute of Spiritualist Mediums and the Noah's Ark Society, that focuses on physical phenomena only.\n\nThere are Spiritualist churches in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The Republic of South Africa, Sweden and groups in many countries including Japan, the Scandinavian countries, Korea, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Iceland. Many such groups and also individuals, are members of the International Spiritualist Federation (ISF) which was founded in Belgium in 1923 and is an umbrella organization for all spiritualists. The ISF holds congresses every two years in different parts of the world.\n\nIn Australia, the Associated Christian Spiritual Churches of Australia (ACSCOA) and the Victorian Spiritualists' Union (VSU) co-exist alongside independent churches, and Canada has the Spiritualist Church of Canada (SCC) founded in 1974, along with a number of independent churches.\n\nAmerican spiritualism has long been more individualistic than its British counterpart. Many North America Spiritualist churches are denominationally affiliated with the National Spiritualist Association of Churches (NSAC), The National Spiritual Alliance (TNSA), or the United Spiritualist Church Association (USCA), but almost as many are independent churches with no national affiliation.\n\nSpiritualist churches generally have, in addition to the church proper, an educational wing called a lyceum (the Greek word for \"place of conversation\"). These Spiritualist lyceums function as a support system for the teaching of Spiritualist history and doctrine outside of the liturgical services, and enable the booking of guest lecturers and visiting mediums.\n\nA unique aspect of American Spiritualism, which sets it apart from British church tradition, was the nineteenth century development and institutionalization of Spiritualist Camps, organized by urban Spiritualist churches. These rural retreats, located in picturesque natural settings throughout the United States, allow Spiritualist families to spend their summer vacations boating, hiking, attending Spiritualist lectures, taking development classes in mediumship, and receiving messages from guest mediums. Among the best-known of the Spiritualist camps are Lily Dale Assembly in Lily Dale, New York, Camp Cassadaga in Cassadaga, Florida, On-I-Set-Wigwam Spiritualist Camp in Massachusetts, Camp Chesterfield in Indiana, Sunset Spiritualist Camp in Kansas, and Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1922, during a time of rising Jim Crow laws and segregationism, the NSAC expelled its African American members. The Black Spiritualists then formed a national organization called the Colored Spiritualist Association of Churches (CSAC), which included churches in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. The CSAC eventually fractured over leadership and doctrinal issues, and the historically African American Spiritualist churches, now loosely referred to as the spiritual church movement, currently includes a variety of denominations such as the African Cultural Nationalist Universal Hagar's Spiritual Church and the Protestant-Christian-oriented Pentecostal Spiritual Assemblies of Christ - International and Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ. The Spiritual Churches of New Orleans are a diverse group of denominations that have schismed from the denomination founded by the Wisconsin-born Mother Leafy Anderson in the early twentieth century. Their theology was grounded on a very original Black feminism, and particularly on the Gospel of John, 4 (the encounter of Jesus and the Samaritan woman).\n\nMost spiritual church movement churches incorporate theological Spiritualism, including the utilization of traditional \"Spirit Guides\" in worship services, with a mixture of Protestant and Catholic iconography. The names of individual churches in these diverse denominations tend to indicate the denominational Christian orientation of their founders or their congregations. Some, such as Divine Israel Spiritual Church (in New Orleans), recall typical Black Baptist churches, others, like Divine Harmony Spiritual Church (in Miami), have names evocative of the early twentieth century New Thought movement, and some, such as Infant of Prague Spiritual Church (in New Orleans), feature Catholic names and include statuary of Catholic saints on their altars. Unlike the NSAC Spiritualist churches, the denominations of the spiritual church movement generally do not maintain Spiritualist Camps or a Lyceum system of extra-liturgical education.\n\nSpiritualist churches are places of worship for the practitioners of Spiritualism. The Spiritualist service is usually conducted by a medium. Generally, there is an opening prayer, an address, the singing of hymns, and finally a demonstration of mediumship. Healing circles may also be part of the formal proceedings.\n\nSome Spiritualist churches maintain that Spiritualism is a religion in its own right, and has no relationship to any other religion.\n\nOther Spiritualist churches draw inspiration from Christianity. African American Spiritualist churches tend to encourage ecstatic worship styles derived from African-American Protestant Baptist and Pentecostal practices. The churches that directly descend from the teachings of Leafy Anderson are also distinguished by special services and hymns that honor the spirit of the Native American war chief Black Hawk, who lived in Illinois and Wisconsin (Anderson's home state).\n\nA third group of Spiritualist churches propose the idea of the Universe as the creator, and does not necessarily follow any specific religious doctrine or dogma.\n\nSpiritualists believe that when people die physically an aspect of the personality or mind survives this and continues to exist on a spirit plane, sometimes referred to as the spirit world. Spiritualists use the word \"Spirit\" as a plural which describes all minds and entities who have entered into the spirit world. The purpose of the medium is to provide some evidence that a human has survived by describing the person to their surviving relatives. The degree of accuracy with which the deceased are described goes some way to convincing the living relatives and friends that the medium has some contact with the spirit.\n\nSpiritualists describe this as \"survival evidence'\".\n\nThere have been a number of famous practitioners of spirit communication connected to Spiritualist churches. One of the principal advocates of Spiritualism was the 20th century British writer Arthur Findlay. Findlay was a magistrate, farmer and businessman who left his mansion house as place for the study and advancement of psychic science. This has now become a psychic college in Stansted, England and is run by the SNU.\n\nMediums develop their ability by sitting regularly in \"development circles\" with other student psychics. Meditation usually plays a large role in Spiritualist practice. Meditation is used to calm the \"voices\" of modern, hectic life so that the practitioner can better hear his or her guide. Meditation often includes the breathing practices of Buddhist meditation (ānāpānasati) and may also include the idea of chakras. The Spiritualist may also focus on the tenets of their chosen religion to help them attain a higher existence. These may include standard prayers (Hail Mary, Shema Yisrael or salat etc.), focusing on the name of God (Jesus, YHWH or Allah etc.) or other aspects of a holy nature. Like most meditation techniques, imaging (intensely imagining a place or situation) is common. There are specific imagings used to \"meet\" one's guide, connect with those who have died, receive protection or support from God or simply calming the mind.\n\nThrough engaging their intuition, they attempt to contact with the spirits of the dead. This is known as \"opening up\". In Britain especially, such mediums are trained to produce clear evidence that the spirit contacted is the person they claim it to be before going on to give any \"message\" from the spirit. Such evidence can be details of where they lived, including addresses sometimes, particulars of illnesses suffered and notable events in their lives, often known only to the person in the congregation being given the information.\n\nSpiritualist healing, as practiced in some Spiritualist churches during formal liturgical services, is a form of mediumship which involves a technique of directing healing energy to the patient from a higher source.

It is widely considered to be the location of the biblical Kadesh Barnea. Recently, some authors have referred to it as Tel Kadesh-barnea. Moshe Dothan (1965) referred to it as Tel 'Ein el Qudeirat, while in the early twentieth century Woolley and Lawrence used the spelling Tell Ain el Guderat.\n\n\"Tell el-Qudeirat\" is the name of the archaeological mound (the \"tell\") itself. It sits near \"Ain el-Qudeirat\", which Carol Redmount describes as \"the most fertile oasis in northern Sinai\". The \"Ain\" (\"spring\") flows out of the ground about 1.5 kilometers east of the tell, and the water from it flows west, becoming the \"Wadi el-Qudeirat\". The tell then sits along the northern bank of the wadi, which continues flowing west and then turns toward the north. The tell is located along the southern base of a hill known as \"Jebel el-Qudeirat\".\n\nDuring the Iron Age, Tell el-Qudeirat was a rectangular fortress, and multiple layers of fortifications have been uncovered. The modern site is a \"tell\", an archaeological mound caused by long-term human habitation. At the lowest level, labelled 4c, are traces of human habitation dated by Israel Finkelstein to the twelfth to tenth centuries BCE. Carol Redmount, on the other hand, claims that the oldest remains at the site date to the tenth century. Tell el-Qudeirat is one of scores of permanent settlements which existed in Iron Age II in the Negev Highlands. \n\nThe first archaeologists to notice the tell were T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") and C. L. Woolley in 1914. They described is as \"little mound about 200 feet long and 120 feet broad ... in a heap from twelve to fiteen feet high above the corn-fields.\" They considered their initial work insufficient to accurately date the remains, but suggested a date somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 BCE for it and the nearby fortresses at Qasr er-Ruheibeh and Bir Birein. They proposed that Tell el-Qudeirat was the biblical Kadesh-Barnea.\n\nFurther work on a limited scale (\"soundings\") was carried out at the tell by Moshe Dothan in 1956. Nelson Glueck (published in 1959), and Yohanan Aharoni (1967) discovered that a large number of other fortresses from the Iron Age also existed in the area, and proposed that these fortresses were built by Israelite kings to increase their influence over this area toward the southern edge of their dominions. Dothan concluded that the fortress itself existed in the eighth to sixth centuries, with evidence of human settlement at the site both before and after the existence of the fortress.\n\nRudolph Cohen conducted work on a much larger scale in 1976-1982. Cohen concluded that the site in fact contained remains of three fortresses. The first was built in the tenth century, in an oval shape. The second and third were rectangular. The second was built in the 700's BCE and destroyed in the 600's. The third seemed to have been built in the second half of the sixth century, during the reign of king Josiah, and was destroyed in 586 BCE when the Babylonians destroyed the kingdom of Judah. Despite the destruction of this last fortress, people continued to occupy the site approximately two centuries.\n\nMordechai Haiman (1994) argued that these settlements were installed by the Israelite United Monarchy between about 1000 and 925 BCE. Haiman held that these sites were abandoned after the kingdom of Israel split and Egypt invaded it around 925 BC. Of these sites, Haiman maintains that only Tell el-Qudeirat and two others were again settled in the eighth century, with Tell el-Qudeirat serving as an outpost of the kingdom of Judah.\n\nDavid Ussishkin (1995), on the other hand, argued that Cohen's \"second\" and \"third\" fortresses in fact constituted a single fort. While Cohen interpreted the fort as an outpost of the kingdom of Judah, Ussishkin suggested, following Nadav Na'aman, that it was not a project of the Judahite government but was perhaps constructed by Assyrians, later falling into Egyptian hands.\n\nIsrael Finkelstein has extended the lines of thinking found in Cohen and Ussishkin, while modifying some of their conclusions. What Cohen saw as an \"oval fortress\", Finkelstein sees as simply the remains of settlement between the tenth and eighth centuries, prior to any fortress construction. As for the rectangular remains, Finkelstein holds these to have been a single fortress operating from the mid-eighth century to about 600. Later human occupation at the site likely continued into the fourth century.\n\n"}
{"id": "868996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=868996", "title": "Three Secrets of Fátima", "text": "Three Secrets of Fátima\n\nThe Three Secrets of Fátima consist of a series of apocalyptic visions and prophecies which were supposedly given to three young Portuguese shepherds, Lúcia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto, by a Marian apparition, starting on May 13, 1917. The three children claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary six times between May and October 1917. The apparition is now popularly known as Our Lady of Fátima.\n\nAccording to Lucia, on July 13, 1917, around noon, the Virgin Mary entrusted the children with three secrets. Two of the secrets were revealed in 1941 in a document written by Lúcia, at the request of José Alves Correia da Silva, Bishop of Leiria, to assist with the publication of a new edition of a book on Jacinta. When asked by the Bishop in 1943 to reveal the third secret, Lúcia struggled for a short period, being \"not yet convinced that God had clearly authorized her to act.\" However, in October 1943 the Bishop ordered her to put it in writing. Lúcia then wrote the secret down and sealed it in an envelope not to be opened until 1960, when \"it will appear clearer\". The text of the third secret was officially released by Pope John Paul II in 2000, although some claim that it was not the entire secret revealed by Lúcia, despite repeated assertions from the Vatican to the contrary.\n\nAccording to various Catholic interpretations, the three secrets involve Hell, World War I and World War II, and 20th century persecutions of Christians.\n\nOf the hundreds of alleged apparitions the Catholic Church has investigated, only twelve have received ecclesiastical approval, and nine of them occurred between 1830 and 1933. Cultural anthropologists Victor and Edith Turner, who converted to Catholicism in 1958, at one time viewed the increase in Marian apparition \"cults\" as a post-industrial reaction of a \"disenfranchised lower middle class to a rapidly changing culture.\"\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Lúcia was sent to the school of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy in Vilar, near Porto. In 1928, she became a postulant at the Dorothean convent in Tui, just across the border in Spain. Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (now Sister María Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, in the event that she might disclose further details of the 1917 apparitions.\n\nAs early as July 1917, mention was made that the Lady of the apparitions had entrusted to the children a secret, \"that was good for some and bad for others\". It was not until her third memoir, written in 1941, that Lúcia indicated that the secret had three parts. In this she follows Mélanie Calvat of La Salette, whose secrets were written down almost twenty years after the event.\n\nIn her third memoir, written in 1941, Lúcia said that the first secret, a vision of Hell, was disclosed to the children on July 13, 1917.\n\nThe second secret was a statement that World War I would end, along with a prediction of another war during the reign of Pope Pius XI, should men continue offending God and should Russia not convert. The second half requests that Russia be consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary:\nIn 1925 Sister Lucia reported an apparition of the Virgin Mary at the Convent of Saint Dorothea at Pontevedra, Galicia. She said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturday Devotions. By her account a subsequent vision of the Child Jesus reiterated this request. In 1930, she wrote to her confessor that in 1929 she had a vision of both Mary and the Holy Trinity in which God had asked for the Consecration of Russia to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary by the Pope in communion with all the bishops of the world. The message regarding the establishment of the Devotion of the Five First Saturdays is reminiscent of that reported by Margaret Mary Alacoque in the seventeenth century, which led to the First Friday Devotion.\n\nIt is unlikely that this message was conveyed to the Pope, but the Bishop of Leiria suggested that she write her memoirs in the event that she might reveal further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her third memoir, written in 1941, Sister Lucia recalled that at the apparition of July 13, 1917, the Virgin Mary had first mentioned the consecration of Russia, and said that she would return to give particulars.\n\nSkeptics have noted that the second prophecy was not disclosed until August 1941, after World War II had already begun. They have also questioned whether Mary, in 1917, referred explicitly to Pope Pius XI, as Ambrogio Ratti did not choose that regnal name until after his election in 1922. Further, the European portion of World War II is generally held to have begun on September 1, 1939, and by then, Pope Pius XII had succeeded Pius XI. As for the \"conversion\" of Russia, to what was Mary making reference on July 13, 1917? The Bolshevik Revolution did not come until November, 1917. \n\nSome proponents of the Fatima prophecies argue that the secret did not say that the war must begin in Europe, and during the pontificate of Pius XI Japan had already invaded China in 1937, which is generally seen by historians of China and other parts of Asia as when the Second World War actually began, a view which also has qualified support from some Western historians. Some critics argue that the Russian Civil War (1918-1921), the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), the Chinese Civil War (1927-1937), the war between Italy and Ethiopia (1935-1936), and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), serve to illustrate that the prediction that one war will end and that another will start is not necessarily an indication of divine inspiration. Proponents of the prophecy will point out that the second secret called for a war worse than World War I, not simply any armed conflict. In addition, with regards to the conversion of Russia, there was already, at the time, strong revolutionary ferment in Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution as witnessed by the earlier February Revolution in 1917 and the active communist and anarchist movements, which would explain Mary's reference to the conversion Russia on July 13, 1917\n\nOn January 25, 1938, \"The New York Times\" reported \"Aurora Borealis Startles Europe; People Flee in Fear, Call Firemen.\" The celestial display was seen from Canada to Bermuda to Austria to Scotland, and short-wave radio transmissions were shut down for almost 12 hours in Canada. It is noteworthy that during the final hour of this aurora, Christian Rakovsky was undergoing interrogation in the Soviet Union, giving information to Stalin about Western involvement in Hitler's rise, suggesting an alliance with the Western powers against Germany.\n\nSister Lúcia chose not to disclose the third secret in her memoir of August 1941. In 1943, Lúcia fell seriously ill with influenza and pleurisy. Bishop Silva, visiting her on 15 September 1943, suggested that she write the third secret down to ensure that it would be recorded in the event of her death. Lúcia was hesitant to do so, however. At the time she received the secret, she had heard Mary say not to reveal it, but because Carmelite obedience requires that orders from superiors be regarded as coming directly from God, she was in a quandary as to whose orders took precedence. Finally, in mid-October, Bishop Silva sent her a letter containing a direct order to record the secret, and Lúcia obeyed.\nThe third part of the secret was written down \"by order of His Excellency the Bishop of Leiria and the Most Holy Mother\" on January 3, 1944. In June 1944, the sealed envelope containing the third secret was delivered to Silva, where it stayed until 1957, when it was finally delivered to Rome.\n\nIt was announced by Cardinal Angelo Sodano on May 13, 2000, 83 years after the first apparition of the Lady to the children in the Cova da Iria, and 19 years after the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II that the Third Secret would finally be released. In his announcement, Cardinal Sodano implied that the secret was about the 20th century persecution of Christians that culminated in the failed Pope John Paul II assassination attempt on May 13, 1981, the 64th anniversary of the first apparition of the Lady at Fátima.\n\nThe text of the Third Secret, according to the Vatican, was published on June 26, 2000:\nAlong with the text of the secret, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, (the future Pope Benedict XVI), published a theological commentary in which he states: \"A careful reading of the text of the so-called third 'secret' of Fatima ... will probably prove disappointing or surprising after all the speculation it has stirred. No great mystery is revealed; nor is the future unveiled.\" After explaining the differences between public and private revelations, he cautions people not to see in the message a determined future event:\nHe then moves on to talk about the symbolic nature of the images, noting: \"The concluding part of the 'secret' uses images which Lucia may have seen in devotional books and which draw their inspiration from long-standing intuitions of faith.\" As for the meaning of the message: \"What remains was already evident when we began our reflections on the text of the 'secret': the exhortation to prayer as the path of 'salvation for souls' and, likewise, the summons to penance and conversion.\"\n\nDespite this statement, on May 11 2010, during the flight to Fatima, answering to a question about the Third Secret, pope Benedict XVI told that \"we would be mistaken to think that Fatima's prophetic message has been completely realized\". Then, he expressed the hope the centenary of the apparitions of 1917 may hasten the fulfillment of the \"prophecy of the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, for the glory of the Blessed Trinity\", specifying that\nthe suffering inside the Church \"\"would have originated not from external enemies, but from within the same Church\".\"\n\nPrior to the 1930s the main focus of devotion to Our Lady of Fatima (which was at that time not widely known outside Portugal and Spain) was on the need to pray the rosary for an end to World War I and for world peace. After the publication of Sister Lucia's memoirs, starting in 1935, Fatima came to be seen as presenting the victory of the Blessed Virgin over Communism.\n\nIn 1960 the Vatican issued a press release stating that it was \"most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal.\" This announcement produced considerable speculation over the content of the secret. According to the \"New York Times\", speculation ranged from \"worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.\" On 2 May 1981, Laurence James Downey hijacked an airplane and demanded that Pope John Paul II make public the Third Secret of Fatima.\n\nThe release of the text sparked criticism from the Catholic Church in Portugal. Clergy as well as laypeople were offended that the text had been read in Rome and not at the Fátima shrine in Portugal where the reported events took place. \"The Times\" for June 29, 2000 reported that \"The revelation on Monday that there were no doomsday predictions has provoked angry reactions from the Portuguese church over the decision to keep the prophecy secret for half a century.\"\n\nCritics such as Italian journalist and media personality Antonio Socci claim that the four-page, handwritten text of the Third Secret released by the Vatican in 2000 is not the real secret, or at least not the full secret. The argument is based on the following:\n\n\nAccording to one source, when Lúcia was asked about the Third Secret, she said it was \"in the Gospels and in the Apocalypse\", and at one point she had even specified Apocalypse chapters 8 to 13, a range that includes the Book of Revelation 12:4, the chapter and verse cited by Pope John Paul II in his homily in Fátima on May 13, 2000.\n\nThe Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the Third Secret was published in June 2000. A report from the Zenit \"Daily Dispatch\" dated December 20, 2001 based on a Vatican press release, reported that Lúcia told then-Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, in an interview conducted the previous month, that the secret has been completely revealed and published, and that no secrets remain. Bertone, along with Cardinal Ratzinger, co-authored \"The Message of Fatima\", the document published in June 2000 by the Vatican that contains a scanned copy of the original text of the Third Secret. \n\nBertone, who was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2003 and held the position of Vatican Secretary of State until September 2013, wrote a book in 2007 titled, \"The Last Secret of Fatima\". The book contains a transcribed interview between journalist Giuseppe De Carli and Bertone in which Bertone responds to various criticisms and accusations regarding the content and disclosure of the Third Secret. At one point in the interview, De Carli comments on an unsourced accusation that the Vatican is concealing a one-page text of the Third Secret which predicts a great apostasy where Rome will \"lose the faith and become the throne of the Antichrist.\" Bertone responds as follows:\n\nAt another point in the interview, De Carli mentions that Cardinal Ottaviani had once stated that the Third Secret was written on a single sheet of paper. He also mentions that one of Lúcia's memoirs contains the words, \"In Portugal, the dogma of the faith will always be preserved etc\", words which some believe introduce the real Third Secret. Describing these observations as \"feeble bits of evidence that neither prove nor disprove anything\", De Carli asks Cardinal Bertone about the possibility of there being two texts, where the \"first document\" contains the words of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the other contains the description of the vision published by the Vatican. Bertone answers in part, \"There is no first document. There never was any such text in the archives of the Holy Office.\" Bertone also says, \"So I'm not sure what Cardinal Ottaviani was talking about.\" Bertone also states that, \"We have the word, better, the official confirmation of Sister Lúcia: 'Is this the Third Secret, and is this the only text of it?' 'Yes, this is the Third Secret, and I never wrote any other'.\"\n\nLater on in the interview, Bertone again addresses the question as to whether a text exists with words attributed to the Blessed Virgin that was censored: \"The part of the text where the Virgin speaks in the first person wasn't censored, for the simple reason that it never existed. ...I'm basing my statement on Sister Lucia's own direct confirmation that the Third Secret is none other than the text that was published in the year 2000.\"\n\nIn early September 2007, archbishop Loris Francesco Capovilla, private secretary to Pope John XXIII, who witnessed Pope John open the envelope of the third secret, said there was no truth in the rumor that the Vatican was suppressing a vision of the end of the world. \"There are not two truths from Fatima and nor is there any fourth secret. The text which I read in 1959 is the same that was distributed by the Vatican.\" Capovilla is also quoted as saying, \"I have had enough of these conspiracy theories. It just isn't true. I read it, I presented it to the Pope and we resealed the envelope.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2007 writers Antonio Socci and Solideo Paolini, who have competing books on Fatima, attempted to crash a reception at the Pontifical Urbanianum University where Bertone was to introduce his book \"The Last Fatima Visionary: My Meetings with Sister Lucia\". They stated that they wished to participate in the question and answer part of the reception. When told that the cardinal would not be taking questions, they then tried to confront Bertone, who is the Vatican Secretary of State. Security guards hustled them. In talking to reporters afterwards, Socci and Paolini produced a tape recording in which they claimed Archbishop Loris Francesco Capovilla, revealed that there were two texts of the Third Secret, although Capovilla had stated otherwise less than two weeks before.\n\nThe Catholic Counter-Reformation group, founded by theologian , takes the position that the released text is the complete Third Secret, but refers to Pope John Paul I rather than John Paul II, pointing out that the latter, after all, did not die when he was attacked, while the bishop in the Third Secret did. John Paul I had met Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter to a colleague after his election, he vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia which Lúcia said Mary had asked for.\n\nMichael Cuneo notes, \"Secret messages, apocalyptic countdowns, cloak-and-dagger intrigue within the highest echelons of the Vatican: not even Hollywood could ask for better material than this\".\n\n\"To understand and appreciate Fatima is to understand and appreciate Portuguese Catholicism\". Jeffrey S. Bennett takes note of how, starting in the 1930s, the image of Our Lady of Fatima developed into a rallying point for anti-communism, an idea that spread far beyond the Iberian peninsula. Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon are more important than its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fatima demonstrates not only how seriously Catholics took \"the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how difficult it is for the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation. Following Fatima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at Necedah.\n\n"}

It contrasts with invincible ignorance, which a person is either entirely incapable of removing, or could only do so by supererogatory efforts (\"i.e.\", efforts above and beyond normal duty). An example of vincible ignorance would be a person who is unsure about certain Catholic teachings, but refrains from seeking an explanation of those teachings.\n\nWhile invincible ignorance eliminates culpability, vincible ignorance at most mitigates it, and may even aggravate guilt. The guilt of an action performed in vincible ignorance ought to be measured by the degree of diligence or negligence shown in performing the act. If some insufficient diligence was shown in dispelling ignorance, it is termed \"merely\" vincible; it may diminish culpability to the point of rendering a sin venial. When little or no effort is made to remove ignorance, the ignorance is termed \"crass\" or \"supine\"; it removes little or no guilt. Deliberately fostered ignorance is \"affected\" or \"studied\"; it can increase guilt.\n\nIgnorance ought to be distinguished from mere nescience. Ignorance is a lack of knowledge that a person has a duty or obligation to know, whereas nescience refers to a lack of knowledge about things one is not bound to know. Thus vincible and invincible ignorance only can be applied to matters that a person has a duty to know about. For example, if a doctor did not know the name of a certain artery in the body, he would be ignorant of that information, but the rest of the population who has no duty to know that information would be nescient of it.\n\nIgnorance may be \n\n\n"}
