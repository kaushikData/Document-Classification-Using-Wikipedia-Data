It is located to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, which contains the grave of Muhammad. It is also known as Baqīʿ al-Gharqad (, meaning \"Baqiʿ of the Boxthorn\").\n\nThe grounds hold much significance for Muslims, being the resting place of many of Muhammad's relatives and companions. Many traditions relate Muhammad issuing a prayer every time he passed it. A Jewish graveyard was once located behind Jannat al-Baqi. The Umayyad rulers took down the wall of the Jewish cemetery and widened the Muslim graveyard to enclose the tomb of Caliph Uthman ibn Affan within it.\n\nWhen Muhammad arrived at Medina from Mecca in September 622 CE, al-Baqi' was a land covered with \"Lycium shawii\" boxthorn trees. According to historical records, after the arrival of Muhammad, the houses of Medina developed near Baqi', which was therefore considered as the public tomb. Also Baqi' was introduced as somewhere which its east side is Nakhl and its west side there are houses. In fact, before demolition Baqi was located behind the houses in the city.\n\nDuring the construction of the Prophet's Mosque, on the site he purchased from two orphan children when he arrived after his migration from Mecca to Medina, Asa'ad Bin Zararah, one of Muhammad's companions died. Muhammad chose the spot to be a cemetery and Asa'ad was the first individual to be buried in al-Baqi among the Ansar.\n\nWhile Muhammad was outside Medina for the Battle of Badr, his daughter Ruqayyah fell sick and died in 624. She was buried in al-Baqi \n\nShortly after Muhammad arrived from Badr, Uthman bin Maz'oon died and was buried in al-Baqi. He was considered the first companion of Muhammad from the Muhajirun to be buried in the cemetery.\n\nEarlier, Caliph Uthman ibn Affan was buried in the huge neighbouring Jewish grave yard. The first enlargement of al-Baqi in history was made by Muawiyah I, the first Umayyad Caliph. In order to honour Uthman ibn Affan, Muawiyah included the huge Jewish graveyard into al-Baqi cemetery. The Umayyad Caliphate built the first dome in al-Baqi over his grave. During different times of history, many domes and structures were built or rebuilt over many famous graves in al-Baqi.\n\nThe cemetery was demolished by forces loyal to the Wahhabi-Saudi alliance in 1806 and 1925 (or 1926).\n\nAt the beginning of the Wahhabis of Najd's nineteenth century (1806) control over Mecca and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi, in accordance with their doctrine. These were razed to the ground and plundered for their decorations and goods.\n\nThe clan of Saud regained control of the Hijaz in 1924 or 1925. The following year King Ibn Saud granted permission to destroy the site with religious authorization provided by Qadi Abd Allah ibn Bulayhid, and the demolition began on 21 April 1926 (or 1925) by \"Ikhwan\" (\"The Brothers\"), a Wahabbi religious militia. The demolition included destroying \"even the simplest of the gravestones\". British convert Eldon Rutter compared the demolition to an earthquake: \"All over the cemetery nothing was to be seen but little indefinite mounds of earth and stones, pieces of timber, iron bars, blocks of stone, and a broken rubble of cement and bricks, strewn about.\"\n\nThe second demolition was discussed in \"Majles-e Shora-ye Melli\" (The National Consultative Assembly of Iran) and a group of representatives was sent to Hijaz to investigate. In recent years, efforts were made by Iranian religious scholars and political figures to restore the cemetery and its shrines. Both Sunni and Shia protested against the destruction and rallies are held annually. The day is regarded as \"Yaum-e Gham\" (\"Day of Sorrow\"). Prominent Sunni theologians and intellectuals have condemned the \"unfit\" situation of the Baqi cemetery but the Saudi authorities have so far ignored all criticism and rejected any requests for restoration of the tombs and mausoleums.\nThough nowadays the situation of the Baqi is better than the time of demolition but there was acrimony in the memories of the Muslims who visited there in the past.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22154187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22154187", "title": "Buddhism and the body", "text": "Buddhism and the body\n\nIn contrast with many Indian religious traditions, Buddhism does not regard the body and the mind or spirit as being two entirely separate entities - there is no sense in Buddhism that the body is a \"vessel\" that is guided or inhabited by the mind or spirit. Rather, the body and mind combine and interact in a complex way to constitute an individual. Buddhist attitudes towards the body itself are complex, combining the distaste for sensual pleasure that characterizes the general Buddhist view towards desire with a recognition of both the individuals dependence on the body, and the utility of the body as an aide in the development of insight. Issues of gender, the mortification of the body, and the body as a source of troublesome desire are all addressed within the Buddhist scriptural tradition directly, while Buddhist attitudes towards other, more contemporary issues have continued to develop and change in response to the social and material changes in modern society.\n\nThe Buddhist tradition regards the body and the mind as being mutually dependent. The body or physical form (called \"rupa\") is considered as one of the five \"skandha\", the five interdependent components that constitute an individual. The Buddha taught that there is no separate, permanent, or unchanging self, and that a human being is an impermanent composite of interdependent physical, emotional and cognitive components. Identifying either the body or the mind as the self is dismissed as a mistaken view by the Buddha; in the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta, it is clearly stated that none of the five \"skandha\" should be regarded as the self.\n\nTraditional sources often emphasize the attitude that the body should be subordinate to the mind; scriptures depict the Buddha instructing followers to look beyond physical discomfort and leave their minds undisturbed.\n\nThough perhaps less concerned with issues of purity and pollution than the Brahmanist tradition, certain views of the body recorded in Buddhist scriptures do depict the body as unwholesome and potentially an object of disgust. This is the “unwantedness” of a body in the tradition of Buddhism identified by some scholars. Reflecting on the loathsomeness of the body is considered to be a particularly powerful method for countering attachment to sensual pleasures, such as sexuality or pride in appearance. Stories recorded in scriptures and in the biographies of Buddhist teachers particularly focus on the contemplation of the foulness of the female body as a remedy for sexual desire in a male religious practitioner.\n\nIn contrast to views of the body as disgusting or a source of unworthy desire, the Buddhist tradition does speak of the value of the body in the context of the preciousness of human birth, and the value of a healthy body as an aid to pursuing the Buddhist path. While contemplating the repulsiveness of the body is considered to be a powerful remedy for sensual attachment, this is a therapeutic perspective that is not necessarily intended to be carried over into other areas of life. In particular, the suitability of the human body for the pursuit of religious practice is praised in traditional sources, comparing favorably with the capacities of birth among the gods or the various chthonic realms.\n\nScriptures and meditation text depict a number of meditation methods that focus particularly on the body.\nThe passage of the breath through the body is particularly common. Entire sutras are devoted to contemplating breathing. Other meditations, used to counter attachment to sensuality, contemplate the frailty of the body - sickness, old age and death - to develop a sense of disgust with it. Analytic meditations - which break down the body into either its anatomical components or in terms of traditional elements - are intended to develop in the practitioner a knowledge of anatman, the Buddhist principle that no permanent enduring self exists within the individual.\n\n\"the engine for sex exemplifies ignorant craving quintessentially,”. Furthermore, “Sexual desire traps us; it renders us slaves to pleasure, slaves to our partners, slaves to the body itself. And it never brings satisfaction; rather, sex causes conflict, burns the mind, and brings us into bad company.” Sex can be seen as a primary reason of continuing samsara, after all, it did bring us into our discontented existence. Nonetheless, sex is not forbidden and Buddhists are aware that laymen and women will still have sex, so “A symbiotic relationship between the monastic order and lay adherents has characterized Buddhism from the beginning, with a dual sexual ethical track: Buddhism has traditionally held celibate monasticism in the highest regard, but it has also seen marriage and family life as highly suitable for those who cannot commit themselves to celibacy, and as an arena in which many worthwhile qualities are nurtured.”. For the laypeople, some guidelines regarding normal, ethical sexual behavior can be found. For example, sex should only be between married couples, it should not be done on religious holidays or within the area of sacred shrines, and there are some examples of sexual misconduct, like oral and anal sex\n\nThere are a number of issues relating to the body that, though given little attention in traditional Buddhist sources, have assumed significant importance in the modern world. Contemporary Buddhist views on these issues vary greatly between different cultures and individuals, and may combine the reinterpretation of traditional views with a variety of other influences.\n\nBuddhist scriptures talk a great deal about the general idea of attachment to sensual pleasures, but do not directly address the issue of substance addiction as it is understood in contemporary society. Jataka stories and certain rules governing lay and monastic behavior do discuss the use of alcohol and intoxicants.\n\nThe issue of suicide can be difficult to address since the Buddha never stated what he thought about this topic. In Buddhism, suicide can be seen as an immoral act or it can be justified under certain circumstances. \"The topic of suicide has been chosen not only for its intrinsic factual and historical interest but because it spotlights certain key issues in the field of Buddhist ethics and doctrine\". This raises a lot of questions whether suicide is right or wrong in Buddhism or if the Buddha believed that suicide can be condoned. Some Buddhists may say that only the Enlightened can commit suicide. “(suicide) can be either right or wrong depending on the state of mind of the person who suicides: the presence of desire (or fear) makes it wrong, and the absence of desire (or fear) makes it right”. The story of Channa is one of the strongest stories, which question whether suicide can be justified.\n\n“Channa was an unenlightened person (puthujjana) who, afflicted by the pain and distress of a serious illness, took his own life. This story however, raises a lot of questions whether the Buddha condoned suicide.” “Channa was not an arhat until the point of death those who suggests that suicide is wrong for a non- arhat would have to accept that Channa was wrong to commit the act”. It is said that there are some Buddhists who commit suicide and then become enlightened when they are about to kill themselves. The only person that can commit suicide is a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva might risk life and limb for the good of others.\n\nTo seek one's death or to make death one’s aim (even when the motive is compassionate, directed toward reducing suffering) is to negate in the most fundamental way the values and final goal of Buddhism by destroying what the traditional sources call the “precious human life” we have the rare good fortune to obtain. It is also said that a person who commits suicide will simply be reborn with the additional bad karma of the suicide to contend with.\n"}
{"id": "29673754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29673754", "title": "Cave of Achbinico", "text": "Cave of Achbinico\n\nCueva de Achbinico, also called cave of San Blas () is a Roman Catholic church and cave located in Candelaria, Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain).\n\nAfter the conquest of the Canary Islands it was the first Christian sanctuary of religious significance. It was also the first sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the Canary Islands, where the Virgin of Candelaria, the patron saint of the Canary islands, was worshipped.\n\nThe cave is located on the coast, just behind the basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria.\nIt is elongated and deep, with a ceiling shaped as a dome. It is 14 meters long by 6 meters wide and 5 meters high. A small chapel was built just outside of it, covering and including within its walls the entrance of the cave.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Inside the cave is a bronze replica of the Virgin of Candelaria. Her statue is most venerated on the island, and has turned the cave into the most important pilgrimage centre in the Canaries for the past 5 centuries. It is still visited by pilgrims, who commonly take and leave flushed candles and do requests to the Virgin.\n\nThe Achbinico cave has a great importance, not only religious but also historic and prehistoric.\nThe cave long served as a Christian worship place. When the statue of the Virgin of Candelaria was found on Güimar's beach of Chimisay at the end of the 14th century, the island had not yet been conquered by the Kingdom of Castile and its native inhabitants were the Guanches. The statue's finders brought it to Acaymo, the Guanche king (or \"mencey\"), at his cave-palace of Chinguaro. The statue was translated to the Achbinico cave in 1446, the ceremony accompanied with popular celebrations.\n\nIn one of the walls of the cave there is a picture explaining the story of the translation of the Virgin. In the lower part of it is a text that says:\n\nGuanches were baptized in the cave. The original baptismal font used to this effect is preserved in the basilica's camarín.\n\nIn 1497, Tenerife conqueror Alonso Fernandez de Lugo held in this cave the first celebration of Candlemas, at the same time as the Festivity of the Purification of the Virgin.\n\nIn 1526, on February 2 (Candlemas), the Virgin was translated from the cave to its new chapel. The current basilica of Candelaria, the primary Marian shrine of the Canary Islands, was built later in 1959. It sits over the remains of a small church that had burned down a few hundred meters away from the cave.\n\nKing Philip III was declared protector of the Virgin of Candelaria. After ascending the throne, the Spanish monarch gave the title of \"Royal\" to this sanctuary - the first sanctuary in the Canary Islands to have received that title.\n\nIn this cave there is also a statue of saint Blas, whose original statue was placed there in 1530 and substituted much later with the present one from sculptor Fernando Estévez. Thus the cave remains honoured by the statue of a saint and maintains its tradition of worship in February: on February 2 there is a religious ceremony in honour of the Virgin of Candelaria and on February 3 the worship is dedicated to saint Blas, with the statue carried out in procession around the plaza de la Patrona de Canarias. This is why the Achbinico cave is also called Saint Blas' cave, with both names in use.\n\nVarious archaeological excavations have proved that the cave was a place of worship long before the Guanches placed the statue of the Virgin in it. According to recent excavations, the layers of ashes found there and subjected to carbon-14 dating indicate an age of more than 3000 years. In this cave a permanent fire had been maintained, such as in the vestal temples of Antique Rome. This sacred character held from very ancient times would explain that after the conquest the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands placed the Virgin precisely in this cave and nowhere else.\n\n"}

K. Rowling.\n\nBorn and raised in London, Radcliffe made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One's 1999 television film \"David Copperfield\", followed by his cinematic debut in 2001's \"The Tailor of Panama\". At age 11, he was cast as Potter in the series' first film \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", and starred in the series for 10 years, starring in the lead role in all eight films culminating with the final film in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\", released in 2011. Radcliffe became one of the highest paid actors in the world during the filming of the Potter films, earned worldwide fame, popularity, and critical acclaim for his role, and received many accolades for his performance in the series.\n\nFollowing the success of Harry Potter, his recent notable films and roles include lawyer Arthur Kipps in the Edwardian horror film \"The Woman in Black\" (2012), famed beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the independent film \"Kill Your Darlings\" (2013), Victor Frankenstein's assistant Igor in the science fiction fantasy \"Victor Frankenstein\" (2015), Manny, a sentient corpse in the comedy-drama \"Swiss Army Man\", technological prodigy Walter Mabry in the heist thriller film \"Now You See Me 2,\" and FBI agent Nate Foster in the critically acclaimed thriller \"Imperium\" (all 2016). Radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in 2007, starring in the London and New York productions of \"Equus\" for which he received immense praise from critics and audiences alike, and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\".\n\nHe has contributed to many charities, including the Demelza Hospice Care for Children, and The Trevor Project for suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth, which gave him its Hero Award in 2011, and is heavily involved in LGBTQ activism.\n\nRadcliffe was born in Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith, London, England. He is the only child of Marcia Jeannine Gresham (née Jacobson) and Alan George Radcliffe. His mother is Jewish and was born in South Africa and raised in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. His father was raised in Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland, in a \"very working-class\" Protestant family. Radcliffe's maternal ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Poland and Russia. Radcliffe's parents had both acted as children. His father is a literary agent. His mother is a casting agent and was involved in several films for the BBC, including \"The Inspector Lynley Mysteries\" and \"Walk Away and I Stumble\".\n\nRadcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five, and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel \"David Copperfield\", portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first \"Harry Potter\" film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to \"have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter\" rather than jealousy.\n\nAs his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work \"really difficult.\" He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. \"The paparazzi, they'd love it,\" he told \"Details\" magazine in 2007. \"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\"\n\nIn 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the movie's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\", after he saw a video of the young actor in \"David Copperfield\". Eight months later, and after several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling also endorsed the selection saying, \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-movie contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that.\n\nThe release of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (released as \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" in the United States) took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was \"not that important\" to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: \"Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing,\" wrote Bob Graham of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\".\nA year later Radcliffe starred in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", the second installment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by \"New York Times\" journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing \"Harry Potter\" film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie's creative success.\n\nThe future of the franchise was put into question when Radcliffe and his co-leads Emma Watson and Rupert Grint hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes; however, by March 2007, Radcliffe had signed for the final films, which put an end to weeks of press \"speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in \"Equus\"\", in which he had performed nude on stage. Radcliffe reprised his role for the fourth time in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2007). Radcliffe stated that director David Yates and actress Imelda Staunton made \"Order of the Phoenix\" the \"most fun\" film in the series to work on. His performance earned several award nominations, and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for \"Best Male Performance.\" As his fame and the series continued, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson left imprints of their hands, feet, and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. In July 2009 \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" was released, the series' sixth instalment. Radcliffe received nominations for \"Best Male Performance\" and \"Global Superstar\" at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards.\nFor financial and scripting reasons the last book was divided into two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010.\n\nThe final film, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsPart 2\", was released in July 2011. Radcliffe, along with the film, was critically acclaimed: Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" asked, \"Who could have predicted that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson would turn out to be good actors?\"; similarly, Rex Reed said: \"Frankly, I’m sorry to see [Radcliffe] go\"; while \"Rolling Stone\" critic Peter Travers commented on Radcliffe: \"Well played, sir.\" Roger Ebert gave the film a highly positive review, but felt that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson were \"upstaged by the supporting [actors].\"\n\nRadcliffe admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character, but also said he is \"proud to be associated with this film series forever.\" Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more \"Harry Potter\" films. After Rowling hinted about writing an eighth book, Radcliffe was asked if he would do another film to which he replied: \"[It is] very doubtful. I think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character.\" Despite devoting so much time to the series, Radcliffe has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors: \"I’ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter.\"\n\nRadcliffe made his film debut in \"The Tailor of Panama\", an American 2001 film based on John le Carré's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2002, he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of \"The Play What I Wrote\", directed by Kenneth Branaghwho also appeared with him in the second \"Harry Potter\" film. In 2007, he appeared in the film \"December Boys\", an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007. Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in \"My Boy Jack\", a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle. Radcliffe stated, \"For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was.\"\n\nAt age 17, in a bid to show people he was prepared for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play \"Equus\", which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7 million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. \"Equus\" opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote that he \"displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward.\" He added: \"I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion.\" The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.\n\nAfter voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series \"The Simpsons\" in late 2010, Radcliffe debuted as J. Pierrepont Finch in the 2011 Broadway revival \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", a role previously performed by Robert Morse and Matthew Broderick. Other cast members included John Larroquette, Rose Hemingway and Mary Faber. Both the actor and production received favourable reviews, with \"USA Today\" commenting: \"Radcliffe ultimately succeeds not by overshadowing his fellow cast members, but by working in conscientious harmony with themand having a blast in the process.\" Radcliffe's performance in the show earned him Drama Desk Award, Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations. The production itself later received nine Tony Award nominations. Radcliffe left the show on 1 January 2012.\n\nHis first post-\"Harry Potter\" project was the 2012 horror film \"The Woman in Black\", adapted from the 1983 novel by Susan Hill. The film was released on 3 February 2012 in the United States and Canada, and was released on 10 February in the UK. Radcliffe portrays a man sent to deal with the legal matters of a mysterious woman who has just died, and soon after he begins to experience strange events and hauntings from the ghost of a woman dressed in black. He has said he was \"incredibly excited\" to be part of the film and described the script as \"beautifully written\".\n\nIn 2013, he portrayed American poet Allen Ginsberg in the thriller drama \"Kill Your Darlings\", directed by John Krokidas. He also starred in an Irish-Canadian romantic comedy film \"The F Word\" directed by Michael Dowseand written by Elan Mastai, based on TJ Dawe and Michael Rinaldi's play \"Toothpaste and Cigars\" and then he starred in an American dark fantasy horror film directed by Alexandre Aja \"Horns\". Both of the films premiered at the 38th Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nRadcliffe also performed at the Noël Coward Theatre in the stage play revival of Martin McDonagh's dark comedy \"The Cripple of Inishmaan\" as the lead, Billy Claven, for which he won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Actor in a Play. In 2015, Radcliffe starred as Igor in a science fiction horror film \"Victor Frankenstein\" directed by Paul McGuigan and written by Max Landis, which was based on contemporary adaptations of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \"Frankenstein.\" He also starred as Sam House, one of the founder of Rockstar Games, in the biographical drama film \"The Gamechangers\".\n\nIn 2016, Radcliffe portrayed Manny, a talkative corpse, in the indie film \"Swiss Army Man\". That same year, he also starred as Walter Mabry in the action adventure film \"Now You See Me 2\", playing a technological prodigy who resents magic. He also starred off-Broadway at The Public Theater in a documentary theatre piece called \"Privacy\", playing the role of The Writer. He starred in the 2016 release \"Imperium\" playing Nate Foster, an idealistic FBI agent who goes undercover to take down a radical white supremacy group.\n\nIn 2017, he starred as Yossi Ghinsberg, based on an internationally bestselling memoir of the same name by Yossi Ghinsberg and directed by Greg Mclean, in the thriller \"Jungle\". In 2018, Radcliffe portrayed a pilot smuggling drugs across borders in the independent action-thriller \"Beast of Burden\" directed by Jesper Ganslandt.\n\nHe is set to star as American reporter Jake Adelstein in \"Tokyo Vice\". In November 2015, he joined the ensemble cast of Shane Carruth's third film, \"The Modern Ocean\" alongside Anne Hathaway, Keanu Reeves, Tom Holland, Chloë Grace Moretz, Asa Butterfield, Jeff Goldblum and Abraham Attah.\n\nIn 2008, Radcliffe revealed that he has a mild form of the neurological disorder developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia). The motor skill disorder sometimes prevents him from doing simple activities, such as writing or tying his own shoelaces. \"I was having a hard time at school, in terms of being crap at everything, with no discernible talent,\" Radcliffe commented. In August 2010, he stopped drinking alcohol after finding himself becoming too reliant on it.\n\nIn November 2007, Radcliffe published several poems under the pen name Jacob Gershona combination of his middle name and the Jewish version of his mother's maiden name Greshamin \"Rubbish\", an underground fashion magazine. He has a close friendship with his \"Harry Potter\" co-stars Tom Felton and Emma Watson, and is close to his family, whom he credits for keeping him grounded.\n\nSources disagree about Radcliffe's personal wealth; he was reported to have earned £1 million for the first \"Harry Potter\" film and around £15 million for the sixth. Radcliffe appeared on the \"Sunday Times\" Rich List in 2006, which estimated his personal fortune to be £14 million, making him one of the richest young people in the UK. In March 2009 he was ranked number one on the \"Forbes\" \"Most Valuable Young Stars\" list, and by April \"The Daily Telegraph\" measured his net worth at £30m, making him the 12th richest young person in the UK. Radcliffe was considered to be the richest teenager in England later that year. In February 2010, he was named the sixth highest paid Hollywood male star and placed at number five on \"Forbes\"s December list of Hollywood's highest-grossing actors with a film revenue of US$780 million, mainly due to \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" being released that year.\n\nRadcliffe maintains a home in the West Village of Lower Manhattan in New York City. , Radcliffe has been dating American Erin Darke, whom he met on the set of \"Kill Your Darlings,\" since 2013. There were rumours and stories of a possible engagement in mid-2014, but Darke's father, Ian Darke, denied there were any such plans in December 2014.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Radcliffe stated: \"There was never [religious] faith in the house. I think of myself as being Jewish and Irish, despite the fact that I'm English.\" He has stated: \"We were Christmas tree Jews\", and that he is \"very proud of being Jewish\".\n\nIn 2012, Radcliffe was quoted as saying: \"I'm an atheist, and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation\", though in a 2009 interview, he stated, \"I'm very relaxed about [being an atheist]. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do. Anything he does on television, I will watch\".\n\nRadcliffe is a supporter of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told \"The Big Issue\": \"...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited. It is great.\"\n\nHe is a supporter of a British republic.\n\nOn 13 April 2006, his portrait, drawn by Stuart Pearson Wright, was unveiled as part of a new exhibition opening at the Royal National Theatre; it was then moved to the National Portrait Gallery. \n\nSpeaking out against homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service announcements in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on \"Equus\" on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. \"I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it,\" he said in a 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.\n\nRadcliffe has supported various charities. He designed the Cu-Bed for Habitat's VIP Kids range (a cube made of eight smaller ones which can be made into a bed, chaise-longue or chair) with all the royalties from the sale of the bed going directly to his favourite charity, Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent. Radcliffe has urged his fans to make donations, in lieu of Christmas presents to him, to the charity's Candle for Care programme. In 2008 he was among several celebrities who donated their old glasses to an exhibit honouring victims of the Holocaust. During the Broadway run of \"Equus\" he auctioned off a pair of jeans and other items worn in the show, for New-York-based Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and was a presenter at the 2011 Gypsy of the Year competition. He has also donated money to Get Connected UK, a London-based free confidential national helpline for troubled youth.\n\n\n"}

He was the head of the Stoic school in Athens, and he was one of three philosophers sent to Rome in 155 BC. He wrote many works, but none of his writings survive, except as quotations by later writers.\n\nBorn in Seleucia on the Tigris in Babylonia, Diogenes was educated at Athens under the auspices of Chrysippus and succeeded Zeno of Tarsus as head (\"scholarch\") of the Stoic school there in the 2nd century BC. Among his pupils were Panaetius and Antipater of Tarsus who succeeded him as scholarch. He seems to have closely followed the views of Chrysippus, especially on dialectic, in which he is said to have instructed Carneades.\n\nTogether with Carneades and Critolaus, he was sent to Rome to appeal a fine of hundred talents imposed on Athens in 155 BC for the sack of Oropus. They delivered their epideictic speeches first in numerous private assemblies, then in the Senate. Diogenes pleased his audience chiefly by his sober and temperate mode of speaking.\n\nCicero speaks of him as deceased by 150 BC, and since Lucian claims that he died at the age of 80, he must have been born around 230 BC. There is some evidence, however, that he may have lived to around 140 BC.\n\nCicero calls Diogenes \"a great and important Stoic\". In the works of the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus found in carbonized papyrus rolls recovered from the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, Diogenes is discussed more frequently than any philosopher besides Epicurus himself.\n\nHe was the author of several works, of which, however, little more than the titles is known: \n\nIn addition, it appears from Philodemus that he wrote extensive works \"On Music\" and \"On Rhetoric\". Some aspects of his views on these two subjects are recoverable from the critical remarks to be found in Philodemus' works on these two subjects.

{"id": "9034599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9034599", "title": "Elder (Christianity)", "text": "Elder (Christianity)\n\nAn elder in Christianity is a person who is valued for wisdom and holds a position of responsibility and authority in a Christian group. In some Christian traditions (e.g., Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Methodism) an \"elder\" is an ordained person who usually serves a local church or churches and who has been ordained to a ministry of word, sacrament and order, filling the preaching and pastoral offices. In other Christian traditions (e.g., Presbyterianism, Baptists, Plymouth Brethren), an elder may be a lay person charged with serving as an administrator in a local, or be ordained to such an office, also serving in the preaching (in this case referring to teaching done during church gatherings) or pastoral roles. There is technically a distinction between the idea of ordained elders and lay elders, often the two concepts are conflated in everyday conversation (for example, a lay elder in the Baptist tradition may still be referred to as being \"clergy\", especially in America). Particularly in reference to age and experience, elders exist throughout world cultures, and the Christian sense of elder is partially related to this.\n\nElders are mentioned in a number of New Testament passages. Individuals such as James had a significant role in the Jerusalem church and the Council of Jerusalem. In reference to churches in Antioch, Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe, Paul appoints elders as a key step in organizing a new church and instructs Titus to appoint others. Paul spoke directly to the elders in Acts and warned them to \"be on guard for themselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made them overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.\"\n\nThe Christian office of \"elder\" is drawn from the word's various uses in the Bible. In many instances, particularly in the Old Testament, it has reference to the older men in a tribe, usually entrusted with the governmental affairs, whose counsel was frequently sought because of their age and experience. This was not necessarily a priesthood calling, although the Aaronic Priesthood is listed as having ordained elders. In the Septuagint, the word for Old Testament elders is πρεσβύτερος (presbuteros), as used in the New Testament for both Christian and Jewish leaders. Various traditions in Christianity translate the underlying term differently depending on their particular doctrinal or practical view of the role. In the Moravian Church, an elder is referred to as a Helper.\n\nIn addition to \"presbuteros\", there are two other words used in the New Testament to describe various aspects of this position of leadership: 'overseer' and 'shepherd': Peter draws the three concepts together in one passage: \"Therefore, I exhort the \"elders\" among you... \"shepherd\" the flock of God among you, \"exercising oversight\".\" \n\n\"Presbuteros\" (πρεσβύτερος, ) is the most commonly used term for elder in the New Testament, stemming from \"presbus\", elderly. It is used with regard to the twelve apostles, the seventy disciples or others acting in a specific role of authority in a local assembly of Christians. It is used twenty-eight times in the Gospels and Acts of the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin and twelve times in Revelation of the representatives of the redeemed people of God. The remaining nineteen times the word is employed in Acts and the Epistles, it identifies the leaders in the local churches of the New Testament. While no specific age is given, the connotation of seniority and experience in this term emphasizes the nature of the position and the character of the person, implying maturity, dignity, experience and honor.\n\nThe modern English words \"priest\" or \"presbyter\" are derived etymologically from \"presbyteros\".\n\nThe New Testament meaning is taken by some scholars as the Latin word \"Legate\" which describes the ancient classical function as a herald who represents the highest state office and might be a governor of a province.\n\n\"Episkopos\" (ἐπίσκοπος, ) was a common word in the Greek culture for any official who acted as a superintendent, manager, overseer, controller, curator, guardian or ruler. It occurs only five times in the New Testament, once referring to Christ and the other four times to church leaders. The Authorised Version translates the word as \"bishop\", emphasizing the function of an elder as exercising authority and supervision \"by divine placement, initiative and design.\" The overseer can sometimes be viewed as a lead elder or as just one of a plurality of elders.\n\n\"Poimen\" (ποιμήν, ) means shepherd, also translated as pastor. It is applied only once in the noun form and three times in the verb form in the New Testament in the context of church leaders. The term emphasizes the elder as one who tends, feeds, guides, protects and cares for his flock.\n\nThe New Testament offers more instruction regarding elders than on many other important church subjects such as the Lord's Supper, the Lord's Day, baptism or spiritual gifts, and their duties are laid out in several places. In the majority of the references, the word for elders is plural and word for church is singular, suggesting that the pattern in the early church was for a plurality of elders in each local church. \nThese were to be shepherds to their flock, setting an example - just like shepherds, they were to feed their flock, to work hard among them and to reprove where necessary and to care for the spiritual and physical needs of church members. Elders are considered rulers over their flocks and their judgement to be submitted to, not so that they can be \"lords over God's heritage,\" but because they are to give account to God for the spiritual character of their church.\n\nElders must to be able to teach and preach sound doctrine and rebuke those who are teaching error, so that false teaching doesn't creep into the church. To this end, they are also to train and appoint others. Above all, the elder is to serve with humility, remembering that their position is a picture of Christ as the chief shepherd.\n\nThere are two key passages dealing with the qualifications of elders in the New Testament, and . The qualifications given by the Apostle Paul are as follows:\n\nWhere elders are addressed in the writings of Paul and Peter, there is no inference of a monarchical episcopacy or single leaders in any of the New Testament-era churches, and \"presbuteros\" and \"episkopos\" are used interchangeably. This was still the case later in the century: the writings of the Apostolic Fathers (such as 1 Clement and the Didache) continue to assert the apostolic authority of the bishops/presbyters as rulers of the church making no distinction between the two terms. The epistle does imply a degree of authority residing in the Bishop of Rome. Writing c.199, Tertullian claimed that Clement was ordained by Peter himself as bishop of Rome, and although tradition identifies him as the fourth pope (after Linus and Anacletus) the order is much disputed. According to the Liber Pontificalis, Linus and Anacletus were ordained with responsibility for the church at Rome and Clement for the church as a whole\n\nAnother of the Apostolic Fathers, Ignatius of Antioch, records that many churches had single bishops by the beginning of the second century, although the church at Rome was not one of them. This became the norm by the middle of the century. Ignatius distinguished the relationship between bishop, presbyters and diaconate typologically and in doing so referred to the practice of a single bishop in a church, separated from the body of presbyters and deacons:\n\n\"In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a church.\" — Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians 3:1.\n\nChurch governance is generally organised in one of three main types:\n\nHistorically, Baptist churches do not recognize elder as a separate office from those of pastor or deacon; it is commonly considered a synonym of deacon or pastor. This is not universal in Baptist circles, however, and there are many Baptist churches which are elder-led. The Southern Baptist Convention does not prescribe an elder-led pattern, although a number of churches in this convention, and other Baptist branches (including Reformed Baptists) are governed by a group of elders. The functional term 'presbytery' has been utilized among Southern Baptists to denote their ordination council.\n\nChristadelphians do not appoint any form of clergy. Organisation is based on ecclesially accountable committees for evangelism, youth and Sunday School work, military service issues, care of the elderly and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority and are wholly dependent upon support from within the church. Women are typically not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the ecclesia when male believers are present, and do not sit on the main committees, however they do participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees.\n\nCongregations referring to themselves as Churches of Christ believe that local congregations should be led by a plurality of biblically qualified elders. They base this on a conviction that congregations (and Christians in general) should attempt to follow the teachings of the New Testament wherever humanly possible. In accordance with the teachings of the bible the Churches of Christ teach and practice that only males may serve as elders (female elders are not recognized), and must meet Biblical qualifications (generally I Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9 are the Biblical texts used to determine if a male is qualified to serve as elder).\n\nIn this regard, elders are accountable to each other and to God. The evangelist and the elders have the spiritual oversight of the congregation (e.g., withdrawing fellowship from a member who the elders consider to be wayward in doctrine or refuses to abide by the elders' counsel or decision in a matter) as well as administrative oversight (e.g., overseeing the congregation budget).\n\nThe elders will be assisted by deacons who, depending on the congregation, may have a specific area of non-spiritual service (e.g., finance, building and grounds, benevolence); the deacons are in all matters subservient to the elders. An elder may also be qualified to serve as a deacon (and, in some cases, may have previously served as a deacon before becoming an elder).\n\nDepending on the congregation, the elders may rotate main preaching and teaching duties or appoint one or more male persons (who may or may not be elders) to serve as the ministers for that congregation. If one person is assigned main preaching duties, he is never referred to as \"Father\" (based on Matthew 23:9, which states that the only Father a Christian has is in Heaven), nor is the individual referred to as \"pastor\" (due to belief that the one reference to \"pastor\" in Ephesians 4:11 is translated \"shepherd\" in all other cases, and in context either refers to Jesus Christ or to an elder; as stated above the person with main preaching duties may or may not be an elder) or \"reverend\" (due to belief that the one reference to this term in Psalm 111:9 refers to the reverence of God's name). Instead, common terms used are \"evangelist\", \"preacher\", \"minister\" (or \"pulpit minister\"; the latter may be used if the congregation has assistant or associate ministers over certain programs or functions), or \"preaching elder\" (if the person is also an elder).\n\n\"Elders\" are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have the Melchizedek Priesthood and have been ordained to the office of elder. Additionally, male missionaries of the Church, General Authorities and Area Authority Seventies are honorarily titled \"Elder\" unless they are instead referred to by the title of \"President.\"\n\nThe detailed duties of the ordained elders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today have been defined in the book of Doctrine and Covenants.\nElder is the proper title given to all holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Thus an apostle is an elder in this sense, and it is proper to speak of members of the Quorum of the Twelve or the First Quorum of the Seventy by this title..\n\nGovernance in the Church of Scotland is based on presbyterian polity. There are several roles in the ministry including ministers of Word and Sacrament, chaplains, deacons and readers. Elders are another role, which is voluntary and un-salaried elders. They are ordained for life by the minister and Kirk Session of a parish, and carry out pastoral and local church government duties under the guidance of the minister. All elders are members of the Kirk session, and may train to chair the session, conduct funerals, preach and lead worship.\n\nCongregational churches are generally run by committee rule, and elders are one office which is appointed by the committee. The governance of each church is arranged with a system of checks and balances so that undue power is never given to one office or individual.\n\nAmong Jehovah's Witnesses, an elder is a man appointed to teach the congregation. He is also called an \"overseer\" or \"servant\". Elders within each congregation work within a \"body of elders\", several of whom are assigned to oversee specific congregational tasks. Each body of elders has a Coordinator (previously known as the Presiding Overseer), a Secretary, and a Service Overseer. Witnesses consider the office of elder to be the same as that referred to in the Bible as \"older man\" (\"presbyter\"), overseer (\"bishop\"), and shepherd (\"pastor\") but do not use any of the terms as titles.\n\nRepresentatives of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses select elders to be appointed as circuit overseers, (also referred to as traveling overseers). Each circuit overseer visits the congregations in his jurisdiction twice each year. During his visit, local elders recommend members who may qualify for appointment as elders or ministerial servants (equivalent to deacons), and appointments are decided by the circuit overseer. Congregation elders do not receive monetary compensation; traveling overseers receive a modest stipend.\n\nAn Elder in the Lutheran Church is a position of lay-service, concerned with the temporal and administrative affair of the congregation. In many congregations, elders are also charged with oversight of the pastor but exercising only that oversight given to every Christian in the congregation. They are also assigned to assist the pastor in the sacraments (the Eucharist and Baptism). In the Eucharist, the Elder may assist in the distribution. In Baptism, the Elder may hold the water or assist the pastor in other ways. Generally, an elder is not permitted to consecrate the bread and wine in the Eucharist, or perform Holy Absolution, as these acts are usually reserved for the pastor. An Elder helps brothers at each congregation.\n\nHowever, many within the confessional wing of Lutheranism, see the term \"elder\" being used in such a way an unfortunate effect of Reformed (and broader Protestant) influence on the Lutheran Church. Elder (or Presbyteros, in the Greek) serving as a synonym for \"Pastor\" or \"Priest\", not unlike how Lutheran teaching also recognizes \"episkopos\" (Greek, meaning overseer), or bishop to be yet another synonym. Historic Lutheranism recognized a single office of Word and Sacrament being established directly by Christ (technically two, counting the uniquely Lutheran vocation of laity); all distinctions within nomenclature and structural ranking were purely \"jure humano\" (of human make). Thus making a distinction between \"pastor\" and \"elder\" would seem pointless, and using the term \"lay elder\" would be oxymoronic.\n\nAn \"Elder\" - sometimes called a \"Presbyter\" - is someone who has been ordained by a bishop to the ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order, and Service. Their responsibilities are to preach and teach, preside at the celebration of the sacraments, administer the church through pastoral guidance, and lead the congregations under their care in service ministry to the world. The office of \"Elder\", then, is what most people tend to think of as the pastoral, priestly, clergy office within the church. Indeed, even a Methodist Bishop is still an Elder who has been elected and consecrated by the laying on of hands to the office of Bishop (Bishop being understood as an \"office\" within the Presbyterate, not an \"order\" or separate level of ordination). In some of the denominations within Methodism, ordination to the office of \"Elder\" is open to both women and men, while in others, such as the Primitive Methodist Church and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, it is only opened to men.\n\nOne of the key distinctions of Plymouth Brethren churches is the total rejection of the concept of clergy. In keeping with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers, they view all Christians as being ordained by God to serve and therefore ministers. Leaders are chosen according to the qualifications found in and , and appointed by the Holy Spirit. Plymouth Brethren churches tend to have multiple elders based on the plural use of the word in reference to New Testament churches.\n\nOne branch of the Plymouth Brethren, the Exclusive Brethren, are so named for their practice of serving the Lord's Supper exclusively to those who are part of their own particular group, agreeing with them on various doctrinal positions. Most Exclusive Brethren groups believe the church to have been in ruins between the death of the apostles and their own time. Since no truly apostolic authority exists to appoint elders the church has none. Instead they recognize \"leading brothers\" who demonstrate maturity and leadership ability.\n\nAlthough practices in the Presbyterian Church vary internationally, typically the church recognises three offices within church polity: the minister (alternately \"teaching elder\" or \"pastor\"), a bench of ruling elders, and deacons. The elders are \"ordained lay\" people and form the session, which is a ruling council for their congregation.\n\nMembers of the Rastafari Movement often refer to their experienced members as elders, such as Joseph Hibbert, Vernon Carrington, Leonard Howell, and Mortimer Planno.\n\nMembers of the Catholic Church still use the Greek word Presbyter (πρεσβύτερος, presbuteros: \"elder\", or \"priest\" in Christian usage) to refer to priests (priest is etymologically derived from the Greek presbyteros via the Latin presbyter). Collectively, however, their \"college\" is referred to as the \"presbyterium\" (meaning \"council of elders\"), \"presbytery\", or \"presbyterate.\"\n\nThe presbyterium is most visible during the ordination of new priests and bishops and the Mass of the Chrism (the Holy Thursday Mass) where the blessing of the oils used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick, and Holy Orders takes place. They are also visible during other special liturgical functions such as the wake and burial of their bishop.\n\nIn each local church, the Pastor works with a \"local elder\", who is appointed by the local congregation and ordained by the pastor. The elder is considered a religious leader in the local church and is able to conduct such as baptism. In some cases more than one elder is appointed, with one designated the \"head elder\". The elder is largely responsible for running the church and allocating responsibilities therein. Whereas \"pastor\" is often used as a title, \"elder\" is not. The local elder's authority is limited to the church in which he serves, whereas pastors have wider authority.\n\n\"Elder\" is also used as a title used to denote ordained clergy. Those who are unordained clergy are often and universally addressed as \"pastor\". If one is ordained and remains in the local church, they are often titled interchangeably as 'Pastor or Elder'. Once ordained clergy leave the local church and begin their service within the Adventist Church's organizational leadership, e.g. Conference/Union/Division/General Conference offices as departmental directors, etc., they are universally addressed as \"Elder\", as in the case of the current (World Church) President of the General Conference, \"Elder Ted Wilson\".\n\nAmong the Shakers, noted for their acceptance of females in leading roles, Elders and Eldresses were leaders in specific areas. Two Elders and Eldresses headed the central Shaker ministry at the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society and dealt with both spiritual and temporal matters. Other pairs of elders and eldresses headed groups of Shaker communities, while others were spiritual leaders of smaller groups within the communities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "938626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938626", "title": "Everson v. Board of Education", "text": "Everson v. Board of Education\n\nEverson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court which applied the Establishment Clause in the country's Bill of Rights to State law. Prior to this decision, the First Amendment's words, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" imposed limits only on the federal government, while many states continued to grant certain religious denominations legislative or effective privileges. This was the first Supreme Court case incorporating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as binding upon the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision in \"Everson\" marked a turning point in the interpretation and application of disestablishment law in the modern era.\n\nThe case was brought by a New Jersey taxpayer against a tax-funded school district that provided reimbursement to parents of both public and private schooled people taking the public transportation system to school. The taxpayer contended reimbursement given for children attending private religious schools violated the constitutional prohibition against state support of religion, and the use of taxpayer funds to do so violated the Due Process Clause. The Justices were split over the question whether the New Jersey policy constituted support of religion, with the majority concluding these reimbursements were \"separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function\" that they did not violate the constitution. Both affirming and dissenting Justices, however, were decisive that the Constitution required a sharp separation between government and religion and their strongly worded opinions paved the way to a series of later court decisions that taken together brought about profound changes in legislation, public education, and other policies involving matters of religion. Both Justice Hugo Black's majority opinion and Justice Wiley Rutledge's dissent defined the First Amendment religious clause in terms of a \"wall of separation between church and state\".\n\nAfter repealing a former ban, a New Jersey law authorized payment by local school boards of the costs of transportation to and from schools – including private schools. Of the private schools that benefited from this policy, 96% were parochial Catholic schools. Arch R. Everson, a taxpayer in Ewing Township, filed a lawsuit alleging that this indirect aid to religion through the mechanism of reimbursing parents and students for costs incurred as a result of attending religious schools violated both the New Jersey state constitution and the First Amendment. After a loss in the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, then the state's highest court, Everson appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on purely federal constitutional grounds.\n\nThe 5-4 decision was handed down on February 10, 1947, and was based upon the writing of James Madison (\"Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments\") and Thomas Jefferson (Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom). The Court, through Justice Hugo Black, ruled that the state bill was constitutionally permissible because the reimbursements were offered to all students regardless of religion and because the payments were made to parents and not any religious institution. Perhaps as important as the actual outcome, though, was the interpretation given by the entire Court to the Establishment Clause. It reflected a broad interpretation of the Clause that was to guide the Court's decisions for decades to come. Black's language was sweeping:\n\nThe 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between Church and State.' 330 U.S. 1, 15-16.\n\nJustice Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Frankfurter. Justice Rutledge wrote another dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justices Frankfurter, Jackson and Burton. The four dissenters agreed with Justice Black's definition of the Establishment Clause, but protested that the principles he laid down ought logically to lead to the invalidation of the challenged law.\n\nIn his written dissent, Justice Wiley Rutledge argued that:\n\nThe funds used here were raised by taxation. The Court does not dispute nor could it that their use does in fact give aid and encouragement to religious instruction. It only concludes that this aid is not 'support' in law. But Madison and Jefferson were concerned with aid and support in fact not as a legal conclusion 'entangled in precedents.' Here parents pay money to send their children to parochial schools and funds raised by taxation are used to reimburse them. This not only helps the children to get to school and the parents to send them. It aids them in a substantial way to get the very thing which they are sent to the particular school to secure, namely, religious training and teaching. 330 U.S. 1, 45.\n\nIn its first hundred years, the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution's Bill of Rights as a limit on federal government and considered the states bound only by those rights granted to its citizens by their own state constitutions. Because the federal laws during this period were remote influences at most on the personal affairs of its citizens, minimal attention was paid by the Court to how those provisions in the federal Bill of Rights were to be interpreted.\n\nFollowing the passage of the Thirteenth to Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution at the end of the Civil War, the Supreme Court would hear hundreds of cases involving conflicts over the constitutionality of laws passed by the states. The decisions in these cases were often criticized as resulting more from the biases of the individual Justices than the applicable rule of law or constitutional duty to protect individual rights. But, by the 1930s, the Court began consistently reasoning that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed citizens First Amendment protections from even state and local governments, a process known as incorporation.\n\nThe 1940 decision in \"Cantwell v. Connecticut\" was the first Supreme Court decision to apply the First Amendment's religious protections to the states, that case focusing on the so-called Free Exercise Clause. The decision \"Everson\" followed in 1947, the first incorporating the Establishment Clause. Numerous state cases followed disentangling the church from public schools, most notably the 1951 New Mexico case of \"Zellers v. Huff\".\n\nSimilar First Amendment cases have flooded the courts in the decades following \"Everson\". Having invoked Thomas Jefferson's metaphor of the wall of separation in the \"Everson\" decision, the lawmakers and courts have struggled how to balance governments' dual duty to satisfy both the nonestablishment clause and the free exercise clause contained in the language of the amendment. The majority and dissenting Justices in \"Everson\" split over this very question, with Rutledge in the minority by insisting that the Constitution forbids \"every form of public aid or support for religion\".\n\n\n\n"}

They even demanded the Yevsektsiya to be dissolved into the Kombund. This seems however to have been a mere agreement on paper that was never implemented, a manoeuver by the Communists to attract support from Bundists as the Bund was more powerful than them in the Belarusian cities.\n\nIn 1921, at its Thirteenth Conference of the still \"General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia\", i.e. then in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, a majority of the Bundist delegates decided to dissolve the party, and part of its membership joined the R.C.P.(B.) on the basis of the rules of admission, while the minority formed the Social Democratic Bund.\n\nIn West Belarus, that was part of interwar Poland, the remnants of the party finally merged into the Polish Bund, while many activists chose to join the Polish Communist Party.\n"}

Most of these traders came from Gujarat, Deccan (now Maharashtra) and Tamil Chola empire. Archaeological evidence of small Hindu settlements have been found in Zanzibar and parts of Swahili coast, Zimbabwe and Madagascar.\n\nPew Research Center estimates there were about 50,000 Hindus in Tanzania in 2010.\n\nA mention of ancient trade between Hindus of India and Africa is from the time of Nabonidus, when Babylon was one of the hubs of global trade. In ancient times, the Hindus would trade, never interfere in political system and return to India. Small settlements of Hindus began in 1st century AD, mostly on islands east of Africa, along its coast and in few cases inland. Ancient Indian texts refer to \"Wanyamwezi\", or \"the men of the moon\" - a term still in use to identify the Nyamwezi people in Tanzania. Every major explorer who visited eastern side of Africa has mentioned the presence of Hindu traders and merchants, in Zanzibar, Kilwa, Mombasa, Malindi and Mozambique. Vasco da Gama won over and convinced one such Africa-settled Gujarati Hindu to help pilot his maiden voyage from Africa to India. This affinity and regular trade was helped by steady trade winds that flow from east Africa to Indian peninsula for part of the year, while reverse and flow from Indian peninsula to east Africa for another part of the year.\n\nThe Hindus were known to be vegetarians and non-violent, never imposing their religion or culture in Africa. They prospered by offering a good trade, quality products and cash loans to the Zanzibar and other African community, but have traditionally kept their religion, social and cultural life as a private, personal matter. The first major change came to Tanzania with the arrival of Shia Islam (Ismaili), when Muslims and Omani Arabs began to compete with Indian Hindus, and when Muslims began a campaign of conversion. The second major change came with in 16th century with the arrival of colonial empires and Christianity.\n\nDuring the colonial era, after European officials, Hindus were the most economically successful ethnic group in Tanzania, but they remained politically and legally insecure as a minority. When British colonial era ended, Indian Hindus became a targeted, persecuted group and many emigrated from Tanzania to Europe and India.\n\nOne of the highest active volcanoes and mountain near Arusha, Tanzania is named Mount Meru after the eponymous mountain in Hindu mythology.\n\nHinduism is a minority religion in Tanzania, practiced by some 30,000 people (1996) in the mainland and Zanzibar combined. Most practitioners are of Indo-Tanzanian (particularly Gujarati) ancestry.\n\nThere were about 50,000 Hindus in Tanzania in 2010, according to Pew Research Center estimates.\n\nAmong the various traditions within Hinduism, Swaminarayan from Gujarat is an active bhakti school of Hinduism in Tanzania and Kenya. It was well established by 1950, because of its social, cultural and temple building initiatives in East Africa. Hindu temples have been established in Dar-es-Salaam, most of them located at the City Centre, the street name where the Hindu temples are located has been renamed to Pramukh Swami street. Swaminarayan temples have also been built in cities other than Dar-es-Salaam, such as Zanzibar, Arusha and Moshi. Other Hindu schools with presence in Tanzania include Yoga and Vedanta.\n\nFollowers of Brahma Kumari, Satya Sai Baba and Hare Krishna also have a presence amongst the Hindus in Tanzania.\n\nDipawali and other Hindu festivals are observed by the Hindus of Tanzania.\n\nTanzania has Hindu temples in several cities and a Hindu council to help organize social and cultural activities.\n\n"}

The educational system was further enlarged and elaborated. Elementary schools for senior students and institutions for advanced students. The formal education of the children usually begins at the age of six when they were admitted to elementary schools. The elementary schools were generally attached to the mosques. At the elementary stage boys and girls read tighter. The curricula for the elementary schools included reading, writing, grammar, traditions and arithmetic. After completing education in the mosque school, a student could seek admission to an educational institution meant for senior students. The syllabus of studies at such institutions included theology, jurisprudence, lexicography, and literature. In the institutions for advanced studies the curricula included astronomy, geometry, philosophy, music, medicine, and other studies. The Abbasid Caliph, Al-Ma'mun, set up an academy known as Bait ul Hikma which served as an institution of higher learning. Under the Seljuks, Minister Nizam-al-Mulk set up a University at Baghdad known as Nizamiyah. It was residential institution and scholars like Imam Ghazali taught at this university. Later the Abbasid Caliph Mutansir set up another University at Bagdad known as the Mustansiriyah. Numerous colleges were set up in various parts of the country. Some of the colleges in Khurasan and Persia were: Sadiyya, Bahaqiyya, Astrabadiyya, and Isfaranayya. One of the carvings on the Portals of these universities was that the world supported by four things: learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the religious and the valour of the brave.\n\nAs an adjunct to the process of education, the Muslims set up libraries. There were libraries attached to all educational institution. The Nizamiah university had four lakh books. The library at Ray had for hundred camel loads of books.\nBukhara was one of the leading centres of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of Islamic culture were natives of the Central Asia who came to be known for their work during Abbasid rule in central Asia.\n\nFurthermore, scientists who were citizens of the Khilafah such as al-Khorezmi, Beruni, Farabi, Abu Ali ibn Sina brought fame to the area all over the world, generating respect across the world, and many scientific achievements of the period made a great impact on the European science. Al-Biruni (from Central Asia, 10th–11th centuries) is best known for his work of history, Chronology of Ancient Nations. He also wrote treatises on astronomy, geography, mathematics, and pharmacology.\n\nJabir Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) developed an early scientific method in his Book of Optics (1021). The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light.\n\nAlgebra was also pioneered by Persian Scientist Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī during this time in his landmark text, Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala, from which the term algebra is derived. He is thus considered to be the father of algebra. The terms algorism and algorithm are also derived from the name of al-Khwarizmi, who was responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals and Hindu-Arabic numeral system beyond the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nMedicine was advanced particularly during the Abbasids' reign in Central Asia. During the ninth century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries in the understanding of anatomy and diseases were made. The clinical distinction between measles and smallpox was discovered during this time in Central Asia. Famous Persian scientist Ibn Sina produced thesis and works that summarized the vast amount of knowledge that scientists had accumulated, and is often known as the father of modern medicine for his encyclopaedias, The Canan of Medicine and the Book of Healing. Some of his great works are: “Kitab Shifa al Nafs” (The book the healing of the soul); “Kitab al Najat al Nafs” (the book of the salvation of the soul); “Kitab al Isharat wal Tanbhihat” (The book of the hints and the Warnings).\n\nTowards the end of 9th century, in Samarkand Al-Maturidi, a contemporary of Al Ash’ari established a school of Rational Theology or Kalam, which sought to effect a compromise between orthodoxy and Mutazilism.\n\nIn the 10th Century Abu Nasr Muhammad Al Farabi produced a book Aara Ahl al Madinah al Fadila. (the Opinins of the Virtuous City), and Al Siyasat al Madaniyya (Political Regimes’) he produced the concept of “Virtuous City” and “First Chief”.\n\nImam al Ghazali produced his classical work Ihya Ulum ul Din towards the end of 11th century.\n\nAbul Barkat Al Baghdadi was an eminent philosopher of the twelfth century. His principal book is Kitab ul Mutahar (The Book of that which has been established by personal reflections). He held that the space is three-dimensional and infinite. He defined time as the measure of being. He held that there is no distinction between intellect and soul.\n\nDuring Middle Ages the Muslims were the most advanced people in the world. While in Europe even the kings could not read and write, in the Muslim countries even the common man could read and write. According to Imam Abu Hanifah, the eminent jurist, the purpose of education in Islam is the acquisition of Taqwa. Taqwa means the right conduct.\n\n“Education means the understanding of what makes or mars a soul, the acquisition of power and the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, between good and bad in regard to this and the next world, and the acquisition of the right and proper capacity to choose the right conduct to that the misguided intellect of man may not lead him astray.” Indeed, no purpose of education could be nobler than that.\n\n"}

It is made up of rectangular strip of cotton cloth that is used to cover the genitals with the help of the strings connected to the four ends of the cloth for binding it around the waist of the wearer. It is used by wrestlers in the game of \"kushti\" or traditional Indian wrestling in the \"akharada\" (wrestling ring) and during practice sessions and training.\n\nIt is used extensively by wrestlers (\"pehelwans\") in India participating in the traditional game of \"Pehlwani\" (a form of traditional wrestling). It is worn by wrestlers during matches, practice, training and exercises (\"kasrat\").\n\nThe kaupinam in India is the traditional male sports gear associated with almost every form of physically straining sports like kushti and \"kabaddi\". It has been worn by sportsmen and bodybuilders during training and exercise sessions (similar to the contemporary use of gym shorts) since ancient times and is still used in traditional sports. \"Langot\" was earlier worn (and is still worn sometimes) in India by men performing any form of physically straining activity. The wrestlers often wear a G-string-shaped guard underneath to protect their genitals.\n\nThe kaupinam is a very ancient form of sportswear and was in use since the early Vedic Period (2000–1500 BC) in India as is evident from a verse in the Sam Veda, the Hindu sacred scriptures, written at that time, encouraging the use of kaupinam during sexual intercourse. The devotees of Lord Shiva were said to be wearing kaupinam.\n\nIt has religious significance attached to asceticism for the Hindus. Bhagavata Purana enjoins that a true ascetic shouldn't wear anything other than a kaupina. Sometimes Lord Shiva himself is depicted wearing Kaupina. Even Lord Murugan of Palani and Hanuman are said to be wearing this garment. Langot or kaupin is associated with celibacy. Sri Shankaracharya composed a verse called \"Kaupina Panchakam\" to assert the significance of asceticism.

He co-founded the band with Jeff Hanneman in 1981 and has been a member ever since.\n\nKerry Ray King was born in Los Angeles, California. His father was an aircraft parts inspector, and his mother was an employee of a telephone company. King attended Warren High School in Downey, California, and started learning guitar at Calvano's Music in South Gate.\n\nIn school, King was a good student who excelled in math. However, his grades slowly declined after he \"discovered\" girls. He said it worked out in the end because he did not plan to go to college. King confesses that he is an experienced drinker, but he has never done drugs in his entire life.\n\nIn 1981, King was at a session trying out for the position of guitarist in a band. After the session was over Jeff Hanneman approached him and the two began playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs with the session's drummer. King and Hanneman subsequently decided to start their own band.\n\nKing's trademark personal appearance and extensive tattoos all over his arms and skin head. His tattoo was praised to such a degree by \"Blender Magazine\" that they once produced a tour of his body ink. King's abbreviation, KFK, was revealed to mean \"Kerry Fuckin' King\" in the January 2007 Issue of \"Guitar World\". King currently resides in Corona, California.\n\nIn addition to appearing on Slayer's albums, he has also made several guest appearances for other artists. While lending production to 1986's \"Reign in Blood\", Rick Rubin was also helping with the production of the Beastie Boys' debut album \"Licensed to Ill\". Rubin felt the track \"No Sleep till Brooklyn\" needed a guitar solo, so he called in King to lay down the part. King has since commented that his playing ability \"certainly wasn't that of a virtuoso\". The video for \"No Sleep till Brooklyn\", whose title was a spoof on Motörhead's 1981 live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\", was originally intended to feature King being knocked offstage by a gorilla, although King refused. King replied, \"If there's gonna be anyone knocking anyone offstage, it'll be me knocking the gorilla\", which was what subsequently happened. King has reminisced that he thought the Beastie Boys were cool, although he had never heard any of their music at the time.\n\nOn \"Licensed to Ill\", King also played the guitar solo on the song \"Fight For Your Right (To Party)\".\n\nKing contributed a lead guitar outro part to Pantera's song \"Goddamn Electric\", which appeared on the 2000 album, \"Reinventing the Steel\". King's rig was set up in Pantera's bathroom backstage just after Ozzfest in Dallas, as the group still did not have their own dressing room, on top of not appearing on the festival bill. After King had finished the first take, Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell ran in and yelled, \"Don't let him do it again!\" King tried again in the hope he would perform a superior rendition, but the first take was used. King has also made several guest appearances on Marilyn Manson's Rape of the World Tour, joining the band to play tracks such as \"Little Horn\", \"1996\" and \"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\". Many fans noticed elements of King's own style used on these occasions. On October 21, 2010, the final date of the Jägermeister Music Tour, King joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheater in Hollywood to perform \"Rattlehead\" which was the first time in 26 years that King had shared the stage with Megadeth (King had been a touring substitute for a few months in 1984).\n\nHe made a movie appearance in the 2009 movie \"Brooklyn's Finest\" as a member of SWAT team led by Ethan Hawke's character.\n\nKing's first experience with a guitar was when he was a child. Steve Huey of AllMusic has commented in his review for \"Reign in Blood\" that Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's demented soloing often mimics the screams of the songs' victims. He also described his and Jeff Hanneman's guitar solos as \"wildly chaotic\". Thom Jurek, also of AllMusic, described his work on 2006's \"Christ Illusion\" as creating \"an intensely harrowing and angular riff that changes from verse to verse, through the refrain and bridge, and comes back again.\"\n\nKing listed Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath as his favorite bands during his teen years. He said once \"Anybody who plays heavy music and doesn't cite Sabbath as an influence is lying, because that's where it all started.\" He cited Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing of Judas Priest as his biggest influences as a guitarist that inspire his style, tone, and gear. He mentioned Eddie Van Halen, Ted Nugent, Ronnie Montrose, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Randy Rhoads as other influences.\n\nKing has been twice divorced and has a daughter named Shyanne Kymberlee King with his first wife; his current wife is Ayesha King.\n\nKing is known to despise organized religion and expresses his views in his songwriting. In a 2006 interview with Blabbermouth.net, King expressed his anti-religious views: \"I don't really have a life philosophy; my thing is just rebelling against pretty much organized religion. That is my main thing, because personally I think it's a crutch for people that are too weak to get through life on their own. I'm the kind of guy that says if I don't see it, then it doesn't work. And nobody can show me God.\" When asked by \"Revolver Magazine\" what superpower would he want if he was a supervillain, King replied \"the ability to burst a church into flames by simply walking by it.\"\n\nKing is an avid snake collector who owns a reptile house and herpetology nursery called Psychotic Exotics.\n\nKing has stayed clear of politics, but stated in 2017 that he was \"embarrassed about Trump's presidency,\" which he described as \"divisive and polarizing\"\n\n\n"}

This page lists well-known individuals in history who are former Catholics.\n\nOne 2008 Pew Research Center study estimates that 10.1% of people in the United States describe themselves as former Catholics in some sense, in total the study reports that 44% of Americans profess a different religious affiliation than the one they were raised in. A majority converted to another religion while a substantial minority are counted as currently unaffiliated.\n\nNote: The list includes those who leave the Catholic Church including any Eastern Catholic Church which is in communion with it. People such as Eddie Doherty, who were allowed to transfer from the Latin Catholic Church to an Eastern Catholic church, or \"vice versa\" are not considered as \"former Roman Catholics\", while Eastern Catholics who convert to a non-Catholic church or another religion are considered as such, even though Eastern Catholics do not typically refer to themselves as \"Roman\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"gottgläubig\" movement was an officially sanctioned unorganised religion in Nazi Germany. Several prominent Nazi leaders started leaving their Catholic or Protestant churches over the course of 1936 as an act of political protest after a gradual worsening of relations with the churches, whom they accused of meddling in Germany's internal affairs.

According to a 2009 survey of the Pew Research Center Forum on Religion and Public Life, one in five American Catholics report that they at times attend places of worship other than the local Catholic parish (which does not have to mean non-Catholic places). The same survey noted that some Catholics incorporate \"yoga as a spiritual practice\", emphasize psychics, and draw on and involve themselves in other religious movements.\n\n\n\nThis section contains people who rejected Catholicism in favor of a non-religious philosophy, including atheism, agnosticism and secular humanism.\n\n\n"}

In contrast to Andrianerinerina, the word \"Andriamanitra\" (the Merina term for \"Fragrant Lord\") is used to refer to revered ancestors. Malagasy cultures were generally polytheistic, and worshiped a variety of entities that straddled the line between god and revered ancestor.\n\nAncestors are generally viewed as a benevolent force in the life of the living, but among some Malagasy it is believed that the spirits of ancestors may become \"angatra\" (ghosts of the dead) if they are ignored or abused. Angatra are believed to haunt their own graves and bring disease and misfortune to those living who offended them. A particular type of angatra is the \"kinoly\": beings which look like people but have red eyes and long fingernails and disembowel living people. Rituals such as the \"famadihana\"—rewrapping the bodies of the dead every 5–10 years in fresh \"lamba\" (handmade cloth)—are believed by some to prevent \"kinoly\" due to the traditional association of the lamba with \"hasina\", the mystical and sacred life force. Beliefs relating to the powers and activities of the ancestors vary greatly from community to community within Madagascar.\n\nThe declarations or actions of ancestors are often the source of \"fady\" (taboos) that shape the social life of Malagasy communities. Across Madagascar, lemurs are often revered and protected by fady. In all of the origin myths of the Indri (in Betsimisaraka dialect: Babakoto), there is some connection of the lemur with humanity, usually through common ancestry. There are numerous accounts of the origin of the Indri in particular, but all characterize lemurs as sacred, and not to be hunted or harmed.\n\nMalagasy mythology portrays a pygmy-like people called the \"Vazimba\" as the original inhabitants. Some Malagasy believe that these original inhabitants still live in the deepest recesses of the forest. In certain communities (and particularly in the Highlands), the practice of veneration of the dead can extend back to veneration of the Vazimba as the most ancient of ancestors. The kings of some Malagasy tribes claim a blood kinship to the Vazimba, including the Merina dynasty that eventually ruled over all of Madagascar. The Merina claim Vazimba ancestry through the royal line's founder, King Andriamanelo, whose mother, Queen Rafohy, was of the Vazimba.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19419819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19419819", "title": "Maya cave sites", "text": "Maya cave sites\n\nMaya cave sites are caves used by and associated with the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Certain beliefs and observances connected with cave sites are also maintained among some contemporary Maya communities. These cave sites are understood to have served religious purposes rather than utilitarian ones. Accordingly, archaeological artifacts found within caves can inform interpretations of religious ritual and cave studies combined with epigraphic, iconographic, and ethnographic studies can further inform Maya religion and society.\n\nMaya cave sites of great interest for the robbers and invaders during the war, so the entrances to some of them were walled up (James Brady as examples leads immured caves of Dos Pilas and Naj Tunich).\n\nThe total number of caves in the Puuc region in the Yucatan is estimated in more than 2000, most of which is not open (the most extensive to date inventory has about 300 caves). In compiled in the fight against idolatry Spanish chronicles 16th century mentioned 17 sites Maya caves and cenotes (of which found 9 caves). In the Relación de las cosas de Yucatán author Diego de Landa described Sacred Cenote. Underground Maya archeology was actively developing starting from the 1980s-1990s. Museo Nacional de Antropología leads two projects to study the Maya caves: \"Caves: Register of Prehispanic Cultures Evidence in Puuc Region\" with 1997 year and \"The cult of the cenotes in the center of the Yucatan\". In 2008, a Mayan underground complex consisting of eleven temples, the 100-meter stone roads and flooded labyrinth of caves, was found on the Yucatan Peninsula. The most famous caves are the Maya: Balankanche, Loltun Cave, Actun Tunichil Muknal and Jolja'.\n\nAt the moment it is not known exactly what the sign represents a cave in the Maya writing. According to the hypothesis of James Brady cave means popular in the Mayan texts \"sign entry\" or \"impinged bone element\" (see figure). James Brady proposes to read this sign as CH'EN or CH'EEN. As proof of his hypothesis, James Brady cites three arguments: 1) use of the mark in the sentence denotes to a certain place in which you can enter, sit down or do a burial. 2) visual mark has common features with symbols of death, the underworld and bats. 3) phonetically the mark ends in a consonant \"N\". In Maya writing this sign is part of the verb \"OCH-WITZ\" (\"Go inside the Mountain\")\n\nA desire to be near the sacred has influenced Mesoamerican settlement. Mountains and caves were important elements in Mesoamerican creation myths. Mesoamerican belief systems liken water to fertility and mountains give flowing water and rainfall through caves. Accordingly, these natural features were considered sacred and were sought out by Mesoamerican migrants looking for a new home. A cave could be considered an \"axis mundi\" if it marked the center of a village (Brady and Ashmore 1999: 127). The Late Postclassic site of Mayapan incorporated several \"cenotes\" into its ceremonial groups and the Cenote Ch’en Mul is at the site core. At Dos Pilas house platforms were often in front of cave entries and the tunnel went beneath the platform.\n\nArtificial landscapes often mimicked sacred landscapes. Doorways of temples were seen as the cave entrances to mountains. Sometimes these doorways were \"witz\" monster mouths. The same was true for the Aztecs, who at Utatlán designed an artificial cave that ends under the central plaza and is designed according to the mythical seven-chamber cave of emergence, Chicomoztoc (this is also seen at Teotihuacan, though somewhat different). and at Muklebal Tzul it appears that an artificial well underneath a massive platform was made to appear like a water-bearing cave. In the Yucatán many Late Postclassic temples had Spanish churches built on top of them after the conquest and so caves and \"cenotes\" can still be found near these places today.\n\nCaves are often described as entries into the watery Maya underworld. For Mesoamerican groups, including the Maya, life and death occur at liminal zones between this world and the otherworld. Caves then are both associated with life and death; when something emerges from the underworld, that something lives, and when something descends into the underworld, that something dies. Caves are seen as birthplaces where humans and group ancestors were born (and live) and the Maya of the Yucatán even thought that the sun and moon were born out of the underworld.\n\nThere appears to be a strong association (and perhaps conflation) between caves and sweatbaths. Caves are often perceived as female and are likened to the womb and vagina. Hence they are a symbol of fertility. Like caves, sweatbaths have also been associated with human fertility and both have strong sexual connotations. Examples of these sexual connotations include the painting of a couple engaged in intercourse at the cave site of Naj Tunich, the contemporary Tzotzil Maya belief that a hypersexual being lives in a cave, and the fact that sweatbaths have been places of illicit sex amongst many Maya groups. Artifacts found at a sweatbath on the periphery of Piedras Negras included a circular mirror and five marine shells, artifacts that have been associated with the watery underworld and the latter of which has been found in the artificial caves underneath the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan.\n\nSpeleothems in caves have also been regarded as sacred and have played a role in Maya religion. Caves are considered to be \"living beings with personhood and souls\". and according to a 41-year-old Q’eqchi’ Maya their speleothems \"are also alive, they grow and sweat water; they themselves are water\". People may take these rocks from the caves and put them on their altars. The Xibun Maya incorporated speleothems into the construction of the ball court at the Hershey site. Ball courts have been associated with the underworld just as caves have been.\n\nCaves are linked with wind, rain, and clouds. The Zinacantecos of the Chiapas highlands even believe that lightning comes from caves. The Yukatek and Lacandon believe that caves and \"cenotes\" are where rain deities reside and the Yukatek of the sixteenth century sacrificed humans to appease these deities.\n\nAt Dos Pilas the Cueva de Murciélagos rests beneath the royal palace platform. After it rains heavily water rushes out from this cave signaling the beginning of the rainy season and the advance of the crop cycle. This artificial landscape showed that the king had control over water, rainmaking, and fertility, thereby legitimizing his authority.\n\nCaves in art have also been used to legitimize authority and elevate status. Individuals in the mouth of a cave for example are endowed with authority that is often associated with shamanism. Scribal imagery is often associated with a skeletal jaw (maws are often likened to the mouths of caves), which may indicate that caves are where his craft originated. Perhaps this imagery \"served to mystify and exalt the scribe's role.\"\n\nCaves are often associated with transformation. One artifact in the Cenote X-Coton is a human stone figure that is making an offering and wearing a (possible) jaguar skin with the human's face coming out of its mouth. It appears that in addition to water and sacrifice rituals the \"cenote\" may have been used for \"way\" transformations.\n\nHuman sacrifice to gods connected to caves was widespread. The sacrifice either occurred in the cave or the body was put there afterwards. Children were commonly sacrificed in the Yucatán and child sacrifice was recorded in Highland Guatemala as well.\n\nArchaeologists have found caves that have been sealed such as the Cueva de El Duende. It is possible that the desecration of caves could have been used as a symbol of conquest and political legitimacy. Another explanation could relate to termination rituals that have often been seen in architectural construction.\n\nAgricultural products are common offerings in caves. Modern Maya believe that maize originated beneath the earth, an idea perhaps expressed by Classic depictions of the Maize God emerging from the underworld. This belief gives caves life-giving power as accounts from the Popul Vuh indicate that humans were made from maize dough. Domesticated plants found in lowland caves were probably used in rituals performed for deities related to agricultural fertility. Use of agricultural products in agricultural rituals continues amongst the contemporary Maya.\n\nJade is a frequent cave offering. The largest amount of jade found at one site is at the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza. Metal was a common offering during the Postclassic, the largest collections coming from the Cenote of Sacrifice and \"bell\" caves in western Honduras. It is possible that the notion of the Earth Lord having lots of wealth in his cave may have come from this tradition.\n\nMayans believed, that the cave home of ancestral spirits, why do in they burial people. It appears that elite cave burial was rare, but it is possible that common people may have used caves as burial places for their dead such as at the Caves Branch Rock Shelter in Belize. Two tomb structures have been discovered in caves to date. One at the site of Naj Tunich and the other at Quen Santo, both in Guatemala. Lineage founders have also been buried in caves. Elites were able to build their own elaborate burial \"caves\" and by doing so reinforced their power and status. It seems elites tried to make their tombs look like natural caves. Stalactites found at Tomb 2 of Nim Li Punit provide an example of this.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Emphasizing its \"twin pillars\" of academic excellence and a clear moral framework, \"NCA\" satisfies the Ministry of Education (Ontario) standards, leading to the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). The Institute was named after Nancy Campbell (1905-1980), an accomplished pianist, artist, actress and dancer, who lived as a \"world citizen\" motivated by her belief in the Bahá'í Faith. Campbell worked to promote the ideal of the oneness of humanity, and was a dynamic speaker who travelled throughout the world giving lectures on peace and world unity.

Other programs include Independent Tutorial and accredited English as a Second Language as needed.\n\nThe Moral Framework used by the institute was adapted from the Moral Framework developed at Universidad Nur. It is harmonized with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For example, two of the moral capabilities include:\n\nFormal qualities of student life at NCA include a \"student family\", proactive counseling programme, and group spiritual observances. \"Student families\" are annualized groupings of students of different ages, races, nationalities, religions, talents and abilities who are carefully grouped in a way such that strengths and weaknesses are balanced out by all the members. The families and their faculty sponsors work together to plan and participate in service projects, hold social and family unity activities and consult together on school-related issues. In the counseling programme students learn how to resolve conflicts through effective communication making decisions that are compatible with spiritual and personal values. Effort is also made to educate students about the effects of drug and alcohol addictions, safe dating practices, and goal setting. The spiritual life at NCA is shared by staff and students which observe religious and cultural celebrations from around the world. Service projects are actively formulated with a strong international, but also local, outlook. Students have participated in community service projects in the following countries:\n\nUntil 2013, the campus was situated in the heart of London, Ontario/Canada, at the edge of the Thames River. The campus, with its historical buildings built in the 1870s, had been beautifully restored after NCA bought out the former Weldon Park Academy which closed in 2003.

{"id": "213340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213340", "title": "Pentacle", "text": "Pentacle\n\nA pentacle (also spelled and pronounced as \"pantacle\" in Thelema, following Aleister Crowley, though that spelling ultimately derived from Eliphas Levi) is a talisman that is used in magical evocation, and is usually made of parchment, paper, or metal (although it can be of other materials), upon which a magical design is drawn. Protective symbols may also be included (sometimes on the reverse), a common one being the six-point form of the Seal of Solomon. Pentacles may be pieces of parchment or cloth that are sewn to the chest of one's garment, or they may be flat objects that hang down from one's neck in front of one's torso, or they may be flat objects that are placed flat upon the ground or upon an altar. Pentacles are almost always shaped as disks or flat circles.\n\nMany varieties of pentacle can be found in the grimoire called the Key of Solomon. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a pentacle is placed within the triangle of evocation. Pentacles are also used in the neopagan magical religion called Wicca, alongside other magical tools. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Wicca, pentacles symbolize the classical element earth. In the 1909 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck (the pentacles of which were designed by Arthur Edward Waite), and subsequent tarot decks that are based upon it, and in Wicca, pentacles prominently incorporate a pentagram in their design. This form of pentacle is formed upon a disk which may be used either upon an altar or as a sacred space of its own.\n\nThe first documents to depict pentacles were the 1500s grimoires called The Heptameron and The Key of Solomon. In The Heptameron, there is only one pentacle, whereas in the Key of Solomon, there are dozens of different pentacles. The Heptameron's pentacle is a hexagram that is embellished by patee crosses and letters, whereas The Key of Solomon's pentacles have a very broad variety of designs, only two of which are pentagrammic. That contrasts with the later popular false definitions of pentacles from the 1900s, which state that pentacles are inherently pentagrammic.\n\nGerald Gardner, the creator of Wicca, got his concept of pentacles in large part from the 1909 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, in which the pentacles are disks that are covered with a pentagram. In Gardner's 1949 book High Magic's Aid, and in his 1954 book Witchcraft Today, Gardner defined a pentacle as a \"five-pointed star\", intending to mean a pentagram. In his 1959 book The Meaning of Witchcraft, Gardner defined a pentacle as a synonym of 'pentagram'. Major dictionaries have taken their definition of the word 'pentacle' from Gerald Gardner, being unaware of its historical inaccuracy. For example, the Online \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (2007 revision) states that the words \"pentacle\" and \"pentagram\" (a five-point unicursal star) are essentially synonymous.\n\nThere is a particular definition of 'pentacle' among many latter-day Wiccans: Namely, a \"pentacle\" refers to a \"pentagram\" circumscribed by a circle.\n\nThe word is first recorded in English usage in 1561, from earlier French use, in turn from post-classical Latin \"pentaculum\" (from \"penta-\" \"fivefold\" + \"-culum\" diminutive suffix). The French word had a meaning of \"talisman\", typically in the shape of a pentagram, but the word could also refer to talismans in the shape of a hexagram.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in earlier editions (2nd edition 1989) went on to say that \"some would connect it\" with the Middle French word \"pentacol\" (1328) or \"pendacol\" (1418), a jewel or ornament worn around the neck (from \"pend-\" hang, \"à\" to, \"col\" or \"cou\" neck). This is the derivation the Theosophical Society employ in their glossary:\n\n\"Pentacles\", despite the sound of the word, often had no connotation of \"five\" in the old magical texts, but were, rather, magical talismans inscribed with any symbol or character. When they incorporated star-shaped figures, these were more often hexagrams than pentagrams. Pentacles showing a great variety of shapes and images appear in the old magical grimoires, such as the Key of Solomon; as Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa summarises it, their use was to \"fore-know all future things, & command whole nature, have power over devils, and Angels, and do miracles.\" Agrippa attributes Moses' feats of magic in part to his knowledge of various pentacles.\n\nA \"Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy\" (c. 1565), which was falsely attributed to Agrippa, gives detailed instructions as to how pentacles should be formulated:\n\nFrancis Barrett, in his influential work \"The Magus\" of 1801 (Book 2, part 2), repeats these instructions almost verbatim.\n\nAnother common design employed in pentacles is a magic square, such as the Sator-Arepo-Tenet square.\n\nIn the Golden Dawn magical system, the Earth Pentacle is one of four elemental \"weapons\" or tools of an Adept. These weapons are \"symbolical representations of the forces employed for the manifestation of the inner self, the elements required for the incarnation of the divine.\"\n\nOther pentacles for the evocation of spirits are also employed in the Golden Dawn system; these are engraved with the name and sigil of the spirit to be invoked, inside three concentric circles, having painted on their reverse a circle and cross like a celtic cross.\n\nAccording to Aleister Crowley's instructions for the A∴A∴, the pentacle is a disc of wax, gold, silver-gilt or Electrum Magicum, eight inches diameter and half an inch thick; the Neophyte should \"by his understanding and ingenium devise a symbol to represent the Universe\", and engrave this on the disc.\n\nA pentacle is also employed as a magical tool within Wicca, generally to summon certain energies or summon spirits.\n\nIn many old grimoires dealing with magical evocation, the pentacle is described as being hung about the neck, providing protection and authority to the operator. Johannes Trithemius has the magician donning the pentacle just before casting the protective circle:\n\nOne version of the \"Key of Solomon\" mentions both a \"Great Pentacle\" which is drawn in a book, as well as a collection of other pentacles which are drawn in ink on separate pieces of parchment for use as amulets:\n\nThe pentacle is of central importance in the evocation of spirits. A fairly typical evocation involves a series of conjurations of increasing potency, each involving the display of the pentacle:\n\nOnce the spirit has appeared and been constrained, the pentacle is covered again, but is uncovered whenever demands are made of the spirit or when it is compelled to depart.\n\nIn the Golden Dawn system, the pentacles are not suspended from the neck, but wrapped in a cloth covering. Instead of wearing a pentacle, the magician wears fastened to their breast a lamen.\n\nIn the tarot, the Minor Arcana are divided into four suits (much like conventional playing cards), which are swords, batons or wands, cups, and coins. Following the innovation of Eliphas Levi, many English-language writers on tarot divination now call the coins \"pentacles\". The first published tarot deck to use an \"actual\" suit of pentacles was the 1909 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck. That deck inspired the creation of subsequent tarot decks which likewise have a suit of pentacles. In the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, Arthur Edward Waite designed the pentacles as golden disks with a pentagram on them. The Wiccan style of pentacle, which is a disk that is covered by a pentagram symbol, was based upon the pentacles from the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck.\n\nThe term \"pentacle\" is used in \"Tilings and Patterns\" by Grumbaum and Shepard to indicate a five-pointed star composed of ten line segments, similar to a pentagram but containing no interior lines.\n\n"}
{"id": "3920284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3920284", "title": "Prang (architecture)", "text": "Prang (architecture)\n\nA prang (; ) is a tall tower-like spire, usually richly carved. They were a common shrine element of Hindu and Buddhist architecture in the Khmer Empire. They were later adapted by Buddhist builders in Thailand, especially during the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1350–1767) and Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782-1932). In Thailand it appears only with the most important Buddhist temples.\n\nThe term \"prang\" is a compound of the Sanskrit terms \"pra-\" ('forward, in front') and \"aṅga\" (limb of the body), with the contacting vowels united by sandhi.\n\n\"Prang\" tower took form of a multi-tiered structure with receding size as it ascends. The receding size of almost identical roof structures of the stepped pyramidal tower, creates a perspective illusion as if the tower is taller than it actually is. The form of the tower is a reminiscent of Indic shikhara of Hindu temple, although slightly different in design. On each cardinal points, a \"prang\" usually has richly adorned tympanum and lintel above doorways or blind doors. The \"prang\" took plan of multi corners rectangular, which on top of each roof steps are adorned with antefixes, which mostly took theme of multi-headed Nāgas, Garuda or deities.\n\nOriginally the Khmer prang temples were for the worship of the Hindu gods, such as Shiva and Vishnu. The space within the prang tower, the cella, was relatively small for two reasons:\n\nThe Cella was entered via a small porch, usually aligned to the east, which was called the Mandapa. Over the cubic Cella rose the central tower, the bud-shaped Prang, modeled after the cosmic mountain Meru, crowned by a top stone in form of a lotus bud.\n\nThe Khmer prangs resembled north Indian temples' shikhara and rekha (temple towers) elements. The early 10th century and the late 12th century prangs in Thailand were influenced by the Khmer architects of the great temple complexes of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom.\n\nThe first prangs in Thailand were built in Phimai and Khao Phnom Rung and Lopburi between the early 10th century and the late 12th century, when the Khmer kingdom was dominant.\n\nAfter the Khmer Empire collapsed, the Thai building masters of the Sukhothai Kingdom adapted the Prang form. They extended and developed it. The building material was no more separate small sandstone blocks, instead the Thais built the Prang in brick or laterite covered with stucco. And the Cella could be reached only by stairs. An example for this is the Prang of the Wat Mahathat in Phitsanulok. Later developments of the Prang suggested the Cella only. The entrance door became a niche, in which was placed the \"Buddharupa\" (Buddha statue), which had originally taken the central position inside. For reasons of symmetry the niche was repeated on all four sides. On its pinnacle was a Trishul, the \"weapon of Indra\".\n\nA \"more modern\" Prang is a slim construction, like an ear of corn, which lets its Khmer origin be only suspected. The best example is Wat Arun, the landmark of Bangkok. Also Wat Phra Kaeo has six thin Prangs arranged in a row. Another example is the four Prangs arranged in all four directions around Wat Pho in Bangkok, and the five Prangs in Wat Pichayart in Thonburi.\n\n\n"}

They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith. It is not their role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but to help live more fully by it in a certain period of history. Guided by the Magisterium of the Church, the \"sensus fidelium\" knows how to discern and welcome in these revelations whatever constitutes an authentic call of Christ or his saints to the Church. Christian faith cannot accept \"revelations\" that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment.\n\nDivine revelation was fulfilled, completed, and perfected in Christ, the fullness and mediator, author and interpreter, purpose and center of public revelation. Hence, public revelation is the deposit of faith and rule of faith and must be lived by all Catholics. Saint Thomas Aquinas taught that all public revelation ended with the death of Saint John the Apostle. Private revelations cannot surpass, correct, improve, fulfill, complete, or perfect public revelation.\n\nDivine revelation, since it is contained in the Word of God and in Christ, also includes the living tradition or \"sensus fidelium\", the magisterium, the sacraments, and Catholic dogma.<ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p1.htm#767\">Catechism, 767</ref><ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c1a2.htm#1116\">Catechism, 1116</ref><ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#88\">Catechism, 88</ref> Because the living tradition and the magisterium are a part of divine revelation, they both have divine authority.<ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm#874\">Catechism, 874</ref> Because the sacraments are a part of divine revelation, their natures cannot be changed (for example, receiving Holy Communion without mortal sin) but their ways of celebration can be changed (for example, receiving Holy Communion in the hand or on the tongue).<ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html\">Redemptionis Sacramentum, 10</ref> Because Catholic dogma is a part of divine revelation, the saving truths of Christ are immutable.<ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20120106_nota-anno-fede_en.html\">Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith: \"The Council, according to Pope John XXIII, wanted 'to transmit doctrine, pure and whole, without attenuations or misrepresentations,' in such a way that 'this sure and immutable teaching, which must be respected faithfully, is elaborated and presented in a way which corresponds to the needs of our time.'\"</ref><ref name=\"https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1984/may/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19840503_vescovi-coreani.html\">Address of Pope John Paul II to the Bishops of Korea: \"In union with Christ you will ponder again what God’s word demands of the Church in Korea. With the courage that comes only with holiness you will accept the full authentic exigencies of the Second Vatican Council for your dioceses. In prayer you will review the perennial teachings of the faith and the ever relevant newness of the Church’s immutable dogmas. In vital communion with Christ, the life-giving vine, and in union with the universal Church, you will continue to preach the word of faith which depends on hearing and which enables the People of God to confess with their lips that Jesus is Lord, to believe in their hearts that God raised him from the dead, and to be saved (Cf. Rom. 10, 9)). This faith - which is nourished in your own hearts and proclaimed with the special episcopal charism that is yours - is the source of all the insights of the faithful, who are called to believe and, in the power of the Holy Spirit, to ponder that belief and live it. \"</ref> But what truths are dogmas has needed to be clarified by church councils, and the much more numerous doctrines have yielded to varied and increased understanding based on solid study of the Biblical roots and of the history of the topic. For this the work of theologians is indispensable, since the charism of the bishops is not to receive revelations but to determine what is Catholic teaching, the more so in doctrines that are more central to the faith and dogmatically taught. The Second Vatican Council of Bishops maintained a careful line between the \"two source\" (Scripture and the living tradition) and \"one source\" explanation of revelation, careful to acknowledge the ultimate priority of the original deposit of faith: \"For Sacred Scripture is the word of God inasmuch as it is consigned to writing under the inspiration of the divine Spirit, while sacred tradition takes the word of God entrusted by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, and hands it on to their successors in its full purity, so that led by the light of the Spirit of truth, they may in proclaiming it preserve this word of God faithfully, explain it, and make it more widely known.\" \n\nThe revelations in the Word of God such as the apparition of the three angels to Abraham and the angel who wrestled Jacob; the burning bush; the theophany on Mount Sinai; the pillar of cloud and pillar of fire; the visions and prophecies of the prophets; Elijah's test at the cave, and his assumption; the revelation to Saint Peter (\"You are the Christ\"); the apparitions of the risen Christ to the Apostles, including the exceptional and unique apparition to Saint Paul; the various miracles recorded in the Acts of the Apostles and in the Epistles; and the entire Book of Revelation are not private revelations but are public revelation, though their original meaning and relevance for the Church today are subject to interpretation. The apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar to Saint James the Greater is a private revelation, since it depends on facts not contained in the original deposit of faith. It, along with the canonization of saints, will never be dogmatically taught, but are taught as safe for Christian belief.\n\nBecause Christ promised that the Holy Spirit would lead the church into every truth, the Lord leads the church into a deeper understanding of the original deposit. To suitably apply the truths of revelation to the needs of each age, the magisterium examines carefully private revelations, to assure that they are in accord with church doctrine. Christ warned that false prophets would come and that the tree will be known by its fruit.\n\nPrivate revelation is a heavenly message that helps people live by divine revelation. Various types of private revelations have been reported in the Catholic Church.\n\nPrivate revelations can come to anyone for so long as God pleases. Some address the visionary, while others address more people. For instance, Our Lady of Laus appeared to a young shepherdess for many years, while Our Lady of Kibeho addressed the leaders of the nation of Rwanda .\n\nThe appearances of the Blessed Virgin Mary are usually called Marian apparitions. These generally include a vision of the Blessed Virgin, accompanied by brief messages. These are by far the most widely reported form. Well known examples of approved Marian apparitions include Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Lourdes and Our Lady of Fátima. These apparitions are considered private revelations from God through the Virgin Mary.\n\nMarian visions do not mean Mary appears as a disembodied spirit, since she has been assumed into heaven. However, it is probable that Mary could appear in bodily form by bilocation. Some theologians, such as Father Reginaldus, believe that, because Jesus does not appear in bodily form, Mary does not appear bodily either.\n\nA number of apparitions of Jesus Christ following his ascension have been reported. Some of these have received approval, as safe for private belief, from the Holy See. For instance, the Vatican biography of Saint Faustina Kowalska quotes some of her conversations with Jesus.\n\nApparitions of Jesus are not the same as the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, even if they include Eucharistic adoration, because the sacraments are a part of public revelation. The apparitions are also not the same as the Second Coming, because the church believes Jesus \"will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\".\n\nThere are also reports of interior locutions in which inner voices are reported, but no vision of divinity is claimed. The Vatican biographies of both Saint Teresa of Ávila and Mother Teresa of Calcutta refer to their interior locutions, although Mother Teresa often preferred to remain private about them.\n\nSome private revelations produce large amounts of text, while others amount to a few reported sentences. For instance, father Stefano Gobbi produced a book of messages attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary, while Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering simply wrote two letters to Pope Leo XIII with a message attributed to Jesus Christ, prompting the Pope to consecrate the world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\nThe church does not regard occultism – spiritism, automatic writing, astrology, fortune-telling, psychic powers, magic, divination, conjuring the dead, etc. – as types of private revelations.\n\nThe church also does not regard private revelations as having authority over the Pope or the bishops in communion with him, because the church, the bishop, and public revelation have divine authority as a matter of faith, while private revelations are not a matter of faith but are believed with human faith. Private revelations neither have divine authority nor can they be believed with divine and catholic faith, and a proof of this is that the Magisterium infallibly interprets the inerrant Word of God,<ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html\">Dei Verbum, 11 & 25: \"Therefore, since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings...It devolves on sacred bishops 'who have the apostolic teaching' to give the faithful entrusted to them suitable instruction in the right use of the divine books, especially the New Testament and above all the Gospels.\"</ref> whereas saints can make errors about the details of private revelations, since fallen human nature is inclined to sin and error. Hence, Catholics cannot disobey the church in favor of obeying private revelation.\n\nAccording to the church private revelations come from God, while false revelations come either from human or demonic sources. Just as in exorcism, the Catholic Church is careful to distinguish between supernatural events, mental illness, drug abuse, deception, and demonic activity. The church gathers a team of scientists, theologians, and other experts to test the spirit of the alleged visionary to see if he is genuine, psychotic or manipulative, influenced by drugs, deceptive or deceived, or possessed by demons.\n\nRevelations from God are an extraordinary grace which confirms Catholic doctrine and dogma. One famous example is Our Lady of Lourdes, who declared Mary to be the Immaculate Conception four years after the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed. Because they are extraordinary, revelations are not to be confused with holiness. Because they are a grace, no one can rightfully desire to receive revelations. Because they remind the faithful of what is already contained in public revelation, private revelations can sometimes occur in unexpected ways, such as the stigmata, which reminds Catholics of the Paschal Mystery; weeping statues, which remind of sin and Mercy; and the mystical ring of Saint Catherine of Siena, which reminds of mystical marriage.\n\nMother Eugenia Ravasio reported a series of messages from God the Father, which were published as \"The Father speaks to His children\". Mother Ravasio's messages were approved by Bishop Alexander Caillot of Grenoble, that ordered an investigation and after ten years issued a letter stating that the messages had a divine nature. In 1988 the messages received also the imprimatur of Cardinal Petrus Canisius Van Lierde, the Vicar General for the Vatican City State, whose general duties were the administration of daily functions of Vatican City. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the Holy See, which is the official authority for approving private revelations on behalf of the Catholic Church, did not declare Mother Eugenia's writings heresy, so this is not controversial to the Catholic Church.\n\nA common human source of false revelations is pareidolia, where people see visions or hear voices where there are none. The church claims that apparitions and visions cannot be photographed and messages and locutions cannot be recorded. Despite this, some people believe in the apparitions of Zeitoun; the church, however, has never judged the alleged apparitions.\n\nAnother human source of false revelations is misattribution, where people put words into saints' and other persons' mouths, such as the \"three days of darkness\" prophecy attributed to Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, the \"end-times\" prophecy attributed to Our Lady of Laus, and the Medjugorje sayings attributed to Pope John Paul II.\n\nAccording to the church a common demonic source of false revelations is demonic possession. It claims that Satan can appear like an angel of light and rebuke people for their sins, and mimic the miracles and revelations of God. The most famous case is Magdalena de la Cruz, through whom Satan uttered false prophecies and fabricated miracles, including uncreated light, stigmata, levitation, ecstasy, and extraordinary fasting (she allegedly survived solely on the Eucharist).\n\nIt is a misconception that the church is quick to accept mental illness or drug abuse, such as schizophrenia or hallucinogens, for private revelation and demonic activity. The church is skeptical, and only accepts private revelation after discernment, because it is \"the pillar and bulwark of the truth\" and because it has a long history of dealing with fraudulent visionaries.\n\nJust as with all charisms, the charisms of prophecy, speaking in tongues, and miracles are subject to discernment.\n\nThe Catholic Church uses the 1987 \"Normae Congregationis\" to discern and judge private revelations. Firstly, the local Catholic bishop judges the alleged revelation according to its fruits:<ref name=\"http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19780225_norme-apparizioni_en.html\">Normae Congregationis, positive and negative criteria</ref>\n\nExamples of revelations with good and bad fruits include:\n\nWhen judgment is favorable, the bishop permits a local devotion without judging the revelation to be worthy of belief, which can include being favorable toward miracles in connection with the revelation without approving of the revelation itself.<ref name=\"http://www.miraclehunter.com/marian_apparitions/approved_apparitions/faith-expression.html\">Miracle Hunter: Apparitions Approved for Faith Expression</ref> This step is commonly called \"approved for faith expression.\"<ref name=\"http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/aprtable.html\">\nMarian Apparitions of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries: A Directory of Twentieth and Twenty-first Century Apparitions</ref> Then, after the bishop sees a healthy devotion to the revelation and abundant spiritual fruits spring from said devotion, he judges the revelation to be worthy of belief: the private revelation contains nothing contrary to Catholic faith or morals, the faithful are authorized to prudently believe in the private revelation (without obligation), and it is legal to publish the private revelation. In addition, the bishop approves of the titles – such as \"Our Lady\" – given to a Marian apparition (Our Lady of Lourdes, for example).\n\nJudgment on private revelations falls under a bishop's ordinary magisterium, which is authoritative but noninfallible and requires religious submission of intellect and will. A bishop or his successor could overturn a prior judgment, such as happened in the case of the apparitions of the Lady of all Nations.\n\nA bishop can judge an alleged private revelation to be either worthy of belief (\"constat de supernaturalitate\") or not worthy of belief (\"constat de non supernaturalitate\"). A private revelation that is worthy of belief can receive full approval if it is approved by the Pope, such as happened with the revelations to St. Margaret Mary. Papal approval does not include popes visiting sites of alleged revelations, granting special privileges to shrines, offering gifts to alleged visionaries, or speaking favorably of alleged revelations or visionaries. A private revelation that is not worthy of belief can either be more fully investigated or, if bad fruits are found, condemned. A condemned revelation may not be followed, believed, or published by the faithful.\n\nA bishop can judge an alleged private revelation before it ends, such as was the case with the prophecies of Montanus (condemned) and the prophecies of Elizabeth Barton (approved). Fraudulent visionaries sometimes counter the negative judgments of their bishops, and skeptics of authentic revelations sometimes counter positive judgments, by saying the bishops didn't do a thorough investigation, such as interviewing the visionaries.\n\nNot all reports of private revelation are approved, even if they have good fruits. For instance, reports of \"Our Lady of Surbiton\" claiming that the Virgin Mary appeared every day under a pine tree in England were flatly rejected by the Vatican as a fraud.\n\nIt is permissible, with the bishop's permission, to make a shrine in honor of an approved revelation. However, no one is obligated to believe in a private revelation, since it is not public revelation; just as no one is obligated to practice popular piety, since it is not the liturgy. Only public revelation and the liturgy are obligatory, for they are necessary for salvation. Despite this, some Catholics, such as the Fatima Crusaders, believe the rosary is necessary for world peace because Our Lady of Fatima said \"Pray the Rosary every day, in order to obtain peace for the world, and the end of the war.\"\n\nOn October 23, 1995 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith clarified about private revelations:\nWith regard to the spreading of texts of presumed personal revelations, the Congregation makes it clear that:\n\n1. The interpretation by some people of a decision approved by Paul VI on October 14, 1966, and promulgated on November 15 of the same year, by virtue of which writings and messages coming from presumed revelations might be freely spread within the Church is absolutely not valid. This decision actually referred to the 'Abolition of the Index of Banned Books,' and said that - once relative censures were lifted - the moral obligation in any case not to spread or read those writings which endangered faith and morals still remained.\n\n2. A reminder, therefore, that for the diffusion of texts of presumed private revelations, the norm of the Code in force, Canon 823, para 1, which gives pastors the right 'to demand that the writings of the faithful which touch faith or morals be submitted to their own judgment before publication', remains valid.\n\n3. Presumed supernatural revelations and writings which regard them are in the first instance subject to the judgment of the diocesan bishop and, in particular cases, to that of the episcopal conference and the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith.\nIt is a misconception that the faithful do not need permission to publish alleged private revelations since the abolition of Canon 1399 and 2318 of the former Canonical Code by Pope Paul VI in AAS 58 (1966) on October 14, 1966. The truth is that Pope Paul VI only abolished the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, and that Canon 823 and 824 of the current 1983 Code of Canon Law define the right and duty of the bishop to censor all material concerning faith or morals.\n\nThe canonization of a mystic or an imprimatur given to a book of revelations do not mean a private revelation is authentic, because the church does not pronounce on alleged revelations when it pronounces on the holiness of an individual and because the Imprimatur only guarantees that a book is free from all doctrinal and moral errors.\n\nCertain private revelations have been the subject of conspiracy theories. The theories include church coverups, church officials siding with the local government to destroy apparitions, visionaries' doubles, and church corruption. It is sometimes claimed that private revelations prove conspiracy theories. For instance, some UFO conspiracy theorists claim that the Miracle of the Sun was a UFO.\n\n"}

{"id": "166683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166683", "title": "Rebbe", "text": "Rebbe\n\nRebbe (: or ) is a Yiddish word derived from the Hebrew word \"rabbi\", which means 'master', 'teacher', or 'mentor'. Like the title \"rabbi\", it refers to teachers of Torah or leaders of Judaism.\n\nIn common parlance of modern times, the phrase \"the Rebbe\" is often used specifically by Hasidim to refer to the leader of their Hasidic movement.\n\nThe Yiddish term \"rebbe\" comes from the Hebrew word \"rabbi\", meaning \"My Master\", which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. It was an honorific originally given to those who had Smicha in the Pharisaic and Talmudic era. Since vowels were not written at the time, it is impossible to know historically whether it was pronounced rah-bee () or r-bee (). The English word \"rabbi\" () comes directly from this form. In Yiddish, the word became \"reb-eh\" ()—now commonly spelled \"rebbe\" (—or just \"reb\" (). The word \"master\" \"\" literally means \"great one\".\n\nThe Sages of the Mishnah known as the \"Tannaim\", from the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era, were known by the title \"Rabbi\" () (for example, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochoy). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the leader of Jewry in Mishnaic Times, was simply called \"Rabbi\" (), as being the rabbi par excellence of his generation.\n\nThe Sages of the Talmud known as the \"Amoraim\", from the 3rd, 4th and early 5th centuries, those born in the Land of Israel, are called \"Rabbi\" (); those born in the diaspora are known by the title \"Rav\" ().\n\nToday, \"rebbe\" is used in the following ways:\nAn ordinary communal rabbi, or \"rebbe\" in Yiddish, is sometimes distinct from a \"rav\" (, also pronounced \"rov\" by Jews of Eastern European or Russian origin), who is a more authoritative halakhic decider. A significant function of a \"rav\" is to answer questions of halakha (corpus of Jewish law), but he is not as authoritative as a \"posek\". The short form \"reb\" is an honorific for Orthodox Jewish men, who are most likely to have profound knowledge of the Talmud and Torah, as opposed to Reconstructionist, Reform or Conservative Judaism. Originally, this title was added to the names of Jews at the time of the schism with the Karaite sect, as a sign of loyalty to the original rabbinic tradition, known today as Orthodox Judaism.\n\nAs a rule, among hasidim, \"rebbe\" () is referred to in Hebrew as \"admor\" (pl. \"admorim\"), an abbreviation for Hebrew \"adoneinu moreinu v'rabeinu\", meaning 'our master, our teacher, and our rabbi', which is now the modern Hebrew word in Israel for \"rebbe\".\n\nHasidim use the term \"rebbe\" () also in a more elevated manner, to denote someone that they perceive not only as the religious leader or \"nasi\" of their congregation, but as their spiritual adviser and mentor. \"The Rebbe\" or \"my Rebbe\" in this sense is a \"rav\" or \"rabbi\" whose views and advice are accepted not only on issues of religious law and practice, but in all arenas of life, including political and social issues. Sometimes a hasid has a \"rebbe\" as his spiritual guide and an additional \"rav\" for rulings on issues of \"halakha\".\n\nHasidim use the concept of a (non-hasidic) \"rebbe\" in the simple sense of \"rabbi\", as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the Hebrew word \"\" . For example: \"I will ask my rebbe (), Rabbi () Ploni (so-and-so), for advice about this personal matter.\"\n\nA hasidic rebbe () is generally taken to mean a great leader of a Hasidic dynasty, also referred to as \"Grand Rabbi\" in English or an \"ADMOR\", a Hebrew acronym for \"Adoneinu-Moreinu-veRabbeinu\" (\"our lord/master, teacher, and rabbi\"). Outside of Hasidic circles the term \"Grand Rabbi\" has been used to refer to a rabbi with a higher spiritual status. The practice became widespread in America in the early 1900s when Hasidic rebbes began to emigrate to the United States and was derived from the German \"Grossrabbiner\".\n\nRabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, is regarded by Hasidim as the first Hasidic rebbe. During his lifetime he was referred to mainly as \"The holy\" rather than as \"Rebbe\", and his disciples were \"magidim\" or \"preachers\", such as the Magid of Chernobyl or the Magid of Mezritsh.\n\nThe first \"rebbe\" to be known as such was the Baal Shem Tov's grandson, Rabbi Boruch of Mezhibozh, who was referred to as \"The Rebbe\" during his lifetime. After him, those who rose to positions of leadership and their successors began to be called \"rebbe\". The title gradually came to suggest a higher spiritual status.\n\nEach Hasidic group refers to its leader as \"the rebbe\".\n\nHannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir or the \"Ludmirer Moyd\", was the only female rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement; she lived in the 19th century in Ukraine and Israel.\n\nAccording to Maimonides, a tzadik is \"one whose merit surpasses [his/her] iniquity\", and every person can reach the level of a Tzadik. According to the Tanya, a tzadik has no evil inclination, and only a select few predestined to attain this level can attain it. According to Kabbalah (and particularly the hasidic understanding of Kabbalah), the world is sustained on the \"shoulders\" of Tzadikim Nistarim, divinely predestined exceptionally righteous people in a generation. Nobody has knowledge about who was such a tzaddik, even one of these exceptionally righteous people would not know that they really are such a tzadik. These people are understood to have perfected their personal service of God to such an extent that they become literally and physically aware of God. These righteous people's perception (of both spiritual and physical, not to mention temporal matters) transcends the apparent boundaries of existence.\n\nHowever, a hasidic rebbe is generally said to be a righteous person, called a \"tzaddik\". Furthermore, a rebbe is said to be able to affect divine providence, and a rebbe is said to be able to \"see the future\", or at least have strong insight into the life and trials of another.\n\nAs a result, hasidim in some hasidic circles seek their rebbe's advice for a variety of concerns: spiritual, physical, and even business concerns. Furthermore, many people seek the blessing \"(bracha)\" of a rebbe (and a hasid will specifically seek the blessing of his own rebbe) for anything from minor (and all the more so major) physical troubles, to grand spiritual concerns. Many famous and common stories of a rebbe's intervention involve women who successfully seek a rebbe's blessing for fertility so that they can conceive after having been barren for many years.\n\nIn some movements the hasidim believe that their rebbe is the \"tzadik hador\" (tzaddik of the generation) and would regard any thought that detracts from his perfection and holiness as heresy. Other sects lessen this idealization to some degree or another. Since many rebbes are sons-in-law or students of other rebbes, it makes sense that they would view themselves as subordinate to those other rebbes. Nonetheless, their hasidim remain loyal to them because of their special loyalty, a family connection, or a belief that a specific \"tzaddik\" or Nasi HaDor (although others might have greater spiritual stature) connects best with one's soul. For example, the Kosover Rebbe makes yearly pilgrimages to the Tosher Rebbe. Nonetheless, his followers remain very loyal to him.\n\nUnlike rabbis or non-hasidic rebbes in other Jewish movements, hasidic Judaism considers a 'hasidic rebbe' to be a conduit between Jews and God. On the basis of traditional Kabbalistic concepts and terminology, Hasidic philosophy bridged deveikut, a Jewish concept referring to closeness to God, to the hasidic rebbe, embodying and channeling the Divine flow of blessing to the world, because Creation is dependent on the continuous flow of Divine lifeforce, without which it would revert to nothingness.\n\nGiven a rebbe's physical awareness of God, and the rebbe's transcendent perception of Godliness, many hasidim take special care to observe the specific and sometimes minute practices of their rebbe. Even things that seem mundane may nonetheless be seen by hasidim as incredibly significant. For example, Lubavitcher hasidim frequently shape their fedoras to match the way that the Lubavitcher Rebbe shaped his hat-which was more flat than many others. Many Skverer hasidim (of the Skverer Rebbe in New Square) wear their peyos identical to those of the Skverer Rebbe. While hasidim do not always follow the specific practices of their rebbe, the rebbe is able to create practices that may be specific and unique to his hasidim. For example, Rabbi Aaron Roth (\"Reb Areleh\", as he was called) the first rebbe of Shomer Emunim, told his hasidim to pause frequently while eating their meals in order to keep them from overindulging. A hasid will usually love his rebbe like a close family member, if not more so. The degree and nature of this belief varies, however, depending on the movement.\n\nThere are some functions which are exclusively the domain of hasidic rebbes:\n\nOthers are not exclusive to Hasidic rebbes, but are often an important part of their role:\n\n\nA rebbe has times when Hasidim (and other petitioners) may come for a private audience. A kvitel (Yiddish for \"note\", plural \"kvitlach\") is a note with the name of the petitioner and a short request for which the rebbe is asked to pray. The formula in which a person's name is written is one's own Hebrew name, the son/daughter of one's mother's Hebrew name, such as \"Shimon ben Rivkah\" (Simeon the son of Rebecca). Hasidim believe that rebbes read supernaturally \"between the lines\" of a \"kvitel\", and in every Hasidic movement there are numerous anecdotes relating how the rebbe saw things that were not written in the \"kvitel\". In most Hasidic groups, the \"kvitel\" is written by the rebbe's \"gabbai\" (secretary), however sometimes the petitioner writes it on his own. Usually, but with some exceptions, a \"pidyon\" (redemption) of cash is customarily handed to the rebbe under the \"kvitel\", but this is not obligatory. This is considered to be the conduit through which the blessing is given, and a redemption for the soul of the petitioner. (\"A gift makes its receiver glad\" is given as an explanation: a blessing only comes from a joyous heart.) It is also customary to tip the gabbai, although this too is not obligatory.\n\nA rebbe conducts a \"tish\" (: \"feert tish\", literally, \"to run [a] table\") or a \"farbrengen\"—a communal festive meal with highly mystical overtones—on Shabbat and other occasions. At a tish, the rebbe distributes \"shirayim\" (lit. remnants) to the Hasidim seated at or gathered round the table. When a gathering similar to a \"tish\" is led by a rabbi who is not a rebbe, it can be referred to as a \"botte\" (esp. amongst groups from Romania) or \"sheves achim\".\n\n\n"}

Their womenfolk cultivated the rich alluvial river banks while the men were fishermen. Preceding them to Stann Creek town (later Dangriga) were some Black Creoles and a few whites who were served by Anglican and Methodist missionaries. In 1834 these missionaries built a chapel for the Garifuna in Stann Creek. There was then a cumulative population of about 500 in Stann Creek and the closely associated town of Mullins River ten miles to the north that had already become a focus of Catholic missionary activity.\n\nThe first evidence that a Catholic priest had been in Stann Creek comes from 1830. Thomas Jeffries, a Methodist minister, said that the Garifuna wore “makeshift beads and crosses to ward off evil and danger, a practice they explained as an inheritance from earlier instruction by Spanish priests.” Mullins River with its colony of immigrant mestizos from Honduras remained the more important Catholic mission until 1867.\n\nIn 1862 Jesuit Fr. Genon was covering Stann Creek from Punta Gorda. Then in 1867 Jesuit Fr. Brindisi built the first Catholic rectory and church in Stann Creek. In 1871 he built a better church “with pillars and naves and a goodly size”, and had the assistance of a diocesan missionary priest Leon Maclluchet from 1874 to 1879. In 1877 Fr. Alfonso Parisi replaced Fr. Brindisi. He built a school in Stann Creek and a new chapel at Mullins River.\n\nWriting in 1874, Jesuit Fr. Pittar described the Garifuna congregation as “remarkably gentle and docile in their conduct … and not a little superstitious.” One superstition he referred to was the belief that spirits of the dead communicate with the living, the dugu ceremony or “spiritualism.” For decades into the 20th century the church and government tried to stamp out this custom. But it has endured with mutual influence: the cross and statues of the Virgin Mary might be placed on the altar in the Dubuyaba, and the Buyei encourage attendance at Christian church services, especially for thanksgiving. Garifuna priests now regard this cultural tradition favorably. The Catholic Mass has been translated into Garifuna and has been enculturated, as displayed at the annual celebration of Garifuna Settlement Day each November 19.\n\nIn 1890 a contingent of Catholics from each of the districts, about 300 strong, gathered at Sacred Heart Church in Stann Creek for the consecration of the Prefecture to the Sacred Heart, a devotion that had come to flourish in the colony. A grand parade with banners and bands processed through town along with Prefect Salvatore di Pietro and the members of the Catholic Association. This all-inclusive event created a future pattern for cultural harmony at Catholic liturgies. It would no longer be the mestizo or Creole or Garifuna church or the church of the elite but the church of all the people. By the mid-1890s, Dangriga had a population of 3965 of whom about 3000 were Catholic. The church building could accommodate 800.\n\nIn 1894 in Stann Creek, beginning in standard 6, the best students received extra classes to enable them to teach in the primary schools, especially in the rural areas. Graduates who were able and willing were hired for a pittance to help in the primary schools of their communities while preparing to qualify as certified teachers. The Garifuna took well to learning and would be essential to the educational efforts of the Catholic church in Belize. In 1897 the Sisters of the Holy Family arrived from New Orleans principally to serve in Stann Creek. They managed Sacred Heart parochial school, Holy Angels in nearby Pomona, and founded Austin High School for Girls, since amalgamated. In 2015 there were 14 Catholic primary schools in Stann Creek District.\n\nIn 1903 Fr. Joe Lynam replaced Joe Rigge as pastor and remained until 1910. In six years Lynam recorded 541 baptisms, 242 marriages, and 310 deaths. Also serving at this time were Spanish Jesuit Matthew Antillach (1893–1910) and Fr. Edmond Coony (1904–1918; 1921–1929). Following him was Fr. Michael Schaefer (1929–1935). In 1931 Stann Creek welcomed its first native priest, Fr. Sebastian Arjonilla. While John Knopp served as pastor (1941–1945; 1954–1957), a plague of locusts destroyed people’s crops (1941) and a hurricane destroyed two schools. Then in January 1942 a fire completely destroyed the church and convent. The present church building was built in 1954. In 1945 Robert McCormack became pastor in Stann Creek. In 1953 he helped open Lynam College nine miles outside of town, which for 18 years served as the country’s only agricultural college, closing in 1971. There followed the pastors William Thro 1963–1970, who built a new rectory, Howard Oliver 1970–1980, and James Short 1981–1989 who had recruited the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth for Belize in 1975 to assist with pastoral ministry at Sacred Heart. The involvement of the laity was formalized into a Lay Ministry Program for Sacred Heart Parish that, in 1980, saw 37 men and women begin the year-long process of preparation. This increased the self-confidence level of lay ministers, as they conducted prayer and Communion services in rural areas and took Communion to the sick. In 1959 Garifuna Osmond P. Martin was ordained to the priesthood in his home parish of Sacred Heart in Stann Creek. He would become the first native bishop of Belize in 1983.\n"}
{"id": "26898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26898", "title": "Sect", "text": "Sect\n\nA sect is a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group. Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.\n\nIn an Indian context, sect refers to an organized tradition.\n\nThe word \"sect\" comes from the Latin noun \"secta\" (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb \"sequi\", to follow), meaning \"a way, road\", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence metonymously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of \"sect\" has been influenced by confusion with the homonymous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word \"secta\" (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb \"\", to cut).\n\nThere are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term. Among the first to define them were Max Weber and Ernst Troeltsch (1912). In the church-sect typology they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a denomination). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge assert that \"sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split\". They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society. Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with. Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.\n\nSectarianism is sometimes defined in the sociology of religion as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.\n\nThe English sociologist Roy Wallis argues that a sect is characterized by \"epistemological authoritarianism\": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, \"sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation\" and \"their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'\". He contrasts this with a cult that he described as characterized by \"epistemological individualism\" by which he means that \"the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member.\"\n\nThe corresponding words for \"sect\" in European languages other than English – \"Sekte\" (German), \"secte\" (French), \"secta\" (Spanish, Catalan), \"sectă\" (Romanian), \"seita\" (Portuguese, Galician), \"sekta\" (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian), \"sekt\" (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), \"sekte\" (Dutch) and \"szekta\" (Hungarian), \"секта\" (Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian) – refer to a harmful religious sect and translate into English as \"cult\". In France, since the 1970s, \"secte\" has a specific meaning which is very different from the English word.\n\nThe \"Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion\" distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into \"Movements\", \"Nikāyas\" and \"Doctrinal schools\":\n\nWhile the historical usage of the term \"sect\" in Christendom has had pejorative connotations, referring to a group or movement with heretical beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox, its primary meaning is to indicate a community which has separated itself in some way from the larger body from which its members came and to which they may or may not still adhere. The term remains valid for this purpose.\n\nThere are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the Community of the Lady of All Nations, the Palmarian Catholic Church, the Philippine Independent Church, the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, Most Holy Family Monastery, and others.\n\nThe Indologist Axel Michaels writes in his book about Hinduism that in an Indian context the word \"sect does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by founder with ascetic practices.\" According to Michaels, \"Indian sects do not focus on heresy, since the lack of a center or a compulsory center makes this impossible – instead, the focus is on adherents and followers.\"\n\nThe ancient schools of fiqh or sharia in Islam are known as \"madhhabs.\" In the beginning Islam was classically divided into three major sects. These political divisions are well known as Sunni Islam, Shia Islam and Khariji Islam. Each sect developed several distinct jurisprudence systems reflecting their own understanding of the Islamic law during the course of the history of Islam.\n\nFor instance, Sunnis are separated into five sub-sects, namely, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Ẓāhirī.\n\nThe Shia, on the other hand, first developed Kaysanism, which in turn divided into three major groupings known as Fivers, Seveners and Twelvers. The Zaydis separated first. The non-Zaydis are initially called as \"Rafida Groups.\" These Rafidis were later divided into two sub-groups known as Imamiyyah and Batiniyyah.\n\n\nThe Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunnis, the Twelver groups, the Ismā'īlī groups, the Zaydis, the Ibadis, and the Ẓāhirīs continue to exist. In addition, new sects like Ahmadiyya movement, Black Muslim movements, Quranists, Salafis, Wahhabis, and Zikris have been emerged independently.\n\nAn Islamic convention held in Jordan in July 2005, which brought 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries together, announced the official recognition of eight schools of Islamic jurisprudence and the varying schools of Islamic theology. The eight recognized Islamic schools and branches are:\n\n\n"}

Firstly the organization was registered under the Society Act at Ludhiana and then on November 4, 2001, the Federation held a large congregation of thousands of Sehajdhari Sikhs before Akal Takht at Amritsar and held Ardas by turning the Sehajdhari Sikh Federation into a political out fit and named it as Sehajdhari Shiromani Akali Dal SSAD.\n\nLater an application was filed with the Election Commission of India for getting the organization registered as a Political Party under section 29(A) of the Representation of the People Act 1951. The Akali Dals in Punjab opposed the name “Sehajdhari Shiromani Akali Dal” and the Election Commission directed to change the words ‘Shiromani’ and ‘Akali’ from the title. As the word ‘AKALI’ means ‘KHALSA’(Amritdhari) and Sehajdharis are not Khalsa hence the old name was selected by the National Council of the Organisation and the Election Commission of India registered the name of “Sehajdhari Sikh Federation” as a Political Party under section 29(A) of the Representation of People Act 1951.Now the Election commission has approved the change of name of the Party as SEHAJDHARI SIKH PARTY (SSP).\n\nThe Party has been contesting a legal battle in the Punjab & Haryana High Court for the voting right of Sehajdhari Sikhs in the SGPC elections which was existing since 1959 and was disfrenchised in 2003 by a notification. The High Court quashed the notification and revived the voting rights of sehajdhari sikhs.The SGPC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court Verdict and the matter is under adjudication.\n\n"}

In 1983, he obtained permission from the Sangha in Thailand, to give a ten-precept \"pabbajja\" to the women, making them officially recognized female renunciants trained in the Ajahn Chah lineage. The reasons for its establishment are due to the historical loss of the bhikkhuni (nun's) ordination in Theravada Buddhism, limiting renunciation for female Theravadins to ad-hoc roles such as the thilashins and maechis, neither of which garner respect from the Theravada community as genuine renunciates.\n\nAjahn Sumedho enlisted Ajahn Sucitto to train the nuns from 1984 to 1991. By 2008, siladharas were trained in the discipline of more than one hundred precepts, including rules based on the patimokkha of the bhikkhuni order. The order waxed and waned throughout its brief history, peaking at around 14, mostly living at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery.\n\nThe siladhara order is formally considered a community junior to that of the bhikkhu order of fully ordained men. Over the last twenty years, many siladhara have therefore sought full bhikkhuni ordination with commensurate privileges, recognition and responsibilities enjoyed by male monastics. Making full ordination available to women a cultural issue with significant implications for the welfare of young girls living in poverty in Asian countries where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, especially Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka. Speaking of Thailand, Lynne Hybels writes, \"Young men in desperately poor families such as those in Chiang Rai can bring honor to their families by becoming monks, but girls are expected to provide financially. Traffickers understand this vulnerability, prey on it, and easily lure girls into life in the brothel.\"\n\nAfter years of debate and dispute, Ajahn Sumedho issued a \"Five Point Declaration\" concerning women's roles and rights in the Amaravati monastic community. This affirmed the traditional privileges and seniority of bhikkhus over female monastics. The edict holds that while some teaching and management responsibilities are shared between the two orders according to capability, the siladhara order is unequivocally junior to that of the monks.\n\nThe \"Five Point declaration\" is considered to be discriminatory against women. Some monastics and scholars also consider it to be an inaccurate interpretation of the Vinaya and other texts similar to the Three-Fifths Compromise in the United States Constitution or other codified examples of discrimination such as coverture. Many female monastics living at Amaravati at the time left the monastery citing discrimination and an inaccurate understanding of compassion on the part of Amravati leadership.\n\nSeveral siladharas from this group founded a community in the United States. Along with numerous other women in recent years, these former siladharas have taken full bhikkhuni ordination. \n\n"}

She is regarded as the mother or daughter of the Heavenly King and, in some myths, as the mother of all shamans. In other myths, the shamans are rather explained as descendants of Dangun.\n\nIn a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to Sungmo, who is associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the \"Heavenly King\". In some myths, she is a mortal princess who is later turned into a goddess. The investiture of the shamans, according to such myths, is believed to pass down through female lineage.\n\nThese myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the \"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\" on the top of a mountain. The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first \"mudang\". According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the Silla period, when Buddhism and influences from China had already penetrated the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region. In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland. The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people. Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers. The first \"mudang\" were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the \"mudang\" are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes.\n\nIn the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as \"Chil Kongju\" (the \"Seventh Princess\"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king. The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and casted it in a pond, but she was rescued by a Dragon King sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters.

They are part of the Lipuun Point Reservation, which has been protected by the government of the Philippines as a museum reservation to protect the caves and immediate vicinity from deforestation and to preserve the cultural artifacts present there.\n\nThe caves are named after the Tabon scrubfowl. It is bordered on the south by the town proper of Quezon, Bgy. Panitian on the west, and the West Philippine Sea on the north and east. Out of 215 known caves, 29 have been explored and seven of these are open to the public. The seven include Tabon, Diwata, Igang and Liyang Caves. One of the oldest human bones found in the Philippines, the Tabon Man, was found here in 1962. Other excavated, unexamined remains are stored onsite. In 2006, the \"Tabon Cave Complex and all of Lipuun\" was added to the tentative list of the Philippines for future UNESCO World Heritage Site nomination.\n\nThe complex is managed by the National Museum and was declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the same institution in February 2011.\n\nThe caves were researched by Dr. Robert B. Fox and a team from the National Museum of the Philippines between 1962 and 1966. The greatest find of was the skull cap of the Tabon Man. It is believed to be approximately 22,000-24,000 years old. The team found over 1,500 burial jars. One jar in particular, the Manunggul Jar, is considered to be a National Cultural Treasure. Other finds included earthenware, jade ornaments and jewelry, many stone tools, animal bones, and human fossils dating back to 47,000 years ago, the earliest human remains found in the Philippines. The archaeological finds indicate habitation from 50,000 to 700 years ago. The limestone formations in the reservation date back 25 million years to the Lower Middle Miocene Period.\n\nThe Lipuun Point Reservation, covering a island connected to the Palawan mainland by a mangrove forest, was declared a Site Museum Reservation in April 1972 and was made a priority site for tourism development in 1991 for its natural and cultural heritage.\n\nIn recent years, verification of facts in addition to further analysis of previously collected samples has allowed for a greater understanding of the site as a whole. Radioisotope dating techniques have been able to show a period of near continuous habitation from 30,000-9,000 years ago. Human remains as well as rock flakes, hammers, and other stone tools indicate the cave may have been used as a workshop. The bone fragments found in the caves have been suggested to have been from the late Pleistocene to early Holocene periods. Previous excavations of the site have also revealed evidence of a diet including pig and deer, which are extinct in the Philippines today.\n\nWhile little new data is available because of the cave's location and safety concerns, they are slowly being excavated and the old data is being reexamined. Approximately 25% of archaeological sites in the caves have been excavated.\n\nEarliest cave uses included inhabitation, and the factory like production of stone tools. According to a video by Dr. Fox, a jar burial period began 3000 years ago and lasted until 1500 years ago. This is evidence the area became dominated by people known as the Sa Huỳnh culture.\n\nThe Sa Huynh adorned their dead with agate, carnelian, and glass beads from India and Iran. Artifacts of this nature, including glass bracelets, were found in the cave and are displayed at the Palawan Cultural Museum in Puerto Princesa.\n\nA migration of Sa Huyhn people to Vietnam is accepted by most experts to have been the forebears of the Cham people. These are a people still existing today that created an empire known as Champa.\n\nHistory of the people in the area took on a new significance in modern times owing to the Spratly Islands dispute.\n\nA gold Ornamental Pendant, from the Tabon caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the eagle bird who is the mount of Hindu deity Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon caves has been linked to those found from Óc Eo archaeological site in Thoại Sơn District in southern An Giang Province of Vietnam in the Mekong River Delta. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China.\n\nIgang is one of the upper caves and one of the longest of the complex. It appears to have been the primary burial site and most of the burial jars were found here.\n\nTabon Cave lends its name to the complex as a whole. In this large cave with a big open chamber, researchers found artifacts indicating trade with China during the Song Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty. These are now at the Philippine National Museum in Manila.\n\nIn July 2015, Holy Trinity University in Puerto Princesa, Palawan was selected for the construction of a new college to studies of ancient Palawan man (Tabonology).\nNearly all active research stopped after Dr. Fox died.\n\nThe National Museum of the Philippines carefully guards the cave complex. All visitors are watched to ensure they take nothing but pictures and do not damage the cave walls. Further, all burial jars and remains have been secured.\n\nOne issue is that new research and exploration of the complex has largely ceased.\n\n"}

Carlson, and first published by Zondervan. The book was adapted by Rolf Forsberg and Robert Amram during 1976 into a film narrated by Orson Welles and released by Pacific International Enterprises. It was originally ghost-written by Carlson, whom later printings credited as co-author. Lindsey and Carlson later published several sequels, including \"Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth\" and \"The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon\".\n\n\"The Late, Great Planet Earth\" is a treatment of literalist, premillennial, dispensational eschatology. As such, it compared end-time prophecies in the Bible with then-current events in an attempt to predict future scenarios resulting in the rapture of believers before the tribulation and Second Coming of Christ to establish his thousand-year (i.e. millennial) Kingdom on Earth. Emphasizing various passages in the books of Daniel, Ezekiel and Revelation, Lindsey originally suggested the possibility that these climactic events might occur during the 1980s, which he interpreted as one generation from the foundation of modern Israel during 1948, a major event according to some conservative evangelical schools of eschatological thought. Cover art of the Bantam edition suggested that the 1970s were the \"era of the Antichrist as foretold by Moses and Jesus,\" and termed the book \"a penetrating look at incredible ancient prophecies involving this generation.\" Descriptions of alleged \"fulfilled\" prophecy were offered as proof of the infallibility of God's Word, and evidence that \"unfulfilled\" prophecies would soon find their denouement in God's plan for the planet.\nHe cited an increase in the frequency of famines, wars and earthquakes, as major events just prior to the end of the world. He also foretold a Soviet invasion of Israel (War of Gog and Magog). Lindsey also predicted that the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, was destined (according to Biblical prophecy) to become a \"United States of Europe\", which in turn he says is destined to become a \"Revived Roman Empire\" ruled by the Antichrist. Lindsey wrote that he had concluded, since there was no apparent mention of America in the books of Daniel or Revelation, that America would not be a major geopolitical power by the time the tribulations of the end times arrived. He found little in the Bible that could represent America, but he suggested that could be speaking of America in part.\n\nAlthough Lindsey did not claim to know the dates of future events with any certainty, he suggested that indicated that Jesus' return might be within \"one generation\" of the rebirth of the state of Israel, and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple, and Lindsey asserted that \"in the Bible\" one generation is forty years. Some readers accepted this as an indication that the Tribulation or the Rapture would occur no later than 1988. In his 1980 work \"The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon\", Lindsey predicted that \"the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it\".\n\n\"The Late, Great Planet Earth\" was the first Christian prophecy book to be published by a secular publisher (Bantam, 1973) and sell many copies. Despite some dated content, 28 million copies had sold by 1990. The film \"The Late Great Planet Earth\" was narrated by Orson Welles and released in theaters during 1979.\n\n"}

It was written by John Marco Allegro (1923–1988).\n\nThe book relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro argues, through etymology, that the roots of Christianity, and many other religions, lay in fertility cults, and that cult practices, such as ingesting visionary plants to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early Christian era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the fresco of the Plaincourault Chapel to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of \"Amanita muscaria\" as the Eucharist. Allegro argued that Jesus never existed as a historical figure and was a mythological creation of early Christians under the influence of psychoactive mushroom extracts such as psilocybin.\n\nHis claims have often been subject to ridicule and scorn due to Allegro's unconventional theory. As \"Time\" magazine put it in an article headed \"Jesus as mushroom\",\n\nTo some biblical scholars in Britain, the new book looked like the psychedelic ravings of a hippie cultist. To others, it was merely an outlandish hoax. One described it as reading \"like a Semitic philologist's erotic nightmare\".\nThe book has been described as \"notorious\" and as \"one of the strangest books ever published on the subject of religion and pharmacology\". There was a media frenzy when it was published at the dawn of the 1970s. This caused the publisher to apologize for issuing it and forced Allegro's resignation from his university position. Judith Anne Brown suggested that the book was \"difficult to read and difficult to summarize, because he follows clues that criss-cross different cultures and lead into many-layered webs of association\". Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed. Philip Jenkins writes that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them, and calls the \"Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" \"possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic\".\n\nSome studies of Allegro's work have given new purported evidence and led to calls for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream. In November 2009 \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with 30-page addendum by Prof. Carl A. P. Ruck of Boston University. A more articulate exposition of Allegro's insights into early Christianity and his discoveries studying the Dead Sea Scrolls was published in his 1979 book \"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth\".\n\nThe work of Allegro also gained recognition and consideration by such late proponents of experiential psychedelia through pharmacological interaction as Terence McKenna, who cited Allegro's claims of certain psychoactive fungi analogizing the Eucharist, spoken in a live lecture in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27913536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27913536", "title": "There is No Natural Religion", "text": "There is No Natural Religion\n\nThere is No Natural Religion is a series of philosophical aphorisms by William Blake, written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with relief etching in the non-textual \"The Approach of Doom\" (1787), \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his illuminated manuscripts. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as Peter Ackroyd points out, \"his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words inscribed like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role.\"\n\nIn 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled \"The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake\". Inscribed in the colophon of this text is \"W Blakes Original Stereotype was 1788\". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the \"Original Stereotype\" to which he here refers was \"All Religions are One\" and/or \"There is No Natural Religion\".\n\nDuring the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.\n\nDuring Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with James Basire during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was stippling, which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, line engraving. Etching was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background. All traditional methods of engraving and etching were intaglio, which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a burin to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with in a web of crosshatched lines, before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the printing press.\n\nFrustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, \"An Island in the Moon\". Around the same time, George Cumberland had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.\n\nBlake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.\n\nBlake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire \"oeuvre\" are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.\n\nBlake himself referred to relief etching as \"printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.\" A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, J.T. Smith; \"writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with aquafortis considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype.\"\n\nRelief etching was the same basic method used for woodcutting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early 18th century by Elisha Kirkall, but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate. Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required. As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; \"it permitted—indeed promoted—a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in 18th-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes\". Blake served as artist, engraver, printer \"and\" publisher.\n\nBibliographically, \"No Natural Religion\" is one of the most complex and ambiguous of all of Blake's illuminated manuscripts. What is known for certain is that there were two printing sessions; one in 1794, and one in 1795, when a large paper copy was printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts.\n\nAlthough \"There is No Natural Religion\" was etched in 1788, whether Blake had printed it prior to 1794 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\", would suggest he had not.\n\nThe 1794 printing consists of 87 known impressions of a total of twelve plates. These impressions comprise the majority of Copy A (British Museum), Copy B (Yale Center for British Art), Copy C (Library of Congress), Copy D (Houghton Library), Copy G (Morgan Library & Museum) and Copy M (Victoria and Albert Museum). All 87 impressions of the twelve plates have been colour printed in reddish-brown ink on the same type of paper. However, only Copy G (reproduced below) contains impressions of all 12 plates, although this copy was not assembled by Blake himself, but by John Linnell, after Blake's death, using unbound leaves found amongst Blake's possessions. Additionally, it was once thought that impressions from the 1794 print made up the majority of plates in Copy E, Copy F, Copy H, Copy I, Copy J and Copy K. However, in 1993, Joseph Viscomi proved that all but five of the plates in these copies are imitations. Copy E, Copy J and Copy K are composed entirely of imitations. Copy F and Copy H have two original impressions each, and the rest are imitations. Copy I has one original plate (a9; reproduced below as Plate a9 from Copy G is damaged). Viscomi believes the imitations may have been commissioned by the publisher Basil M. Pickering in the early 1860s.\n\nFrom the 1795 printing, there is only one known set of impressions (Copy L), now held in the Morgan Library. However, although this second printing also contains 12 plates (with one missing), only four plates from the 1794 print were reprinted. The remaining seven plates are known only in this single impression. The black ink framing lines in Copy L are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to when Blake gave the plates to John Linnell. It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each plate is roughly 5.4 x 4 cm.; each page is 37.8 x 27 cm). In all copies other than Copy L, the plates are roughly 14 x 11 cm.\n\nIn numerous cases in both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.\n\nAll known copies of \"No Natural Religion\" were assembled from loose plates sold anonymously at Sotheby's on April 29, 1862, to Richard Monckton Milnes, and as such, there is no definitive order (except where the plates are numbered). Despite this lack of definitive order however, the sequence of the plates from the 1794 print is generally agreed to be the frontispiece, followed by the title page, then the Argument, then the plates numbered I–VI, followed by the plates reprinted in 1795. The order of the twelve plates from the 1795 print is generally agreed to be the frontispiece, followed by the title page, then the plates numbered I–VII, followed by the Conclusion, Application and the 'Therefore' plate. Traditionally, Blakean scholars tended to place the Conclusion after the Application, but since Mary Johnson and John E. Grant in 1979, this has been reversed.\n\nAfter the original 1794 and 1795 printings, the text of \"There is No Natural Religion\" was not published until 1886, in a facsimile edition edited by William Muir.\n\nIn 1886, William Muir attempted to impose an order on the various plates, but his efforts were not universally accepted. More successful was Geoffrey Keynes' attempt in 1971, and many of his decisions are still followed by modern editors. Keynes most important, and controversial, editorial choice was to rigidly divide the two printing sessions into two distinct series', which came to be known as Series a and Series b. Specifically, he used the later addition of the framing lines in Series b (i.e. the 1795 print) to help him establish that Series as distinct from Series a (i.e. the 1794 print).\n\nIn Keynes' reordering, Series a comprises eight plates, one of which is missing (Plate a2 (title page); this is because the title page from the 1794 print is actually a version of the title page from the 1795 print, and as the title is thought to suit Series b better than Series a, it tends to be designated Plate b2 and assigned to Series b). Keynes also assigned the three plates from 1794 which were reprinted in 1795 to Series b, designating them b3, b4 and b12. As such, Series b comprises eleven plates, with at least one plate missing (Plate b5; III). In 1978, David Bindman suggested that there are more plates missing from Series b than just Plate 5, as he argued that the last three plates (Application, Conclusion and 'Therefore') are thematically isolated, suggesting more missing plates which should come after Plate b8 (VII). Bindman also saw the missing title page from Series a as important, arguing that although Series a was printed with the same title plate as Series b, there is no direct evidence that \"There is No Natural Religion\" is actually the correct title of Series a; \"\"There is No Natural Religion\" would seem to be the title of Series b, and its content would be compatible with such a title; but there would then be no reason why Series a should have the same title.\"\n\nKeynes' editorial decisions have been supported by most scholars since 1971, and editors of Blake's collected work in particular tend to adhere to the division into two distinct series'; for example, Alicia Ostriker's \"William Blake: The Complete Poems\" (1977), David Bindman's \"The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake\" (1978), David V. Erdman's 2nd edition of \"The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake\" (1982), and Bindman's 2nd edition of \"The Illuminated Blake: William Blake's Complete Illuminated Works\" (1992), and \"The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake\" (2003).\n\nHowever, Keynes' theories have not been accepted by all Blakean scholars. For example, in \"Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books\" (1993), Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi argue that the two Series are one, and the only difference between the 1794 and 1795 prints is that the 1794 print is an abridged version of the whole, and only the second half of the work was printed in 1795. They argue that \"the existence of only one title, as well as the \"c.\"1794 abridgement containing plates from both groups, suggest that the work was etched not as two separate Series but as a single work arranged into two parts, the second answering the first.\" If this is correct, Series a cannot stand alone, as the irony found within it is only revealed when it is contrasted with Series b and thus, were it to be interpreted alone, \"Blake would have appeared to contemporary readers as an advocate of the very position he is attacking.\" This argument has been accepted by several modern editors of Blake's work, such as W.H. Stevenson in the 3rd edition of \"Blake: The Complete Poems\" (2007).\n\nAn important component of Keynes' theory was that the three plates from the 1794 print reprinted in 1795, formed a part of Series b, not Series a. However, if they are included with Series a (such as in Bindman's \"The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake\"), they come at the end; plates numbered I & II to refute the theories of the previous plates, followed by the 'Therefore' plate to bring the work to a close. As such, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that the 1794 print represents a twelve plate abridgement (the twelve plates are a1, a2/b2, a3-9, b3-4 and b12). They argue that \"the b-series plates provide a brief but bold refutation of the empirical and materialist principles offered on the preceding pages and indicate the irony with which Blake offers the first group of aphorisms.\" They especially argue that the abridgement theory is supported by plates a9 and b3, which is the crossover point from irony to refutation. Plate a9 depicts a prone figure with his head on the right, whereas plate b3 is a mirror image, a figure with his head on the left; \"this visual reversal complements the sudden change of philosophical perspective in the accompanying text.\" The plates are also ideologically in direct opposition; they both deal with perceptions and organs of sense, but whereas a9 asserts that man can experience through such organs only, b3 states that this is patently false, and perceptions can go beyond organs of sense. Plate b4 elaborates on this theory, and plate b12 fulfils the prophecy of what will happen \"when we know more.\" Thus the series forms a coherent, if brief, statement. As to the question of why Blake omitted the rest of the plates, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that plates b6-11 deal with issues which thematically wouldn't fit into the abridgement—hence the 1794 print represents a streamlined version of the overall thesis; \"a statement on the empiricist theory of perception followed by its direct and forceful rebuttal.\"\n\nA major question related to the 1795 print is why did Blake only print Series b (or under Eaves, Essick and Viscomi's terms, the second half of the overall work). There are two possibilities. Perhaps he did print the entire work, but Series a (i.e. the first half) was lost. The second theory is that he may have printed only Series b as he wanted it to exist as a companion to the 1795 print of \"All Religions\"; \"the decision to delete the first sequence may have been motivated by a desire to create an eleven-page companion to \"All Religions are One\", a work in ten plates. Both are positive statements of Blake's principles; the presence of the ironic first sequence of propositions from \"There is No Natural Religion\" would have come between and disrupted the symmetrical relationship between the companion works.\" In support of this theory is the fact that Copy L of \"No Natural Religion\" was printed on the same paper and in the same ink as the only existing copy of \"All Religions\", and also has the same framing lines.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, it is possible, however tentative, to suggest what the original appearance of the overall work may have been when first etched in 1788. Eaves, Essick and Viscomi propose the following order:\nAlthough it is possible that plate b1 served as a divider between the two series, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi believe it was a tailpiece to the overall work. In that position it would mirror the only other full plate design (the frontispiece). Also the graphical content would suggest it as a tailpiece, as it returns to the gothic architecture of the title page. It also serves as an illustration of plate b12 ('Therefore') insofar as it depicts a resurrection where we become as God is; \"the work therefore ends with its most hopeful and religious concept, the restoration of humanity to spiritual life\" insofar as \"the plate holds out the promise of a resurrection from the 'death' of Lockean philosophy and into the life of the spirit.\"\n\nUntil 1971, most editors tended to consider \"All Religions are One\" as later than \"There is No Natural Religion\". For example, in his 1905 book \"The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals\", John Sampson places \"No Natural Religion\" prior to \"All Religions\" in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that \"All Religions are One\" was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its \"greater technical imperfection.\" In his 1978 book, \"The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake\", David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in \"All Religions\" are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for \"No Natural Religion\". Most scholars however support Keynes, and \"All Religions are One\" precedes \"There is No Natural Religion\" in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, Alicia Ostriker's \"William Blake: The Complete Poems\" (1977), David V. Erdman's 2nd edition of \"The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake\" (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's \"Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books\" (1993), even Bindman's own \"The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake\" (2003), and W. H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of \"Blake: The Complete Poems\" (2007).\n\nFurther evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of \"No Natural Religion\" as more confident than that of \"All Religions\". They especially cite the use of upright roman lettering in \"All Religions\" contrasted with the italic, cursive writing on several plates of \"No Natural Religion\"; italic text \"was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch.\" Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of \"No Natural Religion\", a script which he would use throughout the 1790s. Other evidence for an earlier dating of \"All Religions\" is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in \"No Natural Religion\". This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in \"All Religions\" but not \"No Natural Religion\" suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.\n\nWhen analysing \"No Natural Religion\" it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; \"the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal.\"\n\nOne of the most immediately obvious aspects of the two series' is how they fundamentally contradict one another. In Series a, Blake explicitly states that Man is purely physical and limited to that physicality; \"Naturally he is only a natural organ subject to sense\", and he \"cannot naturally Perceive. But through his natural or bodily organs.\" Because of this, Man can only understand that which he has already encountered (i.e. he cannot understand something he has not encountered, because to do so would involve faculties beyond the physical senses); Man \"can only compare & judge of what he has already perceiv'd.\" Man cannot even extrapolate new comprehensions by combining old ones; \"From a perception of only 3 sense or 3 elements none could deduce a fourth or fifth.\" Thus, because man is limited by organic physicality (\"None could have other than natural or organic thoughts if he had none but organic perceptions\"), both his thoughts and his desires are so limited; \"Mans desires are limited by his perceptions. none can desire what he has not perceiv'd.\" As such, \"The desires & perceptions of man untaught by any thing but organs of sense, must be limited to organs of sense.\" Overall, Series a serves as a declaration of extreme empiricism, which goes much further than any of the empiricist theorists ever took it.\n\nSeries b however, completely refutes the basic concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that \"Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover.\" As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; \"Reason or the ratio of all we have already known. is not the same as it shall be when we know more.\" Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; \"The bounded is loathed by its possessor.\" As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because \"Less than all cannot satisfy Man.\" However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because \"if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot.\" However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus \"the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite.\" That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, \"not\" to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; \"If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things & stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again\"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate (\"the Ratio\"); \"He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only.\" Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, \"God becomes as we are that we may be as he is.\"\n\nDavid Bindman summarises \"There is No Natural Religion\" as \"an early and fundamental statement of [Blake's] philosophical beliefs, expressed in the rational language of 18th-century philosophers.\" In line with this way of thinking, S. Foster Damon suggests that \"the first series states John Locke's philosophy of the five senses until it becomes self-evidently absurd.\" A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that both \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" are \"part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of 18th-century deism or \"natural religion\", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or \"Poetic Genius\".\" In this sense, \"No Natural Religion\" is a \"mockery of rationalism and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude.\"\n\nHowever, as well as attacking the theories of empiricism, Blake also engages with the concept of natural religion. Northrop Frye argues that \"Theology distinguishes between \"natural\" and \"revealed\" religion, the former being the vision of God which man develops with his fallen reason, and the later the vision communicated to him by inspired prophets. To Blake, there is no natural religion. The only reason people believe in it is because they are unwilling to believe in the identity of God and Man.\" For Harold Bloom, because Blake is able to see the identity of God and man, the rejection of Locke and the tenets of deism makes way for a system in which \"to see the infinite in all things is to see God because it is to see as God sees, which Blake believes is the only way to see God. But to see as God sees, man must himself be infinite, a state to be attained only by the individual utterly possessed by the Poetic character.\" Similarly, \"there is no natural religion, according to Blake, because no man reasoning from fallen nature can come to see that \"the real man, the imagination\" and God are the same. Religion must be \"revealed\" in the sense that Revelation means the consuming of natural appearance by a more imaginative vision.\" Along these same lines, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that, for Blake, natural religion is a \"contradiction in terms antithetical to religious belief. Natural religion is derived from experience provided by the fallen senses, not from the Poetic Genius. Thus it is not a religion and cannot be included in the 'all' of \"All Religions are One\".\"\n\nIn Blake's ironic treatment of empirical doctrines and natural religion, a key element introduced in Series b is desire; \"the rational mind, merely a mechanical manipulation or \"ratio\" of sense experience, \"shall be\" transformed as spiritual enlightenment advances and we discover more than \"organic perceptions\" allow. If it were not for desires reaching beyond the sensate, Man would be trapped in a self-imposed empiricist prison. For Blake, expanding the prison or accumulating more will not bring any respite, as only the Infinite will satisfy Man. If we could not attain the infinite, we would be in eternal despair, but because we are not, Blake reasons that we thus must be able to attain the Infinite, and as such, Man becomes Infinite himself; \"Locke's principle of a reciprocal and mutually validating relationship among the mind, the sense organs, and their objects has been converted into a similarly structured reciprocity among infinite desire, its infinite object, and its infinite desirer.\"\n\nIn terms of influences, in 1787 Henry Fuseli was working on a translation of J. K. Lavater's \"Aphorisms on Man\" for the publisher Joseph Johnson, when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them. Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of \"Aphorisms\", and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\". S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;\n\n\nTo these points Blake has annotated \"This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction.\n\nThe importance of Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton and John Locke is paramount to the work, and it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. \"c.\"1808, he annotated Volume 1 of \"The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds\", edited by Edmond Malone, and wrote\n\nThe extreme empiricism of Series a closely mirrors some of the theories espoused by Locke and Bacon. For example, Blake's assertion that Man cannot deduce any other senses is specifically based on Bacon; \"Man, being the servant and interpreter of nature, can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything\" and Locke; \"it is \"not possible\" for any one \"to imagine\" any other \"Qualities\" in Bodies, howsoever constituted, whereby they can be taken notice of, besides Sounds, Tastes, Smells, visible and tangible Qualities. And had Mankind been made but with four Senses, the Qualities then, which are the Object of the Fifth Sense, had been as far from our Notice, Imagination, and Conception, as now \"any belonging to a Sixth, Seventh, or Eighth Sense\", can possibly be.\" However, Locke did argue that Man could build on simple ideas and create a complex concept of spirituality; \"Moral Beings and Notions are founded on, and terminated in these simple \"Ideas\" we have received from Sensation or Reflection.\" Blake ironically rejects this notion, arguing instead that just as Man cannot deduce more senses than he has, he cannot deduce ideas beyond those immediately perceivable by the senses. This claim, that Man cannot desire anything beyond his senses (such as transcendence), is going much further than either Locke or Bacon, neither of whom made any such assertion.\n\nHarold Bloom also cites the work of Anthony Collins, Matthew Tindal and John Toland as having an influence on Blake's thoughts. In a more general sense, \"Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation.\" To that end, Blake \"manipulates the syncretic mythology of Jacob Bryant, Paul Henri Mallet, and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions.\"\n\nIn relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, \"a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon.\" Similarly, Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi state that they \"contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art.\" W.H. Stevenson calls them \"a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life.\" As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of \"No Natural Religion\", in \"Milton a Poem\" (1804–1810), he writes \"This Natural Religion! this impossible absurdity\" (40:13), and in \"Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion\" (1804-1820), \"Natural Religion and Natural Philosophy are the Religion of the Pharisees who murdered Jesus\" (52: \"To the Deists\"). He also repeats the important phrase \"dull round\" in his 1809 \"Descriptive Catalogue\"; \"Historians pretend, who being weakly organized themselves, cannot see either miracle or prodigy; all is to them a dull round of probabilities and possibilities.\"\n\n\n"}

The Tiar in Bihar are found in the districts of Purnea, Bhagalpur, and Munger, and Hooghly, Howrah, North & South 24parganas in West Bengal and Jharkhand. A small number are also found in eastern Uttar Pradesh. According to some traditions, they are a sub-group of the Kewat community. \n\nThe Tiar have seven sub-divisions, the Rajbansi, Surajbansi, Polwar, Malhasuraiya, Kewat, Muriary and Bin. Among these clans, there is a sharp stratification and the Muriary and Bins are looked down upon. Like other Hindu communities, they maintain gotra exogamy. The Tiar are now landless, and most are agricultural labourers. They are Hindu, but have their own tribal deity Raja Bhim Sen Salis. The Tiar speak Bhojpuri and most now understand Hindi.\n\nThe Tiar in Uttar Pradesh are confined to the Ballia Division, although at one time they extended as far west as Sultanpur District. They were said to the rulers of this region until they were overthrown by the Bachgoti Rajputs. The Tiar are now mainly small cultivators, and speak the Awadhi dialect.\n\n"}

Like their neighbors to the north and south, the artistic traditions of the peoples of central New Ireland formerly focused largely around mortuary rites. In contrast to the intricate \"malagan\" carvings of the north, artists in central New Ireland produced less ornate but more permanent figures known as \"uli\", which were kept and reused many times. No longer made today, uli were displayed as part of lengthy fertility rites involving the exhumation and reburial of human skulls, which accompanied the planting of sacred plants. \n\nWhen a newly carved uli was brought out, a shaman assisted in inducing the spirit of the deceased chief to enter the carving, and after the ceremony, the work was kept in the \"men's house\" where it would continue to aid the successor and his people.\n\nUli figures appear hermaphroditic, having both a phallus and prominent breasts. This blending of male and female features possibly symbolized the fertile and nourishing powers of clan leaders, who were expected to provide for the other members of the clan. The Uli figures probably symbolized the connection between paternal and maternal life energy in initiation ceremonies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4082326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4082326", "title": "Vengi", "text": "Vengi\n\nThe Vengi (or Venginadu) is a region spread over the mandals of Godavari and Krishna districts. The capital city of Vengi is located at Pedavegi near Eluru. This area was part of Kalinga until that kingdom was conquered by Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire in the mid-3rd century BC. After the Mauryan Empire collapsed in 185 BC, the region was dominated by the Satavahanas, who were succeeded in Vengi by the Andhra Ikshvakus. Around 300 AD, the Andhra Ikshvakus were replaced by the Salankayanas, who were vassals of the Pallavas of Southern India. In the late 5th century, the Salankayanas were annexed by the Vishnukundinas.\n\nKing Pulakesin II of the Chalukya conquered Vengi from the Vishnukundinas in the early 7th century and installed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as the viceroy. He eventually established the Eastern Chalukya dynasty. The Eastern Chalukyas were first conquered by the Cholas under Raja Raja Chola I (985–1014) and subsequently became very closely aligned to the Chola empire through marital alliance between the Cholas and the Eastern Chalukyas. This insulated the Eastern Chalukyas from the interference of the Western Chalukyas who sought to make the Eastern Chalukyas as their subordinates. During the reign of the Kulothunga Chola I the Vengi kingdom got absorbed into the Chola empire.\n\nThe Vengi territory was part of Ashoka's empire and Satavahanas were the Mauryan feudatories administering the area. Following Ashoka's death and the decline of the Mauryas, Satavahana Simuka established the Satavahana dynasty, which came to include even the Magadha and Bengal at its height.The Satavahanas lasted for the next four hundred years after which the Pallavas and Eastern Chalukyas took control of the kingdom.\n\nThe Eastern Chalukyas of the 7th and 8th century, were a branch of the Chalukyas of Badami. Pulakesin II, the renowned ruler of Chalukyas conquered Vengi (at a battle near Eluru) in 624 from Vishnukundinas and installed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana (624- 641) as its ruler. His dynasty, known as the Eastern Chalukyas, ruled for a century. Vishnuvardhana extended his dominions up to Srikakulam in the north and Nellore in the south. They had faced many wars for the next three centuries from Rashtrakutas and others. The Western Chalukya king Satyashraya tried to amalgamate the two dynasties, but was not successful due to the constant battles with the Paramaras and the Cholas.\n\nTo counter the interference of the Western Chalukyas, Rajaraja supported Saktivarman I, an Eastern Chalukya prince who was in exile in the Chola country. He invaded Vengi in 999 to restore Saktivarman to the Eastern Chalukya throne. Saktivarman finally got his throne back in 1002 and consented to recognise the Rajaraja overlordship.\n\nVengi was part of kingdom of Later Cholas during the 12th century. The Western Chalukyas under the king Vikramaditya VI occupied Vengi in 1118, but the Cholas under Vikrama Chola regained Vengi from Chalukya monarch Someshvara III in 1126–27 with the help of the Velanati Chodas of Tsandavolu.\n\nBetween 1135 and 1206, several other minor kingdoms ruled over parts of Andhra Pradesh accepting the authority of the Velanati Cholas. By 1208, Vengi was part of Kakatiya Empire and later became part of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century.\n\nVengi has occupied a prominent place in the history of Andhra Pradesh since the time of Eastern Chalukyas. They patronised Telugu. Since the time of the Eastern Chalukya Gunaga Vijayaditya, inscriptions show Telugu prose and poetry, culminating in the production of literary works. Later on, in the 11th century under the patronage of the then Vengi king, Rajaraja Narendra, the great epic, \"Mahabharata\" was translated partly by his court poet, Nannaya.\n\n"}
