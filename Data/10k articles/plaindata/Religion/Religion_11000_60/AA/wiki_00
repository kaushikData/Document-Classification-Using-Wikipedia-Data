Owing to the close connection between Church and State under the early Christian emperors and the absence of canons concerning many matters of mixed jurisdiction, the principal bishops found it necessary to maintain agents to look after their interests at the imperial court. Until the French Revolution, the prelates of France maintained similar agents at the royal court of St. Denis. (See Assembly of the French clergy.)\n\nIn modern times the agents of the Roman Congregations are employed by bishops or private persons to transact their affairs in the pontifical courts. Such an agency is undertaken temporarily or perpetually. The principal business of the agents is to urge the expedition of the cases of their patrons. They undertake both judicial and extrajudicial business. If it is a question of papal favors, such as dispensations or increased faculties, these agents prepare the proper supplications and call repeatedly on the officials of the proper congregation until an answer is obtained. They expend whatever money is necessary to pay for the legal documents or to advance in general the affairs of those who employ them.\n\nThe agents have a recognized position in the Roman Curia, and rank next in dignity before the apostolic notaries. The money they expend and the pay they receive depend entirely on the will of their employers.\n\nSome authors include under this name the solicitors and apostolic expeditors of the Roman Curia, whose business it is to assist the procurators in the mechanical details of the preparation of cases for the congregational tribunals. Usually, however, these functionaries are considered as distinct from agents and as outranking them in dignity.\n"}

{"id": "49386101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49386101", "title": "Baodingshan", "text": "Baodingshan\n\nBaodingshan [Ch. 宝顶山／ 寶頂山 also known as Mount Baoding, Precious Summit Mountain, and Summit of Treasures] is a Buddhist site in Chongqing. The site is located on a limestone outcropping at an elevation of 500 meters, fifteen kilometers north of the city of Dazu, a market town that dates to 758 CE and the city is ringed by religious sites dating from 892 to 1249 CE. Primary construction at Baodingshan took place during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279 CE) but it remained largely unknown to the outside world until its reopening to the public in the 1980s, the earliest documented research on the site dating to 1944. The site has since been designated a World Heritage Site since 1999, falling within the collective grouping of Dazu Rock Carvings, a reference to the district in which Baodingshan is located. Dazu County covers 1400 square kilometers northwest of Chongqing on the road to Chengdu. During the Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE), this area of the Chengdu plain was considered one of the wealthiest regions in China.\n\nConsisting of a mile and a half of carvings, numbering over 6000 total, Baodingshan is an atypical Chinese Buddhist site for a variety of reasons: it includes both large scale iconic works as well as intricate narrative tableaux; it represents a variety of Buddhist schools of thought – Huayan, Chan, Pure Land, and Esoteric; it has copious amounts of Buddhist texts carved in conjunction with imagery; and it was constructed within 70 years under the supervision of one man, Zhao Zhifeng (赵智风). Baodingshan consists of two main parts joined by a temple, Shengshousi [Sagacious Longevity Temple 圣手寺／ 聖壽寺]. Best known to the outside world is Great Buddha Bend [Dafowan大佛弯／大佛彎] due to its impressive collection of 31 tableaux featuring imagery such as the parinirvana of the historical Buddha, the hells scenes, the Peacock Queen and numerous other narrative tableaux, the most widely reproduced being the Taming the Wild Ox. Great Buddha Bend also claims some of the biggest Chinese versions of certain Buddhist works – in particular the Hell tableau and the 1000-Armed 1000-Eyed Avalokitesvara or Guanyin figure. This area of Baodingshan follows the natural contours of the landscape, a rocky semi-circle formed by the nearby river. At Great Buddha Bend, the carved works flow from one tableau into another—large, deeply cut reliefs reaching dimensions as great as 26 feet high by 66 feet wide. Visitors encounter an uninterrupted series of carvings totaling 30 connected tableaux punctuated by two caves, giving the illusion of a handscroll. Several authors have even likened Baodingshan’s Great Buddha Bend to “an illustrated storybook.\" The most obvious difference between Great Buddha Bend and other Chinese cave sites is the lack of caves, or even cave-like niches, in which the statues would normally be positioned. Caves at Buddhist sites such as Dunhuang and Yungang were seen as a necessary part of the religious process. They were places where the worshipper entered into a “Buddha-world” and performed rites of circumambulation or made offerings to an icon.\n\nThe other area of Baodingshan is Little Buddha Bend [Xiaofowan 小佛弯／小佛彎], a smaller area situated above and behind the temple where some scholars have argued initiation rituals were carried out. It is within Little Buddha Bend that one finds the Founder’s Pagoda, a carved work on which is seen images of the Tang dynasty local layman Master Liu – famous for his ten austerities that are depicted at Baodingshan as well as at other sites in Sichuan - as well as an image of Zhao Zhifeng, the monk credited with Baodingshan’s creation. Equally important is the inclusion of a carved Buddhist scriptural catalogue on the lower levels of the pagoda, with some scholars noting that the catalogue’s presence points to perhaps a different function for the text seen at the site as a whole. Other areas of Baodingshan include the Vimalakirti Hall, situated at the pinnacle of the summit, and the Longevity Pavilion located just above the Oxherding sequence of texts and images in Great Buddha Bend.\n\nBaodingshan has seen considerable growth in the last decade, with a new highway being built to Dazu from Chongqing to speed up access and new buildings and roads being constructed at Baodingshan itself. Scholarship on the site has also increased, from only minimal treatment of the site by Chinese scholars in the form of archaeological assessment being done up until the 1980s to volumes of essays being published annually. Early Western language work by H. Sorensen, A. Howard and K. Kucera has since been augmented by increasing interest among foreign scholars brought on by Baodingshan’s movement onto the global stage and its subsequent acquisition of World Heritage status. The Dazu Academy of Rock Carvings now holds an international conference every five years to commemorate that landmark bringing together scholars from all over the world, the last of which was held in fall 2014.\n"}
{"id": "2078272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2078272", "title": "Brihadaranyaka Upanishad", "text": "Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (, ) is one of the Principal Upanishads and one of the oldest Upanishadic scriptures of Hinduism. A key scripture to various schools of Hinduism, the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanisad\" is tenth in the Muktikā or \"canon of 108 Upanishads\".\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is estimated to have been composed about 700 BCE, excluding some parts estimated to have been composed after the \"Chandogya Upanishad\". The Sanskrit language text is contained within the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\", which is itself a part of the Shukla Yajur Veda.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is a treatise on Ātman (Soul, Self), includes passages on metaphysics, ethics and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars, and attracted secondary works such as those by Madhvacharya and Adi Shankara.\n\nThe chronology of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", like other Upanishads, is uncertain and contested. The chronology is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Patrick Olivelle states, \"in spite of claims made by some, in reality, any dating of these documents (early Upanishads) that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards\".\n\nThe chronology and authorship of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", along with \"Chandogya\" and \"Kaushitaki Upanishads\", is further complicated because they are compiled anthologies of literature that must have existed as independent texts before they became part of these Upanishads.\n\nThe exact year, and even the century of the Upanishad composition is unknown. Scholars have offered different estimates ranging from 900 BCE to 600 BCE, all preceding Buddhism. \"Brihadaranyaka\" is one of the oldest Upanishads, along with that of \"Jaiminiya Upanishad\" and \"Chandogya Upanishads\". The \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" was in all likelihood composed in the earlier part of 1st millennium BCE, around 700 BCE, give or take a century or so, according to Patrick Olivelle. It is likely that the text was a living document and some verses were edited over a period of time before the 6th century BCE.\n\nThe title \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" literally means \"great wilderness or forest Upaniṣhad\". It is credited to ancient sage Yajnavalkya, but likely refined by a number of ancient Vedic scholars. The Upanishad forms the last part, that is the fourteenth \"kānda\" of \"Śatapatha Brāhmana\" of \"Śhukla Yajurveda\". The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has six \"adhyayas\" (chapters) in total. There are two major recensions for the text - the Madhyandina and the Kanva recensions. It includes three sections: \"Madhu kānda\" (the 4th and 5th chapter of the fourteenth \"kānda\" of Satapatha Brahmana), \"Muni kānda\" (or \"Yajnavalkya Kanda\", the 6th and 7th chapter of 14th \"kānda\" of Satapatha Brahmana) and \"Khila kānda\" (the 8th and 9th chapter of the fourteenth \"kānda\" of Satapatha Brahmana).\n\nThe first and second chapters of the Upanishad's \"Madhu kānda\" consists of six brahmanams each, with varying number of hymns per brahmanam. The first chapter of the Upanishad's \"Yajnavalkya kānda\" consists of nine brahmanams, while the second has six brahmanams. The \"Khila kānda\" of the Upanishad has fifteen brahmanams in its first chapter, and five brahmanams in the second chapter.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" starts by stating one of many Vedic theories of creation of the universe. It asserts that there was nothing before the universe started, then Prajapati created from this nothing the universe as a sacrifice to himself, imbued it with \"Prana\" (life force) to preserve it in the form of cosmic inert matter and individual psychic energy. The world is more than matter and energy, asserts Brihadaranyaka, it is constituted also of Atman or Brahman (Soul, Self, Consciousness, Invisible Principles and Reality) as well as Knowledge.\n\nThe Brahmana 4 in the first chapter, announces the Upanishad's non-dual, monistic metaphysical premise that Atman and Brahman are identical Oneness, with the assertion that because the universe came out of nothingness when the only principle existent was \"I am he\", the universe after it came into existence continues as \"Aham brahma asmi\" (I am Brahman). In the last brahmana of the first chapter, the Upanishad explains that the Atman (soul) inspires by being self-evident (name identity), through empowering forms, and through action (work of a living being). The Soul, states Brihadaranyaka, is the imperishable one that is invisible and concealed pervading all reality.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" starts the second chapter as a conversation between Ajatashatru and \"Balaki Gargya\" on theory of dreams, positing that human beings see dreams entirely unto themselves because mind draws, in itself, the powers of sensory organs, which it releases in the waking state. It then asserts that this empirical fact about dreams suggests that human mind has the power to perceive the world as it is, as well as fabricate the world as it wants to perceive it. Mind is a means, prone to flaws. The struggle man faces, asserts Brihadaranyaka in brahmana 3, is in his attempt to realize the \"true reality behind perceived reality\". That is Atman-Brahman, inherently and blissfully existent, yet unknowable because it has no qualities, no characteristics, it is \"neti, neti\" (literally, \"not that, not that\").\n\nIn fourth brahmana, the Upanishad presents a dialogue between a husband and wife, as Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, on nature of love and spirituality, whether and how is Atman related to deep connection and bonds between human beings. Yajnavalkya states that one doesn't connect with and love forms, nor does one connect or love mind, rather one connects with the Self, the Soul of one's own and one's beloved. All love is for the sake of one's Self, and the Oneness one realizes in the Self of the beloved. He then asserts that this knowledge of the Soul, the Self, the Brahman is what makes one immortal, the connection immortal. All longing is the longing for the Soul, because Soul is the true, the immortal, the real and the infinite bliss.\n\nThe fifth brahmana of the second chapter introduces the \"Madhu theory\", thus giving this section of the Upanishad the ancient name \"Madhu Khanda\". The \"Madhu theory\" is one of the foundational principles of Vedanta schools of Hinduism, as well as other āstika schools of Indian philosophies. \"Madhu\" literally means \"honey\", or the composite fruit of numerous actions on the field of flowers. In the \"Madhu theory\", notes Paul Deussen, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserts that \"Atman exists\" (soul exists), that all organic beings (plants, animals, human beings and gods) are wandering souls yet One with each other and the Brahman (Cosmic Soul); it further asserts that inorganic nature (fire, air, earth, water, space) is the field where the beings act, and where their numerous actions create fruits that they separately and together experience. The Upanishad then states that everything is connected, beings affect each other, organic beings affect the inorganic nature, inorganic nature affects the organic beings, one is the \"honey\" (result, fruit, food) of the other, everyone and everything is mutually dependent, nourishing and nurturing each other, all because it came from one Brahman, because it is all one Brahman, because all existence is blissful oneness. This theory appears in various early and middle Upanishads, and parallels Immanuel Kant's doctrine of \"the affinity of phenomena\" built on \"the synthetic unity of apperception\".\n\nThe last brahmanam of the Upanishad's first section is a \"Vamsa\" (generational line of teachers) with the names of 57 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the \"Madhu Khanda\" from one generation to the next.\n\nThe third chapter is a metaphysical dialogue between ten ancient sages, on the nature of Reality, Atman and Mukti. Paul Deussen calls the presentation of ancient scholar Yajnavalkya in this chapter \"not dissimilar to that of Socrates in the dialogues of Plato\". Among other things, the chapter presents the theory of perceived empirical knowledge using the concepts of \"graha and atigraha\" (sensory action and sense). It lists 8 combinations of graha and atigraha: breath and smell, speech and name (ideas), tongue and taste, eye and form, ear and sound, skin and touch, mind and desire, arms and work respectively. The sages debate the nature of death, asserts the third chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and whether any graha and atigraha prevails after one dies. They rule out six, then assert that one's ideas (name) and one's actions and work (karma) continues to affect the universe.\n\nThe fourth brahmana of the third chapter asserts, \"it is your soul which is inside all\", all souls are one, immanent and transcendent. The fifth brahmana states that profound knowledge requires that one give up showing off one's erudition, then adopt childlike curiosity and simplicity, followed by becoming silent, meditating and observant (\"muni\"), thus beginning the journey towards profound knowledge, understanding the soul of things where there is freedom from frustration and sorrow. In the sixth and eighth brahmana of the third chapter in Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad is the dialogue between Gargi Vachaknavi – the female Vedic sage, and Yajñavalka, on the nature of universe.\n\nThe seventh brahmana discusses how and why the soul interconnects and has the oneness through all organic beings, all inorganic nature, all of universe. It asserts that the soul is the inner controller of beings, conflated with the interaction of nature, psyche and senses, often without the knowledge of beings. It is the soul, nevertheless, that is the true and essence, states the Upanishad. The ninth brahmana, the longest of the third chapter, introduces the \"neti, neti\" principle that is discussed later, along with the analogical equivalence of physical features of a man and those of a tree, with the root of a man being his soul. The last hymns of chapter 3 in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad also attest to the prevalent practice of the renouncing ascetic life by the time Brihadaranyaka Upanishad was composed in Vedic age of India, and it is these ascetic circles that are credited for major movements such as Yoga as well as the śramaṇa traditions later to be called Buddhism, Jainism and heterodox Hinduism.\n\nThe fourth chapter of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" starts as a dialogue between King Janaka and Yajnavalka. It explores various aspects of the \"Soul exists\" theory, its phenomenal manifestations, and its philosophical implications on soteriology. The Upanishad, in the first brahmanam of fourth chapter, states that the soul manifests in human life in six forms: \"Prajna\" (consciousness), \"Priyam\" (love and the will to live), \"Satyam\" (reverence for truth, reality), \"Ananta\" (endlessness, curiosity for the eternal), \"Ananda\" (bliss, contentness), and \"Sthiti\" (the state of enduring steadfastness, calm perseverance).\n\nIn the second brahmanam, the Upanishad explores the question, \"what happens to soul after one dies?\", and provides the root of two themes that play central role in later schools of Hinduism: one, of the concept of soul as individual souls (dualism), and second of the concept of soul being One and Eternal neither comes nor goes anywhere, because it is everywhere and everyone in Oneness (non-dualism). This chapter discusses the widely cited \"neti, neti\" (नेति नेति, \"not this, not this\") principle towards one's journey to understanding soul. The second brahmanam concludes that soul exists is self-evident, soul is blissfully free, soul is eternally invulnerable, and soul is indescribable knowledge.\n\nThe hymn 4.2.4 of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is one of many instances in the ancient Sanskrit text where the characters involved in philosophical debate greet each other with Namaste (नमस्ते), a practice in the culture of India.\n\nThe third brahmanam of the fourth chapter discusses the premises of moksha (liberation, freedom, emancipation, self-realization), and provides some of the most studied hymns of Brihadaranyaka. Paul Deussen calls it, \"unique in its richness and warmth of presentation\", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times. Max Muller translates it as follows,\n\nThe fourth brahmanam continues to build the thematic description of Atman-Brahman (Self, Soul) and the state of self-realization as achieved. Yajnavalkya declares that Knowledge is Self, Knowledge is freedom, Knowledge powers inner peace. In hymn 4.4.22, the Upanishad states, \"He is that great unborn Self, who consists of Knowledge, is surrounded by the Prânas (life-force), the ether within the heart. In it [Soul] there reposes the ruler of all, the lord of all, the king of all. He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded. He who knows him [soul], becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world, mendicants leave their homes.\"\n\nMax Muller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad's view of \"Soul, Self\" and \"free, liberated state of existence\" as, \"[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman-Brâhmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yagnavalkya.\"\n\nThe last brahmanam of the Upanishad's second section is another \"Vamsa\" (generational line of teachers) with the names of 59 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the hymns of \"Muni Khanda\" from one generation to the next, before its became part of Brihadaranyaka.\n\nThe fifth and sixth chapters of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" are known as \"Khila Khanda\", which literally means \"supplementary section, or appendix\". Each brahmanam in the supplement is small except the fourteenth. This section, suggests Paul Deussen, was likely written later to clarify and add ideas considered important in that later age.\n\nSome brahmanams in the last section of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", such as the second and third brahmanam in fifth chapter, append ethical theories, while fourth brahmanam in the fifth chapter asserts that \"empirical reality and truth is Brahman\". In the fourth brahmanam of sixth chapter, sexual rituals between a husband and wife are described to conceive and celebrate the birth of a child.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka text has been an important Upanishad to the Vedanta scholars, and discusses many early concepts and theories foundational to Hinduism such as Karma, Atman and others.\n\nOne of the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\". For example:\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" includes hymns on virtues and ethics. In verse 5.2.3, for example, it recommends three virtues: self-restraint (दमः, Damah), charity (दानं, Daanam), and compassion for all life (दया, Daya).\n\nThe first ethical precept of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" became the foundation of Yamas in various schools of Hinduism. In Yoga school, for example, the yamas as listed by Patañjali in Yogasūtra 2.30 are:\n\n\nThe verses in the Upanishad contain theories pertaining to psychology and human motivations. Verse 1.4.17 describes the desire for progeny as the desire to be born again. The Upanishad states a behavioral theory, linking action to nature, suggesting that behavioral habits makes a man,\n\n<poem>\nAccording as one acts, so does he become.\nOne becomes virtuous by virtuous action,\nbad by bad action.\n— Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5\n</poem>\n\nAncient and medieval Indian scholars have referred to \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" as a foundation to discuss psychological theories, the nature of psyche, and how body, mind and soul interact. For example, Adi Shankara in his commentary on the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" explains the relation between consciousness, the mind and the body.\n\nMind creates desire, asserts \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", with its basis in pleasure. Eye is the cause of material wealth, because it is through sight that wealth is created states the Upanishad, while ears are spiritual wealth, because it is through listening that knowledge is shared. The Upanishad suggests in the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, husband and wife, that one does not love an object for the sake of the object but for the sake of the subject, the Self (the soul of the other person).\n\nVerse 1.3.28 acknowledges that metaphysical statements in Upanishads are meant to guide the reader from unreality to reality. The metaphysics of \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" is non-dualism (Advaita). For instance, in verse 2.4.13 Yajnavalkya asserts that everything in the universe is the Self. The nature of reality or Self is described as consciousness-bliss in verse 3.9.28. Neti-neti or (not this—not this) is a method of emphasizing the discovery of the right, by excluding the wrong. The verse 5.1 states that the Universe, Reality and Consciousness is infinite.\n\n\"From infinite or fullness, we can get only fullness or infinite\". The above verse describes the nature of the Absolute or Brahman which is infinite or full, i.e., it contains everything. Upanishadic metaphysics is further elucidated in the Madhu-vidya (honey doctrine), where the essence of every object is described to be same to the essence of every other object. The \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" looks at reality as being indescribable and its nature to be infinite and consciousness-bliss. The cosmic energy is thought to integrate in the microcosm and in the macrocosm integrate the individual to the universe.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has attracted secondary literature and commentaries (\"bhasya\") from many scholars. In these secondary texts, the same passages have been interpreted in different ways by the various sub-schools of Vedanta such as nondualistic Advaita (monism), dualistic Dvaita (theism) and qualified nondualistic Vishistadvaita.\n\nThe Pavamana Mantra is from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (1.3.28)\n\nTranslation:\n\n\nPoet T. S. Eliot makes use of the story \"The Voice of the Thunder\" and for the source of \"\"datta\", \"dayadhvam\", and \"damyata\"\" found in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\".

{"id": "5410420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5410420", "title": "Cartulary", "text": "Cartulary\n\nA cartulary or chartulary (; Latin: \"cartularium\" or \"chartularium\"), also called \"pancarta\" or \"codex diplomaticus\", is a medieval manuscript volume or roll (\"rotulus\") containing transcriptions of original documents relating to the foundation, privileges, and legal rights of ecclesiastical establishments, municipal corporations, industrial associations, institutions of learning, or families. The term is sometimes also applied to collections of original documents bound in one volume or attached to one another so as to form a roll, as well as to custodians of such collections.\n\nMichael Clanchy defines a cartulary as \"a collection of title deeds copied into a register for greater security\".\n\nA cartulary may take the form of a book or a \"codex\". Documents, chronicles or other kinds of handwritten texts were compiled, transcribed or copied into the cartulary.\n\nIn the introduction to the book \"Les Cartulaires\", it is argued that in the contemporary diplomatic world it was common to provide a strict definition as the organized, selective, or exhaustive transcription of diplomatic records, made by the owner of them or by the producer of the archive where the documents are preserved.\n\nIn the \"Dictionary of Archival Terminology\" a cartulary is defined as \"a register, usually in volume form, of copies of charters, title deeds, grants of privileges and other documents of significance belonging to a person, family or institution\". In 1938, the French historian, Emile Lesne, wrote: \"Every Cartulary is the testimony of the statement of the Archives in a Church at the time when it was compiled\".\n\nRelated terms in other languages are: \"cartularium\" (Latin); \"Kopiar\", \"Kopialbuch\" (German), \"Chartular\" (Oes.); \"cartolario, cartulario, cartario\" (Italian); \"cartulario\" (Spanish).\n\nIn medieval Normandy, a type of cartulary was common from the early 11th century that combined a record of gifts to the monastery with a short narrative. These works are known as \"pancartes\".\n\nThe allusion of Gregory of Tours to \"chartarum tomi\" in the 6th century is commonly taken to refer to cartularies. The oldest surviving cartularies, however, originated in the 10th century. Those from the 10th to the 13th centuries are very numerous.\n\nCartularies frequently contain historical texts, known as cartulary chronicles, which may focus on the history of the monastery whose legal documents it accompanies, or may be a more general history of the world. This link between legal and historical writings has to be understood in the context of the importance of past events for establishing legal precedence. \nGenerally speaking, a cartulary attested by the signatures or marks of a number of prominent individuals ranks as a public document possessing greater value than a private letter or the narrative of an annalist.\nSometimes the copyist of the cartulary reproduced the original documents with literal exactness. On the other hand, some copyists took liberties with the text, including modifying the phraseology, modernizing proper names of persons and places, and even changing the substance, so as to extend the scope of the privileges or immunities granted in the document. The value of a cartulary as a historical document depends not only on how faithfully it reproduces the substance of the original, but also, if edited, on the clues it contains to the motivation for those changes. These questions are generally the subject of scrutiny under well-known canons of historical criticism.\n\nMany cartularies of medieval monasteries and churches have been published, more or less completely. A listing of all known medieval cartularies of the British Isles, edited by Godfrey Davis, was published in 1958, and republished in a heavily revised and extended edition in 2010: the revised edition contains entries for about 2,000 cartularies, including those of both ecclesiastical establishments and secular corporations, dating from the 11th to 16th centuries, with details of dates, provenance, current location, and (where appropriate) publication. The \"Catalogue général des cartulaires des archives départementales\" (Paris, 1847) and the \"Inventaire des cartulaires\" etc. (Paris, 1878–9) were the chief sources of information regarding the cartularies of medieval France. There may be more recent developments in cataloguing.\n\n\nThe late Roman/Byzantine \"chartoularios\" was an administrative and fiscal official. In the Greek Orthodox Church, the corresponding position was called \"chartophylax\". This title was also given to an ancient officer in the Roman Church, who had the care of charters and papers relating to public affairs. The chartulary presided in ecclesiastical judgments, in lieu of the Pope.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58845825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58845825", "title": "Ceremonies of ancient Greece", "text": "Ceremonies of ancient Greece\n\nCeremonies of Ancient Greece encompasses those practices of a formal religious nature celebrating particular moments in the life of the community or individual in Greece from the period of the Greek dark ages (c. 1000 B.C) to the middle ages (c. 500 A.D). Ancient Greek religion was not standardised and had no formalised canon of religious texts, nor single priestly hierarchy, and practices varied greatly. However, ceremonial life in pre-Christian Greece generally involved offerings of a variety of forms towards gods and heroes, as well as a plethora of public celebrations such as weddings, burial rites, and festivals. \n\nA libation is an offering involving the ritual pouring out of a liquid. In ancient Greece, such libations most commonly consisted of watered down wine, but also sometimes of pure wine, honey, olive oil, water or milk. It was a basic aspect of religion in ancient Greece, and possibly the most common religious practice. It was common to perform libations at the beginning and end of every day, and also at the beginning of meals, and was customarily paired with prayer to the gods, which was performed while standing upright and sometimes with their arms raised up. \n\nLibation commonly involved the pouring of wine from a handheld vessel. It was common to pour the substance from a wine jug into a bowl known as a phiale. Then, a part of the substance was poured from the phiale as an offering and the remainder is consumed. This ritual was repeated whenever wine was served. It was typical for libations from each bowl to be dedicated for a specific purpose. During a symposium, it was customary to serve three successive bowls of wine, where libations from the first bowl were usually dedicated either to the Olympians or to Agathos Daimon, libations from the second were usually dedicated to the heroes of Greek myth and libations from the third bowl were dedicated either to Zeus Teleios or to Hermes. Individuals could also make additional dedications to gods of their own choosing. \n\nIt was common to also to perform libation as a part of animal sacrifices, where wine was poured onto the animal during the leadup to its sacrifice. Also, once the animal had been killed and burned, wine was poured onto the fire. \n\nLibations were also poured into the dirt, as a ritual to honour both the humans and gods who reside in the underworld. The \"Odyssey\" explains one such offering, where a hole is dug by Odysseus in the earth, and water, honey and wine are spilled around it. Such libations could also be performed by tipping over a large vessel containing the substance to be offered. Libations would include blood in order to honour heroes who participated in war, while offerings at tombs would more commonly have involved milk or honey. \n\nA key aspect of ceremonial life involved the sacrificing of domestic animals. This was performed at an altar usually located outside of temples. Animal sacrifices were also accompanied with singing and with prayer. The animal was chosen, and should be of good stock and in good health, and bulls were preferred over other animals, though sacrifices could involve cows, sheep, goats, pigs and birds, however sheep were the most common animal that was sacrificed. The animal was adorned with garlands and led by a girl towards the altar. This girl concealed the sacrificial knife in a basket that she held over her head. Libations would also be poured over the animal. Various hymns were sung and prayers said as the animal was killed, and once the animal is slain, women were supposed to cry out loudly. The animal was butchered and its components were used for different purposes. The hide was usually bequeathed to the temple to sell, while the blood was poured over the altar. The meat is prepared to be consumed by the celebrants while all the remaining inedible parts are gathered together and burned as an offering to the gods. Libations might also be poured on the fire at this time. When honouring the gods of the underworld however, animal sacrifices were quite different, and the whole of the animal was burned as in a holocaust. \n\nAnimal sacrifices were practised at feasts in relation to the slaughtering of animals and the consumption of their meat. However, animal sacrifices were also used in order to win the favour of the gods, and so were used in times of disaster or before setting out upon some important mission, such as a military conflict. \n\nPharmakos refers to the ritualistic sacrifice of a human scapegoat. This practice was used especially during times of disaster in order to appease the gods and to purify the community. However, it was also practised on a regular basis, such as on the first day of the Thargelia in Athens. Hipponax of Kolophon describes this process, where the two ugliest men that can be found were chosen to be sacrificed. Then, at the start of the Thargelia, the men were paraded around wearing fig-necklaces and beaten in the genitals using sticks from fig-trees. They were led to the seashore, where they were to be sacrificed, and killed by being stoned to death, then the corpses were burned and the ashes either cast into the sea or scattered onto the fields. Yet, there has been some contention about how reliable Hipponax's account was, especially given the time between when the ritual was performed and when Hipponax wrote.\n\nOver time, this sacrificial ritual changed to a less severe form of atonement for a criminal act. So at sites like Lefkada, criminals would sometimes be taken to be cast down from a cliff side, but he would be watched and caught underneath by men in boats, and his descent would be slowed by attaching birds or feathers to him. This reflected a distinctly non-lethal form of the scapegoat ritual which some scholars have used to support the idea that the pharmakos ceremony was never practised as an execution, and even in its earlier form, only involved stoning and severe beatings, but never to the point of death.\nThere were smaller rituals that would be performed before the wedding itself, such as a bath of purification, offerings and sacrifices made at the temple and a prenuptial feast. Among the different city-states of Ancient Greece, it was most common to perform the wedding ceremony after dusk. And at that time, the bride would be escorted by her family on the back of a chariot as it moved slowly toward the groom's house. This process of the bride leaving her father's house and joining her husband's was signified by the removal of the bride's veil. Another important ritual in the wedding ceremony was the offering up of an apple by the groom's family to be consumed by the bride. The wedding ceremony was formalised by the bride moving in to her husband's house as well as by the bride's father giving a dowry to the groom. \n\nMarriage ceremonies in Sparta differed greatly from the rest of the Greek city-states. Unlike in the rest of Greece, Spartan women had to consent for the marriage to be valid and not just her parents. The ceremony itself was also quite simple and short and would involve the bride and the groom engaging in hand-to-hand combat until the groom is able to overpower his bride and carry her back to his home. After the ceremony was complete, like in the other city-states, the families of the couple would celebrate over a feast.\n\nPrior to a person’s death, they would make arrangements for the care of their families and property, to say their final farewells and to pray. After the person had died, the body was washed and anointed with oil and often a wreath would be put around the deceased person’s neck. Then, coins would be put on the person’s eyes, it was believed that this would allow the individual to pay Charon, the ferryman of the dead, to transport them across the river Styx into the afterlife. In some cases, an amulet would be put on the mouth instead, while in some mystery cults, they would use a golden ornament, sometimes known as a ‘passport of the dead,’ which carried important information for helping the deceased to find their way around in the underworld. \n\nThe following day, the body was laid out for display. At this time, close female relatives of the deceased would lead the mourning by wailing loudly, hitting themselves and ripping their clothes and hair. Early the following day, usually before sunrise, the body would be led in a procession to where it would be laid to rest. And at this point, mourners would cut off a piece of their hair and offer it alongside libations to the deceased. Sometimes blood offerings were made also. Prayers were an important part of the burial process following the offerings. After the burial itself, the deceased person’s property would be cleansed with spiced saltwater, usually by their closest kinswomen and a feast would take place to honor all of the participants of the burial. And even after a person had been buried, it was important to continue to offer libations and cuttings of hair, as well as to regularly celebrate both recently deceased ancestors and the whole host of the dead at major ceremonies like the Genesia.\n\nHowever, funeral rites did vary both throughout the history of Ancient Greece as well as between the different city-states. For example, cremation was a common practice within the city-state of Athens.\nMystery cults were a special aspect of religion in Ancient Greece, so named for the great level of secrecy associated with them. Unlike the rest of religious life in Ancient Greece, the rituals, practices and knowledge of mystery cults were only available to those people who had been initiated into them, known as \"Mystai\" and so to this day, not much is known about the mystery cults of Ancient Greece. Some of the major schools included the Eleusinian mysteries, the Dionysian mysteries and the Orphic mysteries.\n\nTwice each year, initiates of the Eleusinian mysteries travelled to Eleusis from Athens along the sacred way, once in the spring for the Lesser Mysteries and then again around September for the Greater Mysteries. During the journey, celebrants would re-enact Demeter's search for her daughter Kore. Then the initiates stopped by a well, just as Demeter had, where they fasted and consumed a beverage made from mint and barley, which may have contained hallucinogenic properties. After they had consumed the drink, the initiates would enter the underground theater, known as the Telesterion, where the Mysteries actually took place. This stage may have consisted of a ritual re-enactment of the story of Demeter and Kore, and Kore's death and transformation into the figure of Persephone, with which the whole of the Eleusinian Mysteries is concerned. Many accounts and references to the Eleusinian mysteries describe them as having a profoundly powerful effect on the participants, and that many emerged from them without a fear of death.\n\nLess is known about the Dionysian mysteries than the Eleusian mysteries, but it seems to share the same theme of seasonal death and rebirth. Many of the ceremonies within the Dionysian mystery involve the idea of losing control of one's body, of returning to a more primal world and abandoning civilized society. Wine seems to have played a vital role to the Dionysian mysteries, but so did dancing and music, including the use of drums and bullroarers. A key aspect of the mysteries was the idea that by losing control of yourself in this way, the divine would come to inhabit your body.\n\n"}

{"id": "10496416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10496416", "title": "Contemporary Jewish religious music", "text": "Contemporary Jewish religious music\n\nFor the purposes of this article, “contemporary” refers to the period from 1967 (Israel’s Six-Day War) to the present day, “Jewish” refers to the various streams and traits of Judaism practiced. Many Orthodox Jews use the term “religious” to refer to a strict adherence to Jewish law. For the purposes of this article, “religious” refers to the content and context of the music itself: liturgical or implicit references to the divine.\n\nJewish ethnomusicologist Mark Kligman notes, “The scope of contemporary Jewish music encompasses a wide range of genres and styles, including music for the synagogue, folk and popular music on religious themes, Yiddish songs, klezmer music, Israeli music, and art music by serious composers. Every sector of the Jewish community – from the most right-wing Orthodox to the most secular – participates in the Jewish music endeavor, creating, performing, and listening to the particular music that meets its taste and needs.”\n\nThe question of what is Jewish music and what makes music Jewish continues to be explored in academic and artistic circles alike. It may be seen in the work of Velvel Pasternak, who has spent much of the late twentieth century as a preservationist committing what had been a strongly oral tradition to paper. Also, John Zorn's record label, Tzadik, features a \"Radical Jewish Culture\" series that focuses on exploring what contemporary Jewish music is and what it offers to contemporary Jewish culture.\n\nWithin the traditional Jewish community, cantoral and chasiddic melodies were the musical standard.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s recordings began to be made of noncantorial Jewish music, beginning with Benzion Shenker’s recording of the music of the Modzitz chassidic sect and Cantor David Werdyger's Gerrer recordings. The annual Israeli Hasidic Song Festival, first held in 1969, became a stage which saw the premières of pieces like Nurit Hirsh’s \"Oseh Shalom;\" Tzvika Pik’s \"Sh’ma Yisrael;\" and Shlomo Carlebach’s \"Od Yishama\" and \"V’ha’eir Eineinu.\"\n\nWith the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, American Jews showed increasing interest in Israeli music. This trend dramatically accelerated with the Six-Day War. “The practice of singing Israeli songs in American synagogues, camps, and at social gatherings, which spread in the 1950s, accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s as young American Jews looked to Israel as a positive model for Jewish identity, and the songs’ popularity also served as a Jewishly unifying factor.”\n\nAn additional influence was in the pronunciation of Hebrew both in worship and song. The Reform Movement, which previously had used Ashkenazic pronunciation of Hebrew (reflecting a German-Polish tradition), switched to Sephardic pronunciation (reflecting the way Israelis spoke).\n\nLargely influenced by the folk music revival of the time, in the 1960s and 1970s, a new genre of worship music grew out of the Reform summer camp movement. From almost the beginning of Reform worship, the music centered around the use of organ and choir. Rather than the paradigm of organ and choir, the new music was composed for acoustic guitar and group singing.” This new style focused on making the music \"simpler, thoroughly democratic in its singability, largely Hebrew, and playable on guitar.\"\n\nThis influence is also clear in the music of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. Carlebach gained fame for bridging between the folk world and the traditional Jewish Hasidic tunes.\n\nAt the same time as the folk revival made waves in Jewish worship, established composers like Gershon Kingsley and Ray Smolover utilized contemporary genres like jazz and rock in their compositions. As in the broader world, the influence of rock music was debated and still is in some circles. Influence of the rock world came to the Orthodox world with bands like the Diaspora Yeshiva Band, founded in 1975 by American-born student-musicians at the Diaspora Yeshiva in Jerusalem. The founding members were Avraham Rosenblum on guitar, Ben Zion Solomon on fiddle and banjo, Simcha Abramson on saxophone and clarinet, Ruby Harris on violin, mandolin, guitar, and harmonica, Adam Wexler on bass, and Gedalia Goldstein on drums; other student-musicians also played with the group between 1973 and 1986. The Diaspora Yeshiva Band infused rock and bluegrass with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called \"Hasidic rock\" or \"Country and Eastern\". The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at David's Tomb. It inspired later bands such as Blue Fringe, Even Sh'siyah, Reva l'sheva, Soulfarm, the Moshav Band, and Shlock Rock.\n\nPeriodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, with the reggae artist Matisyahu being the most recent example. The 2007 Grammy Awards were a landmark in Jewish music, as the Klezmatics (a klezmer/folk group) became the first Jewish band to win a Grammy. Their music combines lyrics by Woody Guthrie, the famous American lyricist, with classical klezmer tunes.\n\n\nIn recent years, the time lag in style between the broad music world and its adoption by the Jewish music world had been decreasing. Many groups and singers have released albums with noticeable influences from contemporary pop, rock music, etc. This is partly a result of a new wave of young Jewish musicians arriving out of yeshivas and universities. Examples of this trend include The Chevra with clear pop-boy band overtones and dance moves and Blue Fringe with its extended jam sessions echoing Phish and the Dave Matthews Band. Other examples include acts such as Chaim Dovid or Shlomo Katz who echo Shlomo Carlebach's musical style.\n\nOne type of music that is very popular among Orthodox artists and their listeners usually consists of a formulaic mix including brass, horns and strings. These songs are often a joint effort by a composer and an arranger with the singer having little to no input. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students who perform in dress suits. Many have day jobs or are studying in kollel and sideline singing at Jewish weddings. Musical background and training varies from no formal training to very high levels (though rarely academic).\n\nLyrics are most commonly short passages in Hebrew from the Torah or the siddur, with the occasional passage from the Talmud. Sometimes songs with original lyrics compiled in English, Hebrew or Yiddish deal with central themes such as Jerusalem, the Holocaust, Jewish identity, and the Jewish diaspora.\n\nAs a solution to the Jewish law against men hearing women singing, Jewish boys choirs became popular in the 1970s. Among the more notable of these groups are Pirchei London, the Toronto Boys Choir, the Miami Boys Choir, and the Yeshiva Boys Choir. Currently the Miami Boys Choir led by Yerachmiel Begun is perhaps the most popular, with a number of albums amongst the top record sales in Orthodox Jewish circles. In addition, some female Orthodox musicians, including singers like Julia Blum, Kineret, and Ruthi Navon and groups such as Tofa'ah, Ashira, and Bulletproof Stockings, have found success performing for women only.\n\nIn addition to Matisyahu, some well-known Orthodox contemporary Jewish musicians include Yossi Green, Martin Davidson, and Abie Rotenberg; well-known producers and arrangers of this type of music are Yisroel Lamm, Ian Freitor, Daniel Kapler, Eli Leshinsky. Popular artists include Mordechai Ben David, Avraham Fried, Lipa Schmeltzer, Eli Gerstner, Shloime Dachs, Dedi Graucher, and Yaakov Shwekey.\n\nThe Reform Jewish summer camps continue to be a source of contemporary Jewish worship music, where artists like Craig Taubman, Dan Nichols, Rick Recht, Josh Nelson, Alan Goodis and others have shared their newest compositions with the latest generation of campers. Nichols and Recht are among the leading Jewish rock singers of the present day and remain extremely popular among Jewish summer campers. Sam Glaser, Sue Horowitz, Noam Katz, Beth Schafer, Julie Silver, Peri Smilow and others have contributed significantly to modern Reform Jewish music and have been included in \"Ruach\", the biennial music compilation produced by the Union for Reform Judaism.\n\nA large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally written in English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. Country Yossi, Abie Rotenberg, Uncle Moishy, and the producers of the 613 Torah Avenue series are examples of Orthodox Jewish musicians/entertainers whose music teach children Jewish traditions. Parallel performers exist in Israel with the lyric in Hebrew or Yiddish.\n\nIn the Reform and Conservative communities, there has been a body of contemporary children's music written in the last 20 years. Children's music tends to focus on teaching Jewish values and ethics, Hebrew alef-bet and vocabulary, and teaching about the holidays. Though well-known Jewish songwriters like Debbie Friedman and Craig Taubman have written many children's songs, there are some who focus almost exclusively on this genre, like Peter and Ellen Allard and Shira Kline.\n\n"}

It survives in a fragmentary state. The work concerns the rational use of spare time, whereby one can still actively aid humankind by engaging in wider questions about nature and the universe.\n\nNo absolute certainty about the date of writing is possible, but since the contents of the work parallel Seneca's own withdrawal into private life near the end of his life it is thought by a majority of critics to have been written around 62 AD or shortly after.\n\n\"Otio\" is from \"otium\", this literally translates as leisure, vacant time, freedom from business.\n\n\"De Otio\" survives only in fragmentary form. The manuscript text begins mid-sentence, and ends rather abruptly. In the \"Codex Ambrosianus\" (the main source for Seneca's essays) it is simply tacked onto the end of \"De Vita Beata\" suggesting a scribe missed a page or two. The title of the essay, \"De Otio\", is known from the table of contents. The addressee has been erased but appears to have been seven letters long and is assumed to have been Seneca's friend Serenus. \"De Otio\" is thus one of a trio of dialogues addressed to Serenus, which also includes \"De Constantia Sapientis\" and \"De Tranquillitate Animi\". Chronologically, it is thought to be the last of the three.\n\nSeneca understood the word \"otio\" to represent something more than absolute free-time. He understood it to mean leisure used in service to the community by intellectual activity:\n\nIn \"De Otio\" Seneca debates the appropriate life for a Stoic philosopher. Seneca reports the standard position of the school that wise people will engage in public affairs, unless something prevents them. Seneca lists some arguments against engaging in public life such as if the state is too corrupt, or if the wise person's influence is too limited, or if they are ill. Seneca then shows that private life (\"otium\") far from being a life of listless retirement can be active from a Stoic point of view. The wise person can choose to engage with the wider universe: by moving one's actions from the local to the cosmic perspective and engage with the fundamental questions of the universe, one can still aid all of humankind.\n\nThe superior position the sage (\"ho sophos\") inhabits of detachment from earthly (\"terena\") concerns, and an according freedom from possibile future events of detrimental nature, is a unifying theme of the dialogue.\n\n\n"}

The Divine Incantations Scripture sought to clarify the gods are, \"in a word, merely the officials of the celestial bureaucracy.\" The text was unique for the time in that it promised the aid of celestial \"ghost troops\" to those who upheld its teachings and acknowledged the dynamic obedience and simultaneous danger of various \"daemon kings\" that also existed in a fantastical version of the metaphysical world.

It was an important stop on the ancient Silk Road, and today serves as a major junction along the Karakoram Highway with road connections to China, Skardu, Chitral, Peshawar, and Islamabad.\n\nThe city's ancient name was \"Sargin\", later to be known as \"Gilit\", and it is still referred to as \"Gilit\" or \"Sargin-Gilit\" by local people. In the Burushaski language, it is named \"Geelt\" and in Wakhi and Khowar it is called \"Gilt\".\n\nBrogpas trace their settlement from Gilgit into the fertile villages of Ladakh through a rich corpus of hymns, songs, and folklore that have been passed down through generations. The Dards and Shinas appear in many of the old Pauranic lists of people who lived in the region, with the former also mentioned in Ptolemy's accounts of the region.\n\nGilgit was an important city on the Silk Road, along which Buddhism was spread from South Asia to the rest of Asia. It is considered as a Buddhism corridor from which many Chinese monks came to Kashmir to learn and preach Buddhism. Two famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Faxian and Xuanzang, traversed Gilgit according to their accounts.\n\nAccording to Chinese records, between the 600s and the 700s, the city was governed by a Buddhist dynasty referred to as \"Little Balur\" or \"Lesser Bolü\" (). They are believed to be the Patola Sahi dynasty mentioned in a Brahmi inscription, and are devout adherents of Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\nIn mid-600s, Gilgit came under Chinese suzerainty after the fall of Western Turkic Khaganate due to Tang military campaigns in the region. In late 600s CE, the rising Tibetan Empire wrestled control of the region from the Chinese. However, faced with growing influence of the Umayyad Caliphate and then the Abbasid Caliphate to the west, the Tibetans were forced to ally themselves with the Islamic caliphates. The region was then contested by Chinese and Tibetan forces, and their respective vassal states, until the mid-700s. Chinese record of the region last until late-700s at which time the Tang's western military campaign was weakened due to the An Lushan Rebellion.\n\nThe control of the region was left to the Tibetan Empire. They referred to the region as Bruzha, a toponym that is consistent with the ethnonym \"Burusho\" used today. Tibetan control of the region lasted until late-800s CE.\n\nThis corpus of manuscripts was discovered in 1931 in Gilgit, containing many Buddhist texts such as four sutras from the Buddhist canon, including the famous Lotus Sutra. The manuscripts were written on birch bark in the Buddhist form of Sanskrit in the Sharada script. They cover a wide range of themes such as iconometry, folk tales, philosophy, medicine and several related areas of life and general knowledge.\n\nThe Gilgit manuscripts\nare included in the UNESCO Memory of the World register. They are among the oldest manuscripts in the world, and the oldest manuscript collection surviving in Pakistan, having major significance in the areas of Buddhist studies and the evolution of Asian and Sanskrit literature. The manuscripts are believed to have been written in the 5th to 6th centuries AD, though some more manuscripts were discovered in the succeeding centuries, which were also classified as Gilgit manuscripts.\n\nAs of 6 October 2014, one source claims that the part of the collection deposited at the Sri Pratap Singh Museum in Srinagar was irrecoverably destroyed during the 2014 India–Pakistan floods.\n\nGilgit was ruled for centuries by the local Trakhàn Dynasty, which ended about 1810 with the death of Raja Abas, the last Trakhàn Raja. The rulers of Hunza and Nager also claim origin with the Trakhàn dynasty. They claim descent from a heroic Kayani Prince of Persia, \"Azur Jamshid\" (also known as \"Shamsher\"), who secretly married the daughter of the king \"Shri Badat\".\n\nShe conspired with him to overthrow her cannibal father. Sri Badat's faith is theorised as Hindu by some and Buddhist by others. However, considering the region's Buddhist heritage, with the most recent influence being Islam, the most likely preceding influence of the region is Buddhism.\n\nPrince Azur Jamshid succeeded in overthrowing King Badat who was known as the \"Adam Khor\" (literally \"man-eater\"), often demanding a child a day from his subjects, his demise is still celebrated to this very day by locals in traditional annual celebrations. In the beginning of the new year, where a Juniper procession walks along the river, in memory of chasing the cannibal king \"Sri Badat\" away.\n\nAzur Jamshid abdicated after 16 years of rule in favour of his wife \"Nur Bakht Khatùn\" until their son and heir \"Garg\", grew of age and assumed the title of Raja and ruled, for 55 years. The dynasty flourished under the name of the Kayani dynasty until 1421 when Raja Torra Khan assumed rulership. He ruled as a memorable king until 1475. He distinguished his family line from his stepbrother \"Shah Rais Khan\" (who fled to the king of Badakshan, and with whose help he gained Chitral from \"Raja Torra Khan\"), as the now-known dynastic name of Trakhàn. The descendants of \"Shah Rais Khan\" were known as the \"Ra'issiya Dynasty\".\n\nThe area had been a flourishing tract but prosperity was destroyed by warfare over the next fifty years, and by the great flood of 1841 in which the river Indus was blocked by a landslip below the Hatu Pir and the valley was turned into a lake. After the death of Abas, Sulaiman Shah, Raja of Yasin, conquered Gilgit. Then, Azad Khan the cheater, Raja of Punial, killed Sulaiman Shah, taking Gilgit; then Tahir Shah, Raja of Buroshall (Nagar), took Gilgit and killed Azad Khan.\n\nTair Shah's son Shah Sakandar inherited, only to be killed by Gohar Aman, Raja of Yasin of the Khushwakhte Dynasty when he took Gilgit. Then in 1842, Shah Sakandar's brother, Karim Khan, expelled Yasin rulers with the support of a Sikh army from Kashmir. The Sikh general, Nathu Shah, left garrison troops and Karim Khan ruled until Gilgit was ceded to Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846 by the Treaty of Amritsar, and Dogra troops replaced the Sikh in Gilgit.\n\nNathu Shah and Karim Khan both transferred their allegiance to Gulab Singh, continuing local administration. When Hunza attacked in 1848, both of them were killed. Gilgit fell to the Hunza and their Yasin and Punial allies but was soon reconquered by Gulab Singh's Dogra troops. With the support of Raja Gohar Aman, Gilgit's inhabitants drove their new rulers out in an uprising in 1852. Raja Gohar Aman then ruled Gilgit until his death in 1860, just before new Dogra forces from Ranbir Singh, son of Gulab Singh, captured the fort and town.\n\nIn the 1870s Chitral was threatened by Afghans, Maharaja Ranbir Singh was firm in protecting Chitral from Afghans, the Mehtar of Chitral asked for help. In 1876 Chitral accepted the authority of Jammu Clan and in reverse get the protection from the Dogras who have in the past took part in many victories over Afghans during the time of Gulab Singh Dogra.\n\nIn 1877, in order to guard against the advance of Russia, the British India Government, acting as the suzerain power of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, established the Gilgit Agency. The Agency was re-established under control of the British Resident in Jammu and Kashmir. It comprised the Gilgit Wazarat; the State of Hunza and Nagar; the Punial Jagir; the Governorships of Yasin, Kuh-Ghizr and Ishkoman, and Chilas.\n\nThe Tajiks of Xinjiang sometimes enslaved the Gilgiti and Kunjuti Hunza.\n\nIn 1935, the British India government demanded from the Jammu and Kashmir state to lease them Gilgit town plus most of the Gilgit Agency and the hill-states Hunza, Nagar, Yasin and Ishkoman for 60 years. The leased region was then treated as part of British India, administered by a Political Agent at Gilgit responsible to Delhi, first through the Resident in Jammu and Kashmir and later a British Agent in Peshawar.\n\nJammu and Kashmir State no longer kept troops in Gilgit and a mercenary force, the Gilgit Scouts, was recruited with British officers and paid for by Delhi. In April 1947, Delhi decided to formally retrocede the leased areas to Hari Singh’s Jammu and Kashmir State as of 15 August 1947. The transfer was to formally take place on 1 August. However, the Gilgit Scouts rebelled against this action, and under the guidance of Major WA 'Willie' Brown, ceded to the newly founded state of Pakistan.\n\nAbdullah Sahib was an Arain and belonged to Chimkor Sahib village of Ambala district Punjab, British India. Abdullah Sahib was the first Muslim governor of the Gilgit in British time period and was close associate of Maharaja Partap Singh.\n\nKhan Bahadur Kalay Khan, a Mohammed Zai Pathan, was the Governor of Gilgit Hunza and Kashmir before partition.\n\nOn 26 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, faced with a tribal invasion by Pakistan, signed the Instrument of Accession, joining India.\n\nGilgit's population did not favour the State's accession to India. The Muslims of the Frontier Districts Province (modern day Gilgit-Baltistan) had wanted to join Pakistan. Sensing their discontent, Major William Brown, the Maharaja's commander of the Gilgit Scouts, mutinied on 1 November 1947, overthrowing the Governor Ghansara Singh. The bloodless \"coup d'etat\" was planned by Brown to the last detail under the code name \"Datta Khel\", which was also joined by a rebellious section of the Jammu and Kashmir 6th Infantry under Mirza Hassan Khan. Brown ensured that the treasury was secured and minorities were protected. A provisional government (\"Aburi Hakoomat\") was established by the Gilgit locals with Raja Shah Rais Khan as the president and Mirza Hassan Khan as the commander-in-chief. However, Major Brown had already telegraphed Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan asking Pakistan to take over. The Pakistani political agent, Khan Mohammad Alam Khan, arrived on 16 November and took over the administration of Gilgit. Brown outmaneuvered the pro-Independence group and secured the approval of the mirs and rajas for accession to Pakistan. Browns's actions surprised the British Government.\n\nThe provisional government lasted 16 days. The provisional government lacked sway over the population. The Gilgit rebellion did not have civilian involvement and was solely the work of military leaders, not all of whom had been in favor of joining Pakistan, at least in the short term. Historian Ahmed Hasan Dani mentions that although there was lack of public participation in the rebellion, pro-Pakistan sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their anti-Kashmiri sentiments were also clear. According to various scholars, the people of Gilgit as well as those of Chilas, Koh Ghizr, Ishkoman, Yasin, Punial, Hunza and Nagar joined Pakistan by choice.\n\nAbout 100% of the population of Gilgit is Muslim, with 70% being Twelver Shia Muslims, 12% being Ismaili Shia Muslims and 18% being Sunni Muslims.\n\nGilgit is situated in a valley formed by the confluence of the Indus River, Hunza River and Gilgit River.\n\nGilgit experiences a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWk\"). Weather conditions for Gilgit are dominated by its geographical location, a valley in a mountainous area, southwest of Karakoram range. The prevalent season of Gilgit is winter, occupying the valley eight to nine months a year.\n\nGilgit lacks significant rainfall, averaging in annually, as monsoon breaks against the southern range of Himalayas. Irrigation for land cultivation is obtained from the rivers, abundant with melting snow water from higher altitudes.\n\nThe summer season is brief and hot. Strong sunshine occasionally raises temperaturs to , though it typically is cooler in the shade. As a result of this extremity in the weather, landslides and avalanches are frequent in the area.\nThe city of Gilgit constitutes a tehsil within Gilgit District.\n\nGilgit city is one of the two major hubs for all mountaineering expeditions in Gilgit-Baltistan. Almost all tourists headed for treks in Karakoram or Himalaya Ranges depart from Gilgit\n\nThere are several tourist attractions relatively close to Gilgit: Naltar Valley with Naltar Peak, Hunza Valley, Nagar Valley, Fairy Meadow in Raikot, Shigar town, Skardu Valley, Haramosh Valley in Karakoram Range, Bagrot Valley, Deosai National Park in Skardu, Astore Valley, Phunder village, Ghizer Valley, The Land Of Lakes, Yasin Valley, Thoi Valley, Kargah Valley and Nomal Valley.\n\nGilgit is served by the nearby Gilgit Airport, with direct flights to Islamabad.\n\nGilgit is located approximately from the Karakoram Highway (KKH). The roadway is being upgraded as part of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. The KKH connects Gilgit to Chilas, Dasu, Besham, Mansehra, Abbottabad and Islamabad in the south. Gilgit is connected to Karimabad (Hunza) and Sust in the north, with further connections to the Chinese cities of Tashkurgan, Upal and Kashgar in Xinjiang. Gilgit is also linked to Chitral in the west, and Skardu to the east. The road to Skardu will be upgraded to a 4-lane road at a cost of $475 million.\n\nTransport companies such as the Silk Route Transport Pvt, Masherbrum Transport Pvt and Northern Areas Transport Corporation (NATCO), offer passenger road transport between Islamabad, Gilgit, Sust, and Kashgar and Tashkurgan in China.\n\nThe Astore-Burzil Pass Road, linking Gilgit to Srinagar was closed in 1978.\nGilgit is not served by any rail connections. Long-term plans for the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor call for construction of the 682 kilometre long Khunjerab Railway, which is expected to be completed in 2030, that would also serve Gilgit.\n\n\nThe Media of Gilgit is evolving as Gilgit Baltistan becomes a separate province of Pakistan so it is an important to have a growing media in the city Gilgit. There are number of newspapers in Gilgit Baltistan Daily Mahasib, daily Domel, Daily Shamal, K2 etc.\n\nGilgit city has following healthcare facilities\n\n\n\n\n"}

The charitable branch of Daoyuan is known as the Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会 \"Hóngwànzìhuì\").\n\nGuiyidao was founded in 1916 in the Pin County of Shandong as a \"fuji\" group. It was led by Liu Shoji (劉紹基). The following year the association moved to the provincial capital Jinan where it interacted with the Tongshanshe, another Xiantiandao sect. Adopting the organisation structure and meditation techniques of the Tongshanshe, the Guiyi Daoyuan was created in 1921.\n\nThe association formally established itself in Beijing with the support of premier Xiong Xiling (1870-1937, premier in 1913-14) and the American Christian missionary Gilbert Reid, and between 1922 and 1928 it expanded throughout China. The Daoyuan also set up a nationwide charity organisation, the Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会 \"Hóngwànzìhuì\"), which was China's largest relief organisation during the Sino-Japanese War.\n\nThe Daoyuan had a separate organisational structure managed by and for women, which oversaw their religious activity, education and child care, both affirming traditional virtues and valorising women's public service. Western missionaries were fascinated by Daoyuan, which drew members among the Christians, given its inclusion and interpretation of Jesus' teaching.\n\nReports of Guiyidao-Red Swastika strength during the 1920s and 1930s seem to vary widely, with citations of 30,000 \"members\" in 1927 to 7–10 million \"followers\" in 1937.\n\nAfter an earthquake in Japan in 1923, a Guiyidao relief mission was sent there, leading to the creation of a Japanese branch of the sect and ties with Shinto sects given the strong resonance of their beliefs. The first president of Japanese Daoyuan was Deguchi Onisaburo (1871-1948), the cofounder of the Omoto (大本 \"Great Source\") Shinto sect.\n\nOther members included Ueshiba Morihei (1883-1969), founder of the Aikido style of martial arts; Okada Mokichi (1882-1955), who in 1955 founded the Church of World Messianity; Nakano Yonosuke (1887-1974), founder in 1949 of the Ananai sect of Omoto; and Goi Masahisa, founder of the White Light sect.\n\nSuppressed by the communist regime after 1949, Guiyidao has persisted as an underground religion in the People's Republic of China. Branches of the sect are present in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, and the United States of America. Since 1950, the Hong Kong Daoyuan has served as the world headquarters of Guiyidao outside of mainland China.\n\nThe Red Swastika Society is the philanthropic branch of Guiyi Daoyuan founded in 1922 by Qian Nengxun (錢能訓), Du Bingyin (杜秉寅) and Li Jiabai (李佳白). The establishment of the federation was set up in Beijing together with the organization's president Li JianChiu (李建秋) drawing on Western examples such as the Red Cross to build charitable institutions grounded in Chinese religion. The swastika (卍 \"wàn\"; \"infinity\", \"all\") in Chinese and other cultures is a symbol of the manifestation of God or its creation. \n\nRed Swastika's mission was a broad based effort of philanthropy and moral education. It ran poorhouses and soup kitchens, as well as modern hospitals and other relief works. It had an explicit international focus, extending relief efforts to Tokyo after earthquakes and also in response to natural disasters in the Soviet Union. In addition, it had offices in Paris, London, and Tokyo and professors of Esperanto within its membership.\n\nPerhaps the best reported event of its history was its role in the Nanking Massacre. The rampage of the occupying Japanese forces through the city left thousands of bodies in the streets, and the Red Swastika stepped in to assist in burials. Records of these activities from the Red Swastika have provided important primary resources for research into the scale of the atrocity and the location of mass graves.\n\nAlthough it was suppressed during the Maoist rule in mainland China, the Red Swastika continues today as a religious organization focused on charity. It has branches in areas of the Chinese diaspora, with headquarters in Taiwan. Besides charity work, the Red Swastika runs two schools in Hong Kong (Tuen Mun and Tai Po) and one in Singapore (Red Swastika School).\n\n\n\n"}

The amulet is a square copper object measuring approximately 5 cm on each side. Near one edge there is a small hole, presumably used for hanging it around the neck.\n\nThe inscription consists of some 143 runes, written \"boustrophedon\", supplemented by an engraving of a fish; the relevance of the fish to the text is unclear.\n\nThe inscription is one of the longest and best preserved for its time but it has proven hard to interpret. The \"official\" Rundata interpretation is:\n\nThere have been five other serious attempts to decipher the text. This article treats each in turn.\n\nBruce E. Nilsson was the first to offer an interpretation of the amulet. Ignoring what seem to be bind runes at the start of the inscription, he offered this transliteration:\n\nand the following translation into English:\n\nNilsson interprets: \"[T]he amulet is an invocation to the gods to protect Bove, especially while he is at sea.\" This he bases on the carving of the fish, the mention of the sea in the text and the place where the amulet was found.\n\nNilsson understands the mention of Thor and his hammer as a reference of the story of Thor's fishing; where he threw his hammer at the head of Jörmungandr, the Midgard serpent. Since Thor's hammer always returns to its thrower it might in this case be said that it 'fled from evil' and 'came from the sea'.\n\nNilsson does not attempt to solve the first few runic symbols of the inscription. He ventures a guess that they might conceal the name or cognomen of a god. The fish looks more promising to Nilsson. He suggests that it might contain coded runes. The fins of the fish can, according to him, be represented graphically as:\n\nThis might represent the runes 'nbh' in some order. Nilsson suggests that the meaning is based on the names of the runes; thus the amulet should give a björg from hagl and nauð or a \"deliverance\" from \"hail\" and \"need\". He adds that this is \"not at all certain\".\n\nUnfortunately Nilsson's interpretation is not treated critically by later authors.\n\nIvar Lindquist took some 30 years to ponder the amulet - and it shows. He offers a plethora of interpretations - all, however, within the same central theme. According to Lindquist the amulet contains a solemn prayer to the Earth Goddess, referred to as 'Erka', 'Fold' and 'Undirgoð' (:the god beneath) and her 'single son' Thor.\n\nTwo of Lindquist's suggested interpretations are:\nAlso:\nOn etymological grounds Lindquist reasons that Ámr is a demon of sickness.\n\nAccording to Westlund, Lindquist's attempts at deciphering the \"bind runes\" at the beginning of the inscription are misguided. In Westlund's opinion these are not complicated bind runes but elaborate forms of normal runes. To support his claim he compares the runes with an inscription found near Novgorod in 1983 and treated by the Russian runologist Elena Melnikova in 1987. This is material not available to Lindquist and Nilsson.\n\nWestlund reads the first runes as \"hiristikþirbirkbufi\" and takes them to mean (in standardized West Norse) \"Hér rísti ek þér björg Bófi.\" which would come out in English as \"Here I carve protection for you, Bófi.\" This is a major change from Lindquist's interpretation. Instead of Bófi being the carver talking about himself we have a separate carver that addresses Bófi in the inscription.\n\nWestlund goes on to refuse Lindquist's \"prayer to Earth\" in favor of a more magical interpretation. While he rejects Lindquist's interpretation of \"mefultihuþis\" (\"with Earth in mind\") and Nilsson's interpretation of \"samhuhafikam\" (\"that came from the sea\") he does not offer alternative explanations. On the whole he suggests that Lindquist read too much into the inscription and tries to go for a more \"mundane\" solution to the problem. His transliteration and translation of the whole inscription follow:\n\nx hiristik þi birk / bufi me fultihu / þis þe uis in bral / tilu fran bufa þor keti h / ans mi þem hamri samhu / hafikam fly fran iluit fe eki af bufa kuþ iu / unti hanum auk yfi han / um\nIn his conclusion Westlund rejects Lindquist's view of the amulet as a solemn heathen prayer. In his opinion the mention of Thor and 'the gods' reflect a post-conversion magical view of the heathen gods. He even goes as far as suggesting that the wearer of the amulet was probably a baptised Christian.\n\nIn 1992 Ottar Grønvik offered a new interpretation which is essentially an attempt to rehabilitate Lindquist's work. Lindquist's bind-runes are brought back into play.\n\nIn 2001 Jonna Louis-Jensen continued in the same vein as Grønvik with an interpretation involving a sickness demon named \"Ámr\". She offers the following normalized text and English translation.\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3164333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3164333", "title": "Legal responses to agunah", "text": "Legal responses to agunah\n\nLegal responses to agunah are civil legal remedies against a spouse who refuses to cooperate in the process of granting or receiving a Jewish legal divorce or \"get\".\n\nFor a divorce to be effective under Jewish law, a man must grant his wife a Jewish divorce—a \"get\"—of his own free will. Sometimes a Jewish woman can be held in a so-called \"limping marriage\" when her husband refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce. She may have received a civil divorce but cannot remarry within her religion, meaning that for all intents and purposes, she may not be able to remarry at all—a phenomenon known as \"agunah\". Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, that power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more favourable divorce terms. A parallel problem—sometimes called \"male agunah\"—can arise when the wife refuses to respond to the husband's attempts to initiate the \"get\" process, such as refusing to appear before a rabbinical tribunal for the proceeding. Although the consequences are not as serious for the man, the result can still be a form of extortion to agree to agree to the other party's demands.\n\nSince 1990 Canada's Divorce Act permits the Court hearing the divorce to strike out the application, pleadings and/or affidavit evidence of a party creating a barrier to the religious remarriage of their spouse. \n\nIn \"Bruker v. Marcovitz,\" the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that, in the Province of Quebec, a condition of a contract between two spouses that required the husband to give his wife a \"get\" was enforceable. The court overturned a decision from the Court of Appeal of Quebec which held that as the substance of the obligation was religious in nature, the obligation was a moral one and was therefore unenforceable by the courts. The Supreme Court's decision, written by Justice Rosalie Abella, restored the trial decision of Mass J., who had ordered a total of $47,500 in damages: $2,500 for each of the 15 years that the husband had refused to grant the \"get\", and $10,000 for Ms. Bruker’s inability to have children considered “legitimate” under Jewish law. \n\nIn New York, a court cannot enter a judgment of annulment or divorce unless any barriers to religious remarriage by a spouse, the removal of which are within the control of the other spouse, have been removed. Section 253 of the Domestic Relations Law (the so-called \"First New York Get Law\") provides that, in a contested divorce, any applicant whose marriage was solemnised by a religious celebrant must file a statement that:\n\nIn an uncontested divorce both parties must file such a statement or waive the obligation of the other party to do so. The court cannot enter a final judgment of divorce or annulment unless it receives the statements and, even then, final judgment cannot be entered if the person who solemnised the marriage swears that, to his or her knowledge, the applicant has failed to take all steps within his or her power to remove all barriers to the other party’s religious remarriage.\n\nIn Australia, the Family Court in \"Gwiazda v Gwiazda\" ordered a reluctant wife to appear before the Beth Din in Melbourne. Emery J. observed that:\n\nSo-called \"Gwiazda Orders\" are now occasionally used when necessary to produce a fair result by requiring the parties to refer their problems to the local Beth Din. The Australian Law Commission has proposed that the decree nisi should not become absolute and, in any other proceedings except those relating to a child, the court should have the power to adjourn the proceedings.\n\nWithin the United Kingdom, in England and Wales, the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002, relates to Jewish divorce. The Act allows a Court discretionary right to award any \"damages under Tort remedies\", impose any civil or criminal fines or other penalties, or to grant any further relief, and withhold the final legal civil dissolution of a marriage of Jews or of other person by means of granting the \"decree absolute\" until a declaration made by both parties that they have taken such steps as are required to dissolve the marriage in accordance with rabbinical law.\n\nIn case law, there have been a number of cases regarding the provision of a \"get\": in the case of \"O v O\", the wife petitioned for a civil divorce and was granted a \"decree nisi\". As she had not been granted a get, she did not apply for a \"decree absolute\". The husband attempted to apply for it under s9(2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, but was denied until the get had been granted.\n\nSection 5A of the Divorce Act, 1979 provides that the court may refuse a divorce decree if one spouse does not take steps necessary to dissolve the marriage (or to allow the other spouse to remarry) in accordance with religious custom. The court may also make any other order which it finds to be just. This provision was added in 1996 as a result of the South African Law Reform Commission's report on Jewish divorce.\n\nThe Lieberman clause, developed by Rabbi Saul Lieberman, does not deal with secular law, but instead inserts, at the time of marriage, a \"halakhic\" stipulation that the marriage is only valid on the condition that the man gives a \"get\" within 6 months of any secular court's divorce. Were the man to refuse to give a \"get\", the marriage would be declared null retroactively—it would be as if the couple were never married from a Jewish legal perspective.\n\n\n"}

The Easter dates also affect when Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, Maundy Thursday, the Ascension of the Lord and Pentecost occur. Easter may occur on different dates in the Gregorian Calendar and the Julian Calendar. The accompanying table provides both sets of dates, for recent decades and forthcoming years — see the computus article for more details on the calculation.\n\nIn 1818 the Paschal Full Moon fell on Saturday, March 21 (the equinox). Therefore, the following day, March 22, was Easter. It will not fall as early again until 2285, a span of 467 years. The next earliest Easter between 1818 and 2285 (March 23) occurred in 1845, 1856, 1913 and 2008, and will occur again in 2160—an 11, 57, 95 and 152-year gap, respectively.\n\nThe earliest dates for Easter in the Eastern Orthodox Church between 1875 and 2099 are April 4, 1915 and April 4, 2010 (Gregorian). Both dates are equivalent to March 22 in the Julian Calendar.\n\nIn 1943 Easter fell on Sunday, April 25. The ecclesiastical full moon did not occur until Saturday, March 20; because it came before the vernal equinox, the paschal full moon did not happen until Sunday, April 18. Consequently, Easter was the following Sunday (April 25). Easter will not fall as late again until 2038—a span of 95 years. The second latest date for Easter, April 24, occurred in 2011. The last time this occurred was in 1859 and will not happen again until 2095—spans of 152 and 84 years. However between 5121 and 6482, Easter will be no later than April 24.\n\nThe latest dates for Orthodox Easter between 1875 and 2099 are May 8, 1983, and May 8, 2078 (Gregorian). Both dates are equivalent to April 25 in the Julian Calendar. Orthodox Easter has never fallen on Gregorian May 7 yet; it will happen in 2051 unless these churches change to another calendar.\n\nDespite using calendars that are apart by 13 days, Easter 2014 fell on the same date. According to the Western (Gregorian) calendar, the first Paschal Full Moon after the Spring Equinox (March 20) fell on Monday, April 14, 2014. The following Sunday, April 20, was, therefore, Easter Day.\n\nAccording to the Orthodox (Julian) calendar (which is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar), the Spring Equinox also falls on March 21. However, in the Gregorian Calendar, this is April 3. The first Orthodox Full Moon after the Equinox falls on (Julian) Tuesday, April 2, 2014 (Gregorian April 15). The following Sunday, (Julian) April 7, is, therefore, Easter Day (Gregorian April 20).\n\nBoth calendars (Gregorian and Julian) calculate Easter as falling on dates between March 22 and April 25 on their calendars. However, because of the 13-day difference, any member of an Orthodox church would observe that the Western Easter falls between March 10 and April 12 on the Julian calendar. Conversely, any member of a Western church would observe that Orthodox Easter falls between April 4 and May 8 on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nBeginning March 14, 2100 (February 29, 2100, in the Julian Calendar), the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars will increase to 14 days.\n\nIn Hungary, the United Kingdom (except Scotland), Australia, South Africa, Germany, Switzerland and New Zealand, Easter comprises two public holidays, Good Friday and Easter Monday, making a four-day weekend. The moveable date of Easter sometimes brings it into conflict with other, fixed, public holidays.\n\nEaster is not a federal holiday in the United States. In North Carolina, however, it was a public holiday from 1935 to 1987.\n\n"}

It is considered a form of area studies, taking an overtly interdisciplinary approach to the study of a region. In this sense Middle Eastern Studies is a far broader and less traditional field than classical Islamic Studies.\n\nThe subject was historically regarded as part of Oriental studies, which also included East Asian studies and Egyptology and other specialisms in the ancient civilizations of the region; the growth of the field of study in the West is treated at that article. Many academic faculties still cover both areas. Although some academic programs combine Middle Eastern Studies with Islamic Studies, based on the preponderance of Muslims in the region (with Israel and Lebanon being the only exceptions), others maintain these areas of study as separate disciplines.\n\nIn 1978 Edward Said, a Palestinian American professor of Comparative Literature at Columbia University, published his book \"Orientalism\", in which he accused earlier scholars of a \"subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture\", claiming the bias amounted to a justification for imperialism. While other academics such as Irwin challenged Said's conclusions, the book soon became a standard text of literary theory and cultural studies.\n\nIsraeli-American historian Martin Kramer in his 2001 book \"Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America\" accused Middle Eastern studies programs of ignoring the mounting threat of Islamic terrorism. In a \"Wall Street Journal\" article published in 2001, Kramer claimed that Middle Eastern studies courses, as they stood, were \"part of the problem, not its remedy\". In a \"Foreign Affairs\" review of the book, F. Gregory Gause said his analysis was, in part, \"serious and substantive\" but \"far too often his valid points are overshadowed by academic score-settling and major inconsistencies.\"\n\nIn 2002, American writer Daniel Pipes established an organisation called Campus Watch to combat what he perceived to be serious problems within the discipline, including \"analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students\". He encouraged students to advise the organization of problems at their campuses. In turn critics within the discipline such as John Esposito accused him of \"McCarthyism\".\n\nIn 2010, foreign policy analyst Mitchell Bard claimed in his 2010 book \"\" that elements of the Arab lobby particularly Saudi Arabia and pro-Palestinian advocates were hijacking the academic field of Middle Eastern studies within several prominent American universities including Georgetown University, Harvard University, and Columbia University. This has involved Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States funding centers and chairs at universities to promote a pro-Arabist agenda. Bard has also accused several prominent Middle Eastern studies academics including John Esposito and Rashid Khalidi of abusing positions by advancing a pro-Palestinian political agenda.\n\nIn addition, Bard has criticized the Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA) for adopting a pro-Palestinian standpoint. Bard has also alleged that MESA marginalizes non-Israel-related topics including the Kurdish–Turkish conflict and the persecution of religious minorities like Christians and ethnic minorities that are non-Arabs such as Jews and Kurds. Finally, Bard has contended that since the September 11 attacks, the Arab lobby working through Middle Eastern Studies university departments have sought to influence pre-university education by tailoring education programs and resources to reflect a pro-Arabist agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was formed in 2002 at the initiative of the then RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan to allow the Sangh Parivar to reach out to Muslims. Sher haidar Khan and Syed Adil Muneer Andrabi are media persons of it\n\nThe MRM was founded with the stated aim of bringing Muslim communities close to Hindus in India. It states that Muslim suspicions of the RSS and its affiliates are misplaced, and that the Indian National Congress is responsible for a leadership within the Muslim community. The MRM has also expressed support for many of the causes espoused by the RSS, including the banning of cow-slaughter. Its national convener, Mohammed Afzal, stated that the organisation faced significant resistance in the days following the Godhra train burning and the 2002 Gujarat riots.\n\nIn November 2009 the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, one of the largest Islamic organisations in India, passed a resolution describing \"Vande Mataram\" as an un-Islamic song. The MRM expressed opposition to the resolution. Afzal stated \"Our Muslim brothers should not follow the fatwa as Vande Mataram is the national song of the country and every Indian citizen should respect and recite it.\" The MRM stated further that Muslims who refused to sing it were opponents of both Islam and India. In August 2008, MRM organised a \"Paigham-e-Aman\" (message of peace) \"yatra\" from the Red Fort in Delhi to Kashmir in support of land allocation for the Amarnath pilgrimage. Led by the Jharkhand Shahee-Imam Moulana Hizb Rehman Merthi, the 50 activists of the yatra were initially stopped at the border of Jammu & Kashmir. They were later allowed to go to Jammu where they held meetings with the \"Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti\".\nIn the 2014 general election, the MRM campaigned for Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Narendra Modi. Afzal stated that the MRM would attempt to reach out to 50 million Muslims before the election. When questioned about Modi's involvement in the Gujarat riots, Afzal stated:\nIn 2015, the Muslim Rashtriya Manch published a book title \"Yoga and Islam\" on universal appeal and acceptance of Yoga. The Manch expressed its views that 'Yoga' does not have anything to do with religion, further stating that \"Namaaz is one sort of Yoga asana\". The move was supported by the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) but Hindu groups expressed reservations.\n\n"}

The Muslim followers consider Prannath Ji as the \"Last Imam Mehndi\" and Hindu followers as \"Budh Nishkalank Kalki Avatar\" a title conferred to him at a Kumbha Mela at Haridwar in 1735 Vikram Samvat (1678 A.D).\n\nThe founder of the sect, Shri Devchandra Ji Maharaj (1581–1655), was born in Sindh province in Umarkot village of India (now in \"Pakistan\"). From early childhood, he showed saintly tendencies. At the age of 16, he renounced the world and left in search of Brahma-gyana (divine knowledge) to Bhuj in Kutch and later to Jamnagar. Devchandraji undertook the work of giving concrete shape and form to find a new stream of religion called Nijanand Sampradaya. He settled down in Jamnagar, where form he explained Vedas, Vedantic knowledge and Bhagwatam in simple language intelligible to lay persons irrespective of social class and religious differences, and awaken them to their real Self with the help of divine knowledge called \"Tartam\". His followers later came to be known as Sundarsaths or Pranami.\n\nThe credit of spreading the Pranami sampraday goes to his dearest disciple and successor, Mahamati Shri Prannathji (Mehraj Thakur) (1618–1694), who was the son of Keshav Thakur, Diwan of Jamnagar State. He traveled throughout the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian world including Oman, Iraq and Iran to spread the ideals of religious harmony and interfaith understanding the vision of Tartam professes. Through him was revealed the divine knowledge later compiled as the holy \"Kuljam Swaroop\" in six languages - Gujarati, Sindhi, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hindi and also words of many other prevalent languages. His work called Kuljam Swarup a.k.a. Tartam Sagar is worshipped unlike the idols in Shree Krishna Pranami temples worldwide. He also attended Kumbh Mela at Haridwar in 1735 BS (1678 AD) and was engaged in religious debates in which he conveniently became victorious and was conferred the title of \"Niskalanka Bijayaabhinand Buddha Avatar\" by the saints of various sects and creeds.\n\nMaharaja Chhatrasal (1649–1731) of Bundelkhand, was an ardent disciple of Mahamati Prannathji and a follower of Pranami Dharma. Their meeting took place in Mau in 1683, a place near Panna. His nephew Dev Karanji who had met Swami Prannathji, earlier in Ramnagar, was instrumental for this meeting. Chhatrasal was highly impressed of Prannathji and became his disciple. When Maharaja Chhatrasal came to meet him, he was going for a battle against Mughals. Swami Prannathji gave him his own sword and covered his head with a scarf, saying, \"You will always be victorious. Diamond mines will be discovered in your land and you will become a great emperor.\" His prophecy came true and even today Panna region is famous for their diamond mines. Swami Prannathji was not only the religious Guru of Chhatrasal; but he guided him too in political, social, and economic matters. It was by being granted the boon of finding diamonds in Panna by Swami Prannathji that Maharaja Chhatrasal became prosperous.\n\nAmong other notables - Mahatma Gandhi's mother, Putlibai, belonged to Pranami sect. Gandhi in his book \"My Experiments With Truth\" mentions about this sect - \"Pranami is a sect deriving the best of both the Quran and Gita, in search of one goal - God.\"\n\nThis compilation of 14 books consists the revelation of the Vedic Scriptures, Qateb (Semitic scriptures - Quran, Torah, Psalms of David and the Bible) as well as the description of the Supreme Abode Paramdham that Muslims call Arshe Azim (Lahoot) and the Christians call the Supreme Heaven. Due to this compilation having divine knowledge, the followers of Shree Krishna Pranami Faith worship this Holy book as the Lord himself. Tartam Sagar include 18,758 verses.\n\nIt is a collection of Mahamati Prannath's \"Vaani's\" or teaching. It was published in 1965 for the first time. The collection of fourteen books are: Raas, Prakash, Shatritu, Kalash, Sanandh, Kirantan, Khulasa, Khilwat, Parikrama, Sagar, Singaar, Sindhi Bani, Marfat Sagar, and Kayamatnama (chhota and Bada).\n\nIt offers a stratified knowledge from the Hell (Purgatory) all the way to the Supreme Abode of the Lord Supreme Paramdham and enumerates everything in between. This holy text explains the history and reason behind the creation of this relative world among many facets of creation.

The account of their lives recorded by the awakened soul Swami Lal Das Jee, the consort of the Lord Supreme and many other awakened souls outline\nthe ways for enlightenment and Salvation.\n\nMany other books written by the leaders of the Pranami Faith and other religious scholars are available for readers to reflect on in many libraries and Pranami Temples and institutions worldwide.\n\nThe followers of Nijanand Sampardaye are barred from alcohol intake, non-veg diets, tobacco products,etc.\n\nNijanand Sampradaya refrains from idol worship. The followers recite hymns and verses from their holy book Kuljam Swarup a.k.a. Tartam Sagar, worship the Holy book as the Lord Himself. The usual partaking of consecrated water (amiras), together with food offering or prasad, is not considered an essential part of ritual worship in the tradition.\n\nIn Nijanand temples, which are dedicated to Shree Rajshyamaji (the Lord Supreme and his bliss part), ladies and gentlemen sit in separately to listen to the recitation of fragments of their holy scripture and sing devotional songs to the accompaniment of harmonium, drums (tabla and dholak) and small brass cymbals (manjiras). The walls of temple are covered by scripts from their books - which are inscribed both in Hindi and Sanskrit.\n\nNijanand Sampraday followers though a minority sect of an offshoot Hinduism can be found in States of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Assam, West Bengal, Sikkim in India chiefly.

The Protestant Churches of Burma were begun in the early 19th century by Adoniram Judson, an American Baptist missionary. Since the 19th century, Christianity has become deeply rooted and has grown stronger through many adversities.\n\nIn 1966 all missionaries were expelled by the Burmese government, but the Burmese Church has become a vibrant missionary-sending movement, despite financial limitations and geographic isolation. Baptists, Assemblies of God, Methodists and Anglicans form the strongest denominations in Burma. Many Christians are well-educated, but cannot rise to positions of responsibility.\n\nMost Christians are from the minority ethnic groups such as Karen, Lisu, Kachin, Chin, and Lahu. An estimated 0.1 per cent of the Bamar population is Christian.\n\nThe Anglican Communion is represented in Burma by the Church of the Province of Myanmar. , it has about 62,000 members.\n\nThe Myanmar Baptist Convention is an association of Baptist churches in Myanmar.\n\nThe famous American Baptist missionaries, Adoniram and Ann Judson, moved to Yangon in 1813 when British authorities refused to allow them to stay in India. The Judsons were in Burma six years before their first convert was baptised. Adoniram Judson gathered a group of believers and laboured under many trials, but his missionary tenure of almost 40 years helped firmly establish the Baptist work in Myanmar. His monumental work included translating the Bible into Burmese, which was completed in 1834. George Dana Boardman began a work among the Karen peoples in 1828. Today the \"Karen Baptist Convention\" is the largest member body of the Myanmar Baptist Convention, which was formed in 1865.\n\nHIV/AIDS is a significant problem in Myanmar. In 1992, the Baptist Convention created a 32-member AIDS commission, because they see the problem as spiritual, as well as social and medical.\n\nIn Myanmar about 6% of the population is Christian, with two-thirds of them being considered Protestant. Almost half of these Protestants are Baptists. In 2012, the Convention had over 1.6 million members in 4929 churches. The Myanmar Baptist Convention has 18 affiliated conventions and two directly affiliated local churches under its umbrella, and is a member of the World Council of Churches and the Baptist World Alliance.\n\nDuring 5–8 December 2013 Myanmar Baptist Convention celebrated its 200th anniversary arrival of missionary Judson. They are actively planning to evangelise all the unreached people groups of it and plant as many as 1200 churches in their project entitled: Golden Myanmar Baptist Mission, Second Decade(2014-2024).\n\nThe Convention operates the Myanmar Institute of Theology, the leading Christian seminary in Myanmar, founded in 1927 and located in Insein.\n\nMethodist missionaries entered the country along with the British once Myanmar became a British colony in the late 1800s. Methodists established, similarly to the Anglicans, schools in the country, most notably the Methodist English High School in Yangon, mostly to educate the Anglo-Burmese and British. The school exists to this day and today is known as Dagon State High School but still attached the Methodist Church.\n\nThe United Methodist Church works with the Lower Myanmar Methodist Church which was founded by American Methodist missionaries over 100 years ago. The Upper Myanmar Methodist Church was planted by British Methodists. The two are in discussion about merging. They already conduct joint missions.\n\nThe Lower Myanmar Methodist Church began under the British. The Lower Myanmar Methodist Church concentrates on leadership development through scholarships and continuing education. It also provides a home for the elderly, helps youth develop job skills, cares for orphans and provides environmental education.\n\nThe Christian Reformed Church in Myanmar is a Reformed church of Myanmar, and was founded in 1985 by Pastor Chan Thleng who was former ordained in the Presbyterian Church in Myanmar. He belongs to the Matu tribe in Southern Chin State born in 1954 become Christian in 1974. In 1985 he founded the United Christian Church after he graduated from Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, MI he returned to Burma and changed the denominations name to the Christian Reformed Church. It has 52 congregations and 13 preaching points with more than 6,000 members. The church is divided into 10 Classes. Most of the evangelists work among Buddhist and Animist people. The church is divided into classes. The Church recognises the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort and the Ecumenical Creeds. To train pastors the church founded the Reformed Theological seminary in Yangon in 1997. The college offers a degree of Bachelor of Theology. The Christian Reformed Church maintains a clinic opened in 1999 in Matupi. It belonged to the Reformed Ecumenical Council, the only Burmese denomination to do so. But REC merged with the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, now the Christian Reformed Church is affiliated with the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The denomination held its 26th General assembly in 17–20 March 2011. It entered into official ecclesiastical fellowship with the Christian Reformed Church in North America in 2011.\n\nThe biggest church is the Presbyterian Church in Myanmar with 30,000 members and 300 parishes and hundreds of house fellowships.\n\nThe Mara Evangelical Church is one of the oldest church in Chin State. It was founded by American missionaries. The church has 100 congregations and 17,200 members, and it is affiliated with the World Communion of Reformed Churches.\n\nKachin Church is a church centred in Kachin State of Myanmar. It is also present in China and India and is predominantly Baptist.\n\nLisu Church is a Christian church of an ethnic minority of southern China, Myanmar, Thailand and a part of India. Missionaries had been working in the Lisu area since the early 20th century. The first to work among the Lisu, in the Yunnan province in China, was James O. Fraser, who also developed the written Lisu language and the Fraser Alphabet, which today is officially adopted by the Chinese government. Writing and reading in Lisu has been mainly developed by the church. Today there are an estimated 300,000 Lisu believers. The Lisu Church has both the Bible and a hymn book in their own language.\n\nThe True Jesus Church is a nontrinitarian Christian denomination begun in China, growing out of the Pentecostal movement. Since its foundation it has spread to other countries including Myanmar.\n\nAs of 2000, there are two churches, one in Taungphila and Pyindaw Oo, and prayer houses in six different areas: Pyidawtha, Sakhamayi, Tiddicm, Falam, Nud Kyi Kone, and Yangon Shwebogan.

Indeed the arab world \"Qasr\" comes from the latin \"castra\" (meaning in English: \"castle\").\n\nBy the middle of the 2nd century, the Romans built many small temples and other sanctuaries in the vicinity of the temple district of Heliopolis, today's Baalbek, on the edge of the Bekaa. They were pilgrimage destinations for the inhabitants of the big cities on the coast. One of the Roman processional streets led - partly carved out of the rock - from here directly to the mountain temples of Hosn Niha. One of the most famous is the one in the village of Qsarnaba, called actually \"Castra El Banaat\".\n\nGeorge F. Taylor classified Qasr el Banat among a group of ancient Roman Temples of the Beqaa Valley. It is suggested to date to Ancient Roman, but it is possible that was originally built -as a very small temple- during Ancient Greek eras or earlier. The temple is located on a rocky plateau, accessible by a climb up a hill at an altitude of 1100 meters. The top of the hill is covered in various platforms, cisterns, tanks and steps that have been carved out of solid bedrock. Within the remains is a small antae temple, constructed of large square blocks that was used as a fortress in later times. Some sections remain intact built up two or three layers high. A basilica (probably byzantine Christian) from a later period was built alongside the temple.\n\nThere are two circular structures located around southeast of the temple that are thought to have been examples of\nthe high places referenced in the Bible.\n\nThe \"Prostylos Temple\" of Qsarnaba, with the entrance on the east side, stood on a high platform, reached by a wide flight of steps with over 20 steps. The walls of the podium were moved to the east and formed a lateral conclusion of the stairs. The mighty limestone curbs of the former Cella wall, which are distributed on the site, are weathered to some extent to the shapelessness. In 1974, the first phase of the restoration was completed, in which up to three rows of temple walls could be restored. In the middle section of the cella, the stepped base of a raised cult place can be seen. A separate sacrificial altar stands outside in the east at the foot of the staircase. \n\nIt was composed of parts and supplemented in a further restoration phase after 1993. The columns of the vestibule were crowned by Corinthian capitals.\nIndividual parts of the pediment triangle were assembled in the original form and placed as a whole at ground level next to the temple. In the upper cornice, a carved relief bust is preserved at the top of the gable. It shows the bearded head of a man who probably represents the founder of the building. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "35624642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35624642", "title": "Religion and schizophrenia", "text": "Religion and schizophrenia\n\nThe relationship between religion and schizophrenia is of particular interest to psychiatrists because of the similarities between religious experiences and psychotic episodes; religious experiences often involve auditory and/or visual hallucinations, and those with schizophrenia commonly report similar hallucinations, along with a variety of beliefs that are commonly recognized by modern medical practitioners as delusional. In general, religion has been found to have \"both a protective and a risk increasing effect\" for schizophrenia.\n\nA common report from those with schizophrenia is some type of religious belief that many medical practitioners consider to be delusional - such as the belief they are divine beings or prophets, that God is talking to them, they are possessed by demons, etc. Active and adaptive coping skills in subjects with residual schizophrenia are associated with a sound spiritual, religious, or personal belief system. In a study of patients with schizophrenia that had been previously admitted to a hospital, 24% had what the medical field refers to as religious delusions.\n\nTrans-cultural studies have found that such religious beliefs, which often may not be associated with reality, are much more common in patients with schizophrenia who identify as Christian and/or reside in predominately Christian areas such as Europe or North America. By comparison, patients in Japan much more commonly have delusions surrounding matters of shame and slander, and in Pakistan matters of paranoia regarding relatives and neighbors.\n\nSchizophrenia is a complex psychotic disorder in which symptoms include emotional blunting, intellectual deterioration, social isolation, disorganized speech and behavior, delusions, and hallucinations. The causes of schizophrenia are unclear, but it seems that genetics play a heavy role, as individuals with a family history are far more likely to suffer from schizophrenia. The disorder can be triggered and exacerbated by social and environmental factors, with episodes becoming more apparent in periods of high stress. Neurologists have found that the schizophrenic brain has larger ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) compared to a well brain. This is hypothesized to be due to loss of nerve cells. Symptoms usually appear around the onset of early adulthood. It is rare for a child to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, in part because of the difficulty in establishing what erroneous thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to childhood development and which thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to schizophrenia. With psychiatric medication (usually antipsychotics) and therapy, individuals with schizophrenia can live successful and productive lives.\n\nIt has been shown in longitudinal studies that those suffering from schizophrenia have varying degrees of success when religion plays a significant role in their recovery. It would seem that the use of religion can either be a helpful method of coping with the disorder, or it can be a significant hindrance in recovery. Especially for those who are active in a religious community, religion can also be a very valuable tool in coping with the disorder. It can be difficult, however, to distinguish if a religious experience is genuine to the spiritual person, or if it is a positive symptom of the illness. This is where a skilled and reliable therapist can help. Provided that a therapist is open to the use of religion in one's treatment, and that the patient is open and receiving said treatment, it is entirely possible to tie religion in with professional therapeutic aids and medication in order to meet a desirable goal. Those who are involved in their church and are spiritual on a daily basis, while getting psychiatric treatment have reported fewer symptoms and a better quality of life. They learn to see their religion as a source of hope rather than a tormenting reality.\n\nSchizophrenia can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, including significant stress, intensely emotional situations, and disturbing or uncomfortable experiences. It is possible that religion itself may be a trigger for schizophrenia; religious imagery is often very grandiose, and defies commonly held beliefs of what is realistic and natural in the world. Experiencing an intense religious experience may trigger a psychotic episode in those who are vulnerable to them, because religion often requires a believer to suspend their usual idea of what is possible and impossible. This could potentially lead to a psychotic episode due to the shift in realistic thinking; a sufferer may believe that they themselves are religious deities or Messiahs, or that God himself is speaking to the individual. These symptoms may cause violent behavior, either on others or themselves because of taking passages in religious texts literally. In some instances, they may also experience more distress-inducing symptoms if they believe that God is using their illness as a punishment. Religion, depending on how the patient views it, can be paralyzing and quite harmful, in that the patient may refuse treatment based on religious beliefs; in certain instances, one might believe that their delusions and hallucinations are actually a divine experience, and therefore deny any treatment. It has been shown that those with schizophrenia who suffer from religious delusions are more religious than those who do not suffer from these delusions. It has also been shown that those who suffer from religious delusions are less likely to continue long-term treatment.\n\n"}

The sigil has been called a \"material pentagram\" representational of carnality and earthy principles. The Church describes the symbol as the \"...preeminent visual distillation of the iconoclastic philosophy of Satanism.\"\n\nIn the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the \"Satanic\" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat's head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966. The original goat pentagram containing the Hebrew letters at the five points of the pentagram spelling out Leviathan first appeared in the book \"La Clef de la Magie Noire\" by French occultist Stanislas de Guaita, in 1897. This symbol was later used in Mourice Bessy's book \"A Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural\", with the words \"Samael\" and \"Lilith\" removed. During his years of research into the “Black Arts,” LaVey had come across this book and added it to his collection. When he chose to turn his magic circle, the \"Order of the Trapezoid,” into the Church of Satan, he decided that the symbol was the one which most fully embodied the principles which were the bedrock of the Satanic church. Contrary to claims made against the Church by detractors, LaVey never claimed to have created this particular symbol. In its formative years, this particular version of the symbol was utilized by the Church on membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House. During the writing of \"The Satanic Bible\", it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the Church. The complete graphic now known as the \"Sigil of Baphomet\", named such for the first time in LaVey's \"The Satanic Rituals\", first appeared on the cover of \"The Satanic Mass LP\" in 1968 and later on the cover of \"The Satanic Bible\" in 1969.

{"id": "54651803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54651803", "title": "Slavic Native Faith in Russia", "text": "Slavic Native Faith in Russia\n\nSlavic Native Faith (Rodnovery, Orthodoxy, Vedism) in Russia is widespread, according to some estimates from research organisations which put the number of Russian Rodnovers in the millions. The Rodnover population generally has a high education and many of its exponents are intellectuals, many of whom are politically engaged both in the right and the left wings of the political spectrum. Particular movements that have arisen within Slavic Native Faith in Russia include Ynglism, Peterburgian Vedism, Meryan Rodnovery and Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism. Rodnovery in Russia is also influenced by, and in turn influences, movements which have their roots in Russian cosmism and identify themselves as belonging to the Vedic spectrum, such as Ivanovism and Rerikhism.\n\nAitamurto observed that a \"substantial number\" of adherents—and in particular those who had been among the earliest—belonged to the \"technical intelligentsia\". Similarly, Shnirelman noted that the founders of Russian Rodnovery were \"well-educated urbanized intellectuals\" who had become frustrated with \"cosmopolitan urban culture\". Physicists were particularly well represented; in this Aitamurto drew comparisons to the high number of computer professionals who were present in the Pagan communities of Western countries. The movement also involved a significant number of people who had a background in the Soviet or Russian Army, or in policing and security. The \"vast majority\" of Russian Rodnovers were young and there were a greater proportion of men than women. A questionnaire distributed at the Kupala festival in Maloyaroslavets suggested that Native Faith practitioners typically had above-average levels of education, with a substantial portion working as business owners or managers. A high proportion were also involved in specialist professions such as engineering, academia, or information technology, and the majority lived in cities.\n\nShnirelman informs that Rodnovery in Russia is embraced by many politically engaged philosophers, both of the right- and the left-wing. The former group is represented by Vladimir Andeyev, Anatoly Ivanov, Pavel Tulaev (members of the Moscow Slavic Community and founders of the New Right journal \"Ateney\"), Aleksei Trekhlebov from Krasnodar, Valery Demin from Omsk, and the Saint Petersburg journalists Oleg Gusev and Roman Perin, among others. Ivakhiv reports that they have a \"surprisingly extensive\" influence. The well-known Rodnover leader Velimir (Nikolai Speransky), who is the founder of the politically neutral federation Circle of Pagan Tradition, classifies Valery Yemelyanov, \"volkhv\" Dobroslav (Aleksei Dobrovolsky), Vladimir Istarkhov and Igor Sinyavin as representatives of right-wing Rodnovery; according to him, the Union of Slavic Rodnover Communities founded by Vadim Kazakov and the \"Church of Nav\" (Це́рковь На́ви, \"Tsérkov' Návi\") generally lean towards the right-wing. The left-wing of the spectrum would be represented, instead, by Anton Platov, Aleksandr Asov and Aleksandr Khinevich (founder of Ynglism), though they keep most of their religious activities outside of politics. Since the 1990s, Traditionalist School thinkers—chiefly René Guénon and the Italian Pagan philosopher Julius Evola—have been translated and introduced in the very mainstream of Russian thought by the philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who has an influential position at the heart of contemporary Russian academic and political life.\n\nA number of youth subcultures have been identified as introducing people to Rodnovery, among them heavy metal, historical re-enactment, and the admirers of J. R. R. Tolkien. Rodnovery is also spread through a variety of newspapers and journals. Also popular with Russian Rodnovers has been the martial arts movement known as \"Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba\". A number of popular celebrities, including singer Maria Arkhipova and professional boxer Aleksandr Povetkin, have publicly embraced Rodnovery.\n\nWriting in 2000, Shnirelman noted that Rodnovery was \"growing rapidly\" within the Russian Federation. In 2016, Aitamurto noted that there was \"no reliable information\" on the number of Rodnovers in Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" that there were \"several tens of thousands\" of practitioners active in the country. This was partly because there were several Rodnover groups active on the social network VK which had over 10,000 members.\n\nA 2012 survey of religion in Russia estimated that there were 1,700,000 practitioners of \"traditional religions of gods and ancestors\" in the federation as of that year. Of them, 44% were ethnic Russians and Roman Lunkin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences (IERAS)' Institute of Europe, who was among the surveyors, recognised the growing presence of Native Faiths among them. The historian Marlene Laruelle suggested that Rodnovery was likely to remain a marginalised religion in comparison to Russian Orthodoxy, but that its main significance for Russian society had been by diffusing \"historical themes\"—particularly regarding an ancient Aryan race—to a far wider audience, including many who were Orthodox or non-religious. Rodnovery has been spreading rapidly in the North Caucasus region of Russia, especially among communities of Cossacks and in the Stavropol region, where in some areas it already has a dominant position. It has been reported that even former priests of the Russian Orthodox Church have joined their ranks.\n\nA polemical piece entitled \"Adversus paganos\", published in 2015 by the official journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan, cites sociological data saying that Native Faiths are already formally embraced by \"more than 2 million Russians\", while the number of people affected by Rodnover ideas is several times larger. This is based on data provided in 2012 by Igor Zadorin, the director of the research institute \"Tsirkon\", who said that in Russia the proportions of atheists, Orthodox Christians and \"pagans\" are of comparable sizes and their populations overlap: Orthodox Christians are 30% of the total population; people who have some sort of \"pagan\", non-Christian spirituality, are 40% of the population, while the remaining population is composed of a 20% who are atheists, and a 10% who are believers of other religions (4-7% ethnic minorities professing Islam).\n\nThe Ringing Cedars (Звенящие Кедры) or Anastasianism is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery, but is not thoroughly part of it. Many Anastasians are Rodnovers, while others are not. The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of Vladimir Megre (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an archetypal Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia. These books teach what Rasa Pranskevičiūtė has defined as a \"cosmological pantheism\", in which nature is the manifested \"thought of God\" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.\n\nAnastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, \"kinship homesteads\" (родовое поместье, \"rodovoye pomest'ye\"), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name \"Ringing Cedars\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the Siberian cedar. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \"Vedic\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.\n\nZoroastrianism emerged as a public entity in Russia in the 1990s, created by Russians themselves despite the normally endogamic essence of the traditional Zoroastrian communities existing in Iran and India. The first Zoroastrian organisation, the \"Avestan School of Astrology\" (shortened \"Asha\", which, in the oldest texts known as \"Arta\", is the Persian word defining the agency of cosmic harmony), was established by Pavel Globa (1953–) in the early 1990s, and opened dozens of branches in and outside of Russia. Globa had been teaching Avestan astrology since the 1970s, and in the 1990s he had become a nationally acknowledged expert on the subject. Globa presents himself as the heir of a lineage of Zurvanism (the type of Zoroastrianism that regards Zurvan, i.e. \"Time\" and \"Whole\", as the supreme God) from north-west Iran, allegedly transmitted through his great grandmother and his maternal grandfather Ivan N. Gantimurov. Some of Globa's pupils were initiated by he himself into a priesthood (\"khorbad\").\n\nIn 1994 the \"Zoroastrian Community of Saint Petersburg\" was established by Globa's followers and officially registered. The organisation publishes the magazine \"Mitra\" and the newsletter \"Tiri\". The Zoroastrianism that they propose is a consciously mimetic appropriation of the religion as it is practised among traditional Zoroastrian communities. This recreation involves significant changes; for instance the cords that are worn by initiates around their waist are not white woollen cords as in the original tradition, but are three-coloured cords—yellow, red and blue—symbolising, according to Globa, the three colours of Zurvan. Since 2001, the priest of Iranian origins Kamran Jamshidi initiated new Avestan astrologers in Minsk, and Russia became a mission field for them. Tensions arose as Jamshidi's initiates challenged the authority of Globa. Under the influence of these new missionaries, another organisation was founded in Moscow in the year 2005, the \"Russian Anjoman\" (Русский Анджоман; \"anjoman\" is a Persian word meaning \"assembly\"). They use the term of Russian origin \"Blagovery\" (Благоверие \"Blagoverie\", literally \"Good Faith\") to define their Zoroastrianism.\n\nRussian Zoroastrian communities, whether belonging to the Peterburger or Muscovite movements, emphasise that Zoroastrianism has Russian origins, and traces of it have been preserved in Slavic folklore. This parallels the discourse of Rodnovery, and one of the early Rodnover ideologues, Anatoly Ivanov, defined his views as \"Zoroastrian\" and \"Avestan\". In 1981, Ivanov even published the anti-Christian text entitled \"Zarathustra Did Not Speak Thus: The Basics of the Aryan Worldview\", inspired by Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", wherein Ivanov says that Zoroastrianism should be adopted as a new paradigm for humanity and discusses the eschatology of the Saoshyant. Zoroastrianism has been described by Stausberg and Tessmann as a \"permanent discussion topic\" within the Rodnover community. As it is the case for Rodnovers, the site of Arkaim has great importance for Russian Zoroastrians/Blagovers, since it is believed that the \"Aryan prophet\" Zoroaster lived there. In 2007, during an interview with Iranian state media, Russian president Vladimir Putin himself declared that Zoroastrianism originated in the southern part of the Ural region of Russia, and it is the base of all major world religious systems.\n\nMany Rodnovers are influenced by Central Asian or Siberian shamanism and its modern organised form, Tengrism, which has become widespread in easternmost regions of Russia. One of the earliest exponents of Rodnovery, Moscow State University-graduated psychologist Grigory Yakutovsky (1955–, known as a shaman by the name Vseslav Svyatozar; his surname reveals a possible Yakut ancestry), asserted that ancient Slavic religion was fundamentally shamanic, and Siberian shamanism plays a central role in his formulations. In Yakutovsky's Rodnovery, Slavic gods are secondary in importance compared to goddesses, and he claims that this was typical of ancient Slavic religion. Yakutovsky's form of Rodnovery has been defined as \"tolerant, pluralistic and pacifistic\"; his teachings are also representative of the minority of Rodnovers who identify as communists. Yakutovsky is critical of the Soviet type of communism, and rather proposes \"social communism\" as the ideal form of government for the future. He also espouses a form of elitism, by recognising shamans (poets and mystics) as a minority of people characterised by greater intelligence and power devoted to the realisation of a better future for humanity.\n\nAccording to the scholar of religion Mircea Eliade, original Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to Central Asian shamanism than to the later Near Eastern and Mediterranean religions, as proven by their shared crucial concepts: the supreme God of Heaven (cf. Indo-European \"Dyeus\", Siberian \"Tengri\", and Mesopotamian \"Dingir\") and the three-layered structure of cosmology (cf. Sanskrit \"Trailokya\").\n\nThe rise of Rodnovery, and its rapid growth as a multidimensional phenomenon, has brought to the establishment of an artistic scene as part of such multidimensionality. Many professional artists, many of whom are outspokenly Rodnover themselves—some even priests, have emerged with works discussing themes of history, mythology and everyday life. Their works are highly appreciated and celebrated within the Rodnover community. Studies on Rodnover art have found that Svyatoslav I of Kiev is one of the preferred subjects among other historical themes, epic heroes and other human prototypes (even including the appropriation of saints of the Russian Orthodox Church).\n\nRussian artists of Rodnover themes include Aleksandr Borisovich Uglanov, Andrey Alekseyevich Shishkin, Andrey Guselnikov, Andrey Klimenko, Boris Olshansky, Igor Ozhiganov, Leo Khao, Maksim Kuleshov, Maksim Sukharev, Maximilian Presnyakov, Nella Genkina, Nikolay Speransky, Radomir Semochkin, Viktor Korolkov, Vladimir Pingachov, Vsevolod Ivanov. Another artist, whose works are widely appreciated within the Rodnover community, was Konstantin Vasilyev (1942–1976).\n\nRodnovery has a significant role in the War in Donbass, with many Rodnovers forming or joining armed forces. Some of them—for example those of the Svarozich Battalion—have been fighting in favour of Russia; other Rodnovers—such as those of the Azov Battalion—have taken the side of Ukraine. The war has stirred different reactions among Rodnovers in Ukraine; those belonging to the Native Ukrainian National Faith viewed Russia as the aggressor, while adherents of other Rodnover organisations like the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith more commonly saw Russians and Ukrainians as brothers and believed that the conflict was caused by the machinations of the United States.\n\nRussian Rodnover military formations in Donbass include the Svarog, Varyag and Rusich formations, and Rodnovers within the Russian Orthodox Army. Observers have highlighted that Russian Rodnovers have been proselytising in the region, with the endorsement of Russia, under the name \"Orthodoxy\" and preaching the concept of a new \"Russian World\", and that their beliefs have even permeated the Orthodox Christian church.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war, though not necessarily in connection with it, Rodnover and Orthodox Christian military groups have also sprung up in the Russian capital Moscow, reportedly dividing the capital into respective zones of influence, \"cities within the city\" with their own armed forces, with support from local security officials. Rodnover soldiers often help the local population in its opposition to the Orthodox Christian hierarchy's plans to build new churches around the city.\n\n\n"}

The temple was built of sandstone between 25 BCE and 14 CE during the rule of the Roman emperor Augustus. It was part of the Roman fortress known as Taphis and measures . The north temple's \"two front columns are formed by square pillars with engaged columns\" on its four sides. The rear wall of the temple interior features a statue niche.\n\nIn 1960, in relation to the construction of the Aswan High Dam and the consequent threat posed by its reservoir to numerous monuments and archeological sites in Nubia such as the temple of Abu Simbel, UNESCO made an international call to save these sites. In gratitude, Egypt assigned several monuments to the countries that replied to this plea in a significant way, including the Netherlands. Adolf Klasens, the director of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden and a Dutch Egyptologist played a part in arranging the agreement where Egypt presented the temple of Taffeh to the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, the Netherlands.\n\nThis building is constructed from 657 blocks weighing approximately 250 tons.

{"id": "29626959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29626959", "title": "Wenchang Wang", "text": "Wenchang Wang\n\nWenchang Wang (), also known as Wenchang Dijun (), is a Taoist deity in Chinese Mythology, known as the God of Culture and Literature. He is also at times referred to simply as Wen Qu, or Wen. The literal translation of his name would be King () of Flourishing () Culture/Language (). Wenchang Wang is physically represented by a constellation of six stars near the Big Dipper. The stars all had names of their own: Shangjiang (), Cijiang (), Guixiang (), Siming (), Sizhong (), and Silu (). Wenchang Wang is often depicted as an elderly scholar accompanied by two attendants, Tianlong ( or Heaven-Deaf) and Diya ( or Earth-Mute). He has historically been called upon by scholars and writers who need inspiration or help right before an exam.\n\nThere are quite a few accounts of Wenchang Wang; most depict him as a man by the name Zhang Yazi (), of a county in Sichuan Province called Zitong. A particular account cites him as a war hero, having died an honorable death in a rebellion against Emperor Fú Jiān in 374. Other accounts of Wenchang Wang appear rather sporadically at different time periods; he has been given seventeen reincarnations over a period of 3,000 years. A notable account of an appearance of Wenchang Wang was as the Spirit of Zitong, during the suppression of a rebellion in Chengdu, Sichuan, in 1000 A.D. A man allegedly climbed a ladder in midst of battle and declared that the Spirit of Zitong told him the \"town [of rebels] would fall on the twentieth day of the ninth moon.\" The town fell on the day indicated, and the general in charge of repressing the rebellion had the temple repaired.\n\nIn addition to being a respected warrior, Wenchang Wang was well respected as a model for filiality. The \"Book of Emperor Zi Tong\" records: \"Wenchang was had a mature mind at birth. His mother breastfed him even though she was perilously ill and malnourished. In the middle of the night, Wenchang cut flesh from his own thighs and fed it to his mother. She was then cured of her illness.\"\n\nWenchang Wang also appears in other texts, where he is praised for other noble virtues. The book \"Wenchang Emperor and the States He Stabilized\" states: \"He descended into the mortal world seventy-three times as a \"shidafu\"\" (a scholar-bureaucrat position in the emperor's government of feudal China). Wenchang was uncorrupted, upright and just, and never dealt out harsh punishments to the people. He allegedly helps people when they have hardships, saves those who are in trouble, has compassion for the lonely, forgives people's mistakes, and leaves peace and stability everywhere he goes. Because of this, the Jade Emperor put him in charge of the elections of village leaders.\n\nThere is controversy over the actual position of Wenchang, despite common practice of attributing him to Zhang Yazi. Many point out that the stories on Zhang Yazi are attributed mainly to honor and heroism, having nothing to do with actual literature. In his \"Myths and Legends of China\", E.T.C. Werner points out that \"Wherever Wenchang is worshiped there will also be found a separate representation of K'uei Hsing [Kui Xing], showing that while the official deity has been allowed to 'borrow glory' from the popular god, and even to assume his personality, the independent existence of the stellar spirit is nevertheless sedulously maintained.\" The story being that Zhang Kui (Kui Xing) was a brilliant scholar who was, because of his unsightly face, not recognized by the Emperor when he passed the top examinations. Feeling dejected, he threw himself into the ocean, and ascended into the heavens as a star. Initially, scholars worshiped this star, Kui Xing, as the God of Literature, but with time, he was eventually linked to the Dipper (constellation) or Great Bear, and assimilated into Wenchang Jundi.\n\nWenchang has had various titles, but was officially apotheosized by Yen Yu of the Mongol Dynasty in 1314 A.D as the Supporter of the Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty, Diffuser of Renovating Influences, Ssu-lu of Wenchang, God and Lord.\n\nHe is often called upon by scholars and students for academic help. There are many different temples and shrines dedicated to worshiping Wenchang Wang, the most notable being the Wenchang temple of Zitong, located at modern-day Qiqu Mountain (). This famous mountain is both the location of the largest cypress forest in China as well as the origin of the Wenchang culture. As Sichuan (where Qiqu Mountain is located) is mainly in the south, there is a saying, \"In the North there is Confucius and in the South there is Wenchang.\"\n\nThere are also two notable temples dedicated to worshiping Wenchang Di Jun in Taichung: one is in the Beitun District of Taichung, apparently constructed in 1863 as a means of facilitating learning in the developing groups of people there. The other temple is in the Nantun district of Taichung, built in 1825. Both temples face south, which is apparently due to a principle of feng shui.\n\nThe practice of worshiping Wenchang Wang has a long history; it was popular in the past because he was allowed to be venerated by the rich and poor alike. He is still often worshiped now for essentially the same reasons. The third day of the second moon of the Chinese lunar calendar is the birthday of Wenchang. People generally celebrated his birthday by visiting his temples, the officials and scholars of the county all had to go to the Temple of Wenchang to make offerings, sacrifices or recite poems.\n\n"}
{"id": "799523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=799523", "title": "Yibbum", "text": "Yibbum\n\nYibbum () or levirate marriage in Judaism, is one of the most complex types of marriages mandated by Torah law () by which, according to the law, the brother of a man who died without children has an obligation to marry the widow. However, if either of the parties refuses to go through with the marriage, both are required to go through a ceremony known as \"halizah\", involving a symbolic act of renunciation of their right to perform this marriage. Jewish law (\"halakha\") has seen a gradual decline of \"yibbum\" in favor of \"halizah\", to the point where in most contemporary Jewish communities, and in Israel by mandate of the Chief Rabbinate, the former is prohibited.\n\nThe concept of \"yibbum\" is not unique to Judaism. Known as levirate marriage (when the marriage is to the deceased's brother) or widow inheritance (when it is to any surviving male relative), it has been practiced by other societies with a strong clan structure. It is or was known in societies including the Punjabis, Jats, Huns, Mongols, and Tibetans.\n\nSexual interactions by a man with his brother's wife are forbidden by the Torah (; ), but for the case of \"yibbum\", Torah provides a clearer picture of what is acceptable and intended for protection. The surviving brother is given a choice to take his responsibility as a goel by fulfilling the yibbum obligation, or to perform \"halizah\", though the latter choice is described by the verse disfavorably. The brother who agreed to marry his sister-in-law would be the sole benefactor of his brother's estate instead of splitting it with the family. The offspring of the levirate union would be seen as a perpetuation of the deceased brother's name. Levirate marriage is permissible only when the dead brother had no children at all.\n\nAlthough the stated intent of the levirate law as expressed in Deuteronomy is to provide an heir so that the deceased brother's name \"will not be obliterated from Israel\" (), such laws effectively provided protection for widows as well. At the time the Torah was written, if a woman did not have a husband because of widowhood, she had no one to provide for her any longer and she would be disgraced, if not likely die of starvation. Children were also a means of continued provision, since they are commanded to care and show respect for the elderly as they move further along in years. A childless widow was without both means of provision. Although quite contrary to our modern day dilemmas, even becoming a second wife to a brother-in-law, as indicated in Deuteronomy 25:5-10, was better than living on the streets at the mercy of those around her. Under Torah, men had a responsibility to the women around them, which included life-sustaining provisions (i.e. food, shelter, and comfort). Those of honor were beholden to their responsibility to protect the defenseless.\n\nThe most famous case of a levirate-type marriage in the Hebrew Bible is the unusual union of Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar found in . The case is not strictly a case of \"yibbum\" as Judah was Tamar's father-in-law, and also the case pre-dates the biblical obligation. It may be a reflection of contemporary Middle East practices.\n\nReligion professor Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out the economic implications of a Hebrew levirate marriage: the first child born to the brother's widow would be deemed the heir of the deceased brother, and able to claim the deceased brother's share of inheritance. If the deceased brother was the firstborn son, his inheritance was a double share. However, if the deceased brother were childless, the living brother would be entitled to inherit an increased share; or if he is the oldest surviving son he would be entitled to a double share of the increased share.\n\nAnother example of an analogous arrangement to \"yibbum\" is recounted in the Book of Ruth. After the death of her husband, Ruth is noticed and welcomed by her husband's kinsman, Boaz. After Ruth is rejected by an anonymous \"Ploni Almoni\" who performs \"halizah\", Boaz marries her. In this case as well, the kin in question would not have been subject to the biblical levirate marriage obligation, as neither Ploni Almoni nor Boaz were brothers of Ruth's late husband.\n\n\"Halakha\" (Jewish law) has a rich tradition around \"yibbum\". These laws were first recorded in the Mishna and Talmud in Yevamot, and were later codified by Maimonides in the \"Mishneh Torah\". The subject is considered one of the most intricate in Jewish law, partly because of the complication that arise from multiple brothers and multiple wives. \"Yibbum\" is an exception to the biblical prohibition for a man to have sexual relations with \"his brother's wife\" found for example in . (See Incest in the Bible.)\n\nAccording to \"halakha\", when a married man dies without having any children, male or female, from any relationship (including pre-marital and extra-marital), his widow and his brother must perform either \"yibbum\" or \"halizah\". For the laws of \"yibbum\" only brothers that share a common father are considered brothers. In order for yibbum to apply, all of the following conditions must be met:\nEven if some of the brothers do not meet all the conditions to be eligible for yibbum, as long as there is one that does, yibbum applies to him. If there is no brother who meets all of the conditions, neither yibbum nor halitzah applies, except if the widow is forbidden to marry the brother as a result of a prohibition not involving the punishment of kares (spiritual exicision), in which case halitzah would apply.\n\nIt is forbidden for any of the widows to remarry until \"yibbum\" or \"halizah\" has been performed. If the deceased left multiple wives \"yibbum\" may only be performed with one of them, at which time the remaining wives are permitted to remarry. Likewise, if yibbum is not performed, \"halizah\" is only performed with one of the widows, after which all of them may remarry.\n\nIf all surviving brothers are still children, the widow must wait until one reaches halachic adulthood, at which time he can perform yibbum or \"halizah\". Similarly, if the brother is missing, the woman is required to wait until he is located. This can lead to a situation similar to an \"agunah\".\n\nAccording to Biblical law, there is no need for a marriage ceremony between the widow and the deceased's brother as they are already bound by divine decree, thus, they need only cohabit to perform yibbum. Nevertheless, the Sages decreed that the couple perform a marriage-like ceremony called \"maamar\", recite the marriage blessings (\"sheva brachot\") and write a prenuptial agreement (\"ketubah\").\n\nOnly one brother may perform yibbum. The oldest brother is given preference, but if he refuses, any brother can perform \"yibbum\", and if a brother performed yibbum out of turn, it is nevertheless valid. After one brother performs yibbum or halizah, none of the brothers may marry any of the other widows.\n\nBecause there is a general prohibition on a man marrying his brother's wife, anytime that a \"yibbum\" is not required (for example the deceased had a child) it is forbidden. \nLikewise, anytime that there is a doubt whether \"yibbum\" is required, it is also forbidden and \"halizah\" is required.\n\nThe Samaritans followed a slightly different course, which may indicate an earlier custom among the Hebrews; the former practiced the levirate only when the woman was betrothed and the marriage had not been consummated. The Karaites appear to have followed the same practice, and Benjamin Nahawendi, as well as Elijah Bashyazi, favored it.\n\nThe rabbis in the time of the \"mishnah\" added formal marriage requirements such as a \"ketubah\" (marriage contract), but over the centuries \"yibbum\" waned in favor.\n\nBy Talmudic times the practice of levirate marriage was deemed secondary in preference to halizah by some of the rabbis, because of the brother's questionable intentions; indeed, to marry a brother's widow for her beauty was regarded by Abba Saul as equivalent to incest. Bar Kappara also recommends halizah. A difference of opinion appears among the later authorities, with Isaac Alfasi, Maimonides, and the Spanish school generally upholding the custom, while Rabbeinu Tam and the Northern school prefer \"halizah.\" A change of religion on the part of the surviving brother does not affect the obligation of the levirate, or its alternative, the halizah. Additionally, if the surviving brother is married, Ashkenazim, who follow the \"takkanah\" of Gershom ben Judah abolishing polygamy, would be compelled to perform halizah.\n\nOrthodox Jews in modern times have generally upheld the position of Rabbeinu Tam and perform halizah rather than yibbum. Conservative Judaism formally retains it. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism have abolished it.\n\nThe rules may create social problems in some situations, especially for the widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the \"yibbum\" obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need to wait until the brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.\n\n\"Yibbum\" forms the plot of the Hallmark movie \"Loving Leah\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "682534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=682534", "title": "Yoruba religion", "text": "Yoruba religion\n\nThe Yoruba religion comprises the traditional religious and spiritual concepts and practices of the Yoruba people. Its homeland is in present-day Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo, commonly known as Yorubaland. Yoruba religion is formed of diverse traditions. It has influenced a host of thriving traditions such as Santería, Umbanda, Trinidad Orisha, and Candomblé. Yoruba religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up the Yoruba society.\n\nAccording to Kola Abimbola, the Yoruba have evolved a robust cosmology. In brief, it holds that all human beings possess what is known as \"Ayanmo\" (destiny, fate) and are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olodumare (Olorun, the divine creator and source of all energy). Furthermore, the thoughts and actions of each person in Ayé (the physical realm) interact with all other living things, including the Earth itself.\n\nEach person attempts to achieve transcendence and find their destiny in Orun-Rere (the spiritual realm of those who do good and beneficial things). \n\nOne's ori-inu (spiritual consciousness in the physical realm) must grow in order to consummate union with one's \"Iponri\" (Ori Orun, spiritual self).\n\nThose who stop growing spiritually, in any of their given lives, are destined for \"Orun-Apadi\" (the invisible realm of potsherds). Life and death are said to be cycles of existence in a series of physical bodies while one's spirit evolves toward transcendence. This evolution is said to be most evident amongst the Orishas, the divine viziers of Olorun.\n\nIwapẹlẹ (or well-balanced) meditative recitation and sincere veneration is sufficient to strengthen the ori-inu of most people. Well-balanced people, it is believed, are able to make positive use of the simplest form of connection between their Oris and the omnipotent Olu-Orun: an adura (petition or prayer) for divine support.\n\nPrayer to one's Ori Orun produces an immediate sensation of joy. Elegbara (Eshu, not the divine messenger but accuser of the righteous) initiates contact with spiritual realm (not heavenly places) on behalf of the petitioner, and transmits the prayer to Ayé; the deliverer of ase or \"the spark of life\". He transmits this prayer without distorting it in any way. Thereafter, the petitioner may be satisfied with a personal answer. In the event that he or she is not, the Ifá oracle of the Orisha Orunmila may also be consulted. All communication with Orun, whether simplistic in the form of a personal prayer or complicated in the form of that done by an initiated Babalawo (priest of divination), however, is energized by invoking ase.\n\nIn the Yoruba belief system, Olodumare has ase over all that is. Hence, Is considered supreme.\n\nOlodumare is the most important \"state of existence\". Regarded as being all-encompassing, no gender can be assigned. Hence, it is common to hear references to \"it\" or \"they\" (although this is meant to address a somewhat singularity). \"They\" are the owner of all heads, for during human creation, Olodumare gave \"emi\" (the breath of life) to humankind. In this, Olodumare is Supreme.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important human endeavors extolled within the Yoruba literary corpus is the quest to improve one's \"Iwa\" (character, behaviour). In this way the teachings transcends religious doctrine, advising as it does that a person must also improve his civic, social and intellectual spheres of being; every stanza of the sacred Ifá oracular poetry (Odu Ifa) has a portion covering the importance of \"Iwa\". Central to this is the theme of righteousness, both individual and collective.\n\nThe Yoruba regard Olodumare as the principal agent of creation.\n\nAccording to a Yoruba account of creation, during a certain stage in this process, the \"truth\" was sent to confirm the habitability of the newly formed planets. The earth being one of these was visited but deemed too wet for conventional life.\n\nAfter a successful period of time, a number of divinities led by Obatala were sent to accomplish the task of helping earth develop its crust. On one of their visits to the realm, the arch-divinity Obatala took to the stage equipped with a mollusk that concealed some form of soil; winged beasts and some cloth like material. The contents were emptied onto what soon became a large mound on the surface of the water and soon after, the winged-beasts began to scatter this around until the point where it gradually made into a large patch of dry land; the various indentations they created eventually becoming hills and valleys.\n\nObatala leaped onto a high-ground and named the place Ife. The land became fertile and plant life began to flourish. From handfuls of earth he began to mold figurines. Meanwhile, as this was happening on earth, Olodumare gathered the gasses from the far reaches of space and sparked an explosion that shaped into a fireball. He subsequently sent it to Ife, where it dried much of the land and simultaneously began to bake the motionless figurines. It was at this point that Olodumare released the \"breath of life\" to blow across the land, and the figurines slowly came into \"being\" as the first people of Ife.\n\nFor this reason, Ife is locally referred to as \"Ife Oodaye\" - \"cradle of existence\".\n\nAn Orisha (spelled Òrìṣa) is an entity that possesses the capability of reflecting some of the manifestations of Olodumare. Yoruba \"Orishas\" (commonly translated \"unique/special/selected heads\") are often described as intermediaries between humankind and the supernatural. The term is also translated as \"Deities\" or \"Divinities\" or \"Gods\".\n\nOrisha(s) are revered for having control over specific elements by nature, thus being better referred to as the divinities or \"Imole\". Even so, there are those of their number that are more akin to ancient heroes and/or sages. These are best addressed as Dema Deities. Even though the term Orisha is often used to describe both classes of divine entities, it is properly reserved for the former one.\nIrunmole are entities sent by Olorun to complete given tasks, often acting as liaisons between Orun (the invisible realm) and Aiye (the physical realm). Irunmole(s) can best be described as ranking divinities; whereby such divinities are regarded as the principal Orishas. Irunmole, from \"Erinrun\" - 400, \"Imole\" - Divinites or Divine Spirits\n\nThe Yoruba believe in Atunwa, reincarnation within the family. The names Babatunde (father returns), Yetunde (Mother returns), Babatunji (Father wakes once again) and Sotunde (The wise man returns) all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will \"come back\" in the birth of your child, however.\n\nWhenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through myriad lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to \"The Marketplace\" of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences. The Primary Ancestor (which should be identified in your Itefa) becomes – if you are aware and work with that specific energy – a “guide” for the individual throughout their lifetime. At the end of that life they return to their identical spirit self and merge into one, taking the additional knowledge gained from their experience with the individual as a form of \"payment\".\n\nAccording to Professor S. A. Akintoye, the Yoruba were exquisite statesmen who spread across the globe in an unprecedented fashion; the reach of their culture is largely due to migration—the most recent migration occurred with the Atlantic slave trade. During this period, many Yoruba were captured and sold into the slave trade and transported to Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Vincent & The Grenadines, Uruguay, Venezuela, and other parts of the Americas. With them, they carried their religious beliefs. The school-of-thought integrated into what now constitutes the core of the \"New World lineages\":\n\nThe Vodun faith, which originated amongst a different ethnic group (the Gbe speaking peoples of present-day Benin, Togo, and Ghana), holds influential aspects on the African diaspora in countries such as Haiti and Cuba, also Southern States like New Orleans, Louisiana in the United States.\n\n\"Chrislam\" is a neologism used to refer to syncretism between Christianity and Islam among the Yoruba of Nigeria, mentioned by Greenfield (2001) as an example of the \"Yoruba genius for syncretism\".\nYoruba \"Chrislam\" includes two distinct religious movements, one called \"Ifeoluwa\" founded by Tela Tella in the 1970s and 80s and another called \"Oke-Tude\" founded by Samson Saka in 1999. They are also known as \"The Will of God Mission\" or \"The True Message of God Mission\" respectively.\nAdherence to \"Chrislam\" in Nigeria is very limited; Soares (2009) notes that \"such efforts towards religious fusion or synthesis seem to be rather exceptional and increasingly so. In many places there has been intense competition and higher levels of tension within and between different confessional groups.\"\n\n\"\" (\"Love of God\") recognises both the Bible and the Quran as holy texts, and practices \"running deliverance,\" a distinctive practice of spiritual running likened to Joshua's army circling Jericho, or the practice of Pilgrims circumambulating a Church for Palm Sunday or the Kaaba, and Jews around the Synagogue during Sukkot. In contrast to other Chrislamic sects, Tela Tella, while claiming to believe in both the Qur'an and the Bible, says they are incomplete, and is writing his own book called the \"Ifeoluwa Book\". Tela Tella claims that an angel of God came to him and told him that he gave him the mission and the name \"Ifeoluwa: The Will of God Mission\".\n\nOke Tude (Oketude) in Ogudu (a northern suburb of Lagos), founded by Samson Saka in 1999, is slightly less recognisable to mainstream Christianity, resembling more interfaith worship with three different sessions or services that take place on Sunday. The first is a Muslim session, then a Christian session, and finally there is a joint session that Saka leads. During this he stresses the similarities between Christianity and Islamic beliefs.\n\nIn the 1949 documentary \"Fiestas de Santiago Apóstol en Loíza Aldea\", anthropologist Ricardo Alegría noted a similar tendency at Loíza, Puerto Rico, arguing that the affinity between the black population in the municipality and the Catholic saint Santiago Apóstol may derive from the way in which he is depicted as a warrior; a similar theme to some depictions of Shango. This theory supposed that this resemblance was used by the population as a covert form to honor their ancestral deity.\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography \n\n\n"}
